And to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.”Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, confirmed in a social media post that she had signed the agreement on Wednesday. “Together with the United States, we are creating the fund that will attract global investment into our country,” she wrote. The deal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament.Ukrainian officials have divulged details of the agreement which they portrayed as equitable and allowing Ukraine to maintain control over its natural resources.The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said that the fund would be split 50-50 with between the US and Ukraine and give each side equal voting rights.Ukraine would retain “full control over its mineral resources, infrastructure and natural resources,” he said, and would relate only to new investments, meaning that the deal would not provide for any debt obligations against Ukraine, a key concern for Kyiv. The deal would ensure revenue by establishing contracts on a “take-or-pay” basis, Shmyhal added.Shmyhal on Wednesday described the deal as “truly a good, equal and beneficial international agreement on joint investments in the development and recovery of Ukraine”.Critics of the deal had said the White House is seeking to take advantage of Ukraine by linking future aid to the embattled nation to a giveaway of the revenues from its resources. The final terms were far less onerous for Ukraine than those proposed initially by Bessent in February, which included a clause that the US would control 100% of the revenues from the fund.It was unclear up until the last moment whether the US and Ukraine would manage to sign the deal, with Washington reportedly pressuring Ukraine to sign additional agreements, including on the structure of the investment fund, or to “go back home”. That followed months of strained negotiations during which the US regularly delivered last-minute ultimatums while cutting off aid and other support for Ukraine in its defence againstRussia.Ukraine’s prime minister earlier had said he expected the country to sign the minerals deal with the US in “the next 24 hours” but reports emerged that Washington was insisting Kyiv sign three deals in total.The Financial Times said Bessent’s team had told Svyrydenko, who was reportedly en route to Washington DC, to “be ready to sign all agreements, or go back home”.Bessent later said the US was ready to sign though Ukraine had made some last-minute changes.Reuters reported that Ukraine believed the two supplementary agreements – reportedly on an investment fund and a technical document – required more work.The idea behind the deal was originally proposed by Ukraine, looking for ways to offer economic opportunities that might entice Trump to back the country. But Kyiv was blindsided in January when Trump’s team delivered a document that would essentially involve handing over the country’s mineral wealth with little by way of return.Since then, there have been various attempts to revise and revisit the terms of the deal, as well as a planned signing ceremony that was aborted after a disastrous meeting between Trump andVolodymyr Zelenskyyat the White House in February.Earlier this month, it was revealed that the Ukrainian justice ministry had hired US law firm Hogan Lovells to advise on the negotiations over the deal, according to filings with the US Foreign Agents Registration Act registry.In apost on Facebook, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko gave further details of the fund, which she said would “attract global investment”.She confirmed thatUkrainewould retain full ownership of resources “on our territory and in territorial waters belong to Ukraine”. “It is the Ukrainian state that determines where and what to extract,” she said.There would be no changes to ownership of state-owned companies, she said, “they will continue to belong to Ukraine”. That included companies such as Ukrnafta, Ukraine’s largest oil producer, and nuclear energy producer Energoatom.Income would come from new licences for critical materials and oil and gas projects, not from projects which had already begun, she said.Income and contributions to the fund would not be taxed in the US or Ukraine, she said, “to make investments yield the greatest results”.Razom for Ukraine, a US nonprofit that provides medical and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and advocates for US assistance, welcomed the deal, and encouraged the Trump administration to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the invasion. “We encourage the Trump administration to build on the momentum of this economic agreement by forcing Putin to the table through sanctions, seizing Russia’s state assets to aid Ukraine, and giving Ukraine the tools it needs to defend itself,” Mykola Murskyj, director of advocacy for Razom, said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUkraineDonald TrumpRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

One Downing Street insider said: “Tony fucked up.” Another said: “He has completely lost his touch.”A third government source questioned whether the decision to release the report on the eve of the elections was entirely accidental. “It’s not the first time he’s written bombastic forewords suggesting we should slow down on net zero. It’s so disloyal to the party.”Another said they were particularly aggrieved that the words appeared a critique of Starmer himself. “It looks like he is attacking Keir who has only just said climate action was in the DNA of the government.”Just moments before Starmer took prime minister’s questions in the Commons on Wednesday, TBI issued a fresh statement to clarify that it believed the government’s net zero policy was “the right one”.Downing Street also defended the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, who has been the target of attacks by net zero sceptics including within the party. “He’s doing a fantastic job, winning the global race for the jobs for the future. The PM absolutely backs him,” Starmer’s spokesperson said.ButLabourinsiders warned the damage had already been done, with Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, saying she felt “vindicated” by the comments and Nigel Farage boasting on X that Reform UK was “winning the argument” on net zero.There are also concerns Labour could lose votes to the Greens, with their co-leader Carla Denyer urging Starmer to distance himself from Blair’s “dodgy dossier” on net zero. “The future is green; Labour must not allow yesterday’s man to drag us back into the dark ages,” she added.Angry Labour MPs raised questions about the influence that TBI has within the party. As well as the organisation regularly briefing No 10 officials, it has also advised the governments of Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan and other petrochemical states.One MP said: “We are having PLP briefings organised from people who are essentially fossil fuel lobbyists. If anyone speaks admirably about these libertarian tech bros who think that is what will save us, then the party should be running a mile.”A second added: “The day before polling day this just gives Reform talking points – Tony should know better. I don’t know what he is trying to do here, unless it’s a desperate search to continue to be interesting. It doesn’t make him relevant though.”A third MP said: “It’s maddening. Blair parachutes in, and is handing talking points to the Tories and Reform on a silver platter. TBI might want to remember it’s not running the country.”Writing the foreword for a report from TBI, Blair hadcalled for the government to change course on climate, suggesting a strategy that limits fossil fuels in the short term or encourages people to limit consumption is “doomed to fail”.The former prime minister said voters were being “asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle” that would have “minimal” effect on global emissions. He said the current climate debate was “riven with irrationality” and suggested net zero was losing public support.Climate experts accused him of playing into the hands of a rightwing narrative to delay climate action. Nicholas Stern, the author of the influentialStern review of the economics of climate change, commissioned by Blair when he was in power, said the TBI report was “muddled and misleading”.“The UK’s leadership on climate change, particularly the elimination of coal from its power sector, is providing an influential example to other countries. So, too, its climate change legislation and itsClimate Change Committee. If the UK wobbles on its route to net zero, other countries may become less committed. The UK matters,” he said.“And the report downplays the science in its absence of a sense of urgency and the lack of appreciation of the need for the world to achieve net zero as soon as possible, in order to manage the growth in climate change impacts that are already hurting households and businesses across the world and in the UK. Delay is dangerous.”Lady Brown, of the independent Climate Change Committee, saidBlair’s intervention risked sending the wrong messageat a crucial moment.“My concern is that people might take away a message from that report that we should do adaptation instead of mitigation, and that is absolutely the wrong message,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGreen politicsTony BlairClimate Change CommitteeKeir StarmerLabourFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

In Runcorn, some people like Farage, but they are tribally anti-Conservative. For both groups these sort of links can be a red line,” they added.While polling for the Hull and East Yorkshire mayoralty has been less clear, the Lib Dems have used their second place inrecent pollingto campaign heavily on the idea only they can stop Reform, with a mass of leaflets and digital adverts trying to persuade Labour and Green supporters to vote tactically.“We’re focusing really hard on an almost postcode-by-postcode campaign in places where we think there is a stop Reform vote,” a Lib Dem official said. “For a lot of voters, Reform are so far off the deep end that it motivates people. They’re less interested in policies, it’s more: ‘Our number one priority is to stop Reform, if you can do that we’ll vote for you.’”This message, they said, also seemed to be resonating with some Conservative supporters in areas such as East Riding, where the party is traditionally strong.“In Hull, there are lots of Labour and Green voters who are terrified of Reform. In East Riding, what you might call the softer Conservatives are also increasingly saying: ‘My goodness, I can’t let Reform win.’“Something has happened in the last 10 days. It feels like a lot of voters are pivoting quite hard into what you could call a ‘stop Reform coalition’.”‘Extinction-level event’: Tories fear voters turning to Reform in LincolnshireRead moreFarage has sought to manage expectations before the polls open on Thursday, saying his party lacks the experience and expertise of Labour in on-the-ground campaigning, which he says will particularly restrict their chances in Runcorn.However, campaigners from other parties say that, in the byelection particularly, Reform have mustered teams of campaigners to knock on doors, augmented by a heavy spend on paid-for mailed leaflets and social media advertising.The results in Runcorn and the mayoral elections, and more generally in the council votes, will be closely examined for signs of how well the Reform election machine is working, as well as for the emergence of any informal anti-Reform coalition.While a combined Reform and Conservative polling share would be above 45%, strategists from other parties say any pact between the two would be very likely to make such tactical voting even more prevalent.Explore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025Reform UKNigel FarageLocal electionsLabourConservativesGreen partynewsShareReuse this content"

He offered his congratulations to Chelsea and, asked how anyone can stop them, he replied: “It’s a good question. Everyone is trying to find the answer. You have to take those head-to-heads. I know this sounds strange but, for probably the finances they spend, I don’t think they’re a million miles [ahead], even though they’ve won it, there’s always a chance to get them and catch them. But they have serial winners. They’ve experienced it for many years. And you’ve got to try and topple that dynasty.”If Chelsea had needed a morale boost after theirhumbling 8-2 aggregate defeatagainst Barcelona, it came in the form of score updates from Villa Park while they were arriving at a sun-kissed Leigh Sports Village, as news of goal after goal after goal continued to trickle up the M6 until it turned into something of a flood of bewilderment, rippling around the stadium.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Lucy Bronze heads the ball past Manchester United’s keeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce to score what proved to be the winner.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersArsenal had lost 5-2, yes, 5-2, away at Aston Villa. “Really?” fans asked. The team heading to the Women’s Champions League final, after theirhistoric win in Lyonon Sunday, needing a win to keep their own faint title hopes alive, had conceded five goals to statistically one of the worst teams in the league. This was inexplicable. This was the WSL at its very best, offering a storyline scarcely anybody with an ounce of sanity would have predicted. And this was a gift for Chelsea.Quick GuideArsenal's WSL dream ends after thrashing by Aston VillaShowArsenal's faint Women's Super League title hopes ended after they were stunned 5-2 by Aston Villa before Chelsea won at Manchester Un ited.Defeat at Villa Park was only the Gunners' third in the WSL this season, but they were left nine points adrift of Chelsea, who later clinched a sixth successive crown with a 1-0 win at Leigh Sports Village.The former Arsenal player, Jordan Nobbs, came back to haunt her old side after rounding off a swift counterattack on the half-hour mark before Kirsty Hanson doubled their advantage on the cusp of half-time with a stunning strike.Chasity Grant and Rachel Daly piled misery on the Champions League finalists after the break, before two goals in three minutes by Stina Blackstenius and then Alessia Russo cut the deficit.But Grant added her second to wrap up a third straight league victory for Villa.\"That wasn't the performance we expect of ourselves,\" said Arsenal's Kim Little. \"We expect higher standards than that and we're just disappointed in the result.\"It's over now so we have to move on but we'll regroup ... We’ve got two more league games left and a Champions League final.\"PA Media and Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It meant that, before play began in this 8.15pm kick-off, Chelsea knew they needed just one more point to clinch the title, with two more games to follow after this. They were up against a Manchester United side with aspirations of qualifying for Europe, though, and Skinner’s team began the game purposefully. A first half played at a good intensity by both teams saw the world-record signing Naomi Girma produce a block worthy of her high price tag to instinctively prevent Grace Clinton from scoring on the rebound after Melvine Malard’s initial shot had been saved by Hannah Hampton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the other end, Chelsea had looked threatening in wide areas, although they suffered a blow when Mayra Ramírez was forced off with an injury. The Colombia forward had torn United’s defence apart at Old Trafford on the final day of last season, when Chelsea hadcoasted to a 6-0 victory, in what was their final fixture before Bompastor’s arrival.Both goalkeepers were forced into superb saves early in the second half and United began to build up a spell of pressure, as they chased a winning goal for themselves that would have lifted them up to second, before two of Chelsea’s summer signings from 2024 combined to wrap up the title. Sandy Baltimore’s inswinging corner was met by Bronze at the near post and she ran to celebrate in front of the delirious Chelsea fans.It is Chelsea’s eighth WSL title since 2015 and their 17th major trophy in those past 10 years, and they will hope to add another to that tally when these two teams meet again at Wembley in May’s Women’s FA Cup final.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueChelsea WomenManchester United WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Australia’s election campaign began on 28 March.“Things somewhat seem to be moving in the right direction there… those efforts are strictly political in nature and don’t require me to engage with the United States government.”1:33Trump campaign strategist Chris LaCivita talks to undercover reporters – videoLaCivita told the undercover reporters in a second call on 24 April he made the trip without publicity. He contrasts this to media reporting abouthis paid work with Albania’s opposition party.“Never knew I was there,” he said, in reference to his claimed visit to Australia. “I try to maintain a degree of discretion … it just it gives us a degree of freedom of movement.”ACoalitionspokesman denied LaCivita had any connection to the Dutton campaign.“Mr LaCivita is not advising, has never advised, and is not involved in any way with the Coalition campaign. Mr Dutton has not met with him.”In a statement, LaCivita told Guardian Australia: “I did not and do not work for the Liberal Party of Australia. I provide consulting to a wide variety of business interests – some in Australia some in the US etc in terms of a political party – I have not.“Also, I have never met Mr Dutton, but I hope to when he is elected prime minister.”LaCivita was Trump’s co-campaign manager in his successful 2024 presidential run, along with the current White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.Trump thanked LaCivita in his victory speech and LaCivita briefly took the microphone to thank the president, saying Trump was “a hell of a candidate, and he’s going to be a hell of a great 47th president”.Visits and knowledge-sharing between like minded political parties and consultants are not uncommon in election campaigns.Anthony Albanese has previously talked up ties with UK Labour. The ALP’s campaign boss Paul Erickson offered advice to strategists working to elect Sir Keir Starmer ahead of the UK’s 2024 election. Erickson was later invited to present at Labour’s annual party conference.A US Marine veteran who received a Purple Heart for service in the first Gulf War, LaCivita helped craft the infamous Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign, considered a fatal blow for Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in his 2004 race against George W Bush.Dutton has distanced himself from associations with Trump during the campaign after initially pursuing policies that nodded to parts of the US president’s agenda – promising to sack 41,000 public servants,announcing a role for senator Jacinta Nampinjinpa Pricein pursuing “government efficiency”,claiming students were being “indoctrinated”by the school curriculum and denouncing the ABC and Guardian Australia as “hate media”.During the second leaders’ debate of the campaign,Dutton said: “We trust the US. I don’t know the president. I’ve not met him.”Labor has tried to tie Dutton to Trump-style politics as polling showed voters were increasingly uncomfortable with the actions of the US president, particularly following the implementation of trade tariffs. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has labelled the opposition leader “Dogey Dutton”, referring to the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) set up by Trump under the leadership of Elon Musk.Labor is likely to point to claims about LaCivita’s visit as more evidence Dutton’s agenda is being guided by the unpopular Trump, but it also signals close ties between the Coalition and key members of the president’s inner circle, likely advantageous if Dutton wins Saturday’s election.Campaigning in Western Australia, Albanese said Dutton was concerned with fighting “culture wars”.“The campaign of the Liberal party has become more and more right-wing under Peter Dutton. That’s just the truth of the matter,” he said.LaCivita’s credentials within Trump’s orbit are strong.Donald TrumpJr. called him “a supremely competent nuts-and-bolts guy,” in an interview with New York magazine.“He doesn’t care about getting credit, he doesn’t care about stroking his own ego, he only cares about getting the job done and delivering for my father,” Trump Jr. said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025CoalitionAustralian politicsPeter DuttonDonald TrumpRepublicansLiberal partynewsShareReuse this content"

Sorting admin problems is not always easy and can be time-consuming, putting pressure on patients or their families,” Ansari said.Among the reported errors:26% related to personal details such as name or date of birth.16% involved medication a patient had taken.9% of errors incorrectly listed a patient as having had a particular illness9% said a patient had taken specific drugs to treat an ailment.Among that group, 10% said they had been given wrong or inappropriate medication as a result of the error, and 9% said they had received potentially unsafe care or treatment. One in eight (12%) said inaccurate or missing information had led to them being refused treatment.The Patients Association said errors in records, which can occur during care at a GP surgery or hospital, could result in “dangerous delays, misdiagnoses and missed care”.Rachel Power, the association’s chief executive, said: “Since January we’ve received over 100 helpline inquiries about this issue and our patient guide on accessing medical records has several hundred downloads.“Behind each of these errors is a real person facing anxiety and uncertainty about their care. Many of these cases involve incorrect or missing diagnoses and treatments, and callers tell us these errors are predominantly made in GP practices or sometimes in secondary care.“We understand theimmense pressurehealthcare professionals face. But inaccuracies like these can lead to dangerous delays, misdiagnoses and missed care, which is simply unacceptable and deeply concerning to patients. These record errors not only exacerbate illness but add significant stress during already difficult times.”She said patients must be able to trust that their medical records are correct and should not have to recount their medical history repeatedly or spend time seeking to correct their own records.Patients variously told Healthwatch about how errors in their records meant they were given a potentially wrong drug for their diabetes because their GP did not know they had a cyst, or were misinformed about ADHD medication because of an information mix-up involving their GP surgery and a private ADHD diagnostic service.National Voices, a coalition of health and care charities, said mistakes were so common in the paper and digital records theNHSmaintains that some were akin to “Swiss cheese records”.“There’s much talk about how shifting the NHS from analogue to digital will make it more efficient and effective. But realising this brave new future requires a solid foundation of accurate data, not Swiss cheese records, which are creating a mountain of problems for patients and clinicians,” said Jacob Lant, its chief executive.Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College ofGPs, said family doctors would be deeply concerned by the findings.“There may be many reasons for administrative errors occurring. But inadequate IT infrastructure, intense workloads and workforce pressures in general practice, high levels of unnecessary bureaucracy and poor communication between different parts of the health service all contribute to mistakes being made,” she said.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “It is unacceptable that patients are missing out on vital treatments and tests simply because of errors with their medical records.“This government inherited an analogue NHS, but we’re committed to catapulting it into the digital age through our plan for change. We will create a health service fit for the future and put patients in control of their own medical history through a single patient record, summarising patient health information, test results and letters in one place via the NHS app.”Explore more on these topicsNHSGPsHospitalsHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This is our opportunity to be on the right side of history.”On Wednesday, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said it is “absolutely unacceptable” to question the validity of the supreme court ruling that the term “woman” is defined by biological sex.Giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, Mahmood said: “They obviously provided the legal clarity in their legal decision, which is exactly their job.“I think it’s disappointing since then that some individuals have sought to question the validity of the supreme court or cast aspersions, which is absolutely unacceptable.“I think they’ve done their job and I think they’ve sought to do it in a way that recognises that we’re talking about a balance of rights, but sought to give confidence to a minority community that they still have protections.”Some trans rights groups have raised concerns about the practical implications of the ruling.Explore more on these topicsGenderTransgenderUK supreme courtWomenFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He told representatives of cancer charities: “You have my whole family’s deepest admiration.”Charles, 76, who isstill undergoing treatmentmore than a year after his diagnosis, said his cancer journey had given him “an even deeper appreciation of the extraordinary work” of the charities. He added that it had reinforced how “the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion”.He hailed the late Dame Deborah James as an inspiration, quoting her final message and encouraging everyone to follow her example: “Find a life worth enjoying; take risks; love deeply; have no regrets; and always, always have rebellious hope.”James died in June 2022 at the age of 40, five years after she was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Her Bowelbabe fund has raised more than £16m since its launch.His message was printed in a booklet given to guests at the palace’s evening reception, including James’s parents Heather and Alistair.A royal source said there was no update on the king’s condition or treatment, but that it continued in a “very positive direction”, reflected in his “very full” national and international diary. They described the words and subject of the message as “deeply personal” for the king.Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIMonarchyCancerHealthCharitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Taganrog was the most notorious.ByManisha Ganguly,Shaun Walker,Pjotr Sauer, Tetyana Nikolayenko,    Anton Naumliuk,Artem MazhulinandLucy SwanSupported byAbout this contentWed 30 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 13.43 EDTShareSome weeks after being detained as she attempted to leave a Russian-occupied part ofUkrainein January 2023, Yelyzaveta Shylykwas given a polygraph test. As her interrogators attached the lie detector’s wires to her, they calmly issued a threat about what would happen if she failed the test: “You’ll go to a place where you’ll regret being born.”That place, she would later find out, had a name: Sizo number 2, a pre-trial detention centre in the southern Russian city of Taganrog.Prior to the full-scale invasion in February 2022, the facility held juvenile inmates and mothers with young children. After the outbreak of hostilities, it was repurposed as a torture centre for Ukrainian captives, and it has since emerged as the darkest link in a network of detention centresacross Russia and occupied Ukraine.Guards subjected not only combatants but also civilians to sustained violence and torture. The exact number of civilian detainees is impossible to ascertain, but the Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets, said that as of April 2024 the number registered as having disappeared stood at 16,000.The majority are in legal limbo and have not been charged with any crime. Their locations are often undisclosed, although information sometimes filters out via released prisoners of war. Ukraine believes they are being held at as many as 180 separate sites.The Guardian and its reporting partners have identified the systematic use of torture at 29 of these sites – 18 in Russia and 11 in Russian-occupied territories. The most common methods used include electric shocks, waterboarding, mock executions, blows with wooden and metal hammers, and repeated beatings on the same body part, alongside bizarre humiliations such as a person being tied up with tape and then sat on as “human furniture”.Detainees have also reported a ban on speaking Ukrainian, severe food rationing, and being goaded to take their own lives. The worst of these sites have seen multiple fatalities.The use of torture to extract information or false confessions appears to have been organised and sanctioned by Moscow at the highest levels.These are the findings of the Viktoriia project, an investigation over six months involving 13 media outlets, including the Guardian, the Washington Post and Le Monde, led by the French group Forbidden Stories.Named for the Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, whodied in custody after spending months in Taganrog, it draws on more than 50 interviews with some of those who survived Russian captivity and with the families of some of those still held. Legal sources operating inside Russia and the occupied territories have also shared information, as have prison officials who resigned from the service in distress over what they had witnessed. Taken together, a picture emerges of a brutal and systemic assault on Ukrainian prisoners.“It is clear to me that torture is part of the Russian war policy and apparatus, both of Ukrainian civilians as well as of captured prisoners of war,” the UN’s special rapporteur on torture, Alice Edwards, said in an interview. “It’s being applied across all regions occupied by the Russian Federation, in all types of detention facilities. That level of organisation can only be approved at the highest levels.”Violence on arrivalThe birthplace of Russia’s cherished playwright Anton Chekhov, Taganrog is a quiet city on the Azov Sea. It is the closest Russian city to Mariupol, which was occupied by Moscow’s forces in May 2022 after fierce fighting. In the months after Mariupol fell, Russia transferred some of its most high-value prisoners to Taganrog, including soldiers from the Azov brigade who had defended the city. They featured heavily in Russian propaganda about the war as “neo-Nazis”, and Moscow had promised to hold show trials for them. Satellite imagery shows that as the prison filled up with Ukrainians, during the summer of 2022 it was reinforced with new steel roofs.Top-down view of TaganrogThe violence at Taganrog began on arrival. The first Ukrainian prisoners were sent there in April 2022, often tied up and blindfolded onboard military trucks daubed with the Z symbol. Most were subjected to a “welcoming” procedure known as “reception”, where guards would punch, kick and beat them with batons.“This is a sacred ritual for them. Blindfolded, with your hands tied and your head bowed low, you are ordered to walk, and every dog standing there considers it necessary to hit you with something,” said Volodymyr Labuzov, the chief medic of a Ukrainian marine brigade, who arrived in Taganrog in April2022.Over time, civilians were also taken to Taganrog, symbolic of a system that has blurred the lines between combatants and supposed “hostile elements” among the civilian population in occupied territories.Before 2022, the facility had held about 400 Russian detainees, but reports of overcrowded cells as well as analysis of its food procurement contracts suggest it may have held many more Ukrainian prisoners at the peak of its operations.A typical meal at Taganrog was about four and a half spoonfuls of food, according to former detainees. One counted a serving of pasta containing 15 small pieces. Sometimes they were given fish, but it was mixed with bones and entrails. Some would not eat during the day, saving their rations for a single evening meal just to feel full enough to sleep normally. Labuzov said men typically lost up to 25kg (4st) during detention.Using detailed testimonies from six former detainees, plus photographs and public information such as construction contracts, the collaboration produced a 3D model of the prison and reconstructed the torture rooms, interrogation room and cells.To help map the layout, former detainees, who were often blindfolded during interrogations, used techniques such as remembering the number of steps taken to go between rooms.After the “reception”, the violence continued, with regular beatings during the twice-daily cell searches and, most viciously, during interrogations. Two buildings were identified as the main torture sites inside Taganrog. Former inmates recalled hearing the screams coming from these areas.Serhiy Taranyuk, a former Ukrainian marine detained in Taganrog, said he was often interrogated in a room sparsely furnished with a chair and a table. “You go in, you are immediately thrown on the floor, you start to get beat and cut … Then, when you are ready to tell them something, they tell you to sit down,” he said. Taranyuk said he was forced into making a false confession.All Ukrainian prisoners who passed through Taganrog reported horrifying and sustained torture, including civilians and female prisoners. Shylyk, a former soldier who was a civilian at the time of her detention, was beaten with batons all over her body, subjected to electric shocks, threatened with rape and attacked with dogs. Oleksandr Maksymchuk, a prisoner of war who spent 21 months in Taganrog across two separate stints, wrote in testimony obtained by the Guardian of repeated beatings, electric shocks, suffocation and a technique where guards wrapped prisoners from head to toe in sticky tape and then “used them as human furniture”.Shylyk mentioned a room containing an electric chair: “I was put in the electric chair twice … with a device that attached clamps between my toes. Then they turned on the current.” She described overhearing guards complaining about having to keep the electrocution time to under two hours to avoid killing inmates, as deaths meant more paperwork.Another dedicated torture room was used to hang handcuffed detainees upside down in a foetal position, their knees strapped to a bar, for 10-15 minutes while being severely beaten.In some locations, shocks were administered using a Soviet-era battery-powered field phone called a TA-57. The technique, nicknamed “Putin’s phone” by prisoners, involved attaching wires to earlobes, the nose or genitals.View image in fullscreenDetainees reported being tortured in a number of separate rooms. From left to right: room with tub for water torture, where one detainee described being held under water until she was convulsing and had to be brought back to life; an electric chair with restraints – one detainee overheard guards discussing having to keep electrocution sessions to two hours to avoid deaths; and a room with bars used to suspend handcuffed detainees upside down by their knees in an inverted foetal position, for 10-15 minutes while being beaten or shocked.Illustration: Jarrett Ley/Washington PostLabuzov was repeatedly assaulted by guards demanding he confess to mutilating Russian soldiers. “During one of the interrogations, the investigator asked me to state my rank and position. But he didn’t even listen to who I was … I was immediately hit on the head with a wooden hammer.“This investigator said: ‘Tell me something interesting so we can stop beating you.’” Labuzov said he was then shocked with electrical wires and hit with a baton and a chair leg.On another occasion, Labuzov recalled, his palms were burned with a lighter. Once, he was taken to the boiler room and pushed waist-deep into a stove used to heat water, then placed on the meat-cutting table in the kitchen, where he was threatened with a knife.Others recounted psychological pressure that included forced indoctrination, forced reciting of patriotic Russian poems, and repeated physical and sexual threats.The cells were overcrowded, with eight men squeezed into a space built to house half that number. Labuzov also recalled another presence constantly watching over the prisoners. “In all four cells where I was, there was a portrait of Putin,” he said.FSB interrogationsSince November 2022, public information suggests the Taganrog facility has been headed by Aleksandr Shtoda, who took over from the previous head, Gennady Bodnar. Shtoda, the son of two postal workers, was born in a village not far from Taganrog, and before his current role he had held a management position at the prison in 2019 and 2020.One prisoner recalled Shtoda frequently advising detainees to take Russian citizenship. He was often polite, and even joked with some of the inmates. There is no evidence that he personally oversaw any interrogations or torture. But as head of the facility, he was ultimately responsible for the conditions in which prisoners were held.Reached by Telegram voice call, Shtoda, 44, hung up. He then read follow-up questions sent by text but did not answer them or a later formal request for comment. The consortium also made efforts to contact Bodnar and a further 35 current and former employees of the Taganrog facility identified through prisoner testimony and open-source research. Most either did not answer calls, immediately hung up or denied working there. Two claimed conditions at the jail were “excellent” while one denied Ukrainians were held there at all.While prison staff oversee the day-to-day running of the facility, officers from Russia’s FSB security service are in charge of the torture system and conduct the most important interrogations. They control the cases of known dissidents and push for confessions. To back up the FSB, Russia has deployed special units of the FSIN prison service to work on Ukrainians, and they reportedly carry out much of the actual violence.Testimony obtained from three sources formerly inside the system, shared exclusively by the human rights group Gulagu.net, all pointed to a decision taken in the early weeks of the war to encourage physical violence.View image in fullscreenAleksandr Shtoda, the head of Taganrog.One former senior FSIN official recalled meetings in the spring of 2022 in which the head of the St Petersburg FSIN branch, Igor Potapenko, appears to have told commanders they would in effect have carte blanche to use violence. It seems unlikely Potapenko was acting on his own initiative, and international observers believe ultimate responsibility for these policies, which were applied across the prison service, lies with the Kremlin.“It wasn’t phrased explicitly as ‘go beat them’ but it was understood. It was communicated down the chain, from the general and his deputy to the commander of the special forces unit and then to the soldiers, that we were to ‘work hard, do everything possible’. That was the euphemism. But everyone understood what it meant. The message was: ‘Do what you want,’”claimed the source.In contrast to previous assignments inside Russian prisons, when officers wore body cameras to provide a semblance of accountability, now there would be none. “There would be no video recording of any violent actions. That was stated clearly. No documentation, no oversight,” the source recalled.FSIN and Potapenko, who was recently appointed deputy governor of St Petersburg, did not respond to requests for comment. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also declined to comment.By analysing reports from the UN and Ukrainian intelligence, the collaboration located 29 Russian-run detention centres where torture had been reported. The facilities can hold an estimated 18,000 people in total, according to public directories. A total of 695 separate forms of torture were recorded. The information suggests Ukrainian detainees have been scattered across Russia, held as far as 600 miles from the border with Ukraine.Map of detention centresTypes of torture reported by Ukrainian detainees since 2022The sources said FSIN special forces units were sent on month-long rotations around different Russian regions, ensuring they never formed a connection with prisoners.Valeriia Subotina, a press officer for the Azov brigade who spent months in Taganrog, confirmed that the guards would rotate roughly every month. According to a Ukrainian intelligence source, FSIN special forces units from Chechnya, Dagestan, North Ossetia and Rostov, with the group names Grozny, Orel, Bulat and Rosna, were deployed at various times to Taganrog.The guards took care to give little away about their identities. Blindfolds were frequently used for prisoners, and detainees were forbidden to look out of windows. Guards addressed each other using call signs instead of names. One called himself “wolf”, another “shaman”, a third used the codename “death”. All wore balaclavas or other face coverings, suggesting a systemic concealment of identities in order to avoid future accountability.One former senior FSIN official claimed the original rationale for using torture was to extract information that might be useful to Russia’s military forces or civil administrations in occupied areas. “Information about targets, training sites, preparations, the names of commanders, people who might have had useful connections, even civilians who could be of interest.”Reports suggest the abuse was also used as a tool for humiliating Ukrainians, often with a marked ethnic element of denigration. Oleg Orlov, the Nobel peace prize-winning Russian rights activist, said the basic system of kidnapping and disappearance of “disloyal” civilians was familiar from Russia’s Chechen wars. “But there is also something new. This continuous, regular cruelty and torture over months and years, this long-term torture for whole groups, I never heard of this in the Russian prison system before,” he claimed.Subotina said a few of the guards she encountered appeared torn: “They said quietly that they have no choice … that they had no options but to follow orders.” Most, however, seem to have carried out their work with enthusiasm.‘Outside the legal field’The majority of civilians are held, for months or years, without any charge. Families may eventually receive a terse confirmation that their relatives are being detained “for opposing the special military operation”, using the Kremlin’s term for the war. These prisoners are known as “incommunicado”. They do not have the right to send letters or receive parcels and Russia often will not even confirm at which prison they are being held.Often, the first that relatives will hear about where their loved ones are is when those released in an exchange give testimony about the people they shared a cell with.Legal experts say the framework by which Russia is holding the civilians it seized on occupied territories is unclear and not based in law. “There is no official crime in the Russian legal code of ‘opposing the special military operation’. All of this exists outside the legal field. It’s an absurd situation; even in Stalin’s time there were always charges,”said Vladimir Zhbankov, of Poshuk.Polon, an NGO that helps people look for their loved ones.One Russian lawyer who works on Ukrainian cases said: “There are people who have been imprisoned for years and we don’t even know where they are. There is no access to them. We periodically send requests to ask where they could be. But in response … they say according to their data there has never been such a person, never detained.”Access to prisoners in Taganrog is said to be even harder than in most facilities. “It’s impossible for a lawyer to get into Taganrog. I show up and they give me a written refusal: ‘I am declining the services of a lawyer.’ It doesn’t name any lawyer, just says ‘lawyer’ in general, and is signed and dated,” said one lawyer who tried to take on a case of someone held at Taganrog.The few who still do this work have to carry a huge burden. “Lawyers have to be social workers and psychologists too. It’s very high-risk, it’s emotionally extraordinarily difficult. We are the only people who have access,” said one legal source.“A lawyer I know saw their client who had been in Taganrog, and the prisoner was in such a bad condition that the lawyer cried for three days,” the source added.Enduring threatAccording to a Ukrainian intelligence source, as of autumn 2024 there had been at least 15 cases of Ukrainians dying at Taganrog, based on witness statements from detainees who returned in prisoner exchanges. One died from torture during interrogation, four collapsed and died during the violent “reception” upon arrival, and in a further 10 cases specific data was not available.“There was never a doctor in the colony, only a paramedic,” Labuzov said. “When prisoners were unwell, she would come and just ask what was wrong. And she didn’t even give them pills.” If the condition was serious, an ambulance was called from the local hospital, but it often came late, sometimes not until the next day. “I know for sure that one man died like that,” Labuzov said.In recent months there have been reports of improved conditions in Taganrog, and there are suggestions it has been returned to its prewar purpose. While the torture rooms may have fallen silent, they can still be used to instil fear.“Taganrog works as a threat now,” said the Russian legal source. “If they say ‘we’re going to send you to Taganrog’, many people will sign whatever you tell them to.”Explore more on these topicsThe Viktoriia projectRussiaUkraineTortureEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Mobile signal was disrupted, traffic lights stopped working, supermarkets went dark and resorted to cash as digital payment systems stalled, and people were stranded far from their homes as the blackout stretched on for much of the day.EU residents were urged last month tostockpile 72 hours’ worth of essentials, but the blackouts seem to have revealed the vulnerability of many people to widespread disruption.After the outages, with service returning to normal levels, the Guardian spoke to people who got in touch as they reflected on what lessons to learn from the incident in terms of preparedness and resilience.For Iñigo, even though the hospital outages felt like “a complete disaster” at the time, looking back, he’s thankful no one was physically harmed. “The best thing we can do [in future] is have more backup generators and fuel to keep things running as smoothly as possible,” he said.View image in fullscreenBeibei from Barcelona.Photograph: Beibei/Guardian CommunityIn Barcelona, Beibei, 41, at first found the outages “quite exciting”. It was only when her neighbour knocked on her door with her four-month-old baby and said: “You know it’s Europe-wide,” that she started to worry. “I saw my own fear in her face,” she said.She wanted to pick up her six-year-old son from school, but needed to buy food first. “In nearly total darkness the shopkeepers were turning cashless customers away,” said Beibei, who works as a climate campaigner and has lived in Spain since the Covid pandemic. She picked up some essentials, but seeing other customers with trolleys full of food, she began to worry she didn’t have enough.Beibei went out a second time with her neighbour. Their nearest supermarket had stopped letting in new customers. Another supermarket Beibei tried was on its last energy reserve: “As the cashier was taking items from my basket, I realised I didn’t have enough cash. Just then the last bit of power went completely, and she said: ‘Now you cannot take anything’.”After collecting her son and reuniting with her family, Beibei said she will no longer take things for granted. “I’ve already taken out cash so I’m prepared for next time,” she added.“It’s reset my perception of what matters in life. Every bit of food, the presence of people around us, the ease of cooking and washing with appliances, are all miracles that I’ll never overlook again.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But before arriving, the train shuddered to a halt. There was no mobile signal, and the doors remained sealed for about two hours until authorities arrived, opened the doors and gave out bottled drinks, he said.View image in fullscreenA police officer hands water to passengers stuck on a high-speed train.Photograph: Doug Craib/Guardian CommunityHe said a woman suffered a panic attack about six hours in. “The air in the carriages was thick and hot,” he said. As night fell, police eventually escorted passengers off the train with torches, and they walked with bags to a bus that took them to Barcelona, arriving about midnight, he said.View image in fullscreenPassengers disembark from the train after several hours, and head for a bus to Barcelona.Photograph: Doug Craib/Guardian CommunityCraib said the experience provoked a reevaluation of the trend towards digital-only transactions after many people were unable to purchase food or water.“Literally every conversation I had in Barcelona with hotels, taxis and restaurants was tinged with the worry of the current trend to ditch cash,” he said. “All the payment systems went out here, and the only way you could transact was with cash, but most people had none, and the ATMs were down.”Catarina, a 24-year-old engineer in Porto, was at her office when the power failed. She went home and filled up on water in case the pumps stopped carrying it to her third-floor apartment. She listened for updates on a wind-up radio she’d bought last month, after the EU urged people to make emergency precautions.View image in fullscreenCatarina, in Porto, listened for news updates on a wind-up radio she bought last month, and stored water in case the pump stopped working.Photograph: Catarina/Guardian Community“No one knew what to do, where to go, how long it would take,” she said.“On the other hand, there’s a lot of discourse on how humanity is lost because of technology, but if yesterday shows us anything, it’s that it isn’t. When necessary, people stick together, go outside and act like a community again.”With power still down at 5pm on Monday, Catarina went for a walk with her boyfriend – and what she saw made her feel hopeful. She saw cars stopping for pedestrians without traffic lights, large but orderly lines for buses, gardens full of people reading, playing sports, making BBQs with family, friends and neighbours, residents talking to passersby from their doorways.“It was amazing,” she said. “Despite everything that went wrong, it gave me a lot of hope in humanity to see how quickly people got together and helped each other.”Explore more on these topicsSpainPortugalEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then a white building flashed through a gap in the trees, a few kilometres from the road.Without permission from the government, that is as close as anyone can get to the Terrorism Confinement Centre (Cecot), the prison at the core of relations betweenEl Salvadorand the US.President Nayib Bukele bills the prison as the biggest in theAmericas, capable of holding 40,000 people, and specifically members of MS-13 and Barrio 18, the two gangs that brutalised Salvadorian society for decades.It is also wherethe Trump administration has paid to send 238 Venezuelan migrants, and a black hole from which no information escapes – except for what the Salvadorian government chooses to reveal. The Guardian requested to visit but received no response.“It’s like Guantánamo on steroids,” said Juan Pappier, Human Rights Watch’s deputy director for the Americas. “These people are outside the US, in a country with no separation of powers. They’re in a space essentially ungoverned by law.”Three years ago, Bukele declared a state of exception that has continued ever since, suspending constitutional rights and unleashing the state to take on El Salvador’s gangs, including throughmass incarceration without due process.About 85,000 people –1.4% of the population– have been arrested since. Most are being held in pre-trial detention. Human rights organisations believe many people without ties to gangs have been swept up, and have documented almost 400 deaths in custody.View image in fullscreenGovernment prison security officers stand guard inside the newly inaugurated Cecot on 2 February 2023.Photograph: Marvin Recinos/AFP via Getty ImagesThe mass arrests broke the gangs’ territorial grip, brought homicides down and gave many Salvadorians a kind of freedom they hadn’t known for years. The great majorityapprove of Bukele’s government.But at the same time, Salvadorians know they now live at the whim of a president who has accumulated near absolute power.In Tecoluca, the rural district in the shadow of Cecot, most were afraid to speak with their names.‘It’s a war on the people’: El Salvador’s mass arrests send thousands into despairRead more“If you criticise them, they accuse you of being a criminal,” said one man. “All you can say is amen, amen – otherwise they might take you from your home.”César Cañas, a local councillor and activist, said that the prison was built without public consultation. Locals only found out when construction trucks started arriving in 2022.The military had set up a checkpoint on the access road, so Cañas approached on foot from the other side to investigate, finding that farmers had been forced to sell their land or face expropriation.“When Radio YSUCA publishedour findings, that forced the president to give his version,” said Cañas. “And hetweetedthat they were building a mega-prison to house 40,000 terrorists. That’s more than the population of the whole district.”The 23-hectare (57-acre) prison was finished in less than a year, and the first prisoners arrived in February 2023.Even now, locals say they know almost nothing about what happens inside the prison.The secrecy around Cecot is not unique: the government has released little information from any of its prisons since the state of exception began.But what is unique is that no information has leaked out.This reflects the fact that only one prisoner is known to have left the Cecot alive:Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadorian man who was wrongly deported from the US and subsequently transferred to another prison, where he still has no contact with the outside world.This tight control on information coming out of Cecot allows authorities to shape its image through choreographed visits fromselect media,influencersand USRepublican politicians, making it the public face of the state of exception.Those visits have shown large cells with three tiers of metal beds but no sheets or mattresses. There are up to 80 prisoners to a cell, where they share basic toilets and a basin of water to wash in.View image in fullscreenAn inmate puts cream on a fellow inmate’s face in a cell at the Cecot mega-prison on 31 August 2023.Photograph: Marvin Recinos/AFP/Getty ImagesPrisoners are allowed to leave their cells for 30 minutes a day, to exercise in the central area. They never see sunlight, but the lights inside are never turned off – except for the pitch-black solitary confinement cells. No visitors are allowed.The government says15,000 prisonersare currently held there.“Cecot is not meant for rehabilitation,” said Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal, a human rights organisation. “It is meant for permanent exile, permanent punishment.“In that sense, it’s intentionally cruel,” added Bullock. “And that’s what is being communicated: that finally we have a leader strong enough to deal with these people how they should be dealt with, which is as something less than human.”The propaganda doesn’t reflect the reality of El Salvador’s state of exception nor its prison system, where people who may have nothing to do with gangs are trapped in still more terrible conditions inprisons such as Izalco.Nonetheless the image is part of what makes Cecot useful to the Trump administration, said Bullock. When Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security,gave a speechin the prison, she did it in front of MS-13 members – not the Venezuelans they had just deported.“The Venezuelans don’t have the names of gangs tattooed on their chest. And when they had their heads shaved and their backs bent double, they looked sad. It generated some sympathy,” said Bullock. “When you stand in front of MS-13 members, you eliminate that doubt.”The Wall Street Journalreportedthat Bukele plans to double the size of Cecot. In addition to deported migrants, Trump said he would “love” to start sending US citizens who commit violent crimes to prison in El Salvador.View image in fullscreenPrison officials stand guard on a pavilion inside the Cecot mega-prison on 27 January 2025.Photograph: Marvin Recinos/AFP via Getty ImagesPeople in Tecoluca were alarmed by the prospect of the prison’s expansion.In one community, El Milagro – the Miracle – locals complained about being caught in the penumbra of the mobile signal blockade, but also the trail of sewage, that emanates from Cecot.The river has turned brown since the prison began dumping waste upstream. A young man took a stick and began poking the sediment along the banks, releasing a sickening smell.“Cecot istheinternational mega-prison,” he said. “For me it’s shameful that Tecoluca is associated with it.”Still, he was resigned. “We aren’t listened to. People don’t have a voice any more.”“I’d have preferred a mega-university,” he added quietly.Explore more on these topicsEl SalvadorAmericasUS immigrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s another one, from an assessment record by children’s services on the subject of 14-year-old Erin (not her real name). “Erin … is being exploited into prostitution. She hangs around with a number of men who take her money. She is a very promiscuous girl.”I could go on. Groomed: A National Scandal is full of them. Film-maker Anna Hall has decades’ worth of material to choose from. Her 2004 film Edge of the City was the first television exposé of what we now call grooming gangs, born of research she had begun after a chance meeting five years before with a senior director at Barnardo’s children’s charity who told her that they had noticed a new pattern of child abuse. Groups of men were targeting vulnerable children – almost always white girls, usually in the care system – befriending them, giving them drink and drugs, becoming their “boyfriends”, then having sex with them and offering them round to other men.Chantelle, now 32, speaks here of being 11 when her twentysomething “boyfriend”, one of the men who used to sit on the wall outside her Manchester children’s home, started grooming her. The abuse, including being kept in a hotel room for days and “passed about”, went on for years. She contacted the police many times, she says, but “they never done anything”.Erin was groomed from the age of 12 and first raped at 13. The police told her mother that it was Erin’s lifestyle choice. An even worse attack followed. Her mother took her daughter (“bitemarks head to toe”) and her knickers full of semen back to the police. They did nothing. A social services report notes that she is “a young girl … who frequently puts herself at risk”.Hall’s film lays out the systemic failures of the police and all the other authorities supposedly in charge of protecting these girls and thousands like them, not just then, but now and all the terrible years in between. It is a tale of blind eyes turned, abundant evidence ignored, reports buried and task forces disbanded.One such taskforce was Operation Augusta, set up as a result of the 2003 death of 15-year-old Victoria Agoglia after she reported being raped and forcibly injected with heroin by a much older Asian man. It was led by detective constable Maggie Oliver, who says here it took just weeks to find evidence of grooming gangs (“We identified about 97 child rapists”) to whom such vulnerable girls were “just cannon fodder”. The group was broken up while Oliver was away on compassionate leave.Jayne Senior, who would become the whistleblower and source for the Times newspaper articles that first brought the Rotherham grooming scandal to public attention, says the Home Office report she helped prepare was buried for clearer reasons. “I was told on more than one occasion to stop rocking the multicultural boat,” she says.The ethnicity of many of the men involved, of course, is what seems to have made the subject so unpalatable to the powers that be. The possibility of being seen as racist – or, given the religion of many of the alleged perpetrators, Islamophobic – apparently outweighed the need to stop children being beaten, raped and trafficked. The testimony of more recent survivors suggests that, whatever the claims made by the various police forces and authorities about a revolution in approaches since, little has changed.The anger of Senior, Oliver and Hall herself is palpable, with Hall’s fuelling but never overwhelming the film. The survivors are still deeper in survival mode, trying to heal, to overcome the damage and the grief caused by their terrible experiences. How you do that in a world that still privileges image over awful substance, a world in which the deep misogyny that allows female suffering to be dismissed and the victims blamed for it, I do not know. But it is films like Groomed – in their unflinching detail, in the testimonies they present, in the unpublished reports they excerpt – that may function as a stepping stone, somehow, some day, to some redress.Groomed: A National Scandal is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewUK child abuse inquiryDocumentaryChild protectionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Gifted on climate policy, she used all six of her questions to call for another child abuse inquiryWed 30 Apr 2025 14.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 15.12 EDTShareOn days like these,Keir Starmermight come to believe there is a God after all. Fair to say the prime minister has been under the cosh recently. His popularity ratings tanking as people continue to feel fed up that nothing still appears to be working as it should. The local elections on Thursday are unlikely to provide any joy for Labour with Reform ahead in several polls. Even the election of Mark Carney has been a mixed blessing. A reminder that some politicians get rewarded for taking a tough line on Agent Orange. The Lib Dems have declared themselves honorary Canadians.To cap it all, Tony Blairhad just published a report on climate policythat even his best friends might consider to have been “unhelpful”. Tony is a former politician who is unable to go gently into the dark night. Eighteen years after stepping down as prime minister, he still yearns for relevance.Attention, even. If he can’t be meaningful, he can at least be a contrarian. A thorn in Labour’s side, seeking retribution against imagined slights. AgainstLabourMPs, the overwhelming majority of whom weren’t even in parliament at the time he left. Some were even in primary school. But they must be punished nonetheless. For the thought crime of believing they could move on. Nothing less than total obedience and gratitude will do. Never forget who won three general elections. Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.So you might have thought thatKemi Badenochwould have been keen to seize on the report from the Tony Blair Institute. After all, it’s not often that a Tory leader of the opposition finds herself more or less on the same side as Labour’s most successful prime minister. It’s even less often that Labour’s most successful prime minister finds himself Nigel Farage-adjacent. But that’s another story. For now, KemiKaze had an open goal. Six questions to exploit the gulf between Starmer and Blair.But Kemi turned the opportunity down. Maybe she had noticed that Tony had been doing some frantic back-pedalling after realising he had landed in the net zero sceptic camp. That when he had said phasing out fossil fuels in the short term was a strategy doomed to failure what he had really meant was that phasing out fossil fuels in the short term was a realistic endeavour. That he had only been highlighting the problems of developing countries and was totally on board with the Labour government’s focus on renewables and carbon capture.Maybe Kemi had noticed that almost every serious climate scientist had rushed out to rubbish Tony’s report and was having second thoughts about her own position? Unlikely. Reflection is not her style. Most likely, she had got an idea into her head and wouldn’t budge. This was how she rolled. Wake up. Eight double espressos – whichever was closest to hand – and sign in to X. There to join the rollercoaster wild west of conspiracy theories until she found something that suited her mood.That’s the only credible explanation. Because after Starmer had surprised everyone by starting with a gag that was actually funny –a dig at Robert Jenrickfor still running after his outing in the London marathon that creased up the Tory benches: it’s somehow reassuring to find there are so many Conservatives who find Honest Bob objectionable – Kemi used all six of her questions to call for a national inquiry into child abuse gangs.It wasn’t that the topic was not important. It is. The victims suffered horrific abuse. More, there wasn’t a clear reason why Badenoch had chosen to raise it at this Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions. If she hadn’t wanted to go on climate breakdown she could have done bin collections instead. After all, the local elections were the following day. But Kemi insisted on returning to a subject she first raised three months ago after Elon Musk became interested on social media. It goes without saying Elon has long since moved on. He never cared about the victims anyway. He just liked the attention. The frenzy.Nor did Kemi have anything new to say. There was no new information. No new angle of attack. And Keir could hardly believe his luck. He was off the hook. Because no one – with the possible exception of a few QAnon Reform voters – really believe that Starmer is trying to cover up the abuse. After all, as director of public prosecutions he was directly responsible for seeing that some of the perpetrators faced justice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There had been a national inquiry, headed by Prof Alexis Jay, which had made 20 recommendations. None of which the Tories had implemented when they had been in government. Surely it made more sense to act upon the existing recommendations, rather than spending hundreds of millions on another inquiry which might come to the same conclusions? And if Kemi was hellbent on another inquiry, why hadn’t she and the Tories set it up when they had been in power?It was irrefutable logic, but Kemi kept coming back at Starmer again and again. Hoping for what? That he might crack? Unlikely. It all made for a strange impasse. Deja vu. And it left a rather nasty taste in the mouth. Because you couldn’t help feeling that this was all happening at the victims’ expense. They had suffered once at the hands of their abusers. Now they were being used for political advantage.The rest of the session was low-key. No real fireworks. Notable mainly for Tory MPs promoting their VE Day celebrations. Bernard Jenkin tried to drum up interest in a choral evening and sounded almost apologetic that they would be singing some works by German composers on such a patriotic evening. He needn’t have worried. Some of us gladly listen to Bach. Mark Francois hoped for some dosh for a Vera Lynn statue. “Hopefully, we’ll meet again,” he said. Starmer said they would. Though he didn’t sound thrilled by the prospect.All the while, Victoria Starmer looked on impassively from the visitor’s gallery. She gave nothing away. Not even a smile at her husband’s jokes. She’s a tough audience. Also watching on was the erstwhile pop singer, Chesney Hawkes. At least that’s who he said he was.

The takeover of the South Vietnamese capital, renamed Ho Chi Minh City, by North Vietnamese forces reunited a country riven by a decades-long civil war that killed more than 3 million civilians – a triumph of one vision of Vietnam’s future at the violent expense of another, with many caught perilously in between.‘Bombs and bullets were like rain’: 50 years on from the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam warRead moreFor the US, the fall of Saigon was an indisputable humiliation and the end to what was then its longest war, one that killed more than 58,000 servicemen, divided a nation and has only grown more ignominious with time. Fifty years on, the picture is clear: the Americanization of theVietnam warwas an unfathomably costly, poorly run, incomprehensibly horrific folly based on political lies and dubious intelligence. It is taught as a brief but upsetting chapter in American schools – if it’s taught at all.But as outlined in Turning Point: TheVietnamWar, a sweeping new Netflix series on the conflict and its long, dark shadow, the war left an indelible mark on the American psyche that is still festering today. “The America that existed before the United States engaged militarily in Vietnam was a radically different country than the America that emerged after our troops came home,” said the director Brian Knappenberger. “That new America that emerged from this conflict contained the roots of a lot of what plagues our society today – widespread alienation, deep cynicism, profound distrust in government, a breakdown of our civic institutions.”That cynicism emerged largely from the yawning disconnect between what the government under John F Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford said was happening, and what Americans learned was happening through the news, the experience of their loved ones, or the absence of loves ones who never returned home. In the US, belief in the armed forces went from sacrosanct to curdled; one’s view of the conflict depended on who you listened to. “There’s history in the sense of facts. But there’s also history as stories, as narratives,” says the historian and writer Viet Thanh Nguyen in the first episode of the series. Nguyen’s acclaimed 2015 novel The Sympathizer, which traces a North Vietnamese mole’s mutable loyalties over many years, opens during the cataclysmic – or, depending on who you talk to, triumphant – fall of Saigon; as a South Vietnamese refugee in the US, Nguyen says, he was aware how “in both of these countries, there are deeply conflicting histories. That’s part of what led to the war in Vietnam.”In five roughly 80-minute chapters, Knappenberger’s series delves into those histories, layering subjective narrative – among them, the steadfast binary of communism v democracy that undergirded US involvement and the lionization of Ho Chi Minh in the North – over a clear timeline of events. Knappenberger also directed Turning Point entries on the Cold war and the “war on terror”, two conflicts inextricable from America’s war in Vietnam; as in those shows, the Vietnam war proceeds chronologically, covering four US presidential administrations starting with John F Kennedy, who initially escalated US military involvement in South Vietnam under the guise of “advising” their military against real and perceived communist encroachment from the north.The conflict in Vietnam marked not just a sea change in America’s role on the world stage, but in how war was documented. The series relies extensively on archival footage from CBS, one of the pre-eminent US journalism outlets on the ground in Vietnam, whose reporters were responsible for some of the largest breaks with the US military’s party line. For viewers now and then, the footage “brings us much closer to the reality of what’s happening in a way that people found very, very shocking”, said Knappenberger. From interviews with US grunts openly questioning why they’re fighting, to graphic images of women and children massacred by US soldiers at My Lai, to mass graves in Hue following the brutal North Vietnamese Tet offensive, the American public was inundated with the horrific reality of war with a revolutionary, chilling closeness.The series also provides stunning proximity to the thinking of American presidents, owing to their seemingly naive recording of all Oval Office meetings and phone calls. Knappenberger and his team sorted through hundreds of hours of these tapes, from Kennedy through Nixon, which reveal how the war “was often fought for political reasons, and that a lot of the decisions around what to do in Vietnam – particularly the peace process – were really being driven by electoral politics in the United States”, said Knappenberger. As later revealed in the Pentagon Papers, American officials knew by 1967 that the US would never decisively “win” against the North Vietnamese and the People’s Liberation Movement, colloquially known as the Viet Cong, and misled the public to continue anyway. “Nobody wanted to be the president who lost Vietnam,” said Knappenberger, “and often that took priority over Vietnamese and Americans dying in a conflict that was never going to resolve the way the United States wanted it to resolve.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: NetflixThe toll of that conflict, for civilians and soldiers, fighters and protesters alike, is made clear through an impressive assemblage of interviews, including numerous Vietnamese participants from various factions of the civil conflict. “So often the events of this war are told from the American perspective only,” said Knappenberger. “But in Vietnam, it’s important to remember that this was very much a civil war as much as anything else. The understanding of these events can’t be separated from the fact that there are two different parts of this country who had very, very different visions of what their future might be.” Those visions splintered along overlapping, confounding lines – Viet Cong volunteers, over 70% of whom were women, who experienced brutality from the South Vietnamese government and/or US soldiers; South Vietnamese loyalists who believed in democracy in some form; soldiers from both the North and South haunted by violence; everyday citizens from both sides pulled into the war; millions of refugees to the US, Canada and other countries.Knappenberger, whose father served in Vietnam, also takes time for the various experiences of US veterans, many of whom were drafted into the conflict unwillingly or experienced profound disillusionment when faced with evidence of the war’s folly. It is true, as the series recounts in nauseating detail, that the US committed many atrocities in Vietnam – “you just hunt for people and you kill them. And you kill them any way you want,” Scott Camil, a US soldier who later led Vietnam Veterans Against the War, recalls of the mindset encouraged by US military leaders in Vietnam. Camil’s testimony before Congress inspired Graham Nash’s song Oh! Camil (The Winter Soldier). It is also true that the war was hell, and public sentiment against it or outright contempt for veterans alienated many men traumatized by their experience. “It’s just clear that this war is still an open wound of pain and trauma for so many people,” said Knappenberger.‘Police raids are nothing new’: student protesters from 1960s see history repeating itselfRead moreThe Vietnam War offers clear lessons of American fallibility and hubris, the intractability of political conflict, the risks of an unscrupulous, coercive and unforthcoming executive branch as exemplified by Nixon, the profound waste that is war. And yet, as the series explicitly points out, the US has repeated many of the same mistakes. Footage of campus protests in the 1960smirrorthose today calling for an end to US military support of Israel’s war in Gaza, which has again destroyed the lives of too many innocent civilians. Footage of the fall of Saigon eerily foreshadows thesame scene in Kabul46 years later, when the US withdrew from 20 years of counter-insurgency in Afghanistan in a hellish drama of chaos, devastation and broken promises.Then and now, “you just have this growing sense of who are we as a country?” said Knappenberger. “What is our role in terms of using our military around the world? And why didn’t we learn? Are we the United States of amnesia?”The series exists, in part, to re-contextualize memories of Vietnam for those who lived through it. And, in part, to inform those who know little about it yet grew up in a country shaped by the conflict. “I hope that plenty of people who were born way after these events see something of our times and of relevance here,” said Knappenberger. “That they can understand, and can inform their lives and decisions, as younger and younger people end up continuing this human drama, as the story goes on.”Turning Point: The Vietnam War is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryVietnam warFactual TVTelevisionNetflixVietnamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Please tell me you are indeed wearing yellow? Because unless you have been hiding underneath a rock for the past two months, you can’t have failed to notice that butter yellow is the new black.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The “new black” narrative is one of fashion’s most familiar plotlines. Big explosions, dramatic music, and – bam – we all stop wearing the nice normal blue jeans and black jackets that we (a) like and (b) actually own, and start wearing a completely different colour instead. This is fundamentally a bit implausible on many levels. But then, so is the story of Cinderella, and that hasn’t stopped “rags to riches with a side order of fairy godmother” from being the plot of a million films.My point is this: I don’t expect you to take the butter-yellow trend completely literally, but I do suggest you take it seriously. It is not necessary to wear it head to toe, but you would be wise not to laugh it off.Butter yellow is the best “new black” we’ve had in years. If you are going to give a colour a headline slot in style, then it needs to own the stage. Butter yellow is ideal: this is not a colour that one tends to wear by accident.You don’t have to wear it as a dress or a suit. You could do a lemon-yellow shoe. A basket bag would be cuteIt is a fashion statement that tells the world that you are up to date with pop culture. The backstory begins at Paris fashion week last year, where Chloé led a revival of sunshine-coloured bohemian holiday dressing. I remember two divine, long sunshine-yellow dresses on the catwalk, a slip and a tiered gown, both trimmed with ivory lace. I also remember an oversized yellow parka jacket that was giving that’s-what-I-want-to-wear-at-Glastonbury vibes all the way back in October.View image in fullscreenTimothee Chalamet.Photograph: David Swanson/EPAAround the same time, the world became obsessed with Sabrina Carpenter’s hair – not only a creamy yellow, but curled in the elaborate licked whorls of a butter dish delivered with room-service breakfast in a fancy hotel. Fast forward to the 2025 Oscars, andTimothée Chalamet brought butter yellow to the red carpet. As the first public Givenchy moment by new creative director Sarah Burton, Chalamet’s butter yellow was colour as fashion moment. An intentional choice by one of fashion’s most beloved designers and one of its hottest celebrities. Obviously, he looked great, and butter yellow was thickly spread all over the high street pretty much by breakfast time the next day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

An old one | Jess Cartner-Morley on fashionRead moreI know what you’re thinking: it doesn’t suit me. Nobody thinks they look their best in yellow. People will tell you it brings out the worst in their skin colour. Yellow is blamed for making blond hair look brassy. For making serious people look unserious. Frankly, no one has a good word to say for it. But while sharp, blue-tinged citrus yellow has an acidic harshness that feels unrelaxing to look at, warm butter yellow is softer, with a golden-hour mellowness to it.If you are still concerned about how it reflects on your colouring, just add a pop of a different colour at the neckline. This could be a crewneck white T-shirt layered underneath your butter-yellow sweater, so that a ribbon of white dazzles at your throat like a string of pearls. (T-shirt not sitting high enough? Carefully snip the label out and wear it back to front.) Or it could be a navy sweater tied around your shoulders. And besides, as we said already, you can take the butter-yellow trend seriously without taking it literally. In other words, you don’t have to wear it as a dress or a suit. You could do a lemon-yellow shoe. A basket bag would be cute.Anyway, the fact that it might not make you look good is exactly why butter yellow does make you look good. It makes you look bold and brave. It might not reflect well on your complexion, but it reflects well on your personality. Butter yellow is the colour of spring, of daffodils and speckly Mini Eggs. A butter-yellow shirt will be a brilliant beach cover-up this summer, but in the meantime you can wear it with jeans. It will look great! She says, buttering you up.Model: Teesta at Milk.

More than gross, actually – there’s scientific evidence it could have serious health consequences and even, if you want to come over all dramatic about it, be life-threatening. And yet I can count on the fingers of no hands the people I know who ask me to remove my shoes when I visit.Until now this has been an uncomplicatedly divisive subject: you were either a Shoes Off household, or you weren’t. But a secret underground movement is gathering pace – the Shoes On households who wish they were Shoes Off, but are worried about the uptight implications of rolling out that policy. Can you be a Shoes Off household while avoiding Shoes Off household energy?The Shoes Off brigade get a bad rap, given that they’re essentially right – outdoor shoes carry bacteria, allergens and toxic chemicals that could lead toE coli, MRSA or various deadly bloodstream infections. You’re glazing over, aren’t you? Maybe this will grab your attention: 96% of shoes tested positive for coliform bacteria, which is commonly found in faecal matter, in aUniversity of Arizona study. Everyone will presumably now try to convince themselves they’re in the 4% club but although maths is far from my strong point, I’m fairly sure we can’t all be. In other words, we’d apparently rather let our friends track crap all over our homes than demand they go shoe-free, because that seems so control-freaky and joyless.The other problem with Shoes Off households is that most of them don’t give you advance warning, meaning you could end up barefoot in public without the maintenance essential for that to be a mutually non-horrifying experience – or wearing your worst socks. Your shoes might be the key element that ties your whole look together, so you’re a fashion disaster without them. Also, Shoes Off households can’t win with their implementation methods. If they offer communal slippers, yuck. If they don’t, eeek.What Shoes Off households need is a rebrand, for somebody seen as fun and relaxed, but trustworthy, to out themselves as one of them. It’s a tall order, because it would have to be exactly the right person, universally adored, no less than national treasure status for sure.

Stop banging on about renewables; won’t someone think of the things wedon’tknow how to do, like carbon capture and such wizardry as is still locked in tech bros’ imaginations? Basically, net zero had lost the room, according to the former prime minister. And if anyone knows where the room is, and how to get it back, it must be him.The Tony Blair Institute (TBI) issued a statement on Wednesday saying that, in fact, it believes the government’s net zero policy is “the right one”. But this is a familiar trajectory for the former prime minister. He said something similar about “woke”, which sadly lost the room in 2022. “Plant Labour’s feet clearly near the centre of gravity of the British people,” Blair advised Starmer. “[They] want fair treatment for all and an end to prejudice, but distrust and dislike the ‘cancel culture’, ‘woke’ mentality.” What exactly does “woke” mean, if not an end to prejudice? Just how effective is cancel culture if Blair himself could work as a lobbyist for aSaudi oil firm in 2016,advise the government of Kazakhstanafter it brutally suppressed public protests in 2011, and yet still walk among us as the voice of the progressive left? Memo to my fellow cancellers: we are bad at this.Two years later, just after the general election, Blair wasvictorysplaining the populist rightto Keir Starmer: you don’t beat them by arguing with them. “To close off their avenues for increasing support, you’ve got to deal with the grievance.” In practice, this means meeting them halfway on immigration. Promise to cut it, promise to be tough on it, promise to make migrants’ lives as hard as they possibly can be – and Blair has form, here, of course, as the instigator of the life-altering policy ofdenying asylum-seekersthe right to work. The funny thing about meeting populists halfway is that it never works; it almost seems to drive them further into the reaches of their extremism, just to get away from you.But no time! Because net zero extremists are coming for the progressive cause, and the sensible centre needs to head them off at the pass. This issue differs from immigration, in so far as there’s no easy out-group (unless you count “supporters of net zero”), and differs from “woke” in so far as it has a meaning, one that the climate journalist James Murray has handily recapped: “Net zero is a scientific term referring to the balance of anthropogenic emissions and carbon sinks required to stop temperatures spiralling out of control, bringing with them drastically increased risk of food insecurity, catastrophic weather and civilisation-level disaster.” There is no happy medium, where ordinary people get to have slightly less net zero and lower bills. There is only action that is fast enough or not, and political decisions that distribute the cost of that action fairly or not.Many situate Blair’s otherwise incomprehensible position with the allegiance of his largest donor, Larry Ellison, a Trump-affiliated tech billionaire who, as of January 2024,had given $100mto the TBI and pledged to take his donations up to $375m. Don’t panic, anyone; Ellison also spent $200m building aJapanese-inspired villa in Palo Alto. It’s just not that much money to Ellison, so he could easily have bunged it to a mate and not intended to derail any nation’s environmental policies, least of all one as tiny as ours. It makes no sense, he’s not a fossil fuels guy, why would he oppose net zero? Maybe he’s lobbying for tech optimism, maybe he’s working against state regulation. Either way, you didn’t vote for him, nor could you.There’s a more soothing theory still, which is that Blair has always pushed corporate interests and had a deep distaste for grassroots movements for social change. There’s a direct through-line, from the man whopushed PFIand was rumoured to have banned beards on the frontbenches, to the man who finds everything, including wildlife and clement weather, too woke.The last person to voice this anti-net zero position was, of course, Kemi Badenoch. She was asked at a conference in March, by someone who worked at the Eden Project, the only two cogent questions I heard anyone put to her: on what scientific basis did sheresile from the 2050 target? And what would she like the target to be instead? She had no answer at all to the first, and to the second, something whimsical and impressionistic: “Why did we set the target at 2050? Why not 2051, why not 2049? Because there was a zero at the end of the year, not because there was a clear plan.” It was unprepared, undergrad stuff; this politician alone could not hold back the energy for action on climate.That’s what’s often so chilling about anti-climate action – the case for change is so established that you expect its opponents to be at the top of their game, to have an argument so strong that it had never occurred to a waiting world; you expect them to be extraordinary.

Powerful voices across institutions, from politics to academia and religion, must speak outWed 30 Apr 2025 14.07 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 17.27 EDTShareWe have witnessed the first 100 days of the odious Trump regime.The US constitution is in peril. Civil and human rights are being trampled upon. The economy is in disarray.At this rate, we will not make it through the second 100 days.Federal judges in more than 120 cases so far have sought to stop Trump – judges appointed by Republicans as well as Democrats, some appointed by Trump himself – but the regime is either ignoring or appealing their orders. It has evenarrested a municipal judge in Milwaukeeamid a case involving an undocumented defendant.Recently, Judge J Harvie Wilkinson III of the court of appeals for the fourth circuit – an eminent conservative Reagan appointee who is revered by the Federalist Society – issued a scathing rebuke to the Trump regime. In response to its assertion that it can abduct residents of the US and put them into foreign prisons without due process, Wilkinson wrote:If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home? And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present, and the Executive’s obligation to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed’ would lose its meaning.Wilkinson’s fears are already being realized. Ice recently deported three US citizens – aged two, four and seven – when their mothers were deported to Honduras. One of the children, who has stage 4 cancer, was sent out of the US without medication or consultation with doctors.Meanwhile, the regime continues to attack all the independent institutions in this country that have traditionally served as buffers against tyranny – universities, non-profits, lawyers and law firms, the media, science and researchers, libraries and museums, the civil service and independent agencies – threatening them with extermination or loss of funding if they do not submit to its oversight and demands.Trump has even instructed the Department of Justice toinvestigate ActBlue, the platform that handles the fundraising for almost all Democratic candidates and the issues Democrats support.We are no longer Democrats or Republicans. We are either patriots fighting the regime or we are complicit in its tyranny. There is no middle groundMeanwhile, Trump is actively destroying the economy. His proposed tariffs are already raising prices. His attacks on the Fed chief, Jerome Powell, are causing tremors around the world.Trump wants total power, even at the cost of our democracy and economy.His polls are plummeting yet many Americans are still in denial. “He’s getting things done!” some say. “He’s tough and strong!”Every American with any shred of authority must loudly and boldly explain the danger we are in.A few Democratic members and progressives in Congress (Bernie Sanders, AOC, Cory Booker, Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy) have expressed outrage, but most seem oddly quiet. Granted, they have no direct power to stop what is occurring but they cannot and must not appear to acquiesce. They need to be heard, every day – protesting, demanding, resisting, refusing.Barack Obama has spoken up at least once, to his credit, but where is my old boss, Bill Clinton? Where is George W Bush? Where are their former vice-presidents – Al Gore and Dick Cheney? Where are their former cabinet members? They all must be heard, too.What about Republican members of Congress? Arenonewilling to stand up against what is occurring? And what of Republican governors and state legislators? If there were ever a time for courage and integrity, it is now. Their silence is inexcusable.Over 400 university presidents have finally issued a letter opposing “the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education”. Good. Now they must speak out against the overreach endangering all of American democracy.Hundreds of law firms have joined a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the law firm Perkins Coie’s appeal of the regime’s demands. Fine. Now, they along with the American Bar Association and every major law school must sound the alarm about Trump’s vindictive and abusive use of the justice department.America’s religious leaders have a moral obligation to speak out. They have a spiritual duty to their congregations and to themselves to make their voices heard.The leaders of American business – starting withJamie Dimon, the chair and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who in normal times has assumed the role of spokesperson for American business – have been conspicuously silent. Of course they fear Trump’s retribution. Of course they hope for a huge tax cut. But these hardly excuse their seeming assent to the destruction of American democracy.We have witnessed what can happen in just the first 100 days. I’m not at all sure we can wait until the 2026 midterm elections and hope thatDemocratstake back at least one chamber of Congress. At the rate this regime is wreaking havoc, too much damage will have been done by then.The nation is tottering on the edge of dictatorship.We are no longer Democrats orRepublicans. We are either patriots fighting the regime or we are complicit in its tyranny. There is no middle ground.Soon, I fear, the regime will openly defy the supreme court. Americans must be mobilized into such a huge wave of anger and disgust that members of the House are compelled to impeach Trump (for the third time) and enough senators are moved to finally convict him.Then this shameful chapter of American history will end.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

It’s a win for Liberals, who were rightly nervous that former prime minister Justin Trudeau’s poor performance and late-stage missteps might cost them this election. But Carney’s win isn’t as comforting as it should be, especially when we look at all the events leading up to it.It’s no secret that over the last decade, Canada’s image as a welcoming, pacifist, melting pot has completely unravelled, revealing a rightwing underbelly that has seen the rise of the “manosphere” and adeepening ofits influences on young people, as well as a sharp increase inanti-immigrant sentimentand hate crimes. When it came down to this election, it was Trudeau’s forced resignation and people’s ability to credibly accuse the Liberal party of spending a decade basically twiddling their thumbs while the cost of living soared, that pushed Canadians to the right and helped the Conservative party coast to a near win.Trump’s chaotic threats won Mark Carney the Canadian election – but only just | Colin HorganRead moreThenDonald Trumpwon a second term in the US and in effect killed the Conservative party’s momentum here. His decision to impose 25% tariffs on Canada, alongside asinine threats to annex the country as America’s 51st state, fanned the flames of Canadian nationalism, turning voters against Conservatives. A Trump presidency now meant that this election was about who was going to protect us from the madman south of our border – and in that regard, Liberals had Conservatives completely beat.Pierre Poilievre wasendorsedbyElon Musk, publiclysupportedthe 2022 Ottawa “freedom convoy” protests, has never openly condemned the Maga movement, and repeatedly parroted Trump talking points such as ending “woke ideology” (whatever that means), and promising to come down hard on academic institutions whose positions he disagrees with. Carney, on the other hand, has been vocally anti-Trump, and hasbeen clearon the fact that “the possibility that Canada could be part of the US is not on the table and never will be”.So if we understand Poilievre as the Trump-like figure he fashioned himself to be (although he’s reallymore of a Ron DeSantisat this point, as Drew Nelles noted), you can see why it’s so troubling that he came so close to winning, and why it will be hard to wash out the stench of his campaign or forget what it revealed about who Canadians are as a people right now.Poilievreembracedbaseless conspiracy theories about global elite cabals,attackedthe media, has been conspicuouslynon-committalon the climate crisis, has repeatedlyopposedvaccine mandates and praised the “manosphere”, all while indulging the very real fears and anxieties of Canada’s working class and using them as validation for his nonsense ideas. If he had any charisma, the shameless demagoguery might actually be noteworthy. Meanwhile, this is a candidate who before mid-January, was projected as the obvious winner of this election. We simply cannot un-ring that bell.So when I say that Carney may have won, but Canada’s federal elections should make us all worried, that is no exaggeration. And even though he has developed a reputation as the guy you want around when there’s a crisis (Carney was the Bank of Canada’s governor from 2008 to 2013 and was praised for helping getCanadathrough the 2008 financial crisis, and became governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, where he was again pivotal in managing the economic fallout from Brexit), he still has the provincial governments to contend with on major issues such as healthcare and housing, as well as a volatile White House managing the affairs of our southern neighbours.The Guardian view on Canada’s Liberal election: Carney’s triumph is a rebuff to Trump | EditorialRead moreCarney said definitively last month that theold relationshipCanada had with the United Statesis over, and that Canada would “need to dramatically reduce our reliance on the United States” and “pivot our trade relationships elsewhere”, doing “things previously thought impossible at speeds we haven’t seen in generations”.And while it’s left to be seen how he will handletroublesomeconservative provincial leaders and the multiple socialissues left unaddressedin an abrupt campaign (the rights and wellbeing of Indigenous people and public funding, for one), it is clear that he has much to grapple with internally in the coming months, as he simultaneously navigates a radically new relationship with a country that was once one of our closest allies.It may have been a stupid idea, but in all the ways that matter, Canada really has shown itself to be America’s 51st state – a slightly more polite extension of the same destructive far right we’ve seen growing throughout the west.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionAmericasMark CarneycommentShareReuse this content"

My siblings and I would stick out our tongues to compare how blue they were. Sometimes as blue as the milk in our Lucky Charms cereal bowls, where the marshmallows shaped like blue moons, horseshoes and rainbows coloured anything that got in contact with them. Candy corn was a staple on Halloween, and corn syrup jugs were ubiquitous at Thanksgiving to bake pumpkin and pecan pies. These were rare treats – we were an immigrant family who largely ate traditional Indian food – and for that caution, I’m grateful.We now know how artificial food colourings affect the cognitive, behavioural, metabolic and nutritional development of children, and how they are linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This includes my favourite brilliant blue dye. A 2024 scientific review of theevidencetitled Synthetic Colors in Food: A Warning for Children’s Health refers to the possible toxicity levels of these additives, and suggests substituting dyes from completely natural sources instead.Finding any of those dyes in Britain and the EU is pretty difficult, and they’re covered with warnings when you do. In 1995, the UK government passedlegislation(the colours in food regulations) that banned certain colours in food production and required labelling (either by name or by something called an E number) if any of a certain list of chemical food colours were used in manufacturing. Going further, in 2008,the Food Standards Agencysuggested that UK manufacturers should remove artificial food colours, given emerging evidence linking these chemicals to ADHD in children.The UK did not go as far as a complete ban on these colourings, like most EU countries did, but since 2010, food and drink containing certain artificial colourings must carry a warning on the packaging: “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children”. Rather than carry this warning, most food manufacturers have switched to natural sources of food colouring such as beetroot, turmeric, matcha and spirulina.View image in fullscreenThe US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy, at a cabinet meeting at the White House in February 2025.Photograph: ABACA/REX/ShutterstockEU governments and the UK government had to step in with this legislation because just leaving it to the food industry wasn’t enough. Unfettered capitalism is dangerous, with the motivations being sales and producing products in the cheapest way possible, even if they have probable negative health impacts. How is a busy parent supposed to know which cereal is full of E colours that could adversely affect the development of their child, and which cereal is using natural colours? Labelling is a large step forward, as well as warnings. Even better would be to make sure what’s on the shelves isn’t going to make you or your loved ones sick or impaired.I was recently back in the US, and those artificial dyes are still being sold in the same products from my childhood 30 years ago. In one of his last acts in office this January, former president Joe Bidenbanned the dyered 3 in food manufacturing after studies linked the chemical to cancer in male rats. However, food manufacturers have until 2027 to phase the colouring out, meaning foods with this dye such as cakes, candies and cookies are still being sold without any warning on the label.While in EU countries and Britain food safety guidance has evolved with the evidence and to protect consumer safety, US supermarkets and shops are full of products being marketed and sold to children with multiple Es in them, and additives and colourings that are banned or being phased out in other countries.The larger portion sizes and ubiquitous fast food might be most visible when comparing the US to Europe, but the hidden, more insidious difference is what chemicals are regulated and allowed in the food supply.At least a dozen US states rush to ban common food dyes, citing health risksRead moreWith a potential UK-US trade deal including food, the difference in standards presents challenges, and potential slippage into a lower safety bar. We’ve heard of concerns about antibiotics in US meat, and chlorinated chicken, but not about the import of products from the US that don’t meet UK safety standards. We actually have more in common with Europe in terms of food safety, and a trade deal with the EU would improve our food safety baseline.Things are slowly changing in the US, from a surprising source. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health and human services secretary, has a range ofbizarre and dangerous views, buthe’s speakingabout regulating these additives and food colourings under the Maha – or “make America healthy again” – slogan. Maha supporters like to proclaim that this is pioneering. It’s not. Americans love to think we’re world-leading. Sometimes, we’re just behind the curve. In this case, very far behind Europe, and more than a decade behind Britain.While back in the US, I caught up with a friend from England who now lives in Miami. I told her that I had gone into multiple supermarkets looking for ultraprocessed products that didn’t contain something banned or regulated in Europe. Ingredient lists were full of possibly toxic chemicals, yet being sold with no warning or flagging to consumers of what they were buying. She laughed and said, “You’re looking in the wrong section. Go to the British section of the supermarket and you’ll find safer food there.” Who would have thought that the British options would be the healthier options?Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghExplore more on these topicsFood safetyOpinionHealthFood & drink industryFoodcommentShareReuse this content"

SORRY!!! I apologise in advance for everything you are about to read.My more sensible half, you see, is a US citizen, who keeps telling me (a green card holder) that I should stop making jokes about getting sent to a detention centre or deported.Not only are my jokes inappropriate; my wife seems to think they’re suspicious.“I think you secretly want to get deported so you can take a break from childcare and have a lie-in,” she said the other day. I can’t remember what prompted this allegation – perhaps a dire knock-knock joke about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials – but it’s obviously nonsense. I read that Guardian article about theBritish artist who was detainedby US authorities because of a visa mix-up and she was woken up every day at 5:30am and given an Ice-cold potato. There are no lie-ins at Club Fed!Look, it should go without saying that nothing that is happening in the US at the moment is remotely funny. The fact that Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil wasrobbed of seeing his first childbeing born because he’s locked in a cell forprotesting against a genocideis not funny. The fact that a judge has said thatthe Trump administrationjust deported a two-year-old US citizen to Honduras with “no meaningful process” is not funny. The fact that Trump is disappearing people to a prison in El Salvador – and threatening to send “homegrown” Americans there next – is not funny.But while the US’s slide into authoritarianism is no laughing matter, I’m afraid I can’t stop making jokes. It is a compulsion, a sickness. It is simply how I cope with terrible situations. Although, honestly, I’m not coping particularly well. It feels as if everything has been unrelentingly bleak for a very long time now. It’s been over 18 months of watching helplessly as starving kids get slaughtered inGaza, 100 days of Trump inflicting chaos and cruelty in the US. My nerves are shot.In an attempt to brighten things up, my wife and I have been thinking about where we might take our four-year-old this summer. But even a summer holiday isn’t straightforward any more. First, there’s the question of whether it’s too much of a risk to even leave the country as a green-card holder. I reached out to a few contacts who work in immigration law and civil liberties, expecting them to tell me not to be so dramatic and I’d be fine. But they all sort of went: “Ehhh, deportation is definitely a possibility under this unpredictable and lawless regime! You should be prepared! Even flying domestically carries risks!”So now, even though I am in the US perfectly legally, even though I have done nothing wrong (apart from the crime of being Palestinian), summer holiday planning involves extensive risk assessment – tickets, money, passports, a lawyer’s number in case things go south.Across the US, millions of people are making calculations like mine. Should I leave the country or not? Should I go to a protest or not? Should I delete my mean tweets about Trump in case a guard looks through my phone at the border? Should I carry a burner phone when re-entering the US –something foreign journalistsare now being advised to do? You can see, amid all these individual calculations, amid all the self-censorship and self-policing, how easy it is for fear to spread and authoritarianism to take hold.While I may sound cavalier about all this, I am taking my situation seriously. I am lining up possible lawyers in case the worst happens. And I’m coming up with a comms plan. By which I mean I have picked out a cute picture of my dog for my wife to give to the press if I do get detained, in order to foster public sympathy. My dog is a scruffylittle 8lb mongrel called Rascalwho has lost a few teeth in his old age and whose tongue lolls out of his mouth. He has a face that would melt even the Trumpiest heart and he is my secret weapon. It’s very hard to get many Americans to give a damn about Arabs, but dogs are a different story. People will always go to battle for a dog.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s partly ignorance, but politicians don’t helpWed 30 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 07.06 EDTShareMy local area has a thriving community website mainly based around things such as recommendations for plumbers and restaurants, or people selling sofas. But every now and then I feel the need to scan its pages to make sure a near-neighbour hasn’t libelled me. Why?Cycling, of course.As Jeremy Vinehas found out, there is something very peculiar about riding a bike. It seems to make otherwise sensible people on the roads around you lose all reason and perspective. Vine has spent years posting informative and amusing video vignettes of his bike commute, pointing out the many and frequent ways that some drivers seem oblivious or, at times, openly homicidal to those on two wheels.The broadcaster is about as courteous and agreeable a cyclist as you could meet – Ionce joined himon his ride home – but he has finally given up sharing clips in the face of endless comments on X either insulting him or, fairly often, openly wishing him harm. Part of this is simply down to the depressingly grim culture of what used to be Twitter. But it is magnified by the way discussions about cycling inevitably bring out the worst in certain people.I am not by any margin as well-known a bike advocate as Vine. But I havewritten a bookextolling the joys of everyday cycling, pluscolumns on the same subject. For some people, this is enough to make me the object of scorn or even hatred.My irregular appearances on the local website began when the council started introducing so-called low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), filtering schemes intended to make walking and cycling safer and more convenient. The fact Ihave arguedfor such schemes in principle was apparently enough to make me part of a conspiracy to force cars off the road and make cycling mandatory, in league with the council and a shadowy cabal of cycling advocacy groups.View image in fullscreenA still from a YouTube video showing a motorist repeatedly driving at cyclists in London, August 2018.Photograph: MrClifCam/YoutubeWhen I was still a user of X, things were even more feral. Ostensibly serious and sane people, including a Labour councillor and the head of a respected campaign group, would argue that I was not simply wrong about bike lanes and LTNs, but that I knew this and was acting in bad faith.So what is it about cycling? In part it’s sheer ignorance, given that even in most big UK cities, riding a bike is a fairly niche pursuit. To take one example, about twice a week I will have a driver asking (or yelling) about me riding “in the middle of the road”. If I did have the time and patience to explain, the response is simple. First, it’s the middle of thelane; and second, this is a very basic riding tactic recommended by everyone from the Highway Codeto the policeto disincentivise over-close passing when there is not enough room.Similarly, much recent coverage of dangerous cycling is based on what are termed e-bikes – but with their throttles and powered speeds well above the legal maximum of 15mph, these are not bikes. They are illegal electric motorbikes.Such antipathy, of course, takes places within a cultural context. For the UK – plus similar low-cycling countries such as the US and Australia – this is the concerted demonisation of bikes and cycling by everyone from the media to politicians. For certain newspapers and broadcast outlets, bike-bashing is a form of punching-down they can never get enough of. Cyclists are simultaneously so slow and obstructive that they hold up traffic, yet sufficiently rapid and reckless to be a major threat to pedestrians.You can repeatedly point out,as doesthe saintly Chris Boardman, head of Active Travel England, that statistically cyclists are less deadly than lightning and cows – but as ever with culture wars, facts are somewhat futile here.Speaking of culture wars, politicians play their part. Yes, we are thankfully beyond the slightly ridiculous peak of the Rishi Sunak era, when ministers commissioned a report intended to show LTNs didn’t work andsought to cover it upwhen the study found they did. But it is nonetheless notable that the first major intervention linked to cycling by Keir Starmer’s government was to use limited legislative bandwidth toannounce a planned new lawlast week targeting what parts of the media term “killer cyclists”.No one becomes a saint when they start pedalling, and my long-held idea is that the very same people who zoom through a red light on a bike will also speed in a car, recline their seat as the meals are served on a plane or push past to get the last seat on a train. They are multi-modal nitwits.But as Vine, and to a lesser extent myself, have found out, it is only when someone’s legs straddle a crossbar that they are somehow defined by their transport, and logic, reason and courtesy disappear. I’m not a “cyclist”. I just sometimes ride a bike.

We don’t yet know what will be erected in its placeWed 30 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 13.23 EDTShareIt’s possible that later, when we know more about how the Trump regime reshapes the US and about how it ultimately comes to an end, we will look back at this moment in 2025 and conclude that we were already living under an autocracy. Checks on executive power seem to have all but vanished; theTrump administrationis not acting like either the courts, the judiciary or the people have any prerogatives that they must respect.Science is suffering: massive cuts to federal funding of research intomedicine,climate changeor anything that might include a word on a long list of banned ones – like “transition” – has decimated research, made the US a global laughingstock, and set the cause of human thriving back by years. The economy is in chaos, and thebriberyis all but out in the open; it no longer seems to occur to many Americans that their politicians should not be on the take.Immigrantsappear to have lost the entitlement to due process, and the administration appears to be trying to deport as many of them as possible, paying smaller countries in the American sphere of influence to imprison them atforced labor campsfrom which they have no means of petitioning for their own release. Dissidents are beingcaptured on the streets,kidnapped from their homesandarrested in the courtrooms they preside overas punishment for their speech. In light of all this, even without the benefit of hindsight, it is already becoming more difficult to speak of American “democracy” with a straight face.Which is not to say that the developments of the past few months are unprecedented. In many ways, the first 100 days of Trump’s restoration are much like the first 100 of his initial term, in 2017: they are marked by a dizzying whirlwind ofscandals, so numerous and preposterous as to be difficult to keep up with; by a cartoonish incompetence; and by public displays of aggression, cruelty, malice and dominance – be it over thefederal workforce,his political rivals,foreign leaders,major institutionsor theAmerican peoplethemselves.But the second Trump term has also been more reckless, more focused and more frictionless in its work to consolidate power and cut off its political opposition. Long gone are the first-term administration staff members who sought to have some sort of moderating influence on Trump – the bureaucrats and institutionalists who thought they could slow him down with procedure, the more cynical Republican opportunists who thought they could bend his charisma to their own ends. What is left in Trumpworld are only the true believers, or those with the zeal of converts. They are no longer being slowed down from the inside.Nor are they being opposed much from without. In 2017, when liberal Americans could still comfort themselves with the notion that Trump’s election was an anomaly, and in the early months of Trump’s first term, an uncharacteristic level of civic engagement and pride sprang up. The Women’s Marches attracted millions, and crowds swarmed the airports to lend support to travelers from the countries that Trump had targeted with his Muslim ban. But while the early resistance movement had tremendous amounts of feeling, it ultimately lacked direction: all that outrage did not find a useful place to go, and eventually it ebbed. It is hard to find hopefulness, now, among American liberals, and the Democratic party is showing few signs of life. On the Sunday talkshows last week, the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer was asked about the administration’s attacks on institutions of higher education, which have lost federal funding as the regime attempts to restructure their curricula and faculties. Schumer replied that he had sent a strongly worded letter.The United States has long been in a state of constitutional erosion. The role of Congress, the most representative of the federal branches, has been dwindling for decades, as gerrymandering and malapportionment have made its two chambers less competitive and more partisan, leading to permanent gridlock and dysfunction. Congress was once endowed with both the power of the purse and the sole power to declare war; it has largely handed the latter off to the executive, endowing the president with broad powers to use the US military abroad even without congressional approval and has not seemed interested in taking that power back.Trump 100 days: Trump’s whirlwind start to his second presidencyRead moreNow, theTrump administrationseems to have also usurped Congress’s power of the purse for the executive, declaring that the president may refuse to appropriate congressionally allocated funds by personal fiat. This is a profound constitutional change, one that shifts a massive power into the hands of one man; and again, Congress does not seem to be interested in this assault on its own prerogatives, with even many Democratic leaders seemingly preferring to have less power – and, hence, less responsibility.For a long time, the decline of Congress meant the ascent of the federal judiciary, which appropriated large swaths of de facto policymaking authority to itself in light of congressional paralysis. This was already a degradation of democracy: the unelected judges came to have far too much influence over federal policy. And the judges were not the neutral, non-ideological referees that they claimed to be: many interpreted the law to be maximally deferential to the whims of the powerful and only minimally respectful to the rights of the less powerful.The US supreme court, in particular, seemed to change its doctrine almost as whim based on whatever outcome would best serve conservative priorities. Indeed, the judiciary itself seemed more than willing to share in democratically unaccountable power with the president, so long as that president was a Republican: it declared last year that the executive was immune from almost all criminal prosecution, thereby carving out a category of person – Donald Trump – to whom federal criminal law mostly does not apply. But even this wildly partisan federal judiciary does not seem to be good enough for the restored Trump regime, which wants to eliminate all possibility that its agenda might be checked by the courts: JD Vance, the vice-president, has taken to complaining in public when judges rule against the administration,claiming, falsely, that they do not have the authority to check the executive. But such petulant little demonstrations may not long be necessary: increasingly, the Trump regime issimply ignoring judicial ordersthat it does not like.Critics of the Trump administration have called this state of affairs a constitutional crisis. I have come to think of it more like a constitutional collapse: long vacant, the vestiges of the US’s democracy are crumbling to the ground, falling like an empty tent. We don’t yet know what, exactly, will be erected in its place.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But public support for the green transition remains strongWed 30 Apr 2025 13.44 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 20.57 EDTShareThe Climate Change Committee’s latestreporton the UK’s response to unprecedented environmental challenges makes for grim reading. Recalling the extreme weather swings of the last few years – which delivered both the wettest 18 months on record and the largest number of wildfires – the report’s authors deplore the current inadequacy of provision to protect the nation against risks which are now a lethal reality. The threat represented by flooding, said the chair of the committee’s adaptation group, Lady Brown, “is not tomorrow’s problem. It’s today’s problem. And if we don’t do something about it, it will become tomorrow’s disaster.”An assessment so scathing, from such a source, deserved to be at the centre of political discussion ahead of Thursday’s local elections. Instead, Wednesday’s front pages were dominated by a considerably less useful contribution to the climate debate. In a foreword to areportfrom his eponymous Tony Blair Institute (TBI), Sir Tony Blair suggested that governments should dial down efforts to limit the use of fossil fuels in the short term, or risk alienating voters allegedly put off by the “irrationality” and cost of green policies. Politicians’ focus, he insisted, should shift to investing speculatively in technologies for the future such as carbon capture and storage.Offering a counsel of despair over the elimination of fossil fuels really isn’t a good look for an organisation that has enthusiasticallyadvisedthe world’s largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia. Nor, one assumes, was providing doorstep talking points for Nigel Farage the aim of the TBI report’s authors, who loftily state within it that “we need to depoliticise the climate debate”. Some hope. Sir Tony’s remarks were duly greeted withjubilationby the Conservative party and Reform, which have been working overtime to try to turn net zero targets into a Brexit-style dividing line.Following swingeing and justifiedcriticismfrom an array of climate experts, the TBI has scrambled to mitigate the damage. In a clarificatorystatementit noted that “ongoing domestic decarbonisation efforts in all countries remain vital for reducing emissions and delivering a sustainable future”. As Sir Tony’s foreword and the report itself should have made more clear, it is eminently possible to both accelerate the use of available clean technologies such as wind and solar, and invest more in ones for the future such as carbon capture and storage.That, in fact, is what the majority of the public would like to see. As the89 Percent Project, backed by the Guardian and other media organisations around the world, has underlined, global backing for a rapid green transition remains overwhelming. In Britain,researchby the More in Common polling group has found strong approval for net zero targets, not least on the grounds of energy independence and national security.To capitalise on that groundswell of support, Labour needs to lean in rather than take a step back. Properly invested in, with generous subsidies for the less well-off, the green transition can deliver a vote-winning combination of economic growth and environmental sustainability. In a notably bullishspeechlast week, Sir Keir Starmer robustly defended the drive to net zero in these terms. That was good politics as well as morally right. In the meantime, a period of silence from Sir Tony on this subject would now be most welcome.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The answer is that the country’s rightwing leader,Javier Milei, is Donald Trump’s “favourite president”. Amid unease over handing a third of the IMF’s global lending to its largest debtor, the deal passed with $12bn upfront. The IMF has long been intellectually compromised – promoting stability while enforcing neoliberal orthodoxy. Under Mr Trump, it is ethically compromised too.Mr Milei’s bailout marks the second Trump-era rescue for Argentina. In 2018, the fund handed Buenos Aires a record $57bn – but cut it off when its then president, Mauricio Macri,a Trump family friend, was not re-elected. That deal now looks nakedly political. With the US holding an effective board veto, the fund’s independence was always fragile. It’s now completely subordinated. A US takeover of the IMFthreatensdeeper instability than any Argentinian default.Mr Milei shouldn’t have got the loan on these terms. Apart from Argentina’s atrocious record of repayment, its president is operating by emergencydecree, without congressional backing. Since winning power last year, Mr Milei has usedauthoritariantactics – suppressing protest rights and attacking press freedoms – to imposeshock therapy. The plan has been to engineer austerity, spike inflation and deepen poverty, then claim victory when falling prices lowerpoverty metrics.The hard part starts now. Argentina is a classic “stop-go” commodity exporter. It builds up dollars by exporting its produce during a short harvest season, before exports slow naturally or due to a climate event. Argentina burns through dollars importing machinery and medicines. The trouble starts when those dollars are used to prop up the currency, until they run out. Can’t defend the peso? Then the options are to crash it or freeze capital outflows. The IMFdealclearly suggests the former, leading to spiking inflation, stalling growth and eroding wages.Against this backdrop, Mr Milei’s strategy of export-led recovery and spending cuts appears dangerously optimistic. He risks causing private domestic demand to collapse, unless Argentina can attract foreign money. Homegrown private investment will probably prefer dollar assets over industrial expansion. This is unsustainable, as Mr Milei is already facing massiveprotests. The October congressionalmidtermscould become a referendum on his “chainsaw” economics. If cuts trigger recession or inflation returns, his approval will plummet. Mr Milei could stabilise Argentina more effectively by taxing dollar export windfalls and saving the greenbacks in a sovereign wealth fund. This worked in neighbouringChile. Better still: follow South Korea’smodelof subsidies and currencydepreciation, using its US alliance to reinvest export earnings in state-led industry.What’s economically rational is politically toxic to Mr Milei’s libertarian creed.Austerityisn’t buying time for industrialisation. It’s locking Argentina into a capital-friendly, resource-exporting model aligned with US interests. That suits the agro-export bloc thatsupportsMr Milei. Long asick manof South America, Argentina remains trapped in low-value commodity exports instead of building high-value industry. Mr Milei sees the real cure – state-led green development – as worse than the disease. In chasing ideological purity and Trumpian favour, he deepens Argentina’s chronic instability and drags the IMF’s global credibility down with him.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This may be the historic line, but currently, the crisis is not in recruitment but frozen recruitment. In 2024, there was a44% reductionin jobs available, which is likely to be worse now. The reality is a huge and worsening unemployment crisis for fully qualified GPs, particularly those who have recently completed their (extensive and exhausting) training.The Royal College of General Practitioners identifies thisunemployment crisis, the BMA reports that unemployment isprompting GPs to move abroad, and some GPs remaining in the UK aretaking up other work– for example, working as Uber drivers.There is a GP workforce ready to address the issue, but funding is needed for these posts. Moreover, thousands of doctors who applied to train asGPsare rejected each year due to lack of training posts. I am one of them. Addressing the shortage of GPs is entirely within the government’s control, bound by funding. While GPs remain unemployed, it is a spectacular own goal for a country to train up GPs, have demand for GPs, but not provide funding for the posts.The endless shifting of work from secondary to primary care without the cash to back it is illogical and unsustainable. Worryingly, this seems to be the only health policy for this government. GPs are not hospitals and have different financial setups, GPs are subject to direct costs facing small businesses (national insurance hike, energy prices) and the current funding models are unsustainable, with many practices closing their doors due tobudgetary constraintsor workload pressures, which could be reduced by hiring more GPs.Doctors sign up for a career of caring for patients, not working in a call centre. Excessive use of phone calls is symptomatic of firefighting the workload and satisfies no one. Patients and doctors alike are more satisfied and achieve better care with face-to-face contact – this is possible with sufficient funding for GP posts, or else the telephone firefighting will continue indefinitely.Name and address suppliedYour timely editorial highlights the importance of presence in the patient-doctor relationship. Presence in clinical practice involves much more than simply the physical presence of a doctor, but an attentive, empathic connection with a patient.The presence of an interested doctor reduces anxiety, builds trust and is consoling. Presence also has an ethical dimension, conveying a feeling of being responsible for, and responding to, the needs of the patient.For healthcare professionals, being present means acknowledging the patient’s psychosocial needs as much as their physical ones. It is about creating a space where patients feel understood and valued. However, many patients feel a sense of isolation from their general practitioners.Relational, personalised care in general practice is difficult to achieve. Providing continuity of presence, essential for high-quality care, is challenging. The distancing of doctors is exacerbated in medical undergraduate training, where students engage in distance learning, seeing simulated patients and watching podcasts, while bedside teaching declines.Patients want to see a doctor who knows them, and doctors want more patient contact. Politicians need to create conditions which acknowledge the importance of presence in the patient-doctor relationship.Dr David JeffreyWest Malvern, WorcestershireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This has now had huge reputational and financial consequences for the charity, where dozens of staff have since faced redundancy.A core message for charities and all advocates for social justice from this regrettable situation might be that campaigning by diktat rather than persuasion is very rarely successful. Winning folk over to your position while recognising and addressing their anxieties, while very hard work, is usually a better way of securing legislative and social progress that can be embedded and lasts.

The reason the supreme court ruling feels like such a threat to the trans community is because for the last decade activists have misled them about the existing law, staked everything on the complete erasure of sex as a meaningful category in society, and framed any dissent as bigotry, transphobia or worse.It has been catastrophic for a generation of trans-identified youth to have been misled into thinking that their wellbeing is dependent on everyone in society colluding in a pretence that biological sex can simply be overridden by gender identity, irrespective of context. The consequences are all too apparent in the distressed response to what is a compassionate legal ruling that balances the rights of trans people (under the protected characteristic of gender reassignment) while identifying the specific contexts where sex will be relevant too.Name and address suppliedExplore more on these topicsTransgenderWomenEquality Act 2010UK supreme courtGenderlettersShareReuse this content"

As the final whistle went at the end of a noisy and hugely enjoyable semi-finalwith the score at 3-3, there was a feeling of missed opportunity for Barcelona, of what might have been, yet having been a goal down after 30 seconds and trailed 2-0 and 3-2, it might also have been worse. And it was actually pretty special, an exhilarating occasion that resolved nothing but won’t be easily forgotten.The same could be said of Denzel Dumfries, scorer of two goals and forever tearing intoBarcelona, and of Lamine Yamal. They were the most outstanding of many outstanding players on a wild and wonderful occasion in which Barcelona twice came from behind to equalise but couldn’t turn it around entirely, left lamenting their vulnerability at the back. Inter, meanwhile, left satisfied and very much alive, their first task completed. This was a revival they needed, the greatest prize of all still within their reach.Arsenal are talking the talk after PSG loss but can they walk the walk in Paris?Read more“We’re not used to losing,” Simone Inzaghi had said but it had become a bad habit at a very bad time. Three times they lost in seven days. Defeated by their rivals Milanin the Coppa Italia semi-finals, they lost first place in the league at the handsof Bolognaand Roma,Napoli taking advantage. One of three trophies had gone and another was going, the dream of a treble evaporating. Determined that it wouldn’t be the entire season that died away, they could not have started better.The Italians had only been playing for 30 seconds and Barcelona hadn’t yet been given the chance to play at all when they led. A ball into the familiar open space behind the left-back was the Catalan side’s undoing. The first delivery from Dumfries was half cleared, but he got another chance and this time Marcus Thuram – who had missed those three consecutive defeats – guided a glorious flick past Wojciech Szczesny and into the net. It was quick, and the second wasn’t far behind, Dumfries connecting with an acrobatic volley from a corner after 21 minutes.If this was a reminder of the ghosts of theirChampions Leaguepast, and they needed more goals than Inter Milan had conceded in the entire league phase, Barcelona were not to be beaten. Lamine Yamal certainly wasn’t scared. Instead, there he was gesturing for this Olympic stadium to get on its feet and delivering a display that meant they could hardly do anything else.His first delivery had just evaded Ferran Torres and his second set up the striker to fire a fraction wide. That was still at 1-0 and even two down he kept going. The goal which put Barcelona back in the game was almost absurd, the 17-year-old turning away from Thuram, snaking past Henrikh Mkhitaryan and, surrounded by opponents, bending into the corner. A moment later he almost scored one even better, leaving Federico Dimarco on the floor before rattling the bar. Then with the noise rising and the momentum building, Pedri’s lovely ball was headed down by Raphinha and Torres equalised.View image in fullscreenDenzel Dumfries doubles Inter’s first-half lead with an acrobatic volley.Photograph: Joan Monfort/APWhat a game this had become, and it didn’t stop there. If the second half began with Barcelona dominating and Inter sitting deeper, that didn’t mean the Italians had renounced the right to go for the throat when they had the chance. A portrait of the two sides’ approaches came early when a clever pass from Lamine Yamal for Dani Olmo almost opened up Inter and a swift exit from deep did open up Barcelona. Ronald Araújo slid across to stop that attack but, from the corner, Dumfries rose to head past Szczesny, off his line and caught out.Again, the response was immediate, the place exploding when Lamine Yamal allowed a corner to roll through his legs and, from the edge of the area, Raphinha smashed a shot in off the bar and Yann Sommer’s back to make it 3-3 and throw the game wide open. Barcelona were playing with fire, grateful for a superb interception from Pau Cubarsí and relieved to see the flag go up when Dumfries’ wonderful devastatingly ball was finished off by Mkhitaryan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Or perhaps it was just because this is how they are.Either way, it was certainly fun, a microcosm of the game offered when Lamine Yamal pirouetted past two and Szczesny had rush out to deny Dumfries in the same minute. All it lacked was a winner, Lamine Yamal clipping the final shot off the  bar. You might have thought it was a mishit, had he not been doing outrageous things deliberately all night.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBarcelonaInternazionalematch reportsShareReuse this content"

I’m never satisfied. I’m already almost focused on the treble and the FA Cup final.“I want to thank Emma [Hayes]. I’m sure she’s really happy. She left the club in such a great position for me to build on that legacy.”With their victory, Chelsea also set a new record for the longest consecutive unbeaten run of games in a single WSL campaign [20] and they have still not lost any of their domestic fixtures under the management of Bompastor, who arrived last summer to replace Hayes, who had been in charge for 12 years.Bompastor also said she feels her team’s achievements have been underestimated this term, adding: “Yes, I’m listening sometimes, I’ve heard some noise that perhaps it’s ‘too easy’ for Chelsea – that’s not easy, that’s not easy, to beat two times Manchester City, two times Arsenal and two times United [referring to having clinched league doubles over the rest of the sides in the top four].“That’s unbelievable. I don’t think it’s easy, that’s never easy. It’s a lot of work every day. I never let my players breathe. I know, the last few weeks, it was difficult for them.

Of those, one quarter were referred for specialist treatment. The service is not designed to provide a diagnosis, only to provide a risk assessment for former players.Rugby’s concussion trial moves a step closer to reality after high court progressRead moreThe news comes as Rylands Garth, the law firm representing a group of former ­amateur and professional players, says it has received a “surge of new sign-ups” and that it now represents 725 former rugby union players, as well as 280 former rugby league players. They have a range of neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s, motor neurone disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and dementia.The brain health service was launched by World Rugby last year to provide aftercare and is available free of charge to any retired player who played elite rugby in Ireland, Australia, Wales, South Africa and New Zealand.The sport’s governing body is hoping to launch it in more territories this year, but progress has been slowed in France, Argentina and Japan by the challenges of translating the service into different languages. It is not, however, available in England, where the Rugby Football Union runs a similar programme in partnership with Imperial College London.During a presentation at World Rugby’s annual player welfare symposium, the team behind the brain health service expressed concern about the high number of former players who dropped out, or who failed to attend follow-up appointments with medical providers.They say that a large number of the withdrawals were because the players were so worried about what the tests might show. The team are planning to encourage face-to-face consultations in an effort to try to reduce participants’ levels of anxiety.World Rugby’s annual review of injuries revealed that the ­number of concussions suffered in elite male rugby during 2023-24 was in line with previous years, at 13 per 1,000 playing hours, or just under one every two matches. In elite ­women’s rugby over the same period, the ­figure was 11 per 1,000 playing hours, or one every 2.3 matches, which is an uptick. On average, each concussed player was out of the game for around three weeks.Concussions, though, are only part of the problem. There is increasing effort to address the impact of sub-concussive blows, which are now being monitored by instrumented mouth guards. The latest research carried out in France on the Top 14 showed that the top 10% of international players were experiencing around 2,000 physical contacts a year, and there is an increasing focus on reducing “player load”. World Rugby is launching new guidelines in partnership with the global players’ union, International Rugby Players (IRP), stipulating that all players should have a minimum of 12 weeks without physical contact every year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The workloads of most domestic players fall within those limits, but many international players, and in particular “cross-border” internationals who play their Test rugby in one country and their club rugby in another, are going well beyond them. Argentinian internationals who play their domestic rugby in the English Premiership, for instance, in effect have a 12-month season.The guidelines have been drawn up by a group of players, coaches and sports scientists, who spoke during a panel discussion about the tension between player welfare and the commercial and competitive imperatives of the sport. The former Wales captain Ken Owens explained that international players in particular often find themselves in a situation where a large part of their five-week off-season is used for pre-season training. “You come back off summer tour and you potentially get four or five weeks off, but the reality is you’re almost straight back into your club season,” Owens said.The Bath coach, Johann van Graan, who is also part of the group, said that his club have a mandatory six weeks of rest for all Test players, but that he has had to give more than one international all February off in order to achieve it. Bath have a big enough squad to get away with it, but not every club has that luxury. “As coaches, we’re not judged on what we say on panels, or how we are as people,” Van Graan said, “we’re judged on whether we win or not.”Explore more on these topicsRugby unionWorld RugbyConcussion in sportRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Draper had not previously won three consecutive clay-court matches at ATP level. He will next face Matteo Arnaldi,conqueror of Novak Djokovicin round two, for a place in the semi-finals. Arnaldi defeated the 16th seed, Frances Tiafoe, 6-3, 7-5.Jacob Fearnley bows out of Madrid Open as tennis resumes after power outageRead more“The more matches I play at this level will keep helping my confidence on this surface,” said Draper. “Obviously a win today, in that kind of way, against someone who is ranked 12 in the world is a big thing for me. I’m just happy with the way I’m approaching the matches and my training and everything, and yeah, I’m looking forward to keep on continuing, hopefully trying to get better and better on this surface and just in general.”Although Draper is the highest-ranked player left in the draw, he is still finding his feet on clay and learning how to fully unlock his game on the surface. He arrived in Madrid with a 10-12 record on clay after a difficult experience last year, where he frequently competed well against top opposition yet finished 2-6 against the top 100.“Professionally with the ATP I haven’t played loads on it, but when I was younger, whether it was in the UK or abroad, playing European events, I always did well on the clay,” he said. “I always thought I was a player who could play well on all surfaces.”“I guess it’s a bit different at this level. Last year I took a few tough losses against top players when I was unseeded. Then this year, it’s just been about trying to stay fit, but also trying to show that I feel good on this surface. In training I felt great, and I just want to keep going, and I think this surface could be amazing for my tennis.”View image in fullscreenJack Draper stretches for a return during his impressive win over Tommy Paul.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APThis week in Madrid had already seen positive progress. Draper set the tone with an excellent performance against a quality opponent, completely overwhelming Tallon Griekspoor with his relentless aggression. He also looked solid in his third round match against an ailing Matteo Berrettini, who retired with an abdominal injury after losing the first set 7-6 (2).As Draper and Paul stepped out on to Manolo Santana Stadium in cool, windy conditions, it was Paul who started cold, struggling badly to control his forehand, which sprayed four unforced errors as he conceded an early break. Although Draper was hardly at his best early on – his first serve percentage stood at 33% as he served for the first set at 5-2 – his movement and defence were excellent, narrowing the court against Paul, and as he suffocated the American with the weight and depth of his wicked topspin forehand, which spun up to the height of Paul’s shoulder and constantly pinned him behind the baseline.With the first set secured, Draper relaxed, found greater rhythm on his serve and dominated the baseline with his nuclear forehand as he closed out an excellent victory.In the women’s draw the fourth seed, Coco Gauff, set up a rematch of the 2022 French Open final against Iga Swiatek after defeating Mirra Andreeva, the seventh seed, 7-5, 6-1. Swiatek, the No 2 seed and defending champion, avenged herAustralian Open semi-final defeatagainst the eventual champion, Madison Keys, recovering to win 0-6, 6-3, 6-2.Novak Djokovic has reacted to his run of poor form by pulling out of the Italian Open in Rome next week. The 24-times grand slam champion is on a three-match losing streak, havingcrashed out of the Madrid Openagainst Arnaldi.Tournament organisers announced on social media that Djokovic would not be playing in the Italian capital, with the Serb writing on Instagram: “Rome, I will miss you. I hope we meet next year.”View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic said he had to adapt to a ‘new reality’ after the 37-year-old’s defeat by Matteo Arnaldi in Madrid.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APAfter defeat by Arnaldi, the 37-year-old Djokovic said he had to adapt to a “new reality”, adding: “Trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament – it’s a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis.”The Italian Open, which begins on 7 May, is the last big ATP Tour event before theFrench Open, and is a tournament Djokovic has won six times. But he faces arriving at Roland Garros without having won a match on clay since his emotional victory over Carlos Alcaraz last summer in the Olympic final.Djokovic has played a fuller schedule than last season, when his bid for a record-breaking 25th slam title fell short, but it hasnot helped him find any consistent form, with the world No 5 losing his opening match in four of his past five tournaments.“Grand slams is where I really want to play the best tennis,” he said. “I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do that in Roland Garros but I’ll do my best. I’m not going into Roland Garros as one of the main favourites. Maybe that can help, I don’t know, we’ll see.”Explore more on these topicsJack DraperNovak DjokovicTennisFrench Open 2025French OpennewsShareReuse this content"

O’Sullivan will meet the Chinese sensation Zhao Xintong in what promises to be a mouthwatering clash.Trump reeled off five straight frames after starting the final session of a high-octane contest at 8-8 to complete a 13-8 win over fellow former champion Brecel. In doing so he made two more centuries that took his total number of hundred breaks for the season to 104, equalling then surpassing Neil Robertson’s 11-year-old record as he sealed his semi-final spot in style.Trump insisted: “I don’t really care about that record. I was just happy to make the breaks at the important times, no matter what they were. It was just about digging in and putting him under pressure.”Looking ahead to the semi-finals he said: “Mark came through an absolute epic. It was a great advert for snooker. Mark has been in quite a few classics at the Crucible, and it just shows the hunger and determination of the Class of 92.”View image in fullscreenRonnie O’Sullivan was made to battle before sealing a 13-9 win against Si Jiahui (right).Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAO’Sullivan, the seven-time champion, twice saw his 22-year-old opponent pull back to within two frames, but held his nerve and a break to black of 76 confirmed his 14th appearance in the Crucible’s last four.Si, a shock semi-finalist on his debut two years ago, showed few signs of repeating that form in the early stages and O’Sullivan was barely forced to break sweat as he took the first frame of the second session to ease into a 7-2 lead.O’Sullivan, playing his first tournament since he dumped his cue in a bin after crashing out of the Championship League in January, had impressed in patches in his wins over Ali Carter and Pang Junxu, and Si did not appear to be the man to test his limits.O’Sullivan, Higgins and Williams stand strong as Class of 92 battle onRead moreHowever, after starting the final session four frames adrift at 10-6, Si’s fluency showed signs of returning, and with O’Sullivan’s game becoming increasingly scattered with errors, the underdog won three from four to reach the interval just two behind at 11-9.Si had a big chance to make it 11-10 but missed a yellow and a vintage run of 36 from O’Sullivan took him one frame away from victory.Still playing fluently, Si got in first in the 22nd frame and fashioned a 43-point lead, before a miss on the brown served up a chance which O’Sullivan seized to confirm his clash against rising star Zhao.Williamsheld off a superb fightback from his fellow former winnerJohn Higginsto triumph in a last-frame decider and reach his eighth World Championship semi-final at the Crucible. The veteran duo, who have won seven world titles between them, were locked at 8-8 at the end of their second session before Williams put himself on the verge by taking all four frames on Wednesday’s resumption.But Higgins, four times the ­champion, though, dug in after the mid-session interval with breaks of 94, 114 and 67 to force a decider, which ­Williams took after his ­opponent missed a tense blue on the top ­cushion to seal a 13-12 victory.View image in fullscreenMark Williams came through an epic quarter-final before beating John Higgins 13-12. He now faces Judd Trump.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersWilliams, who had trailed 5-1 ­earlier in the match, made the most of some unforced errors from ­Higgins to edge in front and then extend his lead to 10-8. A couple of half-century breaks from the Welshman, who claimed the last of his three world titles in 2018, meant he was seemingly closing in on victory at 12-8 heading into the interval.However, Higgins clawed a frame back before firing in 94 to move within two. Williams then gave away a careless foul after touching the blue with his trailing arm when he was leaning over to pot a long red with the rest.Higgins made the most of the opportunity, digging in again to build a fine 114 break. The Scot missed a frame-ball red along the bottom cushion after a break of 67 in the next but was still able to force a final-frame shootout.With both men running out of position when looking set, the deciding frame turned into a safety battle before Higgins caught the bump on the ­middle pocket, which allowed ­Williams in to edge in front 56-52.Higgins sunk a red with the rest after Williams missed a tricky long red, then rolled the brown in on the top cushion only to miss the blue. Williams clipped it in before ­finishing off the pink and black to seal a dramatic 74-69 victory.Williams told the BBC: “I was drained this morning. Two tough sessions, I didn’t finish until half 10. It’s top out there, especially the older you get. You play all day, the next day you play in the morning. It’s just a pleasure playing now. We got the standing ovation walking in and everyone was cheering. You have to enjoy it because you don’t know how many times I’ll be coming back here.”Zhaoduly picked up the one frame he required to turn a 12-4 overnight advantage overChris Wakelininto a 13-5 victory that sealed his place in the semi-finals for the first time. Zhao, playing as an amateur after returning from a 20-month ban for his part in amatch-fixing scandal, had to come through four rounds of qualifying to reach the final stages at the Crucible and has had little trouble in reaching the last four, where he will play O’Sullivan.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipJudd TrumpRonnie O'SullivanJohn HigginsSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

With United in 14th and certain to finish in their lowest position in the Premier League, it would also give Amorim a trophy after taking over in late October. However, the Portuguese is clear it would not make the campaign a success.Bournemouth’s Evanilson reprieved over Manchester United VAR red cardRead more“Everybody knows it’s really important for our season [but] we know nothing is going to save our season,” he said. “This can be huge, winning a trophy, getting in the Champions League to play European [elite level] games next year: [it] could change a lot of things in our clubin the summer. [But] it’s not the most important thing.“Of course people are going to look in a different way for this season, especially at the coach. But it’s something more in the core of our club [that requires addressing]. We need to change a lot of things and need to be consistent.Europa Leaguewill not change our problems – it’s going to give us Champions League next year, more money to spend, but the problems are still there.“We have to change the minds of our fans with consistency, good decisions, good recruitment, good academy. This is what we need to change to take our club back to the top. This [winning the Europa League] is more of a shortcut to go to the European Cup games. Nothing more. The problems we need to solve in a different way with more time and we’re really clear on that.”Amorim was asked about the view that if United win the Europa League and qualify for the Champions League while finishing so low it would devalue the second-tier continental competition. “Maybe you can say it’s not fair because the best teams, the champions, should be in the Champions League,” the 40-year-old said. “It’s the rules, I don’t know if it’s fair or not but if there is that possibility we have to try and reach it.”Amorim has previously stated that his players often feel nervous, particularly at home. But despite next week’s second leg being at Old Trafford, and the tie’s high stakes, he is not concerned. “They are prepared,” Amorim said. “Every player is an international. The context of this season is really complicated in every aspect. I don’t see it as an issue. They are excited to be here and they are capable of winning.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although Spurs have reached this stage of the Europa League for the first time since they won its predecessor, the Uefa Cup, in 1984, they have beaten only Southampton in the Premier League since the end of February and are on course for their lowest finish since its formation in 1992.Liverpool surge to Premier League title after emphatic 5-1 win against SpursRead moreMaddison acknowledged that performances – including the5-1 hammering at Anfield on Sunday– had not been good enough but he believes Tottenham’s players have the hunger to make up for it by triumphing in Europe.“It hurts me a lot that we’re having a poor season,” said the England midfielder. “But this is why we’re so motivated for this competition, because the season can still be so special. People talk all the time about Tottenham being without silverware for however many years, but we’re in the last four and we’ve got a great opportunity in a competition we’ve been pretty solid in this year. We want to reward them because we feel the support.”Maddison added: “At the end of games and you’ve lost again, you go over and you want to thank them for the support and I know they don’t want to hear it from us. Even this press conference and the interview on Sunday, they’re not really that bothered because words are just words. But it hurts and we’re trying to put it right.“That’s the main thing, that hunger is there. It doesn’t always work how you want it to, but this is a unique situation that we’re in, in the last four in Europe, when we can go and reward them for their support because they do travel everywhere. We are very grateful for that. Even in the league position we’re in and we’ve got nothing to play for, they’re still selling out Liverpool away.”Tottenham will again be without Son Heung-min, although the captain has returned to light training after a foot injury and could be in contention for next week’s second leg. That will take place on an artificial surface at Bodø’s Aspmyra Stadion – located in the Arctic Circle and with a capacity of just over 8,000. The Norwegian champions overcame the league stage winners, Lazio, in the last round via a penalty shootout and have a strong record at home under Kjetil Knutsen, winning six of their seven European matches there this season. Postecoglou knows all about the likely threat they pose having lost both legs of a Conference League playoff with Celtic in 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The incident was firstreported by the Guardian.“No, don’t go there,” Redknapp said. “Oh my God, it was a joke, you know, that badly backfired. But it was only a joke.”During the event in London, Redknapp was asked whether it was right for the FA to appoint Tuchel as the third foreign manager of the England men’s team, after Sven-Göran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.“I don’t know,” Redknapp said before making comments designed to amuse his audience. “I’ll be honest with you, I think he’s a German spy. I’m telling you. Seriously, he’s been sent over to fuck us up. He has. I’m telling ya, he’s like Lord Haw-Haw in the war – ‘We have your best soldiers captured’ and all that.”He went on to imagine an instruction to Tuchel – “‘Go over and ruin that team” – before mimicking a German accent, saying “Ja” and lifting his left arm in what appeared to be a Nazi salute.Redknapp never made a secret of his desire to take the England job and was favourite for the role whenCapello stepped down in 2012, only forthe FA to appoint Roy Hodgson. In his latest interview Redknapp bemoaned the absence of English candidates toreplace Gareth Southgate last year, with Newcastle’s Howe a clear exception.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eddie would have been perfect but he’s got a great job at Newcastle as well. In this particular time, we needed to look for a foreign manager and Tuchel was available. And he’s got a very good track record.”Al Arabiya is owned and funded by Saudi Arabia, host of the 2034 World Cup. Asked for his thoughts on the tournament, Redknapp said:“It’s going to be fantastic. Safe. Great atmosphere. People just come and have a great time. So as long as they behave themselves, which is what everybody should do anyway.

There is a 15% chance of an earthquake greater than 8.0 magnitude on the fault in the next 50 years, the study states.“The expansion of the coastal floodplain following a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake has not been previously quantified, and the impacts to land use could significantly increase the timeline to recovery,” said Tina Dura, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of geosciences at Virginia Tech,tolda university publication.While climate-driven sea level rise happens gradually, these changes would unfold in an instant and persist over decades to centuries, Dura and the study’s other authors write. The most significant impacts would occur in “densely populated” parts of southern Washington, northern Oregon and northernCalifornia. And if the next major earthquake took place in 2100 – there is a 29% chance of one greater than 8.0 magnitude by then – with climate-driven sea level rise, some “low-lying” areas along the fault might never recover, according to the study.Elephants at San Diego zoo form ‘alert circle’ to protect young during quakeRead moreThe authors wrote that they hoped the findings could support decision-makers and coastal communities better prepare for hazards caused by an earthquake and climate-driven sea-level rise.“Preparing for these compound hazards can minimize long-term damage, ensure resilient communities, and protect critical coastal ecosystems from permanent degradation,” the authors wrote.The last great earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone took place in 1700 and brought sudden sea level rise of more than six feet in minutes and generated a huge tsunami that destroyed seaside settlements and created effects seen as far as Japan.Recent research suggests that a 9.0 magnitude quake on the Cascadia subduction zone could lead to more than 30,000 deaths, 170,000 damaged or destroyed structures on the coast, and economic impacts of more than $81bn. A 2022studyfound that a tsunami caused by a major earthquake could exceed 200ft high.Explore more on these topicsEarthquakesWest CoastCanadaAmericasTsunamisNatural disastersCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

Much of India andPakistanis already sweltering in heatwave conditions, in what scientists say is fast becoming the “new normal”.Temperatures in the region typically climb through May, peaking in June before the monsoon brings relief. But this year, the heat has come early. “As far as Asia and the Indian subcontinent are concerned, there was a quick transition from a short window of spring conditions to summer-like heat,” said GP Sharma, the meteorology president of Skymet, India’s leading private forecaster.South Asia, home to 1.9 billion people, is particularly vulnerable. Many live in areas highly exposed to extreme heat and lack access to basic cooling, healthcare or water.In Delhi, where spring usually offers a short spell of mild temperatures, thermometers have risen past 40C in April – “up to 5C above the seasonal average” – according to a report by ClimaMeter, a platform that tracks extreme weather events.“Human-driven climate change” is to blame for the “dangerous” kind of heat seen in recent weeks, it said.“These spring heatwaves are not anomalies. They’re signals. We need to move beyond awareness into action,” said Gianmarco Mengaldo, a climate expert at the National University of Singapore and co-author of the report.Delhi authorities urged schools to cancel afternoon assemblies on Tuesday and issued emergency guidelines to ensure water breaks and stocks of oral rehydration salts in first aid kits, and to treat any signs of heat stress immediately.View image in fullscreenDelhi commuters on their way to work on an unusually hot April day.Photograph: Harish Tyagi/EPATemperatures in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, hit 44C, triggering heatstroke reports among construction workers and farmers. Other states are also grappling with intense heat.The Indian Meteorological Department has reported an “above-normal number of heatwave days”. Temperatures are expected to climb steadily across the subcontinent, with the highest readings forecast for Wednesday and Thursday.Pakistan is also reeling. In the city of Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh province, the mercury has soared to 50C – nearly 8.5C above the April average. In other parts of the country, temperatures have hovered in the high 40s.“What was once considered rare has become alarmingly common, as climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of such events,” said an editorial in the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. The country “remains woefully unprepared for the escalating climate crisis”, it said.Urban heat is making things worse. Data comparing 1950–1986 with 1987–2023 shows that cities such as Delhi and Islamabad are now up to 3C hotter on average than nearby rural areas.View image in fullscreenChildren cool off in water from a leaking pipeline in Hyderabad, Pakistan.Photograph: Akram Shahid/AFP/Getty Images“When it comes to heatwaves, the question is no longer if they are linked to climate change, but what kind of thresholds we are reaching,” said Mengaldo. “Preparedness is essential. But right now, our infrastructure is not well adapted.”Natural climate variability such as the El Niño cycle can affect regional weather, but it is now in a neutral phase.ClimaMeter said: “Compared to pre-1986 levels, similar meteorological conditions now produce temperatures up to 4C higher – almost entirely due to human-driven climate change.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSouth Asia is not alone. “In the northern hemisphere spring months, we are already seeing conditions in parts of the Middle East that are incompatible with human life,” said Mengaldo.“This is very serious for the populations … we also expect summer temperatures in Spain and France to reach unprecedented levels in the next few years,” he said. “Many of the events predicted for 2050 or 2070 are already happening. We underestimated the speed of change. What we’re seeing now is an acceleration – a failure of our predictive models.”David Faranda, a senior climate scientist with the French National Centre for Scientific Research and co-author of the report, said: “The only sustainable solution is to stop burning fossil fuels and reduce emissions. Without drastically reducing emissions and building climate resilience through better insulation, use of green energy, and other moves, the implications are alarming.”“Even if we act now, the climate system will take decades – sometimes over a century – to cool down,” Mengaldo added. “The sea level rise is already locked in for hundreds of years.”Both researchers stressed economic inequality and infrastructure played a critical role in determining who survives extreme heat. “There are different temperature thresholds – actual temperature, [humidity index] and others,” said Mengaldo. “Economic levels play a huge role in how people can cope and sustain themselves.”Delhi has updated its heat action plan, focusing on vulnerable groups such as elderly people, construction workers, and street vendors. But implementation is inconsistent.Faranda said adaptation was increasingly unaffordable for many heat-prone countries, with electricity grids buckling and causing widespread power cuts. “When multiple events occur, there’s often no escape,” he said.Mengaldo highlighted the need for innovation: “We need better-insulated housing, materials that prevent energy loss, and architectural designs that promote natural cooling. These can significantly reduce energy demand during extreme heat.”Faranda also said people must change their lifestyles. “Energy demand keeps increasing. If we want to survive the coming decades, we must not only build more renewables but also reduce energy consumption overall: through lifestyle changes, efficient architecture, and better materials.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisExtreme heatSouth and central AsiaExtreme weatherIndiaPakistannewsShareReuse this content"

There have been months of behind-the-scenes wrangling between the IOPC and the Met, which opposes the decision. In the end, the police watchdog used its legal powers to direct that a hearing be held.Blake has been promoted to inspectorsince his unanimous acquittal in about three hours by an Old Bailey jury, and returned to work after a two-year suspension.The IOPC case will allege Blake should not have opened fire, given all the circumstances, and so the firing of a single shot amounted to excessive force.Blake’s trial heard that in September 2022 in southLondonpolice stopped the Audi Kaba was driving not knowing who the driver was, only that it could be linked to a shooting the night before.The Audi was forced to stop and was then surrounded by armed officers, who burst out from three police cars and tried to pull the suspect out.Blake, who was in a police car that blocked the Audi from the front, said he opened fire fearing Kaba would pull an officer under his car’s wheels or run them over, as he tried to escape “at any cost” after being blocked in.The officer said Kaba’s car was being used as a weapon and he had fired in self-defence and to protect his colleagues, with his primary aim being to “incapacitate” the driver, who was hunched low over the steering wheel.The prosecution at the criminal trial said the Audi was blocked within seconds and could not have escaped nor run over officers at the point Blake fired a shot. The prosecution accepted that Kaba made “concerted” efforts to escape, but his Audi’s top speed during the standoff was 12mph.Fears of armed officers in London walking out if Blake had been found guilty of murder were so acute, advanced plans were devised by the government to send troops on to the streets to fill their roles.The IOPC said it had reviewed its original decision that Blake should face a discipline hearing, and decided he should.The police watchdog said the test for a discipline hearing was lower than for a criminal trial and added: “The guidance is also clear that where the case-to-answer test is met, there must be compelling reasons not to direct misconduct proceedings.”The IOPC director Amanda Rowe said: “We understand the impact this decision will have on Chris Kaba’s family and Sgt Blake and acknowledge the significant public interest in this case, particularly among our Black communities, firearms officers and the wider policing community.“The legal test for deciding whether there is a case to answer is low: is there sufficient evidence upon which, on the balance of probabilities, a disciplinary panel could make a finding of misconduct? This has been met and therefore we need to follow the legal process.”The Met said it would get a chief officer from another police force to chair the hearing, and made clear its continued opposition and concerns for the continuing stress and burden on Blake, whom it refers to by the cypher NX121.Assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said: “NX121 made a split-second decision on what he believed was necessary to protect his colleagues and London.“We know another lengthy process will fall heavily on the shoulders of NX121 and more widely our firearms officers, who continue to bravely and tirelessly police the streets of London every day to protect the public.“Now is not the time for debate and discussion about this case. It is important that we do not risk prejudicing NX121’s right to an impartial hearing.”Kaba’s family accused the Met of exacerbating their pain: “What Martyn Blake did was deeply wrong. We are still so devastated to have lost Chris – this should never have happened.“The fact that the Met promoted Martyn Blake after the verdict only deepened our pain and showed a complete disregard for our loss. Martyn Blake should not be allowed to remain a police officer. He should lose his job.”A date for an inquest into Kaba’s death is yet to be set. A government reviewis considering plans to make it more difficult to prosecute officers,with police claiming that too often they are being put through the ordeal of criminal trials or discipline hearings simply for doing their duty.Matt Cane, general secretary of the Met Police Federation, said: “This is frankly a nonsensical ruling by the IOPC that will shock police officers across London and indeed the country.“Police officers should not have their livelihoods or liberty put at risk for performing what unequivocally, as has been found in a court of law, is their lawful and appropriate function.“This is not accountability. This is not in the public interest. This is not right or fair or just.We will be vigorously defending the actions of Sgt Blake at any conduct proceedings.”Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policeLondonPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

They don’t want to advertise to prospective parents that they might have a problem with relationship violence. But the point is, this is everywhere.”Research by the YEF found nearly a third of teachers taking RSHE classes said they had never received any training, while more than a quarter said they were not confident teaching children how to leave an unhealthy relationship. Almost half said they struggled to explain how to intervene if children witness a sexual assault.Lucy Emmerson, the chief executive of theSex Education Forum, said its research found that only 50% of young people said their RSHE lessons were good or very good, despite recent improvements in the curriculum.“We’re finding that some topics like puberty are covered really well, young people say it’s done really well, and to some extent topics like consent. But topics like pornography and power imbalances in relationships, these are the kind of topics that young people very often say are inadequately covered or not covered at all,” Emmerson said.“That’s often where parents say it’s different from what they encountered as a child – they might remember their sex education being quite technical, quite focused on puberty and biology and not so much on ‘what does it feel like?’ ‘How do I manage my feelings?’ ‘How do I deal with rejection? ‘How can I understand what’s going on here?’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the difficulty remained in getting the training and investment needed for teachers.“To do those so-called trickier topics really well, teachers need to be confident in this subject area, they need to be able to hold high-quality and open discussions with pupils and not just fact-based teaching around it,” Emmerson said.“Children and young people benefit hugely from the skills of listening to each other, to empathise, to respect each other and to negotiate and understand their emotions and express them. It’s not just learning some facts, it’s learning how to behave and respond.”Explore more on these topicsRelationships and sex educationSchoolsTeachingSecondary schoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

One driver is the overuse of antibiotics, with greater exposure to drugs offering bacteria more chances to learn how to evade them.But a focus on overuse has meant access has been neglected, the experts warn.Thestudy, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, is the first to quantify the treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries. It was led by the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GardP).Researchers focused on Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, India, Kenya, Mexico, Pakistan and South Africa, and used modelling data on the number of cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections, which are drug-resistant and on the rise. They then looked at sales data for eight types of antibiotic that could be used as treatment.Across the eight countries, there were an estimated 1.5m CRGN infections and almost 480,000 deaths in 2019. Just under 104,000 courses of antibiotics active against CRGNs were procured.Appropriate antibiotics were available in only 6.9% of cases on average – ranging from 0.2% in Kenya to 14.9% in Mexico and Egypt.Cohn, GardP’s global access director, said it was a pattern likely to be repeated in other poorer nations.The infections in the study included pneumonias, bloodstream infections and complicated urinary tract infections.The “No 1 thing” the lack of drugs did was to drive morbidity and mortality, Cohn stressed, but it could also drive AMR. Trying other, ineffective antibiotics, was likely to mean a longer duration of antibiotic use –linked in studiesto increases in resistant bacteria. Killing drug-resistant bacteria with the correct treatment would stop them spreading.There were many factors behind the treatment gap, she said. Sick people may not make it to a hospital for diagnosis, or those who do may not be able to afford treatments.“We are focusing introduction of newer antibiotics in the US and in a few countries in Europe. That’s not where the burden is,” she said.“We are really trying to change the narrative to say we can’t just focus on stewardship, surveillance and containment in low- and middle-income communities, while we’re focused on just innovation in high-income countries. We actually have to focus on both all at once, in all places.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even in well-resourced healthcare systems it could be hard to diagnose and treat bacterial infections. “Access is important everywhere. No matter how you slice it, there is a big access gap.”Prof Alison Holmes of the University of Liverpool, who leads the global Centres for Antimicrobial Optimisation Network, said the study “should prompt immediate action”.She said: “If these critical gaps in access and care are not urgently addressed, the burden of antimicrobial resistance will continue to rise, leading to more preventable deaths, worsening patient outcomes and an already devastating global health crisis becoming even more inequitable.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentDrug resistanceDrugsGlobal healthAntibioticsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

There had to be a full demilitarisation process similar to the one that occurred after the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland, he said.But Lammy said: “It is unacceptable for any group of people to have lived with no state for longer than I’ve been alive.”He accepted that the accelerating pace of settlement expansion was undermining the viability of two states, and said settlement violence levels were “shocking”.In the last year, he said, 59 outposts on the West Bank had been built, whereas the average over the previous 25 years was seven.The latest speculation about the long saga of recognition started whenEmmanuel Macronreturned from a trip to Egypt on 9 April and said France would probably recognise a Palestinian state at the June conference. It would be the first recognition of Palestine by a G7 member state.A few days later, Macron clarified that the move would be intended to “trigger a series of other recognitions … including the recognition ofIsraelby states that do not currently do so”, remarks that could provide France with a get-out if no momentum towards recognition emerges.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, subsequently rang Macron to tell him that recognising Palestine as a state would be a victory for Hamas and Iran.Donald Trump is due to visit Saudi Arabia this month, where he is certain to be told by Riyadh that Saudi normalisation with Israel, one of Trump’s signature diplomatic themes, is impossible without a credible pathway to a two-state solution.Michel Duclos, a special adviser to Institut Montaigne, a Paris-based thinktank, argued French political credibility was at stake in its handling of the issue.He said that since the best outcome from the June conference at the UN “may be nothing more than a roadmap or set of proposals, the dilemma for France may soon become more challenging: can it continue postponing its recognition of Palestine while waiting for a true two-state momentum? Or would further postponement undermine its credibility?”Lammy showed his frustration with the Israeli leadership’s 60-day ban on aid into Gaza but he proposed no new measures. “The blockade of necessary aid into Gaza is horrendous, the suffering is dire, the need is huge, the loss of life is extreme,” he said.He said he had been clear in person to the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, about Israel’s obligations to provide aid when the two menmet in Londona fortnight ago.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyDavid LammyPalestinian territoriesIsraelFranceEmmanuel MacronSaudi ArabianewsShareReuse this content"

The watchdog is working on a more detailed code of practice that it aims to hand to the government by June for ministerial approval.Barclays is one of the first companies to announce a change to its bathroom policy after the court decision, as organisations review their approach to comply with the ruling.Britain’s first transgender judge, Victoria McCloud, has said she willtake the UK to the European court of human rightsover the supreme court ruling.

Individuals at Blu-3 are suspected of paying more than £3m in bribes to the people linked to Mace Group.More than 70 investigators searched four homes and one commercial property in London, Kent, Surrey and Somerset on Wednesday morning, the SFO said. Authorities in Monaco simultaneously searched a suspect’s premises with help from the UK.Three people were arrested for questioning, and evidence was seized for further examination. Microsoft is not under investigation.Blu-3, founded in 2004, helps to manage large construction projects. It has helped Mace in the construction of the Shard in London, the UK’s tallest building, and was involved in the regeneration of London’s Battersea power station and the Chelsea Barracks. It has also worked on the HS2 railway project, for Transport for London and for the struggling Thames Water.More recently, Blu-3 has focused on datacentres, amid a boom in demand for buildings to house the computer servers on which internet and artificial intelligence companies rely. It made revenues of nearly £100m in the year to March 2024, and said it had a “strong pipeline of work for 2025”, according to accounts published before the arrests.Blu-3 first entered the datacentre market in the Netherlands in 2014. Its website refers to a “large-scale datacentre project on behalf of a blue chip software company” managed by Mace in Middenmeer, north Holland.Mace Group, which employs more than 7,400 people, made revenues of £2.4bn in 2023. The UK-headquartered company has worked on a wide range of projects, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and the Tate Modern gallery extension.The SFO hasfaced scrutiny over the length of its investigations, as well as other troubles such as the £250m cost of an investigation into Kazakh mining company Eurasian Natural Resources Corporationthat resulted in no charges.Nick Ephgrave, the director of the SFO, said: “Paying bribes to do business undermines our financial markets, the reputation of British companies and the rule of law and will not be tolerated. Today’s action is a reminder that we will take rapid and robust action to tackle suspected bribery and corruption wherever it appears – at home and overseas.”The solicitor general and Labour MP, Lucy Rigby, attended one of the arrests in north London this morning.A Mace spokesperson said: “Mace has a zero tolerance approach to breaches of our code of ethics and takes any allegations of bribery extremely seriously. We are committed to fully supporting the Serious Fraud Office in investigating allegations against any former associates of the group.”Blu-3 and Microsoft were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSerious Fraud OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

All studies were part of aninternational consortium of women’s health studies.The authors noted that among participants they could not differentiate between subtypes and stages of endometriosis or determine whether women received surgical excision or ablation removal of endometrioma – cysts which can impact the number of eggs.Women who had hysterectomies with preservations of their ovarian function were excluded from the analysis, so hysterectomies would not explain the earlier natural menopause observed in the study.The study found current management guidelines for endometriosis primarily focuses on pain, infertility and treatment.Menopausewas only mentioned in the context of treatment of endometriosis in postmenopausal women.Chung said she hoped the evidence would improve endometriosis management guidelines, including prevention and strategies for early or medically induced menopause, which has beenrelated to adverse outcomes including osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.“Women with endometriosis should be aware that they may be at increased risk of early or induced menopause,” Chung said, adding these women should visit their GP regularly to check for chronic disease risk factors and prevention strategies.Dr Gino Pecoraro, the president of the National Association of Specialist Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said he was not surprised by the results.“I would expect them to show exactly that or even higher rates of surgical menopause for people suffering badly with endometriosis,” Pecoraro said. “It’s a hormone-responsive condition. It leads to debilitating pain and heavy, painful periods.” Pecoraro was not involved in the study.Surviving breast cancer was enough – Patsy didn’t want to undergo early menopause as wellRead moreIn a significant proportion of cases, endometriomas or “chocolate cysts” – and the process of having them removed – often leads to early natural menopause, he said.Pecoraro said if a gynaecologist takes out the ovaries in a younger woman, they should follow up treating her for symptoms of menopause, such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness and irritability. That included monitoring a woman’s bones and to make sure her lipids (organic compounds) are elevated.A variety of modern treatments for menopausal symptoms do not make endometriosis grow and are non-hormonal, he said, and fertility-sparing surgeries are also available.Pecoraro said women going through the menopause transition – even if on medication for symptoms – should see their doctor at least every one to two years.Explore more on these topicsEndometriosisMenopauseHealth (Australia news)Women's healthHealth (Society)MenstruationnewsShareReuse this content"

The time it takes varies by platform,” she added.Castledine cited the example of the“week of action”against finfluencers undertaken by the FCA last October, during which20 influencers were interviewed under cautionby the FCA, and 38 alerts were issued against social media accounts operated by influencers that may contain unlawful promotions.“Meta took six weeks to act on those requests from the date the warning was issued and the takedown request was submitted,” she said. “Other platforms were more responsive.”Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Treasury select committee, confirmed for the record that Castledine nodded in agreement when asked if she felt the big tech companies could do better.“We know algorithms are driving content to consumers,” Castledine said. “We are talking about some of the biggest tech platforms in the world here. I’d like to see them using that tech to identify [scam content]. At the moment they are being very reactive.”The FCA said it received 25,000 reports of “unauthorised business” relating to online scams last year, and a growing trend among younger 19- to 40-year-olds looking for a “quick way to make money” being scammed.Castledine said that one major problem was that the FCA could only issue takedown notices one account at a time, while scammers engage in “lifeboating” – creating multiple, similar email accounts so they can reappear online almost immediately.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It binds to a protein called PD-1 (programmed death-1) on T-cells, a type of immune cell. This blocks cancer cells from switching off T-cells, allowing the immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells.NHS England said about 1,200 patients a month could benefit from moving to the jab, and that most new patients would be likely to receive it.The injections will not cost the NHS more than for the intravenous infusion, after NHS England and the manufacturer Bristol Myers Squibb negotiated a price agreement.Naser Turabi, the director of evidence and implementation atCancerResearch UK, said: “Innovations like this will be vital for treating cancer patients sooner and more efficiently. We’re in a golden age of cancer research, and it’s essential that our health service continues to adapt to deliver the best possible care for patients.“The government has the opportunity to build on this with the upcoming national cancer plan for England, which must provide investment and reform for the NHS in order to get more cutting-edge treatments and technologies to patients as quickly as possible.”Explore more on these topicsCancerNHSHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He was later involved with the scouts and amateur radio clubs in the Midlands.During his trial, Burrows admitted being a paedophile but denied the more serious allegations, describing them as “degrading and disgusting”.In one email found by police, the former scout leader wrote that he had spent three decades “living in paradise” while on the run in Thailand.He was eventually tracked down in 2023 by officers who used specialist facial recognition software to locate him in Chalong, Phuket.He had been charged with a number of historical sex offences and was bailed but failed to attend a plea hearing at Chester Crown Court in December 1997.Detectives found that Burrows had been living under the name Peter Smith, a terminally ill acquaintance whose identity he had stolen in order to obtain a bogus passport and flee the country while on police bail in 1997.Attempts to locate him included several police appeals and four Crimewatch appeals on national television.Detective Inspector Eleanor Atkinson, who led the Cheshire constabulary investigation, praised the bravery and courage of the victims and said: “Burrows is a coward, he knew he was guilty in 1997, but rather than face the consequences of his actions, he fled the country after fraudulently obtaining a passport using the identity of an unwell man.“He spent the last 27 years, in his own words, ‘living in paradise’. It is clear that he did not spare a thought for his victims, who were trying to live their lives under the shadow of the abuse they had suffered.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeScouts and scoutingChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

BE PATIENT!!!”Democrats argued the figures were a damning verdict on the new administration’s handling of the economy. Senator Jeff Merkley said: “Trump has been in office for only 100 days, and costs, chaos and corruption are already on the rise. The economy is slowing, prices are going up, and middle-class families are feeling the pinch.”Trump 100 days: tariffs, egg prices, Ice arrests and approval rating – in chartsRead moreGross domestic product (GDP), a key measure of theUS economy, contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, down from growth of 2.4% in the last quarter of 2024. The contraction – the first since the start of 2022 – puts the US on the brink of a technical recession, defined by two quarters of negative growth.The drop in activity comes amid a huge fall inconsumer sentiment, which in April dropped 32% to its lowest level since the 1990 recession.US stocks dropped on Wednesday morning. By the end of the day, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones had eked out small gains while the Nasdaq had dropped marginally.On the eve of Wednesday’s GDP report, Trump claimed at a rally in Michigan that he had built “the greatest economy in the history of our country” during his first presidency, which ended in 2021, adding: “We did great, and we’re doing better now.”Responding promptly to data suggesting otherwise on Wednesday, Trump tried to argue his predecessor was responsible.“I didn’t take over until January 20th,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden ‘Overhang.’”Trump spent much of the first quarter threatening, and fleetingly implementing, sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and targeting China with higher duties on its exports.Days into the second quarter, which was not covered by today’s GDP reading, he ordered even higher tariffs on goods from much of the world, beforepulling back the tariffs on all countries but China. As it stands, Trump is charging a 10% universal tariff on imported goods from much of the world, along with a 145% tariff on imports from China.bar chart showing GDP figures from last quarter of 2020 to first quarter of 2025Seemingly responding to deep fluctuations in the US stock market, Trump has shelved a wave of so-called “reciprocal tariffs” of up to 49% on specific countries, which he halted for 90 days.He offered some relief to US automakers, who were facing a 25% tariff on all auto imports on Tuesday, signing an executive order that would allow them to receive a credit if they import auto parts but assemble the cars in the US.Last week, stocks rallied on news that Trumpsaidhis tariffs of at least 145% against China – which already has exemptions for some electronics – will be reduced “substantially” as the White House negotiates a deal with Beijing, though he said that the tariff would not be eliminated completely. China has placed a 125% retaliatory tariff on American goods.Some economists are pointing out that the decline in GDP over the last few months is largely due to the oversized amount of imports that American businesses purchased in anticipation of Trump’s tariffs. When calculating GDP, imports are subtracted to account for the amount of consumption that is not from domestic production.While the International Monetary Fund hasdowngraded its forecasts for US growth this yearbecause of tariffs, some economists said the plunge in imports the border taxes will cause from April could mean GDP rebounds in the second quarter, sparing Trump a recession for now.Elon Muskalso played a role in the first quarter contraction. A 5.1% fall in federal spending also complicated the data, as the billionaire presidential adviser’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) made huge cuts to the executive branch. And consumption slowed from 4% to 1.8%, amid severe weather and a drop in non-profit spending after election donations stopped.New data released on Wednesday highlighted how new tariffs appear to be significantly slowing trade. In China, factory activity slowed in April, withBeijing blaming“sharp changes” in the global economy as US tariffs pounded exports. Exports from the Chinese e-commerce companies Temu and Shein to the US haveplunged65%, while exports to the EU rose by 28%. Meanwhile, the British sports carmaker Aston Martin said that it wouldlimit exportsto the US in the midst of Trump’s tariffs.Also on Wednesday, the payroll firm ADP said that payrolls in the private sector went up by just 62,000 in April, the smallest gain since July – an ominous sign ahead of Friday’s release of official employment data for April, often used by economists to gauge the health of the labor market.Stock markets rise as Trump backtracks on high China tariffs and firing Fed chairRead moreWhile the White House has said in recent weeks that Trump’s tariffs are meant to be a negotiating tactic, leaders around the world have said they will retaliate if Trump continues to try to bully them into negotiations.“If one chooses to remain silent, compromise and cower, it will only make the bully want to push his luck more,”saidthe Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, on Monday.Trump has been sensitive to criticism of his tariffs and the impact they are having on the economy. At one point over the last month, Trump threatened to remove Jerome Powell from his role as chair of the US Federal Reserve after Powell said that Trump’s tariffscould lead topermanent price hikes.After markets fell, Trump eventuallybacked down, telling reporters that he had “no intention” of firing Powell.Explore more on these topicsUS economyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

But he has denied the prosecution’s accusation that he was the organiser or ringleader of the jewel heist in the early hours of 3 October 2016, which was thebiggest robbery of an individual in France in 20 years.The robbers, dressed as police officers, escaped with up to an estimated $10m (£7.5m) in jewellery, including a 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring given to Kardashian by her then husband, the rapperKanye West, estimated to be worth $4m.Kim Kardashian robbery suspects appear in Paris court as trial beginsRead moreAït Khedache is part of a group five men aged over 60 who allegedly went to Kardashian’sParishotel by bike or on foot for the hold-up, and who French media have nicknamed “the grandpa robbers”. Like several other accused men, he has serious health problems. He is deaf and cannot speak, so he read the court’s questions on a typed transcript, writing his answers with a pen and paper, projected on to a screen.The court heard that Aït Khedache, who ran restaurants inFranceand Spain, had served several prison sentences for robbery from the 1970s.The lead judge, referring to Aït Khedache’s past convictions, asked him why he turned to crime. He replied that he did not know, saying it was largely due to keeping bad company. Asked by the judge whether he was driven by a taste for easy money, Aït Khedache wrote: “Not particularly, but that too.”View image in fullscreenAomar Aït Khedache, left, is among 10 people who are on trial for stealing millions of dollars worth of jewellery from Kim Kardashian.Photograph: Pierre Suu/Getty ImagesThe court heard that at the time of the jewel heist, Aït Khedache was already a wanted man, living under a stolen identity in order to escape prison for a drug-trafficking conviction from 2010.A total of 10 people, aged from 35 to 78, are on trial over their alleged part in the Kardashian robbery. Eight deny involvement.One of the accused is Aït Khedache’s eldest son, Harminy, who is alleged to have been a getaway driver. Harminy Aït Khedache, who had previously worked as an Uber driver, has denied involvement in the robbery. He told police he had been asked by his father to collect him one night in Paris, something he often did, and that he knew nothing of the heist.The court heard that Aomar Aït Khedache was born in Algeria and arrived in France as a young child. He and his nine siblings were “paralysed by fear” of their violent father.The older Aït Khedache was convicted for robbery for the first time 1977, and while he was in prison for 10 months, his pregnant wife died in a fire. Aït Khedache had a psychiatric breakdown over her death and received electric shock therapy, which he said caused the start of his hearing problems. Later he met a woman with a young baby, Harminy. He married her, adopted Harminy, and had another son, Haris.Harminy Aït Khedache, in his early 40s, broke down in tears in court on Tuesday. He said he had found out from a relative when he was aged six that Aomar wasn’t his biological father but had been scared of asking his parents for details for fear of upsetting them. He said he considered Aomar his father and had always wanted to please him. He told the judge that, in general: “I wanted to show that I’m devoted to him.”Haris Aït-Khedache, 39, a bus driver, was called as a character witness for his father. He said of his father’s role in the robbery: “He made a mistake. He found himself in a situation where he didn’t have the choice, I think.” He said his father had said that the victims “must have been traumatised” and that he “regrets the repercussions of this”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsKim KardashianParisFranceEuropeTelevisionReality TVnewsShareReuse this content"

The officers were never prosecuted and are all now dead.The families criticised Ramaphosa’s decision that an inquiry should assess their claims for “constitutional damages” – their high court case asked for 167m rand (£7.3m) to fund further investigations and litigation, as well as memorials and public education – and said that their rights were violated.They said in astatementthat an inquiry would have no authority over these areas and would only be able to offer advice. “This fundamental shortcoming was pointed out to the president’s legal team, as well as the fact that it will likely result in the issues remaining unresolved for years. This will perpetuate the pain and trauma that the families and survivors have experienced for many years.”South Africa’s governments have been led by the African National Congress party of Nelson Mandela since the end of apartheid over 30 years ago.In March, Thabo Mbeki, who was president from 1999 to 2008, and the former justice minister Brigitte Mabandla applied to intervene in the families’ high court case.

Renewables work in a stable way.”Sánchez himself has been blunter. “Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear power are frankly lying or demonstrating their ignorance,” he said on Tuesday, adding that nuclear power generation was no more resilient than other electricity sources.Sánchezsummoned the headsof Spain’s private energy operators – including Corredor and representatives from Iberdrola, Endesa, EDP, Acciona Energía and Naturgy – to an urgent meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss the blackout. The prime minister has said the committee will be looking into the role of private energy companies and urged them to help the government get to the bottom of the blackout as soon as possible.Aagesen said some of the operators had already provided huge amounts of data, with the rest of the information expected over the next few days.“As soon as we know what caused this event, we’ll put all necessary measures on the table so that it doesn’t happen again,” she said.The investigations are focusing on what happened at 12.33pm on Monday, when, for five seconds, 15 gigawatts of the energy that was being produced – equivalent to 60% of all the energy that was being used – suddenly disappeared.Spain aims to generate 81% of its electricity from renewables by the end of the decade. Last year, a record 56% of its electricity came from renewable sources.Explore more on these topicsSpainPortugalEuropeRenewable energynewsShareReuse this content"

We have so many pieces of evidence that prove his innocence, but nothing is accepted.”According to Iran’s state news agency IRNA, Langarneshin was a “senior spy” for the Mossad who provided critical “technical support” for the assassination of Hassan Sayyad Khodaei, a colonel in the Revolutionary Guards who was shot five times by gunmen on a motorbike outside his home in Tehran, as well as for other alleged operations.The IRNA report said the Mossad recruited Langarneshin in 2020 and that he met with Israeli intelligence officers in Georgia and Nepal. He was arrested in July 2023.Activists fear that Iran scapegoats innocent people after failing to catch the actual agents, who have often escaped overseas by the time investigators identify them.Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of the Norway-based Iran Human Rights monitor, said: “Mohsen Langarneshin, who was sentenced to death in an unfair judicial process based on confessions obtained under torture and charged with espionage for Israel, was hanged at dawn today.”“The Iranian authorities’ execution machine is accelerating every day, taking the lives of more people,” he added, describing the executions as “extrajudicial killings”.At least 335 people have been hanged in Iran so far this year alone, campaigners say. Iranexecuted more than 900 peoplein 2024. A man was executed in December 2023 after he was found guilty of collaborating with the Mossad. Four others were hanged a year earlier over alleged ties to Israel.The US-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, which had campaigned over Langarneshin’s case, said he had been convicted at a revolutionary court presided over by a judge, Abolghasem Salavati, who has been put under US and EU sanctions and is notorious for handing out death sentences.“He denied all charges, stating that his confessions were extracted under torture,” the group said.The revolutionary courts were set up after the 1979 revolution and deliver often summary justice in closed hearings.Israel and Iran have been engaged in a shadow war of assassinations and bombings for decades. A series of attacks attributed to the Mossad has targeted Iranian scientists, experts and academics, many connected to Iran’s nuclear programme. Last year, Israel is thought to have killed Ismail Haniyeh, the most senior political leader of Hamas, with a bomb in a bedroom of a government guesthouse in TehranIn Israel, a 72-year-old manwas sentenced on Tuesdayto 10 years in prison accused of discussing plots with Iranian intelligence services to assassinate senior government officials, including the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.The US president, Donald Trump, isseeking a new deal with the Iranian leadershipon its nuclear programme, with both Israel and its ally the US long refusing to rule out a military strike on Iran.The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said on Wednesday that Iran expected the next round of negotiations with the US to be held in Rome on Saturday, adding that Iran also anticipated having a meeting on Friday with France, Germany and the UK to discuss the talks.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaThe MossadnewsShareReuse this content"

The ban applies to all agencies, but in October the Knesset voted to end all cooperation with Unrwa specifically, bringing its operations to a halt.Last week, Donald Trump said he had personally urged Benjamin Netanyahu to allow aid into Gaza, but Israel has said the ban would continue until all hostages held by Hamas are released. Trump said he told Israel’s prime minister: “We have got to be good to Gaza.”In December, the UN general assembly asked the ICJ to give an advisory opinion on Israel’s obligations as an occupying power to provide humanitarian aid, and whether the ban on cooperation and contact with Unrwa breaches its privileges and immunities as a UN body.Simmons insisted in his alloted half-hour presentation that the US did want to see aid enter Gaza, but denied there was any unqualified legal obligation for Israel to allow this, either as the occupying power or as a UN member state.He argued that an “expansive” ruling by the ICJ setting out Israel’s obligations and any remedies would be damaging to the credibility of international law.“Novel legal interpretations will not bring an end to the ongoing conflict. They will not bring the hostages home. They will not create a better tomorrow for Israelis, Palestinians and the region,” he said.“To be clear, the United States supports the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, with the safeguards to ensure it is not looted or misused by terrorist groups. We encourage the international community to focus on advancing a ceasefire and on fresh thinking for a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.”He said the only issues to be addressed were whether Israel was obliged under the law of occupation to cooperate with a third party such as Unrwa to provide aid, and whether Israel had been directed to supply aid by the UN security council.View image in fullscreenThe 13 judges at the start of Wednesday’s proceedings in The Hague.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesArguing that the court had heard little about Israel’s legitimate security fears regarding Unwra, he added: “You have heard concerns about Israel’s decision to cease engagement with Unrwa. You have heard little, however, about the serious, credible concerns about Hamas misusing Unrwa facilities and humanitarian assistance. You have also heard little of Israel’s security needs after the terrorist attacks on 7 October, 2023. These security needs persist today.”He said the evidence provided ample grounds for Israel to be concerned, and argued that nothing in the Geneva convention placed unqualified obligations on an occupying power to provide aid.“An occupying power has obligations related to maintaining public order and safety and protecting the civilian population. It also has the right, while an occupier, to pursue its military objectives and govern enemy territory,” he said. “The occupying power does not lose its right to ensure its own security.”He added that Israel has no obligation to permit Unrwa specifically to provide humanitarian assistance. “Unrwa is not the only option,” he said. “In sum, there is no legal requirement that an occupying power permit a specific third state or international organisation to conduct activities in occupied territory that would compromise its security interests.”He also questioned the right of the UN general assembly – representing all member states, as opposed to the 15-strong UN security council – to place any obligation on Israel to cooperate with Unrwa.“The general assembly does not have the power to impose a perpetual obligation to cooperate with Unrwa,” he said. “There should be no finding either as to compliance with any obligations identified in this proceeding, or as to the legal consequences of any alleged breach.”Israel, in its written submission to the court, argued that the ICJ does not have the necessary investigative tools to determine the competing claims, and that there is no full obligation on Israel to provide aid.It claimed that the case “is part of an abusive and systematic campaign that regrettably weaponises international law, and international legal institutions, with the aim of depriving Israel of fundamental rights accorded to all sovereign states, including the right to defend itself.”It added: “The obligations on a state under humanitarian international law are not unqualified and include the obligation of a state in acting to defend its existence, its territory and its people. Israel is fully committed to complying with international law, but that law is not a suicide pact.”Israel submitted written but not oral evidence to the court by a 28 February deadline, before the total ban came into effect.The ICJ’s newly elected president, Yuji Iwasawa, a Japanese judge and professor of international law, is sitting with 12 other judges in the five-day proceedings.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warInternational court of justiceUnited NationsIsraelPalestinian territoriesGazaAidShareReuse this content"

The result exceeded analyst predictions that revenue would grow to $68.42bn, or 10.6% year-over-year, and that earnings-per-share would come in at $3.22.Shares in the tech giant jumped more than 5% in after-hours trading.Microsoft says everyone will be a boss in the future – of AI employeesRead moreAnalysts viewed the earnings report as a temperature check on Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) business, which has announced it will invest around $80bn in this fiscal year alone, though it has alsoterminated some data center leases in recent months. The company has invested billions in OpenAI in recent years, giving it a large stake in the ChatGPT developer.“Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth,” Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement.All in on AIMicrosoft’s heavy bets on AI, which extend to deals with companies beyondOpenAI, has led to Microsoft and its investors being reliant on the technology’s success and widespread adoption. Microsoft has, meanwhile, framed its investments in AI as putting it at the forefront of a world-changing technology it claims is crucial to the future of American industry.“Not since the invention of electricity has the United States had the opportunity it has today to harness new technology to invigorate the nation’s economy,” president Brad Smith claimed in aJanuary blogpost. “In many ways, artificial intelligence is the electricity of our age.”Microsoft executives have also been heavily touting an AI-driven future in recent appearances. Satya Nadellaclaimed earlier this weekthat 20% to 30% of the company’s code was written by AI, although did not give specifics on how that number was calculated. Chief technology officer Kevin Scott, meanwhile,predicted on a podcastthis month that 95% of code would be AI-generated within the next five years.Last quarter, Microsoft reported a 12% increase in revenue and touted growth in its AI business – which it reported saw an increase of 175% year over year.Investors have also been keeping an eye on how Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service is performing after afall in revenuelast quarter. The company has been seeking to expand Azure throughout Europe, with Smith also promising Microsoftwill expand its European data centersby 40% over the next two years.Revenue for Azure in particular exceeded analyst expectations, growing 33% year over year. Nadella touted the performance of the company’s cloud services during the earnings call, stating that Microsoft was growing the market and building data centers to meet demand.“When it comes to cloud migrations, we saw accelerating demand with customers in every industry, from Abercrombie & Fitch to Coca-Cola,” Nadella said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tesla, the world’s most valuable automaker, also released its worse-than-expected earnings last week, which revealed the company had suffered a 71% loss in profits compared with the previous year amid a backlash against Elon Musk.While other tech giants such as Apple and Amazon are exposed to heavy financial risks related to the Trump administration’s erratic tariff policies, Microsoft has been relatively insulated, given that its products and services are less dependent on trade.Shares in Microsoft have fallen around 7% overall since January, a downturn in part caused by wider economic instability as well as China-based developers closing the gap in AI.

That effigy reappeared months later, holding an LGBTQ flag on a Kurdish activists’ float at Stockholm’s Pride parade.According to the indictment, which Medin said he had not seen, the offending images were used to illustrate several of his articles that he had posted online.Addressing the court via video link from Silivri prison, Medin said he had not been inSwedenat the time of January rally.Although he posted links to articles he had written about Sweden’s Nato accession – which was initially blocked byTurkey– he said he was not responsible for the photo selection.“I was not at this event, I was in Germany for work. I didn’t know about plans for his event, and I didn’t share any photo or video about it on social media,” Medin told the court via video link.“I did not insult the president. I was assigned to write the article. The photo was selected by editors, I was just doing my job,” he said, asking to be released so he could return to his wife, who is seven months pregnant with their first child.His lawyer, Veysel Ok, urged the court to acquit him.“Medin has no motivation to knowingly and willingly insult the president. The Nato process was vital for Sweden because a Russian attack was on the agenda; my client reported on this process,” Ok told the court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the Grand National tour, a four-month stadium circuit for the Grammy-sweeping album GNX and SZA’s reissue album Lana, Lamar takes the music industry’s most bitter rivalry match into overtime.Beyoncé review – ever-evolving star kicks off electrifying Cowboy Carter tourRead moreThe score-keeping has not stopped. The Grand National tour’s opening date in Minneapolis last week totaled more than $9m from more than 47,000 spectators, giving Lamar claim to the highest-grossing hip-hop concert of all time – surpassing the record Eminem set after playing Melbourne, Australia, in 2019. That’s what you get when you pair the hottest rapper in the game with an R&B queen who is coming off the critical and commercial success of the buddy comedyOne of Them Days, SZA’s film acting debut.Tuesday’s date at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium was yet another cross-cultural moment that drew 45,000 spectators on the same night Pearl Jam was playing across the street at State Farm Arena – a traffic twofer reminiscent of the spring 2023 weekend when Janet Jackson and Taylor Swift helddueling midtown concerts.“Jesus is more important thanKendrick Lamaror Eddie Vedder,” one curbside evangelist shouted along the boulevard between the two show venues – but his message was lost on a crowd that was too busy adding to the city’s legendary gridlock.There was some sense that even Lamar knew to expect a few thousand late arrivals given how the show kicked off. After an opening DJ set by Mustard, the Marquis de Lafayette in Lamar’s rap war with Drake, the lights went back up for 30 minutes as the speakers blared quiet storm classics from Anita Baker and Luther Vandross – GNX album inspirations whostoked feud rumorsin their heyday. But the enthusiasm and marijuana smoke thickened again when Lamar rose up on to stage in his now-trademark black Buick GNX and set the tone for a multimedia cavalcade that was more of a gapers block than a groove.View image in fullscreenSZA performing on stage.Photograph: Cassidy MeyersWhile Lamar rapped the first few bars of wacced out murals from inside the car, a giant backdrop screen showed him inset from the inside against an animated graffiti that echoed the tributes that Lamar makes in the song. The car and the screen were critical storytelling vehicles for a concert where conflict is a prevailing theme. Even Lamar andSZAare stylistically at odds.Where he represents the cold and unforgiving concrete jungle (and Los Angeles more specifically), SZA is at home in nature among the caterpillars and praying mantises – which her dancers personified, Katy Perry-style, for SZA’s performance of Garden. For most of the three-hour show, the big-screen treats Lamar and SZA with extreme prejudice – flattening the color in Lamar’s flared slacks and red tee to black and white while accentuating all the hues for SZA’s lush set pieces.But early on in the show, the figurative wall between the two artists comes crumbling down on screen during SZA’s performance of The Weekend, revealing an orange-glowing wood – an unmissable nod to the recent LA wildfires. For her mid-show performance of Garden, SZA mounts a giant ant called Anthony while her dancers and backing orchestra are covered in vines and moss. The act crescendoes with her taking to the air in butterfly wings and a cocoon-shaped ballgown (that drops dramatically on to the stage floor) and “flying” into the twilight to Nobody Gets Me – her first time this year touring the song, about her ex-fiance. In an aside to the crowd, it wasn’t immediately clear whether it was her ex or her team that told her “to stop performing the song”. Either way, she didn’t “give a fuck. It’s about y’all.”But the conflict that ultimately wins out is the one between Lamar and Drake. At various points between act breaks, the big screen played snippets of Lamar sitting for a deposition – a direct shot at Drake’s recent efforts to respond to their ongoing rap beef through legal channels. Initially, an (off-screen) counsel asks Lamar if allusions to violence were just him “being metaphorical” or whether they should be taken as a threat. (“Take it how you want,” was Kdot’s response.) In another deposition scene, Lamar is asked if his disappearing acts between albums are “just another form of attention-seeking”, which is how Drake has framed his dynamic with Lamar. Even SZA gets in on the legal back-and-forth, pushing back when the off-camera lawyer mispronounces her name and accuses her of seeking out dysfunctional relationships for their creative potential.Not surprisingly, Lamar brings the house down with Not Like Us (before closing the show with Luther, his current chart-topper with SZA). And while the a-minorsingalong and other Drake callouts hit as hard as ever, it was a bit of a disappointment to see the crowd not connect with the song’s painstaking references toAtlanta. (Lamar dedicates a whole verse to the city’s history while exposing Drake as a culture vulture.) What’s more, Lamar’s political strokes struggled for urgency without Donald Trump and a worldwide Super Bowl audience to play against.While this show will no doubt go down as another victory for Lamar against the erstwhile biggest name in rap, it was still hard to come away from the night without thinking that Drake may have had a point when he suggested that Lamar’s oeuvre doesn’t easily convert to concert fare. Take Not Like Us and Be Humble off the 50-plus set list, and the “big numbers” – the ones that get the crowd holding their hearts and swaying and recalling those moments years later – are all SZA’s. In the end it takes two to take Drake down, but Lamar still gets the last shot.Explore more on these topicsKendrick LamarSZAHip-hopRapAtlantaR&Blive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Could it still thrill me 19 years later?When Bethesda surprise-released a remake last week, I revisited its world with my son to see if the magic was still thereKeza MacDonaldWed 30 Apr 2025 10.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 10.02 EDTShareFor a 10-day period the summer of 2006, in between handing in my resignation at my first job on a games magazine and returning to Scotland to start university, I did almost nothing except eat, sleep and playThe Elder ScrollsIV: Oblivion on my Xbox 360. I hauled my TV from the living room of my small, unpleasantly warm flatshare into my bedroom so I could play uninterrupted; it was all I could think about. My character was a Khajiit thief, a kind of manky lion in black-leather armour with excellent pickpocketing skills. One afternoon, I decided to see whether I could steal every single object in the smallish town of Bravil, and got caught by the guards a couple of hours in. I did a runner, dropping a trail of random plates, cheese wheels and doublets in my wake, and the guards pursued me all the way to the other side of the map, where they finally got entangled with a bear who helpfully killed them for me.I bet a lot of you will have had a similar experience with a Bethesda game – if not Oblivion, then Skyrim or perhaps Fallout 3. There’s something intoxicating about these role-playing games, the way they lay out their worlds for you like a buffet, inviting you to gorge. Go where you like! Learn some weird spells and try them out on bandits! Nip into a cave to fight a necromancer and end up getting ambushed by vampires! Open-world games such as this are exhaustingly common now but Oblivion was the first one I ever played. Lately I’ve been devouring it all again, after Bethesda surprise-released a remake last Friday.I say it was a surprise. In fact, the Oblivion remake/remaster has been one of the games industry’s worst-kept secrets for months, just behind the Switch 2. Nonetheless, I am thrilled about it. Oblivion has, over two decades, become at least as famous for its technical weirdness and amusing glitches as for its pioneering design, and I was relieved to find Bethesda has not tried very hard to fix it. Characters still get stuck in walls, repeating their asinine lines of dialogue. The facial animations are still off. The game crashed on me two minutes into Patrick Stewart’s opening lines as the soon-to-be-murdered emperor of Cyrodiil, and I have twice fallen through the world into the endless void beneath. Weird stuff happens all the time, and it’s rarely intentional. They’ve even preserved aninfamous voice-acting blooper. It is a perfect time capsule of 00s accidental gaming comedy, and I wouldn’t change it for the world.View image in fullscreenA game of choice with no consequence … The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.Photograph: Bethesda Game StudiosI remembered Cyrodiil as enormous and picturesque, full of gently glowing magical ruins and rivers that caught the light in just the right way. By 2025 standards, though, it is weeny, perhaps the size of the opening section of any current game’s gigantic map. (I’m thinking particularly of Avowed, therecent Elder Scrolls-alikefrom fellow Microsoft studio Obsidian.) The imposing-looking Imperial City at the centre is a village of tiny interconnected districts with around 30 people in it. I don’t know how I managed to spend more than 100 hours in such a relatively small space as a teenager, but as I rode around last weekend I found, unexpectedly, that I still knew it intimately. I’d meet a new character and remember details of some quest I hadn’t thought about for years, or ride around a corner on my armoured horse and know exactly where I was from the view.In Oblivion, your character develops according to what you do with them. You don’t meaningfully have to choose between magic, stealth and strength; pick up a greatsword and start using it and your heavy-weapons stat will start increasing. (The trick back in the day was to crouch into a sneak position, use a rubber band to pull the controller’s analogue sticks together, and spin around in circles until your stealth stat hit maximum.) This is part of what makes it feel like a buffet: you can become a master thief, run the mages’ guildandbe a combat arena champion all at once. It is a game of choice with no consequence, beguilingly frictionless and generous. A small world that revolves entirely around you.I have a theory that the Bethesda RPG spell only really works once. You get one life-consuming experience with an Elder Scrolls, and then whatever you play next feels like a repeat; I played Skyrim and Fallout 3 for ages but never finished either. It turns out Oblivion is stillmygame; I can lose myself in it for hours where newer, more sophisticated open-world games start to get on my nerves. I still hate the Oblivion Gates, portals to a generic hellscape where you have to spend a tedious 20 minutes fighting demons in towers with flaming corpses hanging from the ceilings; their vibe is very 00s metal album art. But the beauty of a game like this is that you can effectively ignore the entire plot and fool around as you please.The Oblivion remaster illustrates that old games don’t always need fixing. It looks different, but it’s got the same soul. I imagine my teenage self would say the same about me.What to playView image in fullscreenOne of the best puzzle games I’ve ever played … Blue Prince.Photograph: Dogubomb/Raw FuryIf you haven’t yet playedBlue Prince, stop whatever you’re doing anddownload it now. You are the teenage heir to a giant mansion, with one catch: if you want to keep it, you must find its secret 46th room. Also, every time you go to sleep, the mansion resets, so your route through it will be different every day, drafting each room from a random selection of blueprints, occasionally finding a chamber you’ve never seen before.I spent 40 hours playing through this with my eldest son, who acted asnote-taker, and it is up there with the best puzzle games I’ve ever played. Even after you’ve found Room 46, there are deeper mysteries to probe at; a couple of people I know have truly gone off the deep end with it. Its sedate pace and intellectual challenge were both ideally suited to playing during a period of convalescence.

I thought the interactive medium reallyenhanced its emotions and themes. Can its story still have the same impact in a passive medium? On that note, what great video game narratives do you think absolutely cannot be adapted into a movieor a TV series?”I have just watched the third episode of the second season ofThe Last of Us, and it’s clear that they’re diverging more from the game’s plot this time than they did in season one. They kind of had to, because as you point out, the game’s impact largely comes down to playing it from both points of view, which won’t necessarily work on TV. That said, the first game also owed a lot of its emotional heft to the fact that you, Joel, were the one doing terrible things, whether you as a player agreed with him or not. The TV series couldn’t pull those same levers, so it expanded The Last of Us by showing new perspectives, going into deeper detail on things that wouldn’t have been practical or fun to play through; I’m thinking particularly of that wonderful episode about Bill and Frank, which would never have worked in a game. This is the art of the adaptation: finding something fresh to offer.On that basis: there is no great video game narrative thatcouldn’tbe adapted for film or TV by a sufficiently talented and understanding writer. The key word there is adapted, not transliterated – because a film or show has to offer a new interpretation or perspective. That said, there are plenty of games whose plots are simply toobadto ever make for a good TV show or film. It’d take a true visionary to get anything worth watching out of, say, Heavy Rain.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterRole playing gamesThe Elder ScrollsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mike Peters, who has died aged 66 from blood cancer, was a tireless and inspiring frontman and songwriter for the group, always ready to expound the virtues of faith, belief and perseverance.The group’s concert performances were ecstatic communal celebrations between band and audience, especially in songs such as the anthemicBlaze of Gloryor the Clash-like air-puncherSixty Eight Guns(1983). At MTV’s Spirit of ’86 concert, the Alarm played to 25,000 fans at UCLA in California in a performance beamed live around the world by satellite.However, the group’s crowd-pulling appeal never quite translated into massive record sales, with Sixty Eight Guns giving them their highest-charting single in the UK, reaching No 17 in 1983. Their debut album, Declaration (1984), on which Sixty Eight Guns featured, reached No 6 on the UK chart (and 50 in the US). Subsequent album releases Strength (1985), Eye of the Hurricane (1987) and Change (1989) all reached the UK Top 30. Strength also gave them their highest US chart position when it reached No 39, while the album’s title track reached 12 on the US Mainstream Rock chart. In 1987 they scored a No 6 hit on the same chart with the electronica-flavoured Rain in the Summertime, and reached No 2 the following year with Sold Me Down the River.View image in fullscreenThe Alarm came to embody an almost evangelical belief in the power of rock’n’roll.Photograph: Jules Peters/PAWhat would become the Alarm began in 1977 as the Rhyl-based punk band the Toilets, inspired by Peters seeing the Sex Pistols perform. The band name evolved into Seventeen, then Alarm Alarm, and finally the Alarm, the line-up comprising Peters alongside guitarist Dave Sharp, bass player Eddie Macdonald and drummer Nigel Twist, and they played their debut gig at the Victoria hotel, Prestatyn, on 6 June 1981. In September that year they moved to London.They acquired a manager, U2’s agent Ian Wilson, which earned the Alarm a support slot with U2 at the Lyceum in December 1981. The next year they signed with I.R.S. records and played further shows with U2, with Bono also joining the Alarm on stage. The two groups shared a Celtic heritage as well as religious faith, with Peters’s Christian beliefs reflected in lyrics of songs such as The Stand or Shout to the Devil.In 1983 the Alarm went to the US supporting U2 on their War tour, a visit that successfully launched them in the States. The following year they supported the Pretenders on their stateside Learning to Crawl tour, and in 1986 they supported Queen at two Wembley Stadium concerts. In 1988 they toured the US and Canada supporting Bob Dylan.The Alarm split up in 1991 after Peters announced his departure following a gig at Brixton Academy in south London, though the group would be revived in the new millennium. In 1995 he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The following year he had made a recovery and was able to tour and record again, but in 2005 was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.Two years later, Peters founded the cancer charityLove Hope Strength Foundationwith an American businessman, James Chippendale, and with assistance from his wife, Jules Jones. In one of many bold endeavours, in October 2007 he trekked to the Mount Everest base camp and performed with musicians including Glenn Tilbrook of Squeeze and Slim Jim Phantom from the Stray Cats, to raise money and awareness.Born in Prestatyn in Denbighshire, Mike grew up in Rhyl. His childhood friend Kevin Davies described how they both attended Christchurch primary school and played in the football team: “Mike lived at the Crescent public house on Edward Henry Street. My family owned The Crescent Egg Packing Station … and we used to play footie in the yard and Subbuteo in one of the buildings.” Some of these recollections would feature in the lyrics of Peters’s song Edward Henry Street (2003).Mike met Jules in 1986, when back in Rhyl after touring with Queen. Mike said: “I was back home and kept bumping into her – but whenever I did it was like electricity. I needed another fix.” They became engaged a week later, and married in 1988.After leaving the band, Peters released his first solo album, Breathe, in 1995. It was the first of a string of frequently live and acoustic releases including new material as well as songs from all stages of his career. On Rise (1998) he experimented with drum machines and various studio effects. In 1999 he formed Coloursound with Billy Duffy from the Cult, and they recorded an eponymous studio album.In 2001 he toured with Dead Men Walking, a British supergroup consisting of fellow veterans Pete Wylie from Wah!, the former Sex Pistol Glen Matlock, Kirk Brandon from Spear of Destiny and Captain Sensible from the Damned. From 2011 for two years, Peters was lead vocalist of the Scottish band Big Country (their original frontman,Stuart Adamson, died in 2001), and appeared on their album The Journey.Peters also revived the Alarm name, although he recruited new musicians to replace the original band members, including members of Stiff Little Fingers, the Cult and the Sisters of Mercy, and Jules on keyboards. He would record 16 new Alarm albums between 2002 and 2023, under the band name the Alarm MM++, using Roman numerals to indicate album release dates. In 2004, they had notched up a Top 30 hit with 45RPM, a blast of punk energy that they released under the pseudonym the Poppy Fields. Peters assumed they would be written off as has-beens if it had been released by the Alarm. He explained: “I’m 44 but I’m writing new songs as fresh and as vibrant as anything I’ve ever done. In Britain … if you’re over 35 you’re dismissed as over the hill.”Sara Sugarman’s 2012 film Vinyl was based on the story of Peters and the Alarm, and starred Phil Daniels as Johnny Jones, an old punk-rocker trying to make a comeback. In 2017 BBC OneWalesaired the film Mike and Jules: While We Still Have Time, which documented each of their experiences with cancer.After several years in remission, in 2024 Peters was found to have developed Richter’s syndrome (an aggressive form of lymphoma).He is survived by Jules and their sons, Dylan and Evan.Michael Leslie Peters, musician, singer and songwriter, born 25 February 1959; died 29 April 2025Explore more on these topicsPop and rockPunkCancerWalesobituariesShareReuse this content"

The books are among the most popular children’s titles in the world, with The Gruffalo having sold 3.2m copies to date, and The Gruffalo’s Child 2.1m copies.The new story “sees the return of much-loved characters in a fresh and exciting adventure that has all the hallmarks of a Julia Donaldson andAxel Schefflerclassic,” according to the book’s publisher Macmillan.“It’s always a challenge to write a sequel,” Donaldson said. “I actually had the basic idea for the story a long time ago, but couldn’t think how to develop it.”It was only when the charity National Literacy Trust (NLT) used the first two books as part of one of its campaigns last year that the writer was “spurred on to get my idea out of the cupboard and see once and for all if I could turn it into a really satisfying story,” she said. “To my surprise, I managed to do just that! I was of course delighted when Axel came on board, and am even more so now that I’ve seen the brilliant sketches he’s already done for the new book.”How Julia Donaldson conquered the world, one rhyme at a timeRead moreScheffler said: “Never say never – a lesson learned for me who, whenever asked, denied the possibility of another visit to the deep dark wood. Till one day out of the blue there came a wonderfully clever and inspired new text by Julia. How does she do this? Could I decline? Of course not!”The German illustrator and British writer’s first collaboration was a picture book about an unhappy elderly lady who brings a group of farmyard animals into her small home, A Squash and a Squeeze, published in 1993. Since then, Scheffler and Donaldson have published more than 30 books together, the most famous being the Gruffalo titles.The original Gruffalo story is written in rhyming couplets and follows a mouse walking through a wood where he comes across a number of predators before finally meeting the large and terrifying Gruffalo. It was inspired by a Chinese folk tale called The Fox that Borrows the Terror of a Tiger, about a child who cons a jungle tiger into submission.“I intended the book to be about a tiger, but I just couldn’t get anything to rhyme with ‘tiger’,” Donaldsontold the Observer in 2004. “But then I came up with ‘Silly old fox, doesn’t he know / there’s no such thing as a blank-blank-oh.’ Then I began with ‘Grrrr’, which I hoped would sound quite scary. Then all I needed was a word of three syllables, ending in ‘oh’. Somehow, ‘Gruffalo’ came to mind.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

As all around me institutions fall and norms fail, I feel the moment requires audacious re-imaginings of history or possibilities of thought, and on both a political and imaginative level, Enrigue delivers with his wild telling of the meeting between Hernán Cortés and Moctezuma.I’d be remiss not to shout out the Australian essayist Vivian Blaxell’s sharp and amusingly tart new collectionWorthy of the Event. These essays span years – the book seems to contain a whole library of experience.Lastly, my entire relationship to plants has been altered, rather shockingly, by having readThe Light Eatersby Zoë Schlanger, which explores the possibility of plant intelligence, plant behaviour and even plant consciousness.

I’ve also been enjoying Barbara Kingsolver’sProdigal Summer. I’m constantly amazed at Kingsolver’s ability to get inside characters, and her capacity to communicate the natural world (in this case entomology). She’s an extraordinary writer.Sinéad Campbell, Guardian writerI picked up a copy ofBrianby Jeremy Cooper recently on a whim. I was drawn in by the novel’s central location, the BFI Southbank, as it’s a cinema I frequently visit. Beginning in the late 1980s, the novel follows the titular character Brian, a recluse who works for Camden council, as he finds solace, community and escapism from the humdrum and isolation of his daily life, inside the dark walls and bright screens of the cinema.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I’m no film-buff (at least not by Brian’s standards) and the narrator’s sprawling thoughts on postwar, Japanese arthouse films for the most part flew over my head. But Cooper’s novel is a sweet and at times devastating portrait of how fulfilment can be found through a quaint, esoteric passion.The book also acts as a critique of the way cinema-going has declined as we have entered a joyless age of streaming. Reading it was a much-needed reminder for me to ditch the laptop viewing and head to my local cinema instead.Diana, Guardian readerLately I have readLooking at Women, Looking at Warby Victoria Amelina andOnce the DeedIs Doneby Rachel Seiffert. Both books are utterly gripping. Although the latter is fiction, it is based on fact and Amelina’s book, though fact, seems like fiction from time to time. Sobering but essential reading, these books shock but also bring hope. They both tell of people’s innate courage and kindness in the face of deliberate cruelty.Explore more on these topicsBooksWhat we're readingFictionBarbara KingsolverTim WintonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cans can be quickly and easily chilled, with their contents staying fresh; they’re widely recyclable, compact, lightweight and portable; there’s no fear of cans smashing into smithereens; you don’t require any gadgets to open them – and they vastly improve any journey or gathering.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you’re heading to the park for alfresco socialising, no longer are your beverage options limited to just a four-pack of lager or a can of Diet Coke. From craft beers and wine to G&Ts, cocktails and an array of soft drinks, choice isn’t an issue.The problem is sorting the wheat from the chaff. Whether it’s overpriced craft beers or the plethora of sub-par passionfruit martinis, fridges are holding their fair share of poor-quality tinnies. So, to save you from drinking sad cans in the park, I’ve rounded up a selection of the best. When the sun comes out, all you need to do is pack some cans and go.To compile this list, I tested about 40 different drinks in tins, spanning achingly sweet ready-to-drink cocktails, too-funky kombuchas, super-healthy waters and dangerously drinkable seltzers. This list is far from exhaustive, but for now, there should be something for everyone to enjoy.The best tinned cocktails, wines and pre-mixed drinksBest hard seltzer:Stefanoff black cherry hard seltzerView image in fullscreen£1.09 for 330ml at Aldi (in-store only)You can’t move for hard seltzers these days. The clean, crisp carbonated waters spiked with vodka and fruity flavours have struck gold with gen Z and millennials looking for a lighter option. Compared with beer, wine and many premixed cocktails, hard seltzers are low-calorie, low-sugar and often lower in alcohol, while also being naturally gluten-free. I rate this Aldi black cherry version, which is cheaper than the market leader,White Claw, and is just 106 calories per can. Bursting with flavour for bargain summer fun.Best white wine:Villa Maria sauvignon blancView image in fullscreen£3.60 for 200ml at Sainsbury’s£3.75 200ml at MorrisonsAfter-work picky bits in the park call for a reliable favourite to quaff alongside your hummus, olives and posh crisps – and you can’t get much more reliable than a Marlborough sauvignon blanc. Happily, Villa Maria – NZ’s most award-winning brand of wine – has begun canning its tropical-tasting white just in time for the warmer weather. This crowd-pleasing grassy sauvignon blanc with powerful notes of passionfruit and lime zest is an excellent accompaniment to the sun.Best kombucha:Hip Pop strawberry and pineapple kombuchaView image in fullscreen£17.99 for 12 x 330ml at Hip PopLong summer days are better when they’re less hazy, so keep a clear head with this Great Taste Award-winning kombucha, which brings all the positives of fermented fizz – live cultures, real fruit, low calorie – but none of the nasties. So, no unpleasant funk here, or an overt tea character, just lightly sparkling jammy strawberry and pineapple juices with a healthy dose of gut-friendlyBacillus coagulansand some natural cane sugar for sweetness. It’s tasty, so you won’t feel like you’re missing out if you’re skipping alcohol, and the can looks pretty cool.Best nectar:Gosnells raspberry hibiscus nectarView image in fullscreen£32.50 for 12 x 330ml at GosnellsIs it a beer? Is it a cider? No, it’s mead – the ancient alcohol made using fermented honey, which Peckham-based B Corp brewery Gosnells has rebranded as “nectar” to bring it bang up to date. This nectar tastes kind of like a tart berry fruit cider but fresher and purer because of the lack of artificial ingredients, while the signatureHazy Nectaris more in the orchard fruit cider sphere. It’s gluten-free, 110 calories a can, with a 4% volume of alcohol, and each sale benefits theBumblebee Conservation Trust– a nice touch to thank the bees for the honey.Best cocktail:Wonderland Cocktail Co watermelon margaritaView image in fullscreen£3.90 for 125ml at BrewDog£3.90 for 125ml at Sainsbury’sReady-to-drink tinnies have come a long way, with it now possible for you to pick up bar-quality cocktails in a can from the supermarket. Some readers may choose to avoid BrewDog for thenegative associations with its co-founder; but in terms of its drinks, the brand’s spirits are now being used to make 12 top-notch canned cocktails. My favourite is the bar-strength watermelon margarita. Made using BrewDog’s Casa Rayos blanco tequila, watermelon, lime juice and salt, this 14% cocktail is canned heaven. I also like that the can is purposely oversized, leaving space to shake the cocktail before drinking for a superior serve.Best CBD drink:Intune elderflower and hops sparkling CBD drinkView image in fullscreen£6.25 for 4 x 250ml at Ocado£18.75 for 12 x 250ml variety pack at Amazonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Intune is the Great Taste Award-winning result, with 10mg of CBD a can. Made using natural botanicals with vibrant flavours, Intune’s CBD drinks could help ease anxiety, aid relaxation and focus, and are just great to chill in the park with. Alcohol-free, the elderflower & hops is my favourite, but all four fruity flavours are refreshingly tasty.Best red wine:Nice malbecView image in fullscreen£2.60 for 187ml at Sainsbury’s£28.20 for 12 x 187ml at AmazonAs with the white wine on this list, I don’t believe a canned product is where you start to experiment or get creative. Whether it’s for the train, an after-work picnic, or to take along to an outdoor movie screening, you want a wine that does what it says on the tin. For that, you can’t beat a Nice malbec for those deep Argentinian velvety fruit flavours. This is a smooth, no-nonsense pick that can be enjoyed on its own, or with food – barbecue and cheeseboard, anyone? Plus, it’s a B Corp, so a great pick on many levels.The best non-alcoholic prosecco, champagne and sparkling winesRead moreBest functional water:Jamu Wild Water sparkling lemonView image in fullscreen£20.99 for 12 x 250ml at Amazon£26.18 for 12 x 250ml at WelzoOne of the biggest health trends to emerge last year was the boom in functional drinks. From kombucha to CBD, beverages are increasingly being fortified with healthy additions, such as mushrooms, prebiotics and vitamins. This Jamu Wild Water is among the best I’ve tried; it tastes delicious and includes gut and immune health benefits. Thesparkling raspberryis juicy and is just the right level of sweet, with chicory root providing 5g of prebiotic fibre, plus a decent amount of vit C and zinc per can – all for just 18 calories. Theblood orangeoption tastes great, too. Pack it for a day at the beach, or hydration on the hop.Best innovative can:Guinness Draught Nitrosurge cansView image in fullscreen£8.75 for 4 x 558ml at Waitrose£29.99 for 10 x 558ml at AmazonView image in fullscreenNitrosurge device£30 at Amazon£30 at TescoGuinness is one of the UK’s favourite pub beers, but let’s be honest, it hits differently in a can – in a bad way. Even when poured into a glass, it lacks the sitting, the ceremony and the pump of a pub pint. Not so with Nitrosurge. This USB-charged nozzle can be affixed to a chilled can to ensure it pours a slower, smoother pint from a 45-degree angle. It’s creamier, has a more admirable swirl in the pour, and may even taste better. It could be my imagination, but I appreciate the ritual for improved pints in the park.Best sparkling wine:La Gioiosa Rosea fizzView image in fullscreen£3.50 for 200ml at WaitroseLa Gioiosa is among the leading and most reliable brands of prosecco, so to have one of its drinks – although notably, not prosecco – now in a convenient can is good news for party-going fans of a fizzy rose. This Italian sparkling wine is dry, fruity and floral, with plenty of prosecco-esque flavours: apples and light berries abound. It’s perfect for an aperitif or for enjoying with charcuterie, and at a fairly relaxed 10.5%, it’s very quaffable.Joanne Gould is afood, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

After all, I knew about rescue dogs. Cabbage, our lovely collie cross who had died at the beginning of the year, had come from aDogsTrust rescue centre 15 years earlier, and had also been pretty nervous at first. I was confident that Sophie, a one-year-old of indeterminate breed (but with a lot of German shepherd), brought to us on a van from Romania, would, like Cabbage, quickly settle down in her new home. How wrong I was.Our new dog seemed frightened of my wife and I, and our house, and desperately searched for the smallest space she could find, eventually settling behind a sofa. The next morning, I was keen to restart the early dog walks which had been a key feature of my exercise regime since I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2019. But Sophie was going nowhere.Even today, more than two years after she arrived, Sophie remains a nervous creature, scared of crowds and terrified of small childrenWhen we took her into the garden just to get her used to the idea of a walk she crawled under a seat, then dug her heels in when we attached a lead to her collar. For the first six months she spent 90% of her time in her safe place, always hiding there when visitors came to the house. Things only began to improve when our vet prescribed her a drug called fluoxetine, otherwise known as Prozac, but it still took more than a year for us to get her beyond the garden for a walk. Even today, more than two years after she arrived, Sophie remains a nervous creature, scared of crowds and terrified of small children.What I have learned is that you cannot expect a rescue dog, particularly one from abroad, to fit the template of the family pet you have imagined. Going for a walk, for instance, may be something you enjoy but it may be a completely alien concept to a dog.We knew pitifully little about the pet we chose from the website of a UK-based Romanian couple, who were extremely helpful, even offering to take Sophie back, but perhaps a little optimistic in their description of her as a dog who “loves everybody and is just looking for her forever home”.We did know that she was among a litter of puppies found by a vet abandoned by the roadside and then handed to the vet’s father who had kept them in his barn. They appeared not to have been mistreated but knew only the barn and the old man. They had not been socialised.But here’s what is aggravating – two of Sophie’s siblings later came to the UK and settled down far more easily, never showing the same level of anxiety, despite having spent longer in the Romanian barn than their sister. It is very hard to predict how a dog will turn out but you can prepare yourself by spending far more time than we did getting to know the animal. For most people, that will mean meeting the dog beforehand. That will be difficult if you are looking to bring in a pet from overseas, although some dogs are fostered on arrival in the UK, giving them time to acclimatise in the homes of experienced people before being offered for sale.View image in fullscreenLearning to trust … Sophie today.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianSophie – and our wonderful dog behaviourist Si Wooler – have taught me another key lesson. I have never been particularly patient, but despite my initial horror when people told me it could take months, even years, for Sophie to settle, I have learned, as Si puts it, to move at the pace of the dog.That has meant giving some things up. I realised at Christmas that I had not been abroad once in 2024, the first year in decades that my passport had remained in a drawer. And Sophie has made us temporarily antisocial. Since coming out from behind the sofa, she has guarded our front door, barking furiously at anyone who dares come to the house. But in March we had our first dinner party in more than two years. Following the usual slightly panicky “get out of my house” welcome, Sophie came and sniffed them and settled down, while prospecting for the odd crisp.It was a reminder of how far we had come. Sophie may never be what I thought of as a “normal” dog before she arrived but, after all the struggles and setbacks, she is making progress and every day seems to trust us a little bit more. When she first gave me her paw, my heart melted. In the end, there is a simple truth about our rescue dog – she’s beautiful and we love her. That’s all that matters.Sophie From Romania: A Year of Love and Hope with a Rescue Dog by Rory Cellan-Jones is published by Square Peg at £22.

However, the prevalence of microplastics in human organs is cause for concern among researchers. Studies suggest they could increase the risk of various conditions such asoxidative stress or cardiovascular disease.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Stephanie Wright, an environmental toxicologist at Imperial College, London,told the Guardianthat despite a lack of epidemiological and in-human data, “reducing particle exposure in general (including microplastic) is likely to be beneficial”.Animal studies have linked microplastics to fertility issues, various cancers, a disrupted endocrine and immune system, and impaired learning and memory.Read more about how to reduce your exposure to microplasticshere.Do microplastics ever leave your body?It is not known how long microplastics remain in the body before being excreted. But microplastics have been found inhuman poop, meaning that at least some of the plastic ingested is excreted, while some microplastics have accumulated within bodily organs. Studieshave also shownthat microplastics can be passed from pregnant people to the placenta.Are microplastics the same thing asPfas?No. Microplastics are tiny shards and specks of plastics less than 5mm in diameter.Pfas, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, is an umbrella term for a family of thousands of chemicals prized for their indestructible and non-stick properties.Pfas can take hundreds, if not thousands, of years to break down after they are thrown away, and can leak into soil or water and remain there for centuries.But like microplastics, Pfas are ubiquitous and potentially pose health hazards.Read more about Pfashere.Where have microplastics been found?In short: everywhere.People consume the tiny plastic particles infood(includingseafood),water,teaand bybreathing them in.They’ve been found inhuman blood,semen,lungs,breast milk,bone marrow,placenta,testiclesand thebrain.These tiny shards of plastic have been found in air,dust,remoteanddeep ocean environments, inclouds, in theice of Antarcticaand on the summit ofMount Everest.Their spread has prompted researchers to call for further study, and actions to reduce plastic pollution.View image in fullscreenCan microplastics be removed from water?According to one review study, independent testing in many countries found microplastics in virtuallyall drinking water samples tested, and otherresearchestimated the average person ingests about 4,000 particles in drinking water annually.Oceanand lake sampling has also found microplastics, sometimes atlevels “unsafe for wildlife”.Because microplastics are so small, it’s challenging to remove them. Wastewater filtering practices docapture some of the particles. Researchers have explored innovative ways of doing so. For example, in 2021, a team of researchers engineered abacterial biofilmthat could trap microplastics for easier removal – though it was just a preliminary experiment. Another research team created asponge from cotton and squid bonethat removed up to 99.9% of plastics in testing, though again, not at scale.How to avoid microplastics in your clothingPlastic iseverywhere in fashion– including pleather, or vegan leather, and harder to spot instances, such as microplastics that shed from synthetic fabrics.Polyester and nylon, both common plastics, make up almost 70% of all material used in clothing. Microfibers, which typically shed from synthetic materials, are a significant contributor to microplastic pollution.Here’s how to avoid plastic in clothing:Always check the garment care label, looking to avoid common culprits such as nylon, acrylic and elastane. Look up unfamiliar fabric types online and prioritize brands that use natural materials.For buttons used on clothing, look for those made from corozo nut or wood, and for hooks and eyes made from metal. Zips are often set in plastic fabric, so if you want to avoid microplastics, avoid garments with zips where possible.The materials that create stiffness and reinforcementsin clothing often contain plastic, such as padding in a bra. But the simpler the piece, the easier it is to avoid plastic.Clothing liningoften contains polyester and nylon. Look for silk or viscose rayon.Sequins and beads are almost always plastic.Sequins can be made from recycled Pet, but these can still break into microplastics. Avoid purchasing these to begin with or be sure to mend items regularly so that plastic trims don’t fall off.Vegan leather and faux furcontain synthetic components and shed microplastics. Real leather – including the abundance of vintage leather pieces – is an incredibly durable and repairable material that should last for years, if well cared for.Read more about the hidden plastics in our clothes – and how to avoid themhere.How to avoid microplastics in your kitchenThe highest exposures to microplastics are likely to come from packaged and processed food and drinks, saysWright,the environmental toxicologist. The risk of microplastic shedding increases when plastic is exposed to heat.Avoidheating anything in plasticor drinking hot liquids that were exposed to plastic, such as the lining of a disposable coffee cup. Arecent studyfound that when hot liquid is poured into a single-use coffee cup, it can shed trillions of bits of plastic.The good news for consumers is that almost every plastic kitchen product – including coffee makers and tea bags –has asafer wood, glass, silicone or stainless steelalternative.Sign up for the Detox Your Kitchen newsletter on avoiding potentially harmful chemicals in your foodRead moreWhen it’s time to replace a spatula, try wood, stainless steel or silicone instead. Avoid plastic cutting boards and instead opt for one from a single piece of wood that has not been glued (as glue can contain formaldehyde) and is unfinished or treated with a safe finish, such as beeswax or fractionated coconut oil.When it comes to storing food,opt for glass containers. Instead of plastic wrap, look for unbleached paper or paper that uses soy wax.What to do about plastic pollutionThe World Economic Forum ranked pollution among its10 biggest global risks. Just9% of virgin plastic gets recycled, according to a 2017 scientific paper. The remaining plastic is either incinerated or accumulated in landfills, where it could then leak into the environment.The most consequential action to contain the “global plastics crisis” would be a cap on plastic production, saidDr Philip Landrigan, an anti-plastic advocate. While some plastics are essential for use in the fields of engineering or medicine, Landrigan calls for a curb on “stupid plastics” – or single-use throwaway items.As of 2023, single-use plastics accounted for 40% of the more than 400m tonnes of plastic produced each year. Production is onlyincreasing, with a 2022 report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimating production is on track to almost triple by 2060."

But while his performance was brilliant, Domingo’s meteoric rise was also down to something else: his masterful embrace of Black dandyism.Having honed his trademark tight trousers and unbuttoned shirts waiting tables in San Francisco, on the red carpet he set himself apart in suits with Nehru collars, bow ties, dramatic cloaks and sparkling brooches. “I don’t just wear clothes, I wear stories,”Domingo told GQahead of his appearance at the Golden Globes in January, before stepping out in a black Valentino mohair wool tuxedo paired with a polka-dot silk shirt and a peacock plume brooch, all chosen to evoke “being at the centre of a three-ring circus” – a playful nod to the performative nature of awards season.View image in fullscreen‘I don’t just wear clothes, I wear stories’: Colman Domingo at the 82nd Golden Globes, California, January 2025.Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/APAs the current poster boy for Black dandyism, it’s fitting that Domingo will co-chair this year’s Met Gala, the theme of which is Superfine: Tailoring Black Style. Inspired by Monica L. Miller’s 2009 book, Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, the gala and the accompanying exhibition are a celebration of the strategic use of fashion by Black men throughout history, which the book traces from slavery and colonialism through political and cultural movements such as the Harlem renaissance and the civil rights movement of the 1960s, up to 21st-century icons including André 3000 and Janelle Monáe. Dandyism is not just about impeccably tailored suits and carefully chosen accessories – although it can be both of those things. It is about clothing that deliberately evokes political and historical ideas while showcasing the wearer’s distinct charisma.Speaking to Miller over Zoom from her office at Barnard College in New York City, where she is professor of Africana studies, she’s clearly still processing the unexpected turn of events that brought her research to the red carpet of the Met Gala, the Anna Wintour-organised, star-studded extravaganza widely considered fashion’s biggest night of the year. “I got a cold call saying, ‘We would love to talk about the possibility of turning your book into an exhibition,’” says Miller, who admits to being floored by the invitation: “Even now, with the exhibition coming together, it still feels like a miracle,” she says.The term “superfine” is borrowed from the memoir of Olaudah Equiano, an enslaved West African who, after purchasing his freedom in 1766, spent “above eight pounds of my money for a suit of superfine clothes to dance with at my freedom”. Beyond a simple commitment to flamboyant dressing, the title reflects the deeper significance of Black dandy style as both “imposition and liberation”, preserving a tension between politics and aesthetics. “It’s a sartorial style that asks questions about identity, representation, mobility – race, class, gender, sexuality and power,” says Miller. It’s a timely choice by the Met, given we find ourselves in what Miller euphemistically refers to as “this incredibly political moment”, also noting how the past 15 years have seen Black culture – and designers – play an increasingly central role in western fashion. “There’s a sense in which the exhibition is a distillation of the really important moves Black designers have made in recent years,” she says.The style challenges social hierarchies by subverting expectations of how Black men should present themselvesMonica Miller, professor of Africana studiesMiller first became intrigued by Black dandyism while studying with American philosopher Cornel West in graduate school, reading WEB Du Bois’s The Souls of Black Folk, a collection of sociological essays exploring the Black experience in early 20th-century America. When she discovered a footnote about Du Bois being caricatured unflatteringly as a dandy, she was puzzled. “I didn’t understand why that was a bad thing,” she says. “He was incredibly, like, impeccably dressed.”Du Bois rejected the label: “He was upset about it because the primary image of the Black dandy came from blackface minstrelsy.” But Miller saw something more significant. “If we think about dandyism from a really different perspective,” she says, “the style challenges social hierarchies by subverting expectations of how Black men should present themselves. What was once used to mock Black people became their tool for resistance and self-expression.”View image in fullscreenA sharp-suited Grace Jones, c1980.Photograph: David Corio/Getty ImagesThe exhibition is organised around key concepts that illuminate different facets of Black dandyism, including most notably “ownership”, or the contrast between “being owned and ‘owning it’”. This tension between being dandified by others and adopting dandyism as self-expression runs throughout Black history. Miller cites the example ofJosephine Baker, who rose from being an exotic dancer to global icon of the jazz age through strategic manipulation of her image. “She was able to defy that expectation and take control of it,” says Miller. The ability to manipulate societal expectations was not just important for well-known figures, but marginal ones too, such as runaway enslaved people. “Adverts for absconding enslaved persons would include the clothes they took; even their enslavers knew how important clothes were in their attempt to pass for a free man.”View image in fullscreenMonica L. Miller, author and professor of Africana studies at Barnard College in New York City.Photograph: Carrie Glasser, Barnard CollegeAs the 20th century progressed, the bold clothing of Black dandyism became a way to explore the complex relationships between race, masculinity and sexuality. It’s here that the distinction between Black dandyism and white dandyism – long associated with European queer communities – is most apparent. Asked about what distinguishes the two, Miller is provocative: “I do believe that Black people and their identities have always been queer. They are odd, ill-fitting and problematic, regardless of sexuality.”Black women have also played a key role in shaping dandyism, including Harlem Renaissance blues singer Gladys Bentley, with her trademark white satin suit and top hat, and Grace Jones, who frequently wears masculine garments, such as the Armani suit jacket she dons on the cover of her album Nightclubbing. Miller notes how the footprint of dandy aesthetics is evident with political figures such as Kamala Harris or Michelle Obama. “They’re not only wearing suits, but also thinking about Black designers, like Christopher John Rogers,” says Miller. “It’s a feminist thing, but they’re also thinking about the blackness of it – choosing accessible silhouettes as a way of signalling, ‘Yes, I’m in a position of power, but I’m also just a person.’” In essence, the choices serve a dual purpose: the familiar, relatable silhouettes (such as Michelle Obama’s signature belted looks) create a visual bridge with everyday Americans, while the selection of Black designers makes a statement about cultural representation.View image in fullscreenBlues singer Gladys Bentley at the Ubangi Club, Harlem, New York City, c1930.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesIntentionality is a consistent thread throughout Miller’s conception of Black dandyism. It is perhaps most striking now, at a time when prominent white men, such as Elon Musk, seem practically slovenly despite their highly ambitious political projects. “Part of the tension,” says Miller, “related to Black people and their relationship to fashion is that it seems required for Black people in power, or Black people who want certain forms of power, to dress in a particular kind of way.” In other words, Black people are required to dress smartly to be taken seriously, while white men are afforded the privilege of scruffiness.Black Ivy: A Style Revolution – in picturesRead moreAs Met Gala guests prepare to interpret the theme on the Met steps next month, Miller hopes attenders and viewers will appreciate the deep historical significance of what they’re seeing. “It’s about understanding that the present moment is always informed by both history and our aspirations.” In today’s divided political landscape, Black dandyism continues to be a powerful statement – a way of claiming space, asserting dignity and imagining alternatives to the present. In Domingo, A$AP Rocky and their fellow co-chairs, we will see the latest incarnation of this tradition – one that transforms the red carpet into a canvas for exploring the ongoing, unfinished business of what it means to be visible while Black, in America and around the world.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After my mom flung off her top, my brother was attacked by fire ants and I developed a fiery hot rash, everything began to seem strangely zen …Natalie PalamidesWed 30 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTShareIt was the summer of 2001 and I was on the brink of adolescence, embarking on my first journey outside the United States to the tropically convenient American territory ofPuerto Rico. I was 11, and already the goofball in my group of friends – but, away from those with whom I was familiar, I was painfully shy. Until a family vacation from hell rid me of all my inhibitions.The chaos began when my well-intentioned parents decided to take my brother and me to see the beautiful rainforest. My mom had her heart set on going to the El Portal de El Yunque National Forest visitor centre; a friend had told her it was “perfect for kids”, with guided, paved pathways, a cafe, and even a gift shop. But when my flustered, monolingual father got lost on the Puerto Rican freeway, he panicked, as my mother flipped through the map trying to direct him. “What’s a salida?!” he cried, sailing past the “exit” signs.Fed up and frustrated, he pulled over to ask a man who was selling fruit on the roadside. “The rainforest?” the man responded. “Si, si!” said my father, enthusiastically. The fruit seller proceeded to give us directions, and my father, finally confident in where he was going, made his merry way.View image in fullscreenNatalie Palamides with her brother in Puerto Rico.Photograph: Courtesy of Natalie Palamides“I don’t know, Dale … I don’t think he was talking about the National Forest,” my mum warned. “Becky, he’s from here,” my father insisted, “he knows what he’s talking about.” We eventually landed on a bumpy dirt road, parking next to the tiniest distressed wooden sign that read “RAINFOREST” with an itty bitty arrow pointing into the vast tropical wilderness. “This is not it – Carol said there’s a gift shop!” my mom implored. “The rainforest is the rainforest,” my dad insisted.And so we set off on a six-hour trek, dressed in shorts and sandals, and without any snacks or water, following a narrow uphill path more suited to someone with survivalist skills than a family of four. Eventually, my mom got so overheated she took her top off. “Mom!” I exclaimed, embarrassed at her indecent exposure, but she insisted it was simply too warm for clothes – and besides, who would see her?When my mom and I got too tired to continue, we waited on the path while my dad and brother went further, wanting to reach the peak. About 10 minutes later, I heard people coming down the mountain. “Mom! Put on your top!” I hissed. “Absolutely not, I’m roasting,” she said. “The only one crazy enough to climb up here in this heat is your father.”“They’re speaking Spanish, Mom!” I pleaded, desperate to convince her that the people coming down the mountain were not members of our family. Seconds later, a Puerto Rican family of six rounded the corner. My mom covered up just in time, but my face turned bright red at the mere thought of what might have been. After we greeted them in our best broken Spanish, my mom remarked on how they were dressed head to toe, in long sleeves, trousers and hats – in July! As it turned out, they were probably wondering why we were not wearing any sort of protective clothing in the middle of the tropical wilderness. Moments later, my dad and brother came barrelling down the mountain; my brother had been attacked by a colony of fire ants.Driving fast back to the hotel to help my brother, my dad ran over a flock of birds. We pulled into a parking lot and saw the grill of the car was chock-full of feathers. “What the hell?!” my mom exclaimed. “I thought if I sped up they would fly out of the way!” Dad fretted. But we didn’t let going to a remote part of the rainforest totally unprepared, a few hundred fire ants, and a dead flock of birds ruin our evening. It was my brother’s birthday, so we made our way to an upscale, local branch of our favourite steakhouse – because sometimes we Americans travel thousands of miles to get a little taste of home.View image in fullscreen‘It was mortifying on so many levels’ … Palamides today.Photograph: Natasha PallotzioIt was at this dinner that my ankle started itching incessantly. “Just stop touching it,” said my mom. For dessert, my brother ordered a piece of dark chocolate cake that he devoured in seconds. I was furious I didn’t get to try any of it, but felt altogether less envious a few hours later, when he was throwing up black, dark chocolate bile all over our stark, white hotel room.Who knows if it was the fire ants or just straight-up food poisoning; I didn’t really have time to think about it, because I had awoken to my own nightmare: my entire body felt like it was on fire. I was inflamed from my ankles up to my face with what appeared to be a poison ivy rash. I spent the rest of the trip writhing in pain, looking like an engorged, blistered tomato.Once my brother had stopped vomiting, and we had cleaned all the feathers off the car, we tried again. This time we managed to locate the beautifully paved trails at the El Portal de El Yunque National Forest visitor centre. I got a lollipop with a cricket in it at the gift shop and my mom kept her top on. For the remainder of the trip, my mom would stop and strip me down to my bathing suit (often in public locations, most memorably bent over the drive-thru sign at a McDonald’s ) to cover me in aloe vera.Somehow, the ill-fated journey into the rainforest, combined with my brother’s dark chocolate cake vomit and my whole body rash, helped me to reach an unlikely zen. We still reminisce about that disastrous trip which proved mortifying on so many levels – and after which, it was rare for me to ever feel shy or embarrassed again.Natalie Palamides: WEERis performing at Soho theatre Walthamstow, London, from 2-10 May.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA moment that changed mePuerto RicoFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her first clients were friends. Three-and-a-half years later, Johnston, from St Monans in Fife, is now fully retired from nursing, and feels delighted with the success of hernew venture.“It’s something I really enjoy doing,” she said. “I charge £30 an hour, with most jobs lasting at least four hours. I can fit my working sessions around my life, walking our dog, caring for our granddaughter, going on holiday and visiting family.”View image in fullscreenKari Johnston, 66, a newly established declutterer, from Fife.Photograph: Kari Johnston/Guardian CommunityJohnston was among the Britons who shared with the Guardian why they had set up their own businesses after passing the big 60.The number of self-employed individuals aged 60 and older hit a record 991,432 in 2023, according to analysis of Office for National Statistics data by the digital community Rest Less, and 35% of new businesses in the UK are now started by people aged 50 and above, according to Enterprise Nation.Many respondents said they had launched their own businesses to pursue creative passions or a better lifestyle, often after decades in unsatisfactory or highly stressful employment.Others said they had simply seen no other option after either becoming too frail for regular employment or having been unable to find work close to state retirement age, with several complaining of age discrimination.While many said they had to keep working to stay financially afloat, others said it had been their choice to stay active and seek fulfilment through entrepreneurship.Johnston was among various people who said that spending more time with people was a main motivator in setting up shop at an age when many of their peers were readying themselves to exit the workforce.“I like meeting the varied people who contact me for help,” she said. “I thought decluttering would feel completely different to nursing, but I actually provide some kind of therapy. It’s never about the teacups, it’s about how people feel about their stuff.“Some have hoarding tendencies, but you need to care, not judge. I possibly get more satisfaction from what I do now than I did from nursing.”This has been a revelation to me, I’ve never done anything like this beforeGeoff Carss, 63, from Wedmore, Somerset, initially trained as a geologist and had worked in software engineering and corporate sales. One of his big passions, however, has always been biodiversity.Dismayed over increasing biodiversity loss, but also a general lack of accuracy in reports on the topic, Carss began to think about better ways of measuring levels of biodiversity around the world.“It had to be easy to use, it had to work anywhere, and be scalable,” he said.In 2022, after much research, Carss decided to launch a tech company and, with the help of his business partner, Lorenzo Trojan, developed a way to use sound and AI to measure biodiversity.Geoff Carss, 63, loves running his tech startup.Photograph: Geoff Carss/Guardian Community“The aim is to provide land managers, ecologists, nature-based NGOs and others with a better understanding of the impact they are having on biodiversity by automatically analysing vast quantities of audio captured by mini recorders. An AI checks the recording every three seconds and then identifies what has made a sound – a robin, say.”Interest in his venture, Wilder Sensing, Carss said, had been “huge”, and the company is now in the process of hiring additional software engineers and business developers.“This has been a revelation to me, I’ve never done anything like this before. It’s been deeply satisfying to set up and lead a tech startup aged over 60. It’s crazy, but good crazy. Just wonderful, and deeply purpose-driven.”A desire to be creative pushed Sibylle Hyde, 62, from west London, to launch her own business after retiring from teaching economics last year.“I am a qualified upholsterer – I had taken classes since the 1990s. Since I enjoy making curtains, blinds, and upholstery, as well as cycling, I thought: ‘Why don’t I become a cycling curtain-maker?’”View image in fullscreenSibylle Hyde in her home workshop.Photograph: Sibylle Hyde/Guardian CommunityHyde set up her local curtain-making business in May, dropped some leaflets in her neighbourhood and made a website.“I have a garage and a small workshop at home, and I’ve only spent around £1,200 so far on tools: a trailer for my bike, and some Ikea table tops I clip together for very long curtains,” she said.“It’s picking up slowly, thanks to recommendations and some repeat business. I’ve been having around £250 worth of business a week, enough for now. But if possible, I will 100% expand and hire staff.”Despite the long hours it takes to make custom Roman blinds from scratch, Hyde is very happy with her new venture.I’m too young for going from 100 to zero“You need to be careful that the work doesn’t impact your health, but for me, it’s perfect, I love it. Cycling keeps me fit, and I like creative problem solving.“I’m too young for going from 100 to zero. I’ll do this for as long as I’ll be able to, and am thinking of offering upholstery workshops for kids.”Doing something useful in retirement also motivated Andrew Hall, 70, from Hexham, Northumberland, when his laboratory research career at Newcastle University ended in 2016.“I had been exploring the reasons why some children with cancer become resistant to treatment,” he said.View image in fullscreenAndrew Hall, who is 70, enjoys finally working to his own agenda.Photograph: Andrew Hall/Guardian Community“When I retired from the university I felt I still had some fuel in the tank and wanted to provide patients with rare forms of cancer the option of being linked up with academic research groups and pharmaceutical companies with new ideas that may help with their treatment..”Originally conceived as a charity, Hall decided that it would be better to fund his service by charging companies to find patients for clinical trials.With three colleagues and financial support from family, friends and angel investors, Hall launched his company, RareCan, in 2020.Today, the platform provides a free trial matching service for nearly 2,000 registered patients, who are found with targeted advertising on social media and Google, and by working with charities.Setting up shop so late in life has been “fascinating”, Hall said. “This work is full-time, though more flexible than a nine to five job. I feel very motivated and I am, at long last, working to my own agenda.”After a decades-long career as an IT systems specialist, Kath, now 64, had had enough of the corporate rat race. In 2022, she moved from Yorkshire to Blairgowrie, Perthshire, where she established a sourdough bakery in her own home to help pay the bills.“Since they changed the state pension age I have no choice but to keep working and need something which fits around my six-year-old twins [at time of interview] and their home education. Bread making is flexible, I decide when I make it, and get up at five o’clock to bake, to get it to the local shop at nine o’clock.”Lacking capital and support for older people starting a business, Kath has been unable to rent business premises.“The grants are aimed at younger people, and up here in Scotland nobody is providing small workshop spaces.“Without bigger ovens, working at scale is very difficult. I bake about 70 to 80 loaves a week, and am selling them for £4 each. If I make a few hundred pounds a month, I’m doing well, which is the difference between surviving and not surviving.”View image in fullscreenKath with a batch of her bread.Photograph: Kath/Guardian CommunityDespite enjoying bread-making, working in a physical job is taking its toll, Kath said. “It’s a constant struggle, but on the flip side you don’t get bullied by bosses and colleagues.“I’d always wanted to be a baker and it’s very satisfying work, but I do this primarily to bridge the time until state pension age.“You’re not allowed to stop, and so the oldies, many of us are having second lives.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersEntrepreneursAgeingSmall businessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A joint of meat is a magnificent offering, but it can sometimes be hard to carve cleanly, and you end up leaving chunks of meat and flavoursome fat on the bone. These scraps are perfect for turning into succulent, tasty tacos. Cut any meat and fat off the bone, then shred with two forks. I’ve added black beans to bulk out the meat; if you have less meat, or want to make a vegetarian version, just use an extra tin of beans.Leftover lamb barbacoa tacosBarbacoa de Borregois a traditional Mexican dish of tender slow-cooked lamb (or mutton) that’s often wrapped in agave or banana leaves and baked in an underground pit. Rich, smoky and deeply spiced, it’s typically served shredded in tacos with salsas, lime and fresh herbs. This speedy but satisfying shortcut version captures the essence of the dish using leftover roast lamb and pantry spices.Roast meat is an incredible resource – it takes so much energy to produce, from the land, water and fuel used to farm, transport and store the meat, to the time and energy we put into cooking it – so any extras we make from it are delicious meals in waiting. The meat can simply be reheated until piping hot for a quick, comforting “ready-meal”, or you can turn them into something more elaborate such as today’s dish.Try this recipe and many more of Tom’s thrifty creations on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Mexican chillies are well worth seeking out for this dish, and larger supermarkets are starting to stock them more regularly; alternatively, look in specialist shops and online. I used a ready mix of guajillo, ancho and chipotle flakes, which are all classic chillies commonly used in traditional barbacoa. Chipotle and other Mexican chillies add an extra layer of smokiness and depth to the dish, but a mix of chilli flakes and smoked paprika will also work, if need be. And if you don’t have a mortar and pestle, it’s fine to leave the chilli flakes and cumin whole – just be sure to mince the garlic finely before mixing it with the rest of the ingredients.The green apple salsa verde, meanwhile, is inspired by Mexican tomatillo sauces, and adds a refreshing, tangy kick that cuts through the richness of the meat and balances the dish beautifully.Makes6 tacos3 tsp chilli flakes or powder, Mexican, ideally (guajillo, ancho and/or chipotle), or regular chilli flakes and smoked paprika1 tsp cumin seeds(optional)3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped1 tbsp lime juice, or cider vinegar2 tbsp vegetable oil1 tbsp brown sugar1 tsp sea salt, plus extra for the salsa1 tsp ground cinnamon1 tsp oregano200–250g leftover cooked roast lamb, shredded1 medium white onion, peeled and thinly sliced400g tin kidney, blackor black eyebeans, plus a little of the liquid from the can (if making vegetarian tacos, use 2 tins of beans)6 small tortillasLime wedges, to serve (optional)Fresh coriander, to serve (optional)For the green apple Mexican-style salsa verde (optional)1 green apple(such as a granny smith), cored and roughly chopped, core removed1 fresh green chilli(jalapeño or serrano, ideally), finely chopped, with or without seeds, depending on your liking for heat½ small white onion, roughly chopped1 garlic clove, peeled20g fresh coriander, chopped from stem to leafJuice of 1 lime, plus the finely grated zest, if unwaxed and organicToast the chilli flakes or powder and cumin seeds in a dry pan for a couple of minutes, until they smell spicily aromatic. Transfer to a mortar, grind to a coarse powder, then add the chopped garlic and crush to a paste. Mix in the brown sugar, lime or vinegar, a tablespoon of oil, the sea salt, cinnamon and oregano.Put a tablespoon of the oil in a thick-based frying pan on a medium heat, add the sliced onion, lamb and the spice paste, stir to combine, then saute gently, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, until the lamb and onions are caramelised. Add the beans and enough of their tin liquid to make the mix saucy, then simmer, stirring often, until thick and sticky.Meanwhile, make the salsa verde. Put everything in a blender, then pulse until everything is evenly and finely chopped; if need be, add a splash of water to loosen and help things along. Season to taste with sea salt, and transfer to a bowl.Serve the lamb mix in warm griddled tortillas with lime wedges, coriander and an optional spoonful of my salsa verde to taste. Any excess salsa will keep in a sealed container or jar in the fridge for up to four days.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteMeatLambMexican food and drinkMain coursefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This year’s celebration was the 17th annual parade organized by Cambodia Town Inc and also the 50th anniversary of the Khmer Rouge’s four-year reign of terror that began in 1975. Under a communist-led regime, more than a million Cambodians were murdered in mass executions known as the Killing Fields.Throughout the 80s and 90s, Cambodians arrived in the US as refugees fleeing the violence of their home country and settled in Long Beach. Today, 4% or about 20,000 Long Beach residents identify as Khmer, the highest concentration of Cambodians outside south-east Asia.“The parade itself … shows resiliency and also shows the strength of our community that comes together,” said Sithea San, the chair and co-founder of Cambodia Town Inc, one of the thousands of Cambodians who survived the genocide and arrived in the US as a teenager.‘Our Cambodian food is unique’View image in fullscreenThe Khmer New Year Parade in Long Beach, California, on 6 April.Photograph: Jireh Deng/The GuardianRicher San, Sithea’s husband, said the parade originated from a push to bring resources and awareness to the Cambodian community along the Anaheim corridor back in 2005.“One of the goals is to heal the survivors of the Killing Fields, and, of course, also to bring business to the small businesses in that area,” said Richer.Sophy Khut, the owner of Sophy’s: Cambodia TownFood& Music, had her hands full at the festival, slicing pre-marinated meat for their most popular item on the menu: beef skewers.“Our Cambodian food is unique,” said Khut, 57, who started the restaurant after graduating from college and had to recruit some help to meet the demand. “We use a lot of healthy herbs like lemongrass, galangal, kaffir.”Khut’s friend, Karen Ing, pitched in by skewering slices of meat for the grill. She said the food festival attracts Cambodians from all over in search of home and nostalgia. Unlike other Asian cuisines such as Korean or Chinese food, Cambodian food isn’t as readily available.“I don’t think anywhere else has Cambodian food at the moment,” Ing said of the distinct and vibrant food scene in Long Beach. But she has been noticing that the festival is continually growing year after year even among non-Cambodian audiences. “We just don’t have that many in terms of population and exposure, so this festival gives that.”On the festival stage, a rock band ensemble energized a crowd as they line-danced to a medley of Cambodian classics from singers such as Sinn Sisamouth and Pen Ran – artists who had disappeared in the backlash against western music during the 1970s, but whose work survived and endures with music lovers.‘We try to keep our culture going’View image in fullscreenThe Khmer New Year Parade in Long Beach, California, on 6 April.Photograph: Jireh Deng/The GuardianThe cloudless day did not deter the intergenerational celebration as people danced in the streets along the parade route, Buddhist monks offered blessings, and rowdy children jumped around inflatable bounce houses. “ You can see on their face [what] we call radical joy,” Sithea said.Locals such as Teig Sida could watch the entire festivities from his front porch across, as the parade snaked through the streets of Long Beach, a coastal city in south-eastern Los Angeles county.Sida, 60, remembers taking his children to the first parade in 2007 and now takes his grandkids. “I try to get rid of the past,” he said of surviving the Khmer Rouge. As he passes down traditions, he doesn’t want his family’s future to be defined by the trauma of the past.“We try to keep our culture going,” Sida said as he waved to passersby while holding aloft a money tree he planned to donate to a temple later. “You have to remember where you’re from.”Mental health is the other dimension of the parade’s importance for Richer and Sithea, who are outreach coordinators with Pacific Asian Counseling Resources. Because of the war and trauma, some Cambodian survivors feel shame around the negative associations with their cultural identity and history, Richer said.A 2005 study of Cambodians in Long Beach found that 62% of survivorshad post-traumatic stress disorder, rates much higher than 4% for the general population. A third of Cambodian households in Long Beach live below the poverty line in comparison with 12% of Asian Americans overall in Los Angeles county, according toUCLA’s 2013 reporton the state of Cambodia Town.“ If you don’t have a good mental health. It will affect your physical health,” said Sithea.Richer said that survivors like himself who have PTSD can unintentionally alienate their family members by refusing to talk about their trauma.Their kids “ feel stressed because they didn’t understand why their parents react to a certain environment”, said Richer. But he said the parade offers an opportunity for families to address the past and to bond over their culture and history.“The parade bring all of them. You see that they walk together, three generations,” said Richer.‘We don’t want history to repeat’View image in fullscreenPeople celebrate and dance during the parade, on 6 April.Photograph: Jireh Deng/The GuardianMila Kristensen was a baby when the Khmer Rouge took over Phnom Penh and was attending the Cambodian New Year festival with her nine-year-old daughter, Caija.“It’s really fun,” said Caija of the festival. “ I can meet all my friends, make new ones and eat food that I don’t have at San Diego.” Mila and Caija had driven several hours that weekend to participate in the parade.“A lot of people still remember the history, but we don’t want the history to repeat to the next generation,” said Kristensen who lost her father in the genocide. A devout Buddhist, she holds on to her practice as a reminder to extend peace and love to the rest of the world and wants to pass that on to her daughter as well.“By having a happy moment celebrating Cambodian New Year is to remind the new generation: do not repeat the history, be happy, be blessful,” she said.Sithea said she had seen the festival and parade shift the narrative around Cambodian American identity away from shame for the community to one of belonging and healing intergenerational trauma.“Some young generation, they don’t want to identify themselves as Cambodian because of the Killing Field,” Sithea said of Cambodians who have struggled with an identity crisis. “ But after the parade, they feel that they have pride.”The festival has helped younger Cambodian Americans reconnect with their cultural roots. While older generations were wearing more traditional attire, like a sampot skirt tucked along the waist with a matching av pak blouse, gen Z youth paired casual streetwear with checkered silk krama scarves.“People didn’t let the whole war take away from how they feel about their culture and how they feel about the other people in their culture,” said Khloe Phornsovann, 16, whose paternal grandparents are Laotian from Cambodia. “It brought them together, if anything.”Sean Soun grew up on the east side of Long Beach and encountered stereotypes about Cambodia being a poor country or people who didn’t recognize his background under the umbrella of Asian American identity. He appreciates how the parade presents the richness of his cultural heritage.“It is good to have these types of festivals to show ’em what we’re really about,” said the 17-year-old high school senior. “I love how everybody loves our culture and they wanna be a part of it.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastCambodiaAsia PacificFoodMental healthBuddhismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And we have ended that and we are very aggressively going out and trying to find these children, 300,000 children that were lost by the Biden administration.”During his campaign for the 2024 election, Trump repeatedlymisrepresented government datato falsely claim that 300,000 migrant children who crossed the border unaccompanied had gone missing, and said many of them were trafficked or likely to be dead.The children were not in fact lost or missing. HHS data recorded only the numbers crossing the border, and tracking ceased when they were placed in homes and communities with relatives already in the US.Kennedy did not expand on the “aggressive” efforts his department was making to try to find children who were actually never missing.Much of the rest of the two-hour meeting, and a question-and-answer session with the media, was consumed by Trump talking up the perceived accomplishments of his first 100 days. He attempted to distance himself from Tuesday’sbleak economic datathat suggests the US could be heading for a recession on the back of his tariff policies:“I’m not taking a credit or discredit for the stock market,” he said. “I’m just saying we inherited a mess.”Yet when the stock market was soaring during the final year of Biden’s presidency, Trumpfrequently insistedit was because investors were buoyant at the prospect of him returning to the White House.The president was asked by a reporter on Wednesday if he had spoken with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, about the tariffs that have sparked a potentially costly trade war between the countries, and have led topredictions of empty shelvesbefore the end of the year as imports dry up.Trump said he had not, and offered his own prediction as to how Christmas might look for American families.“Somebody said,‘Oh, the shelves are gonna be open.’ Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,” he said.“So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe US politics sketchUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He and the other passengers, their hands and feet shackled, settled into a tense silence. Then a terrifying possibility crept into Salazar’s mind.“My fear was being sent to El Salvador,” he said,tothebrutal prisonwhere the Trump administration hasdispatchedmore than 200 Venezuelans into alegal black hole. They are accused of being violent gang members, but reportedly onflimsy evidenceformost, deportedwithouteven a court hearing.Salazar became stressed “because we’d been listening to the news and the other people at the facility”, he saidin a telephone interview from detention.His and other buses in the convoy from the remote Bluebonnet facility pulled over on the side of the road for an unexplained 15 minutes then drove on to Abilene regional airport, about 200 miles west of Dallas. Salazar recognized it as where he landed a few days earlier from detention in Farmville, Virginia, where he had been for about a month after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) arrested him and his father in neighboring Maryland.But once they arrived at the airport in Abilene, the buses abruptly turned around. On the way back to Bluebonnet, a guard told them to be thankful to God, Salazar said. Later he found out the likely reason why. An emergency order in the early hours from the supreme court had temporarilyblocked theirremoval from the US, in thelatest clashbetween Donald Trump and the courts.View image in fullscreenPolice officers stand guard during a media tour at the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) prison, in Tecoluca, El Salvador, on 4 April 2025.Photograph: José Cabezas/Reuters“I thank God that we weren’t sent to El Salvador, but I am still sad knowing that I am in this detention facility when I do not [even] have any tattoos [and have committed] no crimes,” Salazar said in a 25 April phone call, through an interpreter.He is being held in stark conditions, separately from his father, and unable to speak with his ailing mother, who lives in Colombia.Salazar’s case demonstrates that “if your only tool is a hammer everything looks like a nail,” said his attorney, Travis Collins. Based on court documents, exclusive interviews with Salazar, his brother and his attorney, and a review of an 23 April phone conversation between the 19-year-old and his legal team, the Guardianhas pieced together how Salazar was swept into the administration’s dragnet.Javier Salazar came to the US as an unaccompanied minor in 2022 and reunited with his father and some other relatives. The Guardian is using only his middle name, as he fears retaliation in Venezuela.His father had listed him as a beneficiary on his own US asylum application, where an unmarried offspring under 21 gains asylum if it is granted to the parent. Javier has no known criminal record, was at school and, per the justice department website, has an immigration court date in Virginia scheduled for 14 May, where Collins had planned to request Salazar’s release from Ice detention while his legal case progresses.But on an early mid-March morning, agents entered his father’s house in Maryland and took Salazar and his father away in handcuffs.Afterwards, scrolling through his social media on their phones, agents interrogated Salazar and asked him to identify various people in his network. Salazar saw one of the agents writing down in his notes something about a gun – an English word he recognized, he said.View image in fullscreenJavier Salazar.Photograph: Courtesy of Salazar’s familyThe agents did not show him the image, but Salazar remembers insisting to them that whatever they saw was probably a toy water pistol. The Guardian has reviewed an image that Salazar’s family thinks Ice may have been referring to, it shows a person standing near Salazar with a blue-and-white item peeking out of a pants pocket that resembles a small plastic water pistol.Salazar was recorded in the authorities’ computer system as an alleged member of the VenezuelanTren de Aragua criminal gangand was made to wear green prison clothing that signifies an alleged gangster, according to a court filing.Ice was approached by the Guardian for comment but did not respond before publication.Javier’s older brother Daniel described Salazar as the video game-obsessed “baby” of the family.“He’s just a kid, still in the process of growing up,” Daniel told the Guardian in Spanish. Daniel’s full name is being withheld as he has an open immigration case. “Like any human being, he deserves a chance,” he added.The family is in pain. “We miss him, my family, my aunts, my mom, what we do is cry,” Daniel said.He has been posting social media slideshows with photos and videos set to music of Javier making peace signs at the beach, doing bicep curls at the gym, horsing around in a school cafeteria, rolling up a snowball.“You are not a criminal, you are a human being with many dreams and goals, you do not deserve that injustice,” text on one of these slideshows reads in Spanish.On 7 April, the supreme courtruledthat immigrants subject to the obscure Alien Enemies Act (AEA)wartime lawTrump is using to justify summary deportationsmust be givendue process and time to seek legal remedies “before such removal occurs”.A week later, attorneys heard murmurs that theTrump administrationwas preparing to ship more migrants to El Salvador. On 14 April, when a 9am video call with Salazar from detention in Virginia was abruptly cancelled via email at 7.11am, Collins knew something was wrong.He scrambled to figure out where his clients were, “fearing the worst”, he said. Only two days later did he learn that they were taken to northern Texas, which at that timewas notsubject to a court block on summary removals under the AEA.On 17 April, Bluebonnet staff separated Salazar from his father, took him outside and handed hima notice in English. They asked him to sign it without reading it to him in Spanish or giving him a chance to consult his lawyer. When he refused, the agent said: “It ‘doesn’t matter, you’re going to be deported within the next 48 hours. Where you’re being deported to, I don’t know,’” Salazar later recounted to Collins in the phone conversation reviewed by the Guardian.The next thing Salazar knew, he was on that bus. The supreme court order has now bought him some time, but the battle is far from over. In a court filing from 24 April, the administrationsaidit believed a mere 12 to 24 hours was a “reasonable” amount of time for detainees to contest their removal – and that it maycontinue with removalseven if such a petition is pending, if a court denies a request for an emergency pause.Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)’s Immigrants’ Rights Project vowed that his organization “will continue to fight in courts around the country, including the US supreme court, to ensure there is due process, so that no individual ends up, perhaps permanently, in a brutal foreign prison without ever having had a chance to contest the government’s allegations and use of a wartime authority during peacetime”, he told the Guardian.Salazar’s relatives grapple with their decision to seek refuge and opportunity in the US. Daniel had thought that “the process would have been fair” based on how America has been portrayed on television, he said.“I feel guilty because I told him to come so he could have a better life,” he said. “And look at what happened.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsEl SalvadorVenezuelaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like the other buildings in his neighbourhood, the three-storey property he had shared with his extended family was pitted with bullet holes. Some of the walls had been blown through and the charred shells of burnt-out vehicles were scattered along the street. There was debris everywhere, and no water or electricity.“When we came back, everything had been stolen. There was nothing left – no furniture, no belongings, not even our clothes,” he says.Now in itsthird yearof war, Sudan faces the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Tens of thousands are reportedly dead, hundreds of thousands arefacing famineand 13 million people are displaced, including 4 million who have sought refuge abroad.Abushama, 27, and his family were among the millions of Sudanese people who were internally displaced when street-to-street fighting between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in May 2023 forced them from their home.View image in fullscreenLoss and nostalgia are central themes in Abushama’s work.Photograph: Mosab Abu Shama‘It’s not our job to make photos that are easy to look at’: the female photographers exposing the cost of conflict in 2024Read moreInitially, they moved to northern Omdurman, before most of his relatives sought refuge abroad. Abushama remained behind with his elderly father, who was unable to obtain a visa to leave. In the meantime, their home had become a base for the RSF and his neighbourhood “a battlefield”, he says.Abushama remained in the safer parts of Omdurman, where he threw himself into volunteer work, supporting hospitals and emergency food kitchens in the city.Returning home in March 2024, he had to confront another devastating cost of the conflict – the widespread destruction of the country’s already limited infrastructure.3:22Khartoum before and after: footage shows destruction wreaked by war in Sudan – videoMany key landmarks such as the presidential palace and Al-Shaheed Mosque, in Khartoum, have been destroyed. Nearly half of the hospitals in Khartoum state have been damaged,accordingto a recent report. Nearly all buildings hosting media institutions have beenvandalised or destroyed. In parts of Darfur, entire villages have been razed and burned to the ground.Loss and nostalgia have become central themes in Abushama’s photography and visual art, as he tries to preserve fragments of life in Sudan in his work.“This war didn’t just take physical things from us – like our city – it was also a war on our memory,” he says. “That house was everything to me, any sad or happy moment in my life happened there and it was ruined.”View image in fullscreenAbushama photographed life in the streets around where he lived in Omdurman, ‘documenting people’s lives during the war and how it is impacting us’.Abushama first picked up a camera in 2019, when Sudan was in the throes of large protests after the country’s longtime former president, Omar al-Bashir, wasousted from power. It was a hobby at the time, which he pursued alongside his full-time job as a creative assistant at a production house. He occasionally shared what he photographed on his social media accounts.He continued photographing life in Omdurman – of children playing, funerals and families sitting together – even after the war began, posting some online and keeping others. In the process of chronicling the lives around him, he accidentally became a war photographer.“When the war started I was taking pictures for myself,” he says. “Then I realised after a few months that I’m documenting people’s lives during the war and how it is impacting us.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His neighbourhood, Wad Nubawi, in eastern Omdurman, was one of the most severely damaged areas in the tri-city region, where the cities of Bahri, Omdurman and the capital Khartoum sit along the banks of the confluence of the White and Blue Nile rivers.“I’m trying to show people what we’re missing, what we loved, how our lives were before,” he says, “so that people could feel what I feel, and what we all feel in Sudan.”His first photo project, Tadween – Arabic for documenting –appeared in 2023and was produced in partnership with theArab Documentary Photography Program, an organisation that provides mentoring for photographers from the Arab world. It emerged from his artistic interest in capturing the mundane aspects of everyday life, such as his grandfather watching prayers broadcast on TV from Mecca during the war, or a child with a rolling wheel toy, playing as a plume of smoke billows up in the background.He also overlays images taken in Omdurman before the war with others taken after the RSF was ejected. In one composition, he juxtaposes an image of the debris of his house today with another of a gathering for his late grandfather, where friends and family had come together to eat and read the Qur’an.Another captures a moment from a street nearby, where a group of men hanging out and playing football is overlaid on to the same street today. The people are no longer there, the shopfronts bear the scars of war, and the streets are strewn with litter. A parked car appears in both images, and in the later one it is so badly damaged that its bonnet seems fused with the road, the tyres gone and the contents of its engine stripped.View image in fullscreenAn image of a gathering of friends and family to eat and read the Qur’an at Abushama’s home is superimposed on the debris-strewn remnants of the same building.Abusharma won an award at the World Press Photo contest in Amsterdam this year for a photo taken on his phone of a bridegroom in a suit holding a gun at his wedding in Omdurman.

In her case, the process was seamless.Spruiking, fake tradies and corflute stoushes: how to understand the Australian electionRead more“I just rocked up and showed my passport,” the 25-year-old says.Not everyone’s plans turned out as well.One traveller who contacted Guardian Australia from central Asia found himself frustratingly caught out, having left the country too early to vote in person but too late to receive a postal voting form – and thousands of kilometres from his nearest in-person polling place in Moscow.But the Australian Electoral Commission says it has made a big effort to allow as many people as possible to vote from outside the country. More than 111 voting centres have been set up across 83 countries, more than at any previous federal election.It is a sharp contrast to pared-back services during the pandemic. In 2022, only 19 overseas centres could offer in-person voting – down from 85 locations in 2019.An AEC spokesperson said that as of Tuesday there had been more than 26,000 votes cast at overseas voting centres, with more than 4,000 postal votes returned from overseas.View image in fullscreen‘Even the security guard that they had hired was an Aussie’: Tae Young’s parents, Linda and Craig Young, outside the embassy in Malta.Photograph: Tae YoungAbout 39,000 Australians either voted in person at or returned their postal votes via overseas centres in 2022. That rose substantially during the 2023 voice referendum, when 62,000 in-person votes and 8,200 postal votes were recorded across 107 overseas centres.Tae Young, who voted in Malta, says it was “much more chill” than in Australia.“You want to do the right thing and do it correctly. You try and look it up beforehand, but the general vibe was just to rock up and it would be fine.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter“Me and my parents went to vote. Because we were so early it was pretty empty, but we were number 80 and we got there at lunchtime. The electoral commission people were chatty with everyone.”As for many travellers abroad, the rituals of voting – and perhaps a familiar drawl in the air – were a reminder of home.“Even the security guard that they had hired was an Aussie, which I thought was super funny,” Young says.Voting is compulsory for those in Australia but optional from overseas, where it requires a bit more effort. People can use either in-person or postal voting options – online voting is not available – and those relocating indefinitely can use the form to remove themselves from the electoral roll, with the option to re-enrol if they return.Phone voting is reserved for rare cases, like Australians stationed in Antarctica. In 2022, 65 voters at Australia’s Antarctic bases dialled in their ballots from the ice. The same year, over 74,000 exemptions were granted to Australians affected by Covid-19.This year in the Maldives, Australians in the capital, Malé, escaped tropical sun and humidity to cast their vote inside the Australian High Commission building.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Malta for the referendum, turnout leapt from just 22 postal votes to 362 in-person ballots.In recent years, buzz has grown in expat hubs such as London and Bali.In Bali, 740 votes were cast for the 2022 election, rising to 1,072 at the 2023 referendum.The 2022 federal election saw 11,621 votes lodged at Australia House in London, increasing to 18,080 for the referendum.Outside on the first day of in-person voting for 2025 in the UK, a queue snaked down the street, drawing at least 1,000 votes.An overseas liaison officer from the Australian High Commission in the UK said they were proud to host the “largest overseas voting centre” and recreate some of the election-day atmosphere from home.“It’s striking how similar voting overseas is to voting in Australia, and we’re proud to provide a sense of home to Australians abroad.”New York (3,227 votes), Hong Kong (2,894), Berlin (2,356), Singapore (2,230) and Ho Chi Minh City (1,181) also reported strong voting numbers for the 2023 referendum.2:41Voting 101: How do you actually vote on election day? – videoWhile Covid disruptions make international comparisons tricky, the AEC says the 2025 overseas voting operation is “the best it’s ever been”.Still, hurdles remain.The Labor party’s international arm, ALP Abroad, warned in a 2022 submission that overseas voting laws “discriminate against Australians abroad” by making the process more complicated than many expect.“Australians are raised in a culture of universal compulsory voting assuming that they will always be able to vote when overseas and are unaware that they have to take special steps to keep their vote,” the submission said.Sean Bartlett, a dual Japanese-Australian citizen living in Fukuoka, found the process trickier than he expected.Originally planning to cast an in-person vote in Tokyo for his Queensland electorate of Griffith, Bartlett realised too late he wouldn’t be able to make the trip. Instead, he applied for a postal vote – and after a tense wait, received his ballot in Kitakyushu.Bartlett says he is is glad to have taken part, but surprised by the logistical effort required, including the “principle” of having to pay for postage back to the embassy.The acting electoral commissioner, Jeff Pope, noting the AEC does not “control or operate overseas postal services”, has urged Australians abroad to either attend a voting centre or apply for postal votes early. (Postal votes must be received by the AEC by the 13th day after polling day to be counted.)“We are conscious that there might be external circumstances, such as the geographical locations of some electors or postal delays, that might prevent people from voting.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then in March, a group of Roger’s deputieswere accused of assaultduring the arrest of a 57-year-old who claimed he was punched in the back of the head and left bloody after allegedly running a stop sign.Those episodes follow years of scandal.In 2023, Rogers’ predecessor in the top job was forced to resign – twice – after recordings emerged of him describing African American deputies on his force as “Black bastards”. The department wasalso under a recent federal investigationover allegations of sprawling embezzlement.Despite this track record, the Columbus county sheriff’s office scored a recent win under the new administration ofDonald Trump.On 5 March, the Trump administration accepted the sheriff’s department as an official partner in the all-out push by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to execute the president’s election promise of “mass deportations”. Trump’s department of homeland security (DHS) signeda memorandumwith Rogers known as a 287(g) agreement, which will empower the beleaguered department of Columbus county to help carry out the complex and controversial task of implementing federal immigration law and identifying residents potentially eligible for deportation.The agreement in this rural, conservative jurisdiction, wedged on North Carolina’s southern border, is just one in an unprecedented surge of such partnerships with local law enforcement agencies across the country. Since Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, his administration has signed over 370 memorandums with over 300 agencies, at an average of four per day, according to an analysis of DHS data. This explosion has more than tripled the number of agreements since Trump was sworn into office and has brought the number of 287(g) agreements to over 500 across the country.Graph showing the growth in 287(g) agreements, with task force agreements now the most common.An examination by the Guardian reveals that previous oversight requirements have been overridden as the administration has resurrected an aggressive partnership model that was shelved more than a decade ago amid alarms about civil rights abuses. With the new surge of 287(g) agreements, civil rights advocates and former Homeland Security officials are expressing concerns about a potential cascade of administrative and civil rights violations involving law enforcement agencies across the US.The Columbus county sheriff’s office is one of five departments identified by the Guardian that have previously applied to take part in 287(g) but were denied by DHS – only to have a new application approved within weeks of Trump returning to the White House.The specific reason for its first denial, which according to records occurred in 2007, was not immediately clear. Rogers did not respond to interview requests and a series of detailed questions from the Guardian were not answered. But a spokesperson indicated the department intended to train only one officer at the county jail to take part in its program.Kristi Graunte, legal director of the ACLU of North Carolina, said the department’s previously failed attempt to join the program and its history of alleged rights violations and racial discrimination were “clear red flags” as it moved forward with its Ice partnership.“With an agency like Columbus county, where there have been recent, very serious complaints of misconduct, abuse of power and legal violations, I worry whether there is sufficient oversight and screening happening,” Graunte said. “Immigration law is incredibly complex and unless there is proper oversight and intensive training, there is incredible capacity for mistakes and harm.”The department of homeland security did not respond to detailed questions.The 287(g) program, created in 1996, began a relative boom in the wake of theSeptember 11terror attacks. Agreements concentrated in sunbelt states in the American south, including Florida, North Carolina and Arizona during the second term of George W Bush.As programs expanded, concerns over racial profiling and civil rights violations proliferated as well. Two landmark US justice department investigations, published under Barack Obama, confirmed many of these fears.In Alamance county, North Carolina, the US justice department uncovered a raft of abuses by the sheriff’s department, which had signed its 287(g) agreement with Ice in 2007. County deputies were between four to ten times more likely to stop Latino drivers than other groups, the investigation found. The department had deliberately set up check points in majority Latino neighborhoods and specifically targeted Latinos for arrest. The county sheriff, Terry Johnson, was accused of encouraging a culture of discrimination, allegedly referring to Latinos as “taco eaters” and suggesting anyone of Mexican origin was “inherently suspicious”.Johnson, who remains the sheriff in Alamance county, called the investigation “grossly tainted with politics” after a subsequent justice department lawsuit was dropped in 2016. His department rejoined the 287(g) program during Trump’s first term in office.In Maricopa county, Arizona, where the sheriff’s department also signed its agreement in 2007, federal investigators uncovered a “chronic culture of disregard for basic legal and constitutional obligations”. Similar to Alamance county, federal authorities found that the sheriff’s department had systematically targeted Latino drivers and that senior deputies had circulated racist emails. The 2011 justice department report said the sheriff,Joe Arpaio, had “clearly communicated to his officers that biased policing would not only be tolerated, but encouraged”.The investigation also found multiple instances of deputies using excessive force against Latino residents and observed that “a wall of distrust” had emerged between the sheriff’s office and Latino communities as a result of the department’s enforcement practices.Arpaio repeatedly denied the conclusions of the investigation but was eventually found guilty of criminal contempt for refusing to comply with a court order compelling reforms of his department. He was pardoned by Trump in 2017. The Maricopa county sheriff’s office is currently not part of the 287(g) program.View image in fullscreenJoe Arpaio and Donald Trump.Photograph: Rick Scuteri/APThe conclusions from both these reports led to a curb in the creation of new 287(g) programs and the complete abandonment of the “task force” model employed in Maricopa county, which had permitted sheriff’s deputies to question and detain people they suspected of immigration violations as part of their work in the field, rather than only those already held in jail.While Ice funds the initial training of local law enforcement, thefrequently high expensesof running a program are borne by the local department.In 2009 DHS set up an advisory board to evaluate the applications of law enforcement agencies applying for 287(g) status and to assess their suitability for the program. The seven-member board voted on each application, and included a representative from DHS’s office for civil rights to advise “on civil liberties and civil rights issues associated with potential or existing” 287(g) partners,according to records.But ten days after taking office in 2025, the Trump administration unilaterally disbanded the board and routed all 287(g) approval requests directly to the Ice director’s office,according to a previously unreported DHS memothat followedan executive orderissued by the new president. And earlier this week, the White House released more executive orders, targeting so-called sanctuary cities and local officials that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.The abolition of the board appears to have opened the floodgates to new 287(g) agreements. The first approved application, submitted by Texas’s attorney general office, was dated the day the advisory board was disbanded. It was signed by Ice within 24 hours,according to records.The statewideTexasoffice did not respond to detailed questions on its new 287(g) deal.On 26 February 2025, theTrump administrationapproved 89 new agreements in a single day, according to a Guardian analysis. Most of the new agreements in 2025 are the “task force” models previously employed in Maricopa county, which have been unused since 2012. In the Trump administration’s first 100 days, Ice and local law enforcement agencies signed 231 task force model agreements.The Guardian’s findings drew alarm from former DHS inspector general John Roth, who served under Obama and during Trump’s first term in office.“Any time you loosen the appropriate controls over a program you’re going to increase the risk that program is misused or ineffective,” Roth said in an interview.Roth pointed tothe conclusions of a report he commissioned during Trump’s first termthat examined the consequences of a much smaller spike in 287(g) agreements using the “jail enforcement” model, which only allows local law enforcement to carry out immigration checks on those already detained in jail.In the first 14 months of Trump’s initial term the number of these agreements rose by 40, from 36 to 76. This increase was modest in size compared to the current surge, but it nevertheless caused havoc within Ice, the report found. The agency struggled to hire enough program managers – required by statute – to oversee the new agreements and failed to deliver the necessary IT systems to local police required to make programs operational.Roth described the surge in new task force models and the disbanding of the oversight board as indicative of a “complete disregard for the kind of controls you need in a program that is as high risk as this one would be”.“You only have to look at what happened in Maricopa county to show what can happen if there isn’t proper oversight over law enforcement in the execution of immigration laws,” he added.The nationwide explosion of new 287(g) agreements has involved police agencies in 38 states. The largest concentration by far is in Florida, which has logged 191 new deals since Trump’s inauguration.Graph showing that 50% of new 287(g) agreements are in FloridaFour of the five agencies identified by the Guardian that had been previously rejected and then approved in Trump’s second term are situated in Florida. As in Columbus county, North Carolina, the specific reasons for their prior rejection were unclear, buta 2010 DHS reportnoted that half of 287(g) agreements denied since 1996 had been turned down due to a lack of supervisory resources at Ice.The Florida state legislature and its conservative governor, Ron DeSantis, has pushed through a slew oflawsandordersthat seek to compel local law enforcement to take part in the program and enhance co-operation with Ice. The effects of this cooperation are starting to be seen already. In late April, nearly 800 people were arrested over four days in Florida as a part of one of the first 287(g) operations in the state,according to Todd Lyons, acting Ice director.A similar legislative effort is ongoing inNorth Carolina, and another similar bill in Arizona, which was recently blocked by the state’s Democratic governor,has led local Republicans to vow further action– an indication the surge in agreements is likely to continue rising.Prior analysts of the program caution that assessing where the most acute issues will arise is hard to predict.“Previous research has shown that 287(g) agreements can be implemented in wildly divergent ways from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,” said Austin Kocher, an immigration researcher at Syracuse University, pointing to the degree of discretion available to local law enforcement leaders across the US. “We aren’t going to really know until we start hearing reports about what’s going on in these particular new jurisdictions.”The Guardian analysis of county sheriff offices that have signed new deals raises questions about many departments’ capacity to meaningfully execute a partnership with Ice. Of the agencies that have signed up for the program, 117 represent counties with fewer than 50,000 residents. The Guardian also identified a handful of municipal police departments that have signed onto the program that serve areas with just a few hundred residents.The Pittsburg, New Hampshire, police department, which signed a task force agreement with DHS on 3 March 2025, serves a township of 800 people and has just two serving officers. Only one of the two is employed full time.In a phone interview, Captain John LeBlanc acknowledged he would be the only member of Pittsburg police’s immigration detail, but said he had signed his agency up due to its proximity to the Canadian border. LeBlanc also acknowledged that in his ten years at the department he had never encountered a migrant crossing irregularly from Canada.“Essentially there’s not going to be any difference on our day-to-day activities,” LeBlanc acknowledged.Pittsburg police, like many other departments across the country, was still waiting to hear from the new Trump administration on how to train and prepare for its fresh agreement with Ice.Do you have a tip about this story?

When Moran pointed out that the supreme court had ordered García’s return to the US, and suggested Trump had the power to comply by making a single phone call, the president bristled.“I could,” Trump said – contradicting weeks of his administration’s insistence that he could not – but added: “I’m not the one making this decision. We have lawyers that don’t want to do this.”“You’re the president,” Moran said, then after talking over each other, Trump said: “No, no, no, no. I follow the law. You want me to follow the law. If I were the president that just wanted to do anything, I’d probably keep him right where he is.”“The supreme court says what the law is,” Moran pointed out.The exchange deteriorated further when Trump insisted García had MS-13 tattoos on his knuckles, while Moran – after several times gently disagreeing and trying to move to a new topic – eventually pointed out that the image Trump was referring to had obviously been digitally altered.“Why don’t you just say, ‘Yes, he does’ [have a gang tattoo] and, you know, go on to something else,” Trump said.The US president added: “You do such a disservice … This is why people no longer believe the news, because it’s fake news.”He then claimed he picked Moran to do the milestone interview “because frankly, I never heard of you”, and added: “Hey, they’re giving you the big break of a lifetime, you know – you’re doing the interview.”Throughout, Trump stood by his controversial economic and immigration policies, even as Moran pressed him on potential consequences.On his steep tariffs against China – which reached 145% on some goods – Trump dismissed widespread economic concerns about price increases for American consumers. “Everybody’s gonna be just fine,” the president insisted, despite analyses from Moody’s and other financial institutions projecting thousands of dollars in additional costs for American families.“It’ll raise prices on everything from electronics to clothing to building houses,” Moran said.“You don’t know that. You don’t know whether or not China’s gonna eat it,” Trump countered, claiming his tariffs were necessary to address trade imbalances that made the US economy “not sustainable”.When it came to his proudest achievement in the first 100 days, Trump pointed to his border policies, claiming his administration had reduced illegal crossings by “99.9%”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked if he acknowledged that under US law every person facing deportation is entitled to a hearing, Trump responded: “If people come into our country illegally, there’s a different standard,” contradicting decades of supreme court precedent establishing that constitutional protections extend to all persons on US soil.Even when Moran cited concerns from the podcaster and Trump supporter Joe Rogan, who warned that deportations without due process might mean “we become monsters while we’re fighting monsters”, the president offered only vague assurances about being “careful” while doing “something that has to be done”.On Ukraine, Trump described the ongoing conflict as “Biden’s war” while recounting his recent meeting with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, at St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Though he condemned Russia’s missile strikes on civilian areas, he also expressed belief that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, “wants peace” – a claim at odds with Russia’s continued offensive operations.When asked directly if he trusted Putin, Trump deflected: “I don’t trust you. I don’t trust a lot of people. I don’t trust you,” before adding that Putin “respects me”.Trump also declined to clarify whether the US would continue military aid to Ukraine if peace negotiations fail, saying: “I want to leave that as a big, fat secret, because I don’t want to ruin a negotiation.”When challenged about his use of presidential powers – including revoking security clearances and targeting law firms with regulatory threats – Trump defended his actions by claiming he had been “persecuted like no other president”.And as the interview wrapped, Moran asked Trump directly about concerns he was becoming authoritarian, to which the president responded: “I would hate them to think that. I’m doing one thing: I’m making America great again.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpABCUS television industryUS politicsUS immigrationTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It shows a silhouetted figure with a chainsaw cutting into a tree. Loud chainsaw noise can be heard as well as the sound and sight of the tree toppling to the ground.Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, have denied being responsible for cutting down the tree, which had stood in a dip on the wall since the late 19th century. They also deny criminally damaging Hadrian’s Wall.On Wednesday Amy Sutherland, an intelligence analyst for Northumbria police, was asked about the evidence she had collated in order to produce a timeline of events.Sutherland told the court the tree-felling video was in the downloads on Graham’s phone and she had been able to get the coordinates of where it was filmed from the metadata. She said the coordinates were for Sycamore Gap.View image in fullscreenCourt sketch of Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers.Photograph: Elizabeth Cook/PA MediaThe jury was shown two sets of footage, said to have been filmed in the early hours of 28 September 2023. The first was almost completely black, raw footage. The second had been enhanced by police to change the brightness and contrast.Jurors at Newcastle crown court were also shown CCTV footage of a car, said by the prosecution to be Graham’s black Range Rover, being driven towards a car park near the Sycamore Gap tree. They were also shown footage of it being driven away from the car park.Earlier the court was read a written statement from an inspector of ancient monuments, Lee McFarlane, who said some of the stones on Hadrian’s Wall were damaged by the falling tree.She said it was fortunate the tree was still in full leaf as the crown of the tree appeared to have acted as a kind of “cushion”. The damage could have been “catastrophic” otherwise, she added.A statement by Tony Wilmott, a senior archaeologist with Historic England, said the Sycamore Gap name was coined in the 1980s and over the decades it had become one of Northumberland’s most appreciated features.“Its unmistakable profile has been repeated in many media and because of this it has become totemic,” he said.“It has become a place of marriage proposals, family visits and even the location of ashes to be spread. The place is much loved by many thousands of people.”Also read out was evidence from Alice Whysall Price, a walker who took pictures of the tree at 5.20pm on 27 September, some of the last to be taken when the tree was still standing.Opening the case on Tuesday, Richard Wright KC said Carruthers and Graham embarked on a “moronic mission” to cut down in minutes a tree that had stood for more than 100 years.He said the two men appeared to revel in the news coverage, which soon began once it was known the tree was felled. Messages talked about it going “wild” and “viral”.Wright told jurors: “They are loving it, they’re revelling in it. This is the reaction of the people that did it. They still think it’s funny, or clever, or big.”Graham, of Carlisle, and Carruthers, of Wigton, are jointly charged with causing criminal damage worth £622,191 to the tree. They are also charged with causing £1,144 of damage to Hadrian’s Wall, a Unesco world heritage site. The wall and the tree belong to the National Trust.Graham and Carruthers deny all the charges against them.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

At 18, she was a glamour model. A few years later, another man violated her trust. Then she fought backAnna MooreWed 30 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 09.15 EDTShareJess Davies was a 15-year-old schoolgirl, sitting in an art lesson, absorbed in her fairytale project about a princess and a postman, when her Nokia phone began to vibrate with messages. “Nice pictures,” read one. “I didn’t think you were that type of girl,” said another.To this day, she remembers the racing thoughts, the instant nausea, the hairs prickling up on her legs, the sweaty palms. She had shared a photograph of herself in her underwear with a boy she trusted and, very soon, it had been sent around the school and across her small home town, Aberystwyth, Wales. She became a local celebrity for all the wrong reasons. Younger kids would approach her laughing and ask for a hug. Members of the men’s football team saw it – and one showed someone who knew Davies’s nan, so that’s how her family found out.Only now can Davies, the 32-year-oldpresenter, influencer and women’s rights campaigner, see all this for what it was. It happened in the 00s, when she was a girl – she still loved High School Musical and Hannah Montana – with a woman’s body, navigating new feelings and the male gaze. “I had boobs when I was 10 so from then on, there were comments. You quickly learn that this is the lens you’re seen through. This is who you are now.” The boy who betrayed her trust, the men in the football team, everyone who shared that picture faced no scrutiny. “I was the one shamed,” she says, “I was the first person I knew of that this had happened to, so there was no blueprint to follow. I was mortified. My response was: ‘OK, this is it. I have to try to own this as it’s not going away.’” She chose to laugh it off and front it out. By 18, while at university, she was working as a glamour model for lads’ mags. “It’s wild how one thing can change your life trajectory,” she says. “Without that image going round my school, would I have ever felt confident to go on a modelling shoot? There was already so much stigma attached to me, I thought: ‘Why not try to embrace it and be confident in my body?’” She’s quiet for a moment. “I think that’s been a plus and a negative.”Her book, No One Wants to See Your D*ck, takes a deep dive into the negatives. It covers Davies’s experiences in the digital world – that includes cyberflashing such as all those unsolicited dick pics – as well as the widespread use of her images on pornography sites, escort services, dating apps, sex chats (“Ready for Rape? Role play now!” with her picture alongside it). However, the book also shines a light on the dark online men’s spaces, what they’re saying, the “games” they’re playing. “I wanted to show the reality of what men are doing,” says Davies. “People will say: ‘It’s not all men’ and no, it isn’t, but it also isn’t a small number of weirdos on the dark web in their mum’s basements. These are forums with millions of members on mainstream sites such as Reddit, Discord and4chan. These are men writing about their wives, their mums, their mate’s daughter, exchanging images, sharing women’s names, socials and contact details, and no one – not one man – is calling them out. They’re patting each other on the back.”It has taken years for Davies to shift the blame away from herself and on to them. For most of her adult life, she says, she carried shame and stigma around like a “weighted cross” on her back. “Every time I was taken advantage of, I kind of accepted it,” she says. “I thought: ‘Oh well, you’ve opened yourself up to this. What did you expect?’ Part of me believed that this is just how the world is, and this was all I was worth.” That message was delivered in so many ways. As a model, she tried setting boundaries, never shooting topless content. When she was once asked to pose in a mesh bodysuit, she agreed on the understanding that her nipples would be edited out. She was assured they would be. A month later, the pictures appeared in a Nuts magazine summer special, nipples very clearly on display, an image that was quickly scanned and shared on the internet. (Davies remembers crying in her mum’s arms as her standards collapsed in a “pathetic heap of lost hopes”.)View image in fullscreen‘These are forums with millions of members on mainstream sites.’Photograph: Posed by model; Yuliya Taba/Getty ImagesAround the same time, as a student and part-time model, someone she was dating took her photo while she slept and posted it on his mates’ group chat. “There had already been little red flags,” she says. “I’d heard him bragging about being with ‘Jess from Nuts’, but I was very romantic, I was all in. I thought this was it, which looking back, was very silly.“That morning, I was in bed, he’d gone for a shower. I had this sense that something had happened. I’d never gone through someone’s phone before, but I looked at his and it opened on to a group chat with a photo of me asleep fully naked. To this day, I’ve never shot a full frontal so that’s the only image that exists. He would have had to stand up to take it. It would have been such a conscious decision.” Davies quickly deleted it but didn’t confront him. “It’s really sad, looking back now, the way I just accepted it,” she says. “I thought: ‘Oh, I guess that’s what happens. He just sees me as a body.’”The most lasting repercussions from that period stemmed from her modelling agency’s requirement to provide a weekly selfie. In a forerunner to OnlyFans, her agency ran a website that gave private content to subscribers. “I was getting paid about £200 a month, so I had thought there must be no more than 20 or 30 subscribers who’d see them and the pictures would stay behind a paywall,” she says. “I hated it. It was such a disconnect from a professional photoshoot, being picked up in cars, having hair and makeup done, to just uploading a selfie from my grotty student flat in Cardiff. I was always late sending them, and then they started to fine me, which I couldn’t afford. Those images are the ones that spread in a way I could never really have imagined. There was such a total loss of control. To this day, it blows my mind.”In the years ahead, though modelling had taken a backseat, those images haunted her. “Every other day, I would be trying to report stuff,” she says. “Maybe I’d get something taken down then another link would come up, and then another. I’d do a reverse image search on Google and see hundreds. It felt so overwhelming. What if I apply for a job and they Google me? If I go on dating apps, will someone recognise me, or will his friends or his parents? It felt paralysing. I really did feel that this was something I was going to have to live with because of a choice I made when I was 18 years old.”At 27, working as a TV researcher, Davies was contacted by seven men over seven days who had all been scammed or catfished by seven different fake accounts that were using her images. She wrote an Instagram post to warn others and a BBC journalist got in touch, leading to her first documentary When Nudes Are Stolen. This was life-changing. “It was the first time that I had sat down with campaigners and experts who laid all those images out and said that what happened to me wasn’t OK,” she says. “No one had ever said that before. No one had ever said: ‘It wasn’t your fault.’ It was such a moment for me. It lifted the weight off my shoulders.” From then on, Davies stopped Googling herself (she still doesn’t) and started campaigning. “My coping mechanism has been to talk about it and call it out.”View image in fullscreen‘I was the one shamed.’Photograph: Posed by models; Klaus Vedfelt/Getty ImagesHer book sets the spotlight firmly back on the perpetrators to ask how their online behaviour could ever be accepted as “normal”, or “just what happens”. Davies doesn’t have to look very hard to find activity that should disturb anyone:nudify requestswhere AI apps are used to create fake nude images (“nudify my sister/cousin/mum/dead wife”); the collector culture – “One thread, for example, where someone requests images of girls from Birmingham or my home town Aberystwyth, gets hundreds of thousands of views because men from those places click on them,” she says. “Someone would say: ‘Has anyone got X from Plymouth?’ And men would reply: ‘Yes, I’ve got her, have you got Y?’ For me, that really hit home. These are men in our daily lives who we see every single day, whether it’s in the shops or at the school gate, or in our homes.”Davies saw things she almost wishes she hadn’t. A game called “Risk”, for example, which has various versions but the premise is that someone posts a woman’s picture and if someone else “catches” it – by responding within five minutes – the original poster has to give him the woman’s full name and socials. One man was “risking” pictures of his mate’s wife and daughter. When asked how his own wife would react if she knew, he replied: “Divorce, no questions asked. She’s a bit of a prude. The risk makes it hotter somehow.”Her book describes several games like this. In “Captions” someone posts a picture and the real name of a woman and others create detailed captions, usually involving violent rape and humiliation fantasies. In “Make Me Ashamed” someone posts a picture of his mum, for example, and invites the most graphic response in order to make him regret it. She sees cybermobbings play out: someone posts a picture of a girl with freckles and “kind brown eyes” along with her contact details and the instruction, “Go ruin her”. Others add, “Let her know she’s a whore” and “Tell her how she needs to get fucked”. At this point, Davies says, looking at this gently smiling, oblivious girl, she felt a crushing weight on her chest.Still, Davies is glad she saw all this. “Those men exist in such an anonymous, secretive world and I’m glad I know what they’re talking about, what they’re doing,” she says. Her book includes pages of advice on how to protect yourself online – how to have content removed, how to block and report, how to call this out, where to seek help – and also looks at projects to tackle it. Davies herself goes into schools and talks to boys. She points to the loss of community and the decimation of youth services – in England, there was a £1.1bn cut in funding between 2010 and 2021. The internet has filled this void. “The boys I speak to are usually 14 to 19 and some have never had a conversation about consent before,” she says. “How are we expecting so much from them when they are blasted with content telling them to act a certain way?”In some ways, she is hopeful now. There has been progress. She cites examples – the removal by Pornhub of 80% of its content after Mastercard and Visa severed links andblocked the use of its cards on the sitefollowing a New York Times investigation that accused it of being “infested” with child abuse and rape-related videos (Pornhub has denied the allegations); the Online Safety Act 2023, which is beginning to hold tech companies accountable for content. “Of course, there is so much more that needs doing, but we’re so close to change,” she says. “We’re at the beginning of creating laws and saying this isn’t OK. I think it’s partly why there is so much backlash in the manosphere. It’s like the jeopardy just before the happy ending in a Disney movie!”View image in fullscreen‘We’re so close to change’ ... Jess Davies.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianStill, on a personal level, Davies is wary – and single. She has seen too much. “I don’t go on dating apps,” she says. “I don’t date at all. It’s a bit of a joke to my friends, but it’s ruined it for me. I’d like to find someone one day but how do you build that trust back? It’s hard to say: ‘Yes, I’m going to give someone else a chance.’“Through all the campaigning I’ve done, the TV, the podcasts, the social media, no one has ever contacted me to apologise for sharing my image without consent. Not the man who took my picture while I was asleep. No one from that adult football team when I was 15 years old. Not the people who ran my website, or distributed my image or started the fake accounts. I’m not saying: ‘Lock them up and throw away the key’ but there should be some accountability. I like to think that some have seen me and thought: ‘Oh, shit. That was me and that’s not OK’. But maybe the likelihood is that they’re thinking: ‘Yeah, that was me. What’s wrong with that?’ Unfortunately, we’ve still got a way to go.”No One Wants to See Your D*ck: A Handbook for Survival in the Digital World by Jess Davies is published on 8 May by Headline Press (£20).

Here is what doctors do themselves to delay the onset of cognitive declineSarah PhillipsWed 30 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 13.40 EDTShareAs we live longer, our risk of cognitive impairment is increasing. How can we delay the onset of symptoms? Do we have to give up every indulgence or can small changes make a difference? We asked neurologists for tips on how to keep our brains healthy for life.Take care of your health generally“All of the sensible things that apply to bodily health apply to brain health,” says Dr Suzanne O’Sullivan, a consultant in neurology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, and the author ofThe Age of Diagnosis. “When you’re 20, you can get away with absolute murder. You can not sleep for nights at a time and stuff like that. But you get away with nothing when you hit middle age. With every year that I get older, my lifestyle gets healthier.”All of her consultations will focus to some degree on lifestyle choices, she says: “I work with a lot of people with degenerative brain diseases, and they are not caused by lifestyle. But everything is made better by having a moderate degree of exercise, eating healthily and sleeping well, whether it be bodily disease, brain disease or mental health.”Don’t smoke, and don’t drink every day“If you want to damage your brain, smoke a lot,” says Tom Solomon, professor of neurology at the University of Liverpool. Likewise, “a lot of alcohol is not good for you. There is some soft data suggesting one to two units might reduce risks of cardiac disease in the elderly, but the evidence overall is that alcohol is harmful, especially to the brain.”Dr Faye Begeti, a neurologist and neuroscientist at Oxford University hospitals, takes a hard line: “I find that people who are not alcoholics, but drink a small amount of alcohol every day over many decades, can still run into problems. With alcohol I have two rules for my patients: not out of habit, so only when celebrating; and not drinking daily.”Exercise three times a weekView image in fullscreenWhat’s good for your blood vessels is good for your brain.Photograph: Posed by models; Compassionate Eye Foundation/David Oxberry/Getty ImagesThere is a well-established link between physical activity and brain health, says Dr Richard Davenport, a consultant neurologist in Edinburgh and the outgoing president of the Association of British Neurologists: “It works on many levels: psychological, metabolic, physiological.”“Things that are good for your blood vessels are good for your brain,” Solomon says. “A lot of dementia is because of damaged blood vessels. Physical activity is good for blood vessels as it keeps blood pressure down.”Solomon got a Guinness world record for running the fastest marathon dressed as a doctor in 2010, raising money forEncephalitis International, a brain inflammation charity. But you don’t need to run marathons to keep your brain healthy, he says. Although, “there is not much hard data telling you exactly how much exercise to do – in our headache clinics we say do 20-30 minutes of something that gets you at least a little bit short of breath two or three times a week, so running, swimming, cycling. They are very good for de-stressing, too,” he adds – another bonus for the brain.Stand on one leg“There are studies that show being active in every decade really helps with brain longevity,” says Begeti. “I advise people to include single-leg exercises in their routine, because walking relies heavily on single-leg balance, and maintaining this becomes crucial as we get older. Aerobic exercise releases a brain-nourishing chemical called brain-derived neurotrophic factor that supports our neurons. A combination of that with resistance exercises that build up muscle is very important, as numerous studies have found greater muscle mass reduces cognitive decline, even in those who have already been diagnosed with dementia.”Ditch the butterView image in fullscreenWhen in doubt, opt for olive oil.Photograph: Posed by model; FG Trade/Getty ImagesOpt for “antioxidants and unsaturated fats, and not too much red meat”, says Solomon.“The biggest evidence is for the Mediterranean diet,” says Begeti, adding: “I was born in Greece, so maybe I am biased.” She says the advice she often gives on this is simple: “When you cook, your primary source of fat should be olive oil rather than butter. This is what I do and it is a really easy transition to make. You can have cakes with olive oil in; everything you fry should be in olive oil, rather than butter. I’m not saying you would never eat butter again, but that the primary source of fat is olive oil. And having some omega-3 with oily fish has really good evidence for brain health as well.” She says it is important for vegans and vegetarians to take vitamin B12 supplements.To prevent headaches, drink water, not coffee“We see people who have simple or chronic headaches,” says Solomon. “The things that reduce the risk of headaches are all very much the same. Regular exercise. Staying hydrated by drinking at least two litres of water a day. Stopping all caffeine. Not skipping meals. Getting to bed at a sensible time. We usually say to people: if you do this religiously for three months, headaches will reduce or come under control. And most of those things are also good for your general brain health, as far as we know.”Sort out your sleepView image in fullscreenTry getting up at roughly the same time each day.Photograph: Posed by model; Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty Images“Good sleep starts at the beginning of the day,” says Begeti, “rather than at night when you are stressing about not getting good sleep. Anchor your morning by getting up at roughly the same time each day. If you need more sleep at the weekends, then catch up with 60 to 90 minutes, or one sleep cycle extra. Don’t make it too erratic, because then your brain doesn’t know when to produce the right hormones.”“We still don’t exactly know what sleep is all about,” says Davenport, “but increasingly, there is good evidence that sleep is allowing the brain somedowntime to do a bit of tidying up, and in particular, tidying some of these dodgy proteins that ultimately may do bad things in terms of degenerative disease. In other words, getting decent sleep matters.”Chill out a little“With insomnia, there can be a lot of worry when we hear that reduced sleep can give rise to disease,” says Begeti. “I think it is about being able to do good things for your brain, but not being really stressed if you’re not doing everything perfectly, because stress has really negative effects as well.” But, she concedes: “It’s easier said than done to say to somebody, ‘Don’t be stressed!’”“There is evidence that people with perceived long-term stress are at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia,” Solomon agrees.Establish phone boundariesWe are in the midst of a panic about what technology is doing to our brains, but as Begeti explains in her bookThe Phone Fix, the science does not confirm that we are addicted to our phones. That said, she limits checkingher Instagram accountto twice a day and mutes all WhatsApp groups. “I suggest people try to develop a routine or a schedule of connection and disconnection that works for them. Distraction is a big thing when it comes to technology. I prefer people to use technology intentionally because they want to, rather than to avoid doing some difficult work or dealing with something, and instead using technology to fill that gap. When people use it as an avoidance tactic, I think that is when it can make them feel bad.”Does having so much information readily available online mean we are losing memory capacity? “You may not be able to remember a phone number, but the brain is very adaptable,” says Begeti. “It remembers things that you use and sidelines things that you don’t. If you don’t remember phone numbers daily, then your brain might not be accustomed to remembering them. It doesn’t mean this ability has disappeared. It is more the brain is prioritising certain things that you do.”Use tech to make social connectionsMaintaining social connections is crucial in helping to avoid dementia. “Of course, there are problems associated with technology,” says O’Sullivan. “There is some awful content on there. But I think we often forget the positive things it brings to our lives. For older people, who may not have great mobility, it is creating incredible connectedness.” Begeti adds: “There are early studies with preliminary findings that show if middle-aged adults engage in social media, they have reduced incidence of dementia.”Take up hobbies and meet new peopleView image in fullscreenFinding a hobby that involves social interaction is helpful.Photograph: Posed by models; Halfpoint Images/Getty Images“Brain and mind health is all about having ambitions and interests outside of yourself,” says O’Sullivan. “I have so much work to do that my mind is kept well occupied, but my plan going forward is to do all the things I wish I had time to do now: go back to university, do art appreciation courses, and challenge myself in settings where I’ll be mixing with lots of different people.”Cultivate a healthy obsessionFind a “magnificent obsession”, says Dr Richard Restak, a professor of neurology at George Washington University hospital in the US and author ofHow To Prevent Dementia: An Expert’s Guide to Long-Term Brain Health. “Take up an interest, the earlier in life the better, and do a lot of mental work trying to learn more stuff. You can link it to social interaction, which is very important.”Work your mind as hard as your bodyView image in fullscreenWorkouts aren’t just for your biceps – train your brain with word challenges.Photograph: Posed by models; Caia Image/Getty Images/Collection Mix“You need to exercise the brain every day, particularly with memory,” says Restak. At 83, he is still writing books. What is his secret? “I think, in my case, it is mostly training the brain. I walk and have a sensible diet, but I’m not cultish about it. If my wife brings back some pastries, I will certainly have one.”What’s his training? “Every day I try to learn a new word,” says Restak. “The word today is turveydrop – based on a character in [Charles Dickens’s] Bleak House – and is someone who is just interested in looking important. If somebody calls you that, it’s not a compliment.” He keeps lists of all his daily words to refer back to, if his memory fails him.But don’t narrow your training too much, he adds. “Remembering particular things is only good for the area in which they are applied, so that you become a good crossword puzzler or a great Scrabble player. I lose at Scrabble all the time. I think I’ve got a pretty good vocabulary, but Scrabble is its own world.”Learn something new, be it the flute or FrenchView image in fullscreen‘People who play musical instruments are less likely to have cognitive impairment.’Photograph: Posed by model; Krisada tepkulmanont/Getty Images“Learning is harder when you are older,” says Solomon, “but it helps as you mature.” He played piano as a child, then took it up again 10 years ago. “People who play musical instruments are less likely to have cognitive impairment because it is all about using the brain.” The same goes for learning languages. With both, “You’re using very different parts of your brain. If you don’t do any of those things, there are whole chunks of your brain that are not really being used.”Get help with hearing and vision problems“Deafness is one of the characteristics that theLancet Commission has identifiedas being an important risk factor for dementia,” says Davenport. “It’s the same for vision. Anything that leads you to less interaction with the outside world is likely to be detrimental.” There is less evidence on the effects of reduced vision, he says, “but if your vision deteriorates, you’re going to stop driving, you may stop going out so much, and all of those things start to lead to social isolation, like deafness. Keep on top of your senses; make sure you can hear and see.”Interestingly, Davenport adds, “sense of smell is often an early symptom of some of the degenerative diseases. No one is suggesting losing your sense of smell leads to them. It is probably just an early symptom, particularly in Parkinson’s disease.”Wear a helmetDavenport is a keen cyclist. Does he wear a helmet? “Absolutely. There is good evidence that helmets do protect you.” He refers to the debate around the effect of repeated head injuries in sports such as rugby and football, and their role in neurodegenerative disease: “There is still quite a lot to be unravelled about that, but it makes sense to try to protect your head from unnecessary injury. Where you need to be careful, of course, is that we know that physical exercise is very good for people, and therefore you don’t want to stop kids playing football. But maybe easing up on heading the ball, which is already happening.”Accept that some memory loss is to be expectedO’Sullivan points out that memory decline starts in your 30s. “We all are increasingly forgetful over time,” Solomon agrees. Don’t worry, he says, if, for example: “You go upstairs for a jumper, and then you get upstairs and you can’t remember what you’ve gone up there for. That’s not a reason to see the doctor.” He says that thedifference is obvious between patientswho have dementia and those who are experiencing normal forgetfulness: “When I say to these patients, ‘Why have you come to see me?’, they turn their head to look at the relative who is with them, because they have no idea why they are there.”This article was amended on 30 April 2025 to clarify how much alcohol is considered safe to consume.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe expertsDementiaMental healthFitnessHealthAlzheimer'sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You wondered if this was a step too far for Mikel Arteta’s men.They did improve in the second half, but PSG should have extended their lead at the end.

No, I didn’t see that coming. I didn’t see universities and big law firms bending the knee so quickly.”Hasan discusses the impact of Trump’s first 100 days on people in the US and around the world, his plan to run for a third term, how the Democrats are performing and why public movements are the only way to resist the dismantling of democratic norms.“My greatest hope is that the American people – not all of them, I think 30 to 40% are unreachable – but the vast majority of them recognise the peril that American democracy is in, the peril that the American economy is in, and the peril that the globe is in, and actually do take to the streets, do take to town halls, and do take to the ballot box, eventually, when we get there in ’26, to say this was a huge mistake that we did twice.”Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: Evan Vucci/APExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpToday in FocusTrump administrationUS politics"

Photographer Alex Elton-Wall explains allAnn LeeWed 30 Apr 2025 10.25 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 10.26 EDTShareA sofa was dumped in the middle of Lydbrook, a village in Gloucestershire, and every time Alex Elton-Wall walked past it he found himself smiling. While he’s clear he doesn’t condone fly-tipping, the cream-coloured two-seater looked “really funny,” he says, perched on a patch of waste ground, next to a road, the woods as a scenic backdrop. As an amateur photographer, he spotted an opportunity.At the start of April, a few weeks after the sofa first appeared, the 49-year-old office worker posted a message in the village Facebook group asking for people to come and pose on the sofa so he could take their portraits. That day, he says, “I ended up taking pictures from 10 in the morning until eight o’clock that night. People were just having so much fun, and it was so bizarre what we were doing.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Elton-Wall/SWNSView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Elton-Wall/SWNSSince then, Elton-Wall has staged more photoshoots and taken pictures of more than 170 locals with the sofa – and even a few animals, including a tortoise, a chicken and a horse. His photoshoots have made the sofa a surprise tourist attraction, rising up the Tripadvisor rankings to become thesecond-best thing to do in Lydbrook(pipped only by an alpaca farm). It even has its own dedicatedFacebook page, called Lydbrook Lounge, where visitors post their own pictures. “It’s become a real community and feelgood thing,” says Elton-Wall. “You know, life’s tough, the world’s pretty crazy at the moment, but people have really embraced this.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Elton-Wall/SWNSView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Elton-Wall/SWNSItems started appearing mysteriously around the sofa; a side table with a plant pot, a hat stand, a lampshade, a rug, a coffee table and a magazine rack. Elton-Wall thinks this could be the work of a secret local artist, nicknamed Tumpsy, who was responsible for a spate of googly eyes that cropped up around the village a few years ago.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Elton-Wall/SWNSView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Elton-Wall/SWNS“I kept meaning to stop taking photos, but people kept asking me,” says Elton-Wall. He’s taken photos of the kids’ football team, staff from the local cafe serving afternoon tea, and the owner of the local timber yard posing with chainsaws – all with the sofa. “I’ve got pictures of everything from kids jumping up and down on the sofa to a couple of blokes drinking pints, who were kidnapped from the local pub.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Elton-Wall/SWNSView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Elton-Wall/SWNSElton-Wall, who has lived in Lydbrook for nearly 20 years, has decided to create a photo book, which he will sell at the village fete in the summer to raise money for playground equipment. “It was just this amazing opportunity to capture a snapshot in time of the community,” he says.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Elton-Wall/SWNSView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex Elton-WallYesterday, without warning, the project ended. The sofa, and all the items surrounding it, suddenly disappeared. Elton-Wall has no idea who took them and says he has mixed emotions. “At the end of the day, fly-tipping is not to be condoned. People in the village were always clear that it would be disposed of properly.” Looking at all the comments online, mourning the loss of the sofa, one stood out to him: “Don’t be sad it’s over, be glad it happened.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographyThe Guardian picture essayTripadvisorShareReuse this content"

The officers were never prosecuted and are all now dead.The families criticised Ramaphosa’s decision that an inquiry should assess their claims for “constitutional damages” – their high court case asked for 167m rand (£7.3m) to fund further investigations and litigation, as well as memorials and public education – and said that their rights were violated.They said in astatementthat an inquiry would have no authority over these areas and would only be able to offer advice. “This fundamental shortcoming was pointed out to the president’s legal team, as well as the fact that it will likely result in the issues remaining unresolved for years. This will perpetuate the pain and trauma that the families and survivors have experienced for many years.”South Africa’s governments have been led by the African National Congress party of Nelson Mandela since the end of apartheid over 30 years ago.In March, Thabo Mbeki, who was president from 1999 to 2008, and the former justice minister Brigitte Mabandla applied to intervene in the families’ high court case.

The robbers failed to get the kettle and iron working, so were unable to burn anyone. Then the gun trigger jammed when they tried to shoot Kyle in the spine.“They specifically said they were coming back for this farm … [that] it was their land,” said the 43-year-old, who did not want to use his full name. “Only afterwards, we found out that the guy that stays on the plot was actually killed … the farmhand … I don’t know what his name was.”Kyle, a divorced father of three, is one of thousands of white South Africans hoping to take up Donald Trump’soffer of refugee status, to escape crime and what they allege is discrimination against white people.The Trump administration’ssupport for these claims, whilestopping other new refugee arrivals, has inflamed uncomfortable conversations about how far racial reconciliation still has to go, three decades after the end of white minority rule.The US president’s offer was a “godsend”, said Kyle, now a salesman working remotely for an overseas company: “I’ve got white children, they’re at the bottom of the hiring list here. So, there is no future for them. And the sad thing is they don’t even know what apartheid is.”White Afrikaner governments racially segregated every aspect of life from relationships to where people were allowed to live during apartheid, repressing South Africa’s Black majority while keeping the white minority safe and much better off.South Africa remains deeply unequal, more than 30 years since the system ended. The black South Africanunemployment rate is 46.1%, for example, compared with 9.2% for white people.As a white Afrikaner, I can claim asylum in Trump’s America. What an absurdity | Max du PreezRead moreAffirmative action has created a Black elite, but also nurtured feelings of disfranchisement among some white South Africans. Less than two-thirds of white South Africans agreed that apartheid deprived black people of their livelihoods, v three-quarters of Black South Africans, according to the2023 Reconciliation Barometer, a survey by the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation, a thinktank.Kate Lefko-Everett, the report’s author, said: “The level of contact and interaction between South Africans of different race groups has not really changed substantially.”South Africa’s high violent crime rate – in the last quarter of 2024 there were almost 7,000 murders, according topolice figures– affects everyone. But it has also added to a siege mentality among some white people. Almost two-thirds of white people were considering emigrating, compared with 27% of all South Africans, according to 2022 Afrobarometer data.More than 8,200 people have registered their interest in US refugee status, the New York Timesreportedin March. The US embassy in Pretoria refused to comment.Chilly Chomse, a 43-year-old carpenter, said he wanted to claim asylum for the sake of his four daughters.View image in fullscreenChilly Chomse: ‘You’re not safe.’He moved to Orania, awhite, Afrikaner-only town, for work during the Covid-19 pandemic, but said he was not committed like some residents: “Once you leave this Orania premises, you are still in South Africa … you’re not safe and you can’t remain here 24/7 for the rest of your life.”While some white English-speaking South Africans like Kyle hope the refugee programme will include them too, Trump’s February executiveorderreferred to “ethnic minority Afrikaners”. It claimed a recently signed South African law that allows land expropriation in limited circumstances would enable the government to seize Afrikaners’ property, while state policy was “fuelling disproportionate violence against racially disfavoured landowners” (a longstandingfar-right claim).When Esté Richter, a friend of Chomse’s in Orania, heard about Trump’s refugee policy, she initially did not believe it. “Then I felt that someone has heard us, finally, that someone has heard the cries of Afrikaners,” said Richter, 35, who homeschools her two children and helps her husband with plumbing jobs.“The main reason why we are looking at the refugee programme is in September 2022 my husband’s father was murdered on his farm,” she said. Richter’s mother-in-law was burned with a hot iron, beaten up and abandoned in the bush, but survived.View image in fullscreenThe Richter family: ‘Someone has heard the cries of Afrikaners.’Photograph: Courtesy of Esté RichterTheAfrikaner rights group AfriForummet Trump allies in the US during his first term,claimingthe South African government was “complicit” in white farmer murders. The group, which has 300,000 members, continues toclaimthat “Afrikaners are the target”.Rudolph Zinn, a University of Limpopo professor, noted South African police data onfarm attacks– whichlisted12 “farming community” murders in the final quarter of 2024 – included black smallholder farms and non-commercial plots.He said: “It’s definitely not linked to any political motive or a specific race. It’s all about the money.”Zinn said imprisoned farm robbers he interviewed said they would tailor their language to instil as much fear as possible to get victims to hand over cash and valuables. “If it’s a white victim, then they would say: ‘I hate you because you’ve taken our land.’ But the very same offender would, when it’s a Black victim, say: ‘You’re a coconut, black on the outside, but inside you’re white.’”View image in fullscreenOrania, a white, Afrikaner-only town.Photograph: Sisipho Skweyiya/ReutersBoth AfriForum, which promotes staying in South Africa, and the prospective refugees raised the controversialKill the Boersong as a reason for their fears. A South African court ruled in 2022 that the song, sung by the populist, far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party at political rallies, was not meant literally.Others said South Africa risked a “white genocide”, a conspiratorial claim repeated by Trump’sbillionaire, South African-born adviser Elon Musk.Sam Busa, a 60-year-old business consultant of British descent, wants to claim asylum for herself and her three adult sons. She set up an “Amerikaners”websiteand social media pages to disseminate information, and gathered 30,000 signaturesto thank Trumpfor offering refugee status.She said: “We’re in, in my personal opinion, an advanced stage of a genocide potentially unfolding.

The supreme court had ordered the administration to return Ábrego García to the US so that he would face immigration proceedings as he would have, had he not been sent toEl Salvador.Kristi Noem says Kilmar Ábrego García would be deported immediately if sent back to USRead moreThe discussions appeared to be an effort by the Trump administration to window dress the underlying legal case and build a paper trail it could reference before the US district judge Paula Xinis, whopreviously ruledthat Donald Trump raising the matter in the Oval Office was insufficient.Ábrego García has since been moved out ofCecot, the mega-prison officials known as the terrorism confinement center, to another prison in El Salvador since the supreme court ruling which the administration has repeatedly tried to manufacture uncertainty around or otherwise misrepresent.The recalcitrance from the US administration to comply has been on display for weeks as senior Trump advisers have become increasingly determined to use it as a case to test the extent of presidential power and its boast that the courts have no practical way to ensure quick compliance with orders.At a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said he would “never tell” if he had been in touch with Bukele. CNN earlier reported Rubio has had discussions with Bukele directly. The New York Timesreportedthere had been a diplomatic note sent to Bukele.“I would never tell you that. And you know who else I’ll never tell? A judge,” Rubio said as he sat next to Trump, adding it was “because the conduct of our foreign policy belongs to the president to the united states and the executive branch, not some judge”.And in aninterview with ABC Newsthat aired the night before, the US president himself said he “could” tell El Salvador to return Ábrego García.When it was raised to him that he had the ability to call Bukele and say “send him back right now”, Trump deflected responsibility. “I’m not the one making this decision. We have lawyers that don’t want to do this,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a 15% chance of an earthquake greater than 8.0 magnitude on the fault in the next 50 years, the study states.“The expansion of the coastal floodplain following a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake has not been previously quantified, and the impacts to land use could significantly increase the timeline to recovery,” said Tina Dura, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of geosciences at Virginia Tech,tolda university publication.While climate-driven sea level rise happens gradually, these changes would unfold in an instant and persist over decades to centuries, Dura and the study’s other authors write. The most significant impacts would occur in “densely populated” parts of southern Washington, northern Oregon and northernCalifornia. And if the next major earthquake took place in 2100 – there is a 29% chance of one greater than 8.0 magnitude by then – with climate-driven sea level rise, some “low-lying” areas along the fault might never recover, according to the study.Elephants at San Diego zoo form ‘alert circle’ to protect young during quakeRead moreThe authors wrote that they hoped the findings could support decision-makers and coastal communities better prepare for hazards caused by an earthquake and climate-driven sea-level rise.“Preparing for these compound hazards can minimize long-term damage, ensure resilient communities, and protect critical coastal ecosystems from permanent degradation,” the authors wrote.The last great earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone took place in 1700 and brought sudden sea level rise of more than six feet in minutes and generated a huge tsunami that destroyed seaside settlements and created effects seen as far as Japan.Recent research suggests that a 9.0 magnitude quake on the Cascadia subduction zone could lead to more than 30,000 deaths, 170,000 damaged or destroyed structures on the coast, and economic impacts of more than $81bn. A 2022studyfound that a tsunami caused by a major earthquake could exceed 200ft high.Explore more on these topicsEarthquakesWest CoastCanadaAmericasTsunamisNatural disastersCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

He is anEl Salvadorcitizen. He is home there in his country. If he were to be brought back to the United States of America, we would immediately deport him again,” Noem said of the 29-year-old who entered the US illegally around 2011 after fleeing gang violence.Ábrego García was subsequentlyaffordeda federal protection order against deportation to El Salvador. Despite the order, on 15 March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials deported Ábrego García to El Salvador where he was held in the Center for Terrorism Confinement, acontroversial mega-prison.Though the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego García’s deportation was an“administrative error”, it has repeatedly cast him as an MS-13 gang member on television – a claim his wife, a US citizen, and his attorneys staunchly reject. Ábrego García has no criminal record in the US,according tocourt documents.Since Ábrego García’s deportation, the Trump administration has refused to bring him back to the US – despite the supreme courtunanimously orderingit to “facilitate” his release. Trump officials claim that US courts lack jurisdiction over the matter because Ábrego García is a Salvadorian national and no longer in the US.Noem asserted the Trump administration’s claims to CBS, saying: “President Trump and his administration has adhered to the court and respects the court and its decision,” adding, “This individual is not under the United States of America’s jurisdiction and he is not one of our citizens. He is home in his home country. And that’s up to that country to decide what to do.”Last week, a federal judgeaccusedthe White House of “bad faith” in the case, arguing that “defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this court’s orders”.Yet, Noem maintains that the Trump administration spends “hours and hours” building cases against alleged gang members.Upon being asked about the administration’s claims against individuals who have been deported without due process, the homeland security secretary said: “Obviously, we’re relying on the expertise of our investigators, our teams, double-checking, triple-checking, going through the paperwork, making sure that we have done everything absolutely correctly.”Noem also accused federal judges who have issued court orders the Trump administration dislikes as “activist judges”.“I’m sure that these judges will continue to challenge every single thing that this administration does. We have several activist judges across the country,” she said, despite some of the judges who haveruled againstTrump’s immigration policies being nominated by Republicans.Earlier this month, J Harvie Wilkinson, a Ronald Reagan-appointee and conservative appellate judge,calledthe Trump administration’s claims in Ábrego García’s case “shocking”, saying: “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”Explore more on these topicsKilmar Ábrego GarcíaKristi NoemTrump administrationEl SalvadorUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Ina social media video, Zema hurled a mock-up of the red shirt on to the ground in theatrical disgust.Bolsonaro’s politician son, Flávio Bolsonaro, said the supposed plans needed “vehemently repudiating”, insisting: “Our flag isn’t red – and it never will be.”But Bolsonaristas are not the only ones up in arms about the reported attempt to swap Brazil’s blue away shirt – in use since the country won the first of its five World Cup, in 1958 – for a red one.Football purists of all political stripes have clobbered the “leaked” plans since they surfaced on Monday ina viral reportby the football website Footy Headlines.The idea has proved so controversial that the CBF was forced to deny it on Tuesday insisting online images of the red jersey were not official and that it remained committed to yellow and blue shirts. The kit for next year’s World Cup had yet to be designed in partnership with Brazil’s official kit supplier Nike, the CBF claimed.Walter Casagrande, a Lula-voting former player and commentator who is associated with Brazil’s left and pro-democracy movement, called the scheme “idiocy”.Sports writer Paulo Vinícius Coelhosaidthe move showed “a complete lack of sense” and was almost certainly commercially driven.Galvão Bueno, Brazil’s most famous TV commentator, called the idea “a crime” and a “gigantic insult” to the glorious history of a national team which has won more World Cups than any other country.Some leftwing Brazilians were more receptive to the idea of a crimson kit. Over the past decade the country’s iconic yellow jersey has becomea symbol of the far rightand is regularly worn at pro-Bolsonaro rallies. Many progressivesnow refuse to wear it.Ina pro-red shirt manifesto, columnist Milly Lacombe declared that she would wear the jersey with pride and rejected the outbreak of “collective hysteria” over the mooted shirt. “Red is a strong colour that stands for revolution, change, transformation, blood, struggle, life, death, rebirth,” she wrote.Juca Kfouri, a left-leaning football writer who is among those who shun the yellow shirt,also rejected the “bad taste” change, arguing that a red shirt would further fuel the toxic politics swirling around the national team’s attire and divide supporters.“Red doesn’t have anything to do with Brazil,” Kfouri said, although he noted that Brazil took its name from a redwood tree calledpau-brasil(brazilwood in English) and, in the early 19th century,had red in its first flag.Kfouri suspected the red shirt story was “a trial balloon” devised to see how the money-making ruse went down with fans. “Just like politicians sometimes leak a policy, wait to see how the social networks react and, depending on that reaction, give up or move ahead,” he said.For the CBF, the hoo-ha was also a helpful diversion as it sought to shift attention away from its apparent failure to recruit the Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, as Brazil’s next manager anda compromising exposéin a Brazilian magazine. “It distracts from the things that really matter,” Kfouri said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilWorld CupAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the halted deportations.It was a reprieve for the group of Venezuelans detained at Bluebonnet, who still face being potentially sent toCecot, the notoriousmaximum security prison in El Salvadorwhere the Trump administration has sent at least 137 Venezuelans under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, if the supreme court lifts the block.The Bluebonnet facility, located 200 miles (322km) west of Dallas, is privately run by the Management and Training Corporation under a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Named after the state flower ofTexas, it has held an average of 846 detainees a day in fiscal year 2025, according to Ice detention data.Denied access to the Bluebonnet facility by Ice, Reuters flew a small plane over the center last week as well as a drone nearby on 28 April to gather aerial images of the detainees being held there. Some of the detainees photographed by Reuters were wearing red jumpsuits designating them as high risk.Millan was moved to Bluebonnet in mid-April from the Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia, where he had been held since he was arrested by immigration agents in the Atlanta suburbs on 12 March, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official. Reuters could not find a criminal record for Millan, who had been working in construction. The DHS official said Millan was a “documented” member ofTren de Aragua, but provided no evidence.The DHS official said Ice detained Escalona in January 2025, after he was arrested by local Texas police for evading arrest in a vehicle. He arrived at Bluebonnet after he was returned from the US migrant detention facility in Guantánamo Bay in February.The DHS official said Escalona was a “self-admitted” Tren de Aragua member but did not provide evidence of the claim.During a phone interview from Bluebonnet, Escalona said he had no ties to Tren de Aragua or any gang. He was a police officer inVenezuela, he said. When they detained him, US authorities took his phone and he suspects they saw photos of him making hand gestures that he said were common in Venezuela.“They’re making false accusations about me,” he said. “I don’t belong to any gang.”Escalona said that he has asked to return voluntarily to Venezuela but was denied.“I fear for my life here,” he said. “I want to go to Venezuela.”Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have come to the United States over the past few years, fleeing economic collapse and what critics call an authoritarian crackdown under President Nicolás Maduro.Under the administration of Joe Biden, many were given temporary humanitarian protections that theTrump administrationis trying to revoke.‘He’s just a kid’: the Maryland teenager swept into Trump immigration dragnetRead more‘He is desperate’Since their aborted deportation, the men have been on edge, their families say.In Millan’s dorm, he and some of the other Venezuelan men take turns sleeping so that they can alert family members if immigration officers come to deport them, according to Millan’s wife, who asked not to be named for fear of being targeted by immigration officials.One day last week, he told her the men in the dorm refused to go out into the yard because they were worried they would be put on another bus and sent toEl Salvador.“He is desperate,” Millan’s wife said. “He told me that when he walked out onto the field, he sat down and looked at the sky and asked God to get him out of there soon.”In one recent video call, Millan told his wife that they have not been given much food, and he tries to sleep more so that he is not so hungry, she said, something that other detainees’ relatives echoed.A spokesperson for Management and Training Corporation, which runs the facility, said: “All detainees housed at Bluebonnet receive meals based on a menu that has been approved by a certified dietitian, ensuring the recommended daily caloric intake is met.”In a statement, DHS said it “uses multiple strategies to manage capacity while maintaining compliance with federal standards and our commitment to humane treatment”.On Saturday, animmigration official visited Escalona’s dorm and answered some of the detainees’ questions, according to an audio recording of the visit obtained by Reuters.The men, talking over each other frantically, wanted to know why the government was trying to send them to El Salvador and what was happening with their immigration court dates.The official explained that the US had tried to remove them under the Alien Enemies Act, which was a separate process from their scheduled immigration court hearings.“If he gets removed under the Alien Enemies Act, then that court date doesn’t exist, he’ll never have that court date,” the official said in English to someone who was translating.Donald Trump wants to crack down on ‘sanctuary cities’. What does that mean?Read moreSeveral of the men wanted to know how it was possible for them to be classified as “alien enemies” when they were not gang members and had committed no crime.“If I don’t have a criminal record in the three countries in which I have lived in, how are they going to send me to El Salvador?” one of the men in the recording asked. Reuters was not immediately able to establish his identity.The official said he was not involved in the intelligence gathering.Several of the men had court hearings in their immigration cases last week and advocates scrambled to find lawyers for them.Millan has a pending asylum case and his next hearing is scheduled for May 1, unless he is sent to El Salvador before then.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationVenezuelaEl SalvadorUS immigrationTexasAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Such a move could put itsupcoming London stock exchange listingon hold.The figures predate Trump’s April announcement that he wasscrapping the tariff exemption on parcel imports worth up to $800 (£598)from 2 May. But they highlight how China’s e-commerce platforms have diverted marketing efforts to Europe in anticipation of US tariffs to come.From May, US consumers may experience something akin to the Brexit effect that made many low-value imports prohibitively expensive for UK online shoppers, because of the overnight change in trading rules with the EU.Punishing US tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods have already come into force, sending prices rocketing on both Temu and Shein.Temu is passing on nearly all its import taxes to the consumer, with the average price of 100 products in two categories – toys and games, and health and beauty – jumping by more than 40% in the last two weeks, according to analysis by Bloomberg.CNBC reported that a summer dress listed on Temu for $18.47 (£13.83) will cost $44.68 after $26.21 in import charges are added to the bill – a 142% surcharge.Meanwhile, the cost of a child’s swimsuit almost triples from $12.44 to $31.12 when the $18.68 import charge is taken into account. A handheld vacuum cleaner listed at $16.93 now costs $40.11 when factoring in the additional fee.On Tuesday, the Chinese government sent a defiant video message to Trump, warning it would not “kneel down” in the face of the punitive tariffs.“Bowing to a bully is like drinking poison to quench thirst,” it said in the English-language statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But observers have voiced concerns that regulatory oversight in the country hasfailed to keep up with the rush to develop minesto satisfy booming global demand.Leaked documents seen by the Guardian suggest a source of drinking water close to a$1bn (£800m) mining projectowned by the Indonesia-based Harita Group on remote Obi Island, was contaminated with unsafe levels of hexavalent chromium (Cr6), the cancer-causing chemical more widely known for its role in theErin Brockovich story and film.Cr6 cancause liver damage, reproductive problems and developmental harmwhen ingested or inhaled. Long-term exposure through drinking water has alsobeenlinked to stomach cancer. Evidence has shown thatCr6 in drinking water can bea result of industrial processes.Map showing Obi Island, IndonesiaThe leak comes after aGuardian investigation into pollutionat the site in 2022 was disputed by the mining company, which extracts and processes nickel for use in EV batteries.For the 2022 investigation, water samples collected from a spring in the village of Kawasi, less than 200 metres from the mining site, were tested at government-certified laboratories and suggested high levels of contamination fromcarcinogenic Cr6of 60 parts per billion (ppb). Themaximum contaminant levelallowed by law in Indonesia is 50ppb.In response to the Guardian’s original investigation, a Harita company said its own results had shown that the spring water was suitable for consumption and met the quality standards set by the Indonesian government.However, the leaked documents and emails suggest a Harita company found the Cr6 values in Kawasi spring, used as drinking water by villagers, in excess of Indonesian quality standards just one day after its statement to the contrary. It then found even higher values in subsequent days.

Chinese exports soared more than 12% last month as businesses rushed toget ahead of the punishing tariffs.The impact of the measures began to show in official data on Wednesday, with the purchasing managers’ index – a key measure of industrial output – falling to 49.0 in April, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the lowest reading since December 2023. Anything below the 50-point mark signifies a contraction.Xi announces plan for Chinese economy to counter impact of US trade warRead moreThe reading for April represented a steeper decline than the 49.7 forecast in a Bloomberg survey. It was down from March’s 50.5, which was the highest figure in 12 months.Zhao Qinghe, an NBS statistician, said the drop was largely down to “sharp changes in [China’s] external environment”.Economists have warned that the disruption in trade between the tightly integrated US and Chinese economies could threaten businesses, increase prices for consumers and cause a global recession.“The weak manufacturing PMI in April is driven by the trade war,” Zhiwei Zhang, the president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, wrote in a note. “The macro data in China and the US will weaken further … as the trade policy uncertainty delays business decisions.”Goldman Sachs has estimated that 16m jobs in China could be at risk if the high tariffs persist, mainly in the export, wholesale and retail industries.A new US measure to close a loophole that had allowed low-value goods to be shipped into the US for free comes into effect on Friday, which will mainly affect Chinese businesses.More than 90% of packages arriving in the US come underthe “de minimis” scheme, which allows items with a value under $800 (£599) to evade duties. From Friday, those goods, which have fuelled the rise of e-commerce companies such as Temu and Shein, will be subject to a 120% levy or a flat fee.China sends back new Boeing jet made more expensive by tariffsRead moreChina’s economy, the world’s second largest, has struggled to fully recover since the Covid pandemic and is also grappling with sluggish domestic demand and a protracted property sector crisis.“China’s economy is coming under pressure as external demand cools,” said Zichun Huang, a China economist at CapitalEconomics, in a note. “Although the government is stepping up fiscal support, this is unlikely to fully offset the drag, and we expect the economy to expand just 3.5% this year.”Authorities last year announced a slew of aggressive stimulus measures aimed at boosting growth, including rate cuts and the easing of some home purchasing restrictions.On top of this, leaders at a key political meeting vowed to create 12m urban jobs in 2025 in March.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The city was renamed Ho Chi Minh city shortly after the war, in honour of the North’s founding leader.“It was a victory of justice over tyranny,” To Lam, Vietnam’s Communist party chief and the country’s top leader, said on Wednesday, citing one of Ho Chi Minh’s mottoes: “Vietnam is one, the Vietnamese people are one. Rivers may dry up, mountains may erode, but that truth will never change.“The fall of Saigon, about two years after Washington withdrew its last combat troops from the country, marked the end of a 20-year conflict that killed some 3 million Vietnamese people and nearly 60,000 Americans, many of them young soldiers conscripted into the military.“Communist troops rolled into the South Vietnamese capital virtually unopposed, to the great relief of the population which had feared a bloody last-minute battle,” said a cable from one of the Reuters reporters in the city on the day it fell.The cable described the victorious army as made up of “formidably armed” troops in jungle green fatigues but also of barefoot teenagers.View image in fullscreenParticipants wave flags as they march during a parade marking the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam war.Photograph: Nhac Nguyen/AFP/Getty ImagesThose events were seared into many memories by the images of US helicopters evacuating some 7,000 people, many of them Vietnamese, as North Vietnamese tanks closed in. The final flight took off from the roof of the US embassy at 7.53am on 30 April, carrying the last US Marines out of Saigon.The formal reunification of Vietnam was completed a year later, 22 years after the country had been split in two following the end of French colonial rule.Vietnam and the United States normalised diplomatic relations in 1995 and deepened ties in 2023 during a visit to Hanoi by former US President Joe Biden.“The United States and Vietnam have a robust bilateral relationship that we are committed to deepening and broadening,” a spokesperson for the US Mission in Vietnam said on Wednesday.That bond is however now being tested by the threat of crippling 46% tariffs on Vietnamese goods that Biden’s successor, Donald Trump, announced in April.View image in fullscreenChinese troops march during a parade to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam war in Ho Chi Minh CityPhotograph: Achmad Ibrahim/APThe tariffs have been largely paused until July and talks are under way. But if confirmed, they could undermine Vietnam’s export-led growth that has attracted large foreign investments.Washington sent Susan Burns, its consul general in Ho Chi Minh city, to represent the country at the parade.While Hanoi has re-established relations with the US, it has maintained close ties with Russia, which is its top supplier of weapons.Vietnam has also nurtured closer relations with northern neighbour China despite a complex history involving several conflicts and a rivalry in the disputed South China Sea.View image in fullscreenSoldiers march during a parade marking the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam warPhotograph: Manan Vatsyayana/AFP/Getty ImagesChina is now a major investor in its economy and the source of many of the components that are used in products that are then exported to the USExplore more on these topicsVietnamAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Australia’s election campaign began on 28 March.“Things somewhat seem to be moving in the right direction there… those efforts are strictly political in nature and don’t require me to engage with the United States government.”1:33Trump campaign strategist Chris LaCivita talks to undercover reporters – videoLaCivita told the undercover reporters in a second call on 24 April he made the trip without publicity. He contrasts this to media reporting abouthis paid work with Albania’s opposition party.“Never knew I was there,” he said, in reference to his claimed visit to Australia. “I try to maintain a degree of discretion … it just it gives us a degree of freedom of movement.”ACoalitionspokesman denied LaCivita had any connection to the Dutton campaign.“Mr LaCivita is not advising, has never advised, and is not involved in any way with the Coalition campaign. Mr Dutton has not met with him.”In a statement, LaCivita told Guardian Australia: “I did not and do not work for the Liberal Party of Australia. I provide consulting to a wide variety of business interests – some in Australia some in the US etc in terms of a political party – I have not.“Also, I have never met Mr Dutton, but I hope to when he is elected prime minister.”LaCivita was Trump’s co-campaign manager in his successful 2024 presidential run, along with the current White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.Trump thanked LaCivita in his victory speech and LaCivita briefly took the microphone to thank the president, saying Trump was “a hell of a candidate, and he’s going to be a hell of a great 47th president”.Visits and knowledge-sharing between like minded political parties and consultants are not uncommon in election campaigns.Anthony Albanese has previously talked up ties with UK Labour. The ALP’s campaign boss Paul Erickson offered advice to strategists working to elect Sir Keir Starmer ahead of the UK’s 2024 election. Erickson was later invited to present at Labour’s annual party conference.A US Marine veteran who received a Purple Heart for service in the first Gulf War, LaCivita helped craft the infamous Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign, considered a fatal blow for Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in his 2004 race against George W Bush.Dutton has distanced himself from associations with Trump during the campaign after initially pursuing policies that nodded to parts of the US president’s agenda – promising to sack 41,000 public servants,announcing a role for senator Jacinta Nampinjinpa Pricein pursuing “government efficiency”,claiming students were being “indoctrinated”by the school curriculum and denouncing the ABC and Guardian Australia as “hate media”.During the second leaders’ debate of the campaign,Dutton said: “We trust the US. I don’t know the president. I’ve not met him.”Labor has tried to tie Dutton to Trump-style politics as polling showed voters were increasingly uncomfortable with the actions of the US president, particularly following the implementation of trade tariffs. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has labelled the opposition leader “Dogey Dutton”, referring to the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) set up by Trump under the leadership of Elon Musk.Labor is likely to point to claims about LaCivita’s visit as more evidence Dutton’s agenda is being guided by the unpopular Trump, but it also signals close ties between the Coalition and key members of the president’s inner circle, likely advantageous if Dutton wins Saturday’s election.Campaigning in Western Australia, Albanese said Dutton was concerned with fighting “culture wars”.“The campaign of the Liberal party has become more and more right-wing under Peter Dutton. That’s just the truth of the matter,” he said.LaCivita’s credentials within Trump’s orbit are strong.Donald TrumpJr. called him “a supremely competent nuts-and-bolts guy,” in an interview with New York magazine.“He doesn’t care about getting credit, he doesn’t care about stroking his own ego, he only cares about getting the job done and delivering for my father,” Trump Jr. said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025CoalitionAustralian politicsPeter DuttonDonald TrumpRepublicansLiberal partynewsShareReuse this content"

And to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.”Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, confirmed in a social media post that she had signed the agreement on Wednesday. “Together with the United States, we are creating the fund that will attract global investment into our country,” she wrote. The deal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament.Ukrainian officials have divulged details of the agreement which they portrayed as equitable and allowing Ukraine to maintain control over its natural resources.The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said that the fund would be split 50-50 with between the US and Ukraine and give each side equal voting rights.Ukraine would retain “full control over its mineral resources, infrastructure and natural resources,” he said, and would relate only to new investments, meaning that the deal would not provide for any debt obligations against Ukraine, a key concern for Kyiv. The deal would ensure revenue by establishing contracts on a “take-or-pay” basis, Shmyhal added.Shmyhal on Wednesday described the deal as “truly a good, equal and beneficial international agreement on joint investments in the development and recovery of Ukraine”.Critics of the deal had said the White House is seeking to take advantage of Ukraine by linking future aid to the embattled nation to a giveaway of the revenues from its resources. The final terms were far less onerous for Ukraine than those proposed initially by Bessent in February, which included a clause that the US would control 100% of the revenues from the fund.It was unclear up until the last moment whether the US and Ukraine would manage to sign the deal, with Washington reportedly pressuring Ukraine to sign additional agreements, including on the structure of the investment fund, or to “go back home”. That followed months of strained negotiations during which the US regularly delivered last-minute ultimatums while cutting off aid and other support for Ukraine in its defence againstRussia.Ukraine’s prime minister earlier had said he expected the country to sign the minerals deal with the US in “the next 24 hours” but reports emerged that Washington was insisting Kyiv sign three deals in total.The Financial Times said Bessent’s team had told Svyrydenko, who was reportedly en route to Washington DC, to “be ready to sign all agreements, or go back home”.Bessent later said the US was ready to sign though Ukraine had made some last-minute changes.Reuters reported that Ukraine believed the two supplementary agreements – reportedly on an investment fund and a technical document – required more work.The idea behind the deal was originally proposed by Ukraine, looking for ways to offer economic opportunities that might entice Trump to back the country. But Kyiv was blindsided in January when Trump’s team delivered a document that would essentially involve handing over the country’s mineral wealth with little by way of return.Since then, there have been various attempts to revise and revisit the terms of the deal, as well as a planned signing ceremony that was aborted after a disastrous meeting between Trump andVolodymyr Zelenskyyat the White House in February.Earlier this month, it was revealed that the Ukrainian justice ministry had hired US law firm Hogan Lovells to advise on the negotiations over the deal, according to filings with the US Foreign Agents Registration Act registry.In apost on Facebook, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko gave further details of the fund, which she said would “attract global investment”.She confirmed thatUkrainewould retain full ownership of resources “on our territory and in territorial waters belong to Ukraine”. “It is the Ukrainian state that determines where and what to extract,” she said.There would be no changes to ownership of state-owned companies, she said, “they will continue to belong to Ukraine”. That included companies such as Ukrnafta, Ukraine’s largest oil producer, and nuclear energy producer Energoatom.Income would come from new licences for critical materials and oil and gas projects, not from projects which had already begun, she said.Income and contributions to the fund would not be taxed in the US or Ukraine, she said, “to make investments yield the greatest results”.Razom for Ukraine, a US nonprofit that provides medical and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and advocates for US assistance, welcomed the deal, and encouraged the Trump administration to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the invasion. “We encourage the Trump administration to build on the momentum of this economic agreement by forcing Putin to the table through sanctions, seizing Russia’s state assets to aid Ukraine, and giving Ukraine the tools it needs to defend itself,” Mykola Murskyj, director of advocacy for Razom, said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUkraineDonald TrumpRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Renewables work in a stable way.”Sánchez himself has been blunter. “Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear power are frankly lying or demonstrating their ignorance,” he said on Tuesday, adding that nuclear power generation was no more resilient than other electricity sources.Sánchezsummoned the headsof Spain’s private energy operators – including Corredor and representatives from Iberdrola, Endesa, EDP, Acciona Energía and Naturgy – to an urgent meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss the blackout. The prime minister has said the committee will be looking into the role of private energy companies and urged them to help the government get to the bottom of the blackout as soon as possible.Aagesen said some of the operators had already provided huge amounts of data, with the rest of the information expected over the next few days.“As soon as we know what caused this event, we’ll put all necessary measures on the table so that it doesn’t happen again,” she said.The investigations are focusing on what happened at 12.33pm on Monday, when, for five seconds, 15 gigawatts of the energy that was being produced – equivalent to 60% of all the energy that was being used – suddenly disappeared.Spain aims to generate 81% of its electricity from renewables by the end of the decade. Last year, a record 56% of its electricity came from renewable sources.Explore more on these topicsSpainPortugalEuropeRenewable energynewsShareReuse this content"

That effigy reappeared months later, holding an LGBTQ flag on a Kurdish activists’ float at Stockholm’s Pride parade.According to the indictment, which Medin said he had not seen, the offending images were used to illustrate several of his articles that he had posted online.Addressing the court via video link from Silivri prison, Medin said he had not been inSwedenat the time of January rally.Although he posted links to articles he had written about Sweden’s Nato accession – which was initially blocked byTurkey– he said he was not responsible for the photo selection.“I was not at this event, I was in Germany for work. I didn’t know about plans for his event, and I didn’t share any photo or video about it on social media,” Medin told the court via video link.“I did not insult the president. I was assigned to write the article. The photo was selected by editors, I was just doing my job,” he said, asking to be released so he could return to his wife, who is seven months pregnant with their first child.His lawyer, Veysel Ok, urged the court to acquit him.“Medin has no motivation to knowingly and willingly insult the president. The Nato process was vital for Sweden because a Russian attack was on the agenda; my client reported on this process,” Ok told the court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If convicted, Medin could face up to nine years in prison. He denies the charges.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanSwedenPress freedomEuropeNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

But he has denied the prosecution’s accusation that he was the organiser or ringleader of the jewel heist in the early hours of 3 October 2016, which was thebiggest robbery of an individual in France in 20 years.The robbers, dressed as police officers, escaped with up to an estimated $10m (£7.5m) in jewellery, including a 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring given to Kardashian by her then husband, the rapperKanye West, estimated to be worth $4m.Kim Kardashian robbery suspects appear in Paris court as trial beginsRead moreAït Khedache is part of a group five men aged over 60 who allegedly went to Kardashian’sParishotel by bike or on foot for the hold-up, and who French media have nicknamed “the grandpa robbers”. Like several other accused men, he has serious health problems. He is deaf and cannot speak, so he read the court’s questions on a typed transcript, writing his answers with a pen and paper, projected on to a screen.The court heard that Aït Khedache, who ran restaurants inFranceand Spain, had served several prison sentences for robbery from the 1970s.The lead judge, referring to Aït Khedache’s past convictions, asked him why he turned to crime. He replied that he did not know, saying it was largely due to keeping bad company. Asked by the judge whether he was driven by a taste for easy money, Aït Khedache wrote: “Not particularly, but that too.”View image in fullscreenAomar Aït Khedache, left, is among 10 people who are on trial for stealing millions of dollars worth of jewellery from Kim Kardashian.Photograph: Pierre Suu/Getty ImagesThe court heard that at the time of the jewel heist, Aït Khedache was already a wanted man, living under a stolen identity in order to escape prison for a drug-trafficking conviction from 2010.A total of 10 people, aged from 35 to 78, are on trial over their alleged part in the Kardashian robbery. Eight deny involvement.One of the accused is Aït Khedache’s eldest son, Harminy, who is alleged to have been a getaway driver. Harminy Aït Khedache, who had previously worked as an Uber driver, has denied involvement in the robbery. He told police he had been asked by his father to collect him one night in Paris, something he often did, and that he knew nothing of the heist.The court heard that Aomar Aït Khedache was born in Algeria and arrived in France as a young child. He and his nine siblings were “paralysed by fear” of their violent father.The older Aït Khedache was convicted for robbery for the first time 1977, and while he was in prison for 10 months, his pregnant wife died in a fire. Aït Khedache had a psychiatric breakdown over her death and received electric shock therapy, which he said caused the start of his hearing problems. Later he met a woman with a young baby, Harminy. He married her, adopted Harminy, and had another son, Haris.Harminy Aït Khedache, in his early 40s, broke down in tears in court on Tuesday. He said he had found out from a relative when he was aged six that Aomar wasn’t his biological father but had been scared of asking his parents for details for fear of upsetting them. He said he considered Aomar his father and had always wanted to please him. He told the judge that, in general: “I wanted to show that I’m devoted to him.”Haris Aït-Khedache, 39, a bus driver, was called as a character witness for his father. He said of his father’s role in the robbery: “He made a mistake. He found himself in a situation where he didn’t have the choice, I think.” He said his father had said that the victims “must have been traumatised” and that he “regrets the repercussions of this”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsKim KardashianParisFranceEuropeTelevisionReality TVnewsShareReuse this content"

We are now gathering information and the police are conducting door-to-door inquiries and interviewing witnesses,” the authority said in a statement. In addition, mobile phones and other material that have been seized are being analysed.”Police had earlier confirmed in a press conference that a detained person was suspected of murder and was one of several people being interrogated as part of the investigation, although they did not provide an age. They did, however, confirm that the victims were aged between 15 and 20.The shooting took place at a hair salon in Uppsala, a university city 42 miles north of Stockholm, on Tuesday. Police said the attack was believed to be an isolated event and not linked to the annual Valborg celebrations expected in the city on Wednesday evening. Valborg is a Swedish bonfire festival marking the arrival of spring.Swedish media reported that one of the deceased had connections to organised gang crime. Police would not confirm those reports but said gang-related crime was one of the theories they were pursuing “particularly intensively”.Authorities in Sweden have been struggling to deal with gang violence, which remains at the forefront of a national debate, including growing concerns over the young age of children being caught up in the bloodshed. Guns and explosives are regularly used by rival gangs.Police have appealed to the public for information after a masked person was seen fleeing the crime scene on an electric scooter on Tuesday.Gangs of Stockholm: the rise of gun crime in Sweden - podcastRead moreThe minister of justice, Gunnar Strömmer, condemned the killings as a “brutal act of violence”.Police were first alerted to the incident shortly after 5pm on Tuesday, when they received several phone calls from members of the public about loud bangs. Officials later confirmed that three people were dead.“Quite soon we encountered three people who appeared to have been shot. They did not need to be taken to hospital,” Magnus Jansson Klarin, a spokesperson for Uppsala police, told the Svenska Dagbladet daily newspaper.The Swedish government announced in February that itplanned to strengthen its weapons lawsafter the country’s worst mass shooting, when agunman killed 10 people at an education centre in Örebro, west of Stockholm, before shooting himself.

There had to be a full demilitarisation process similar to the one that occurred after the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland, he said.But Lammy said: “It is unacceptable for any group of people to have lived with no state for longer than I’ve been alive.”He accepted that the accelerating pace of settlement expansion was undermining the viability of two states, and said settlement violence levels were “shocking”.In the last year, he said, 59 outposts on the West Bank had been built, whereas the average over the previous 25 years was seven.The latest speculation about the long saga of recognition started whenEmmanuel Macronreturned from a trip to Egypt on 9 April and said France would probably recognise a Palestinian state at the June conference. It would be the first recognition of Palestine by a G7 member state.A few days later, Macron clarified that the move would be intended to “trigger a series of other recognitions … including the recognition ofIsraelby states that do not currently do so”, remarks that could provide France with a get-out if no momentum towards recognition emerges.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, subsequently rang Macron to tell him that recognising Palestine as a state would be a victory for Hamas and Iran.Donald Trump is due to visit Saudi Arabia this month, where he is certain to be told by Riyadh that Saudi normalisation with Israel, one of Trump’s signature diplomatic themes, is impossible without a credible pathway to a two-state solution.Michel Duclos, a special adviser to Institut Montaigne, a Paris-based thinktank, argued French political credibility was at stake in its handling of the issue.He said that since the best outcome from the June conference at the UN “may be nothing more than a roadmap or set of proposals, the dilemma for France may soon become more challenging: can it continue postponing its recognition of Palestine while waiting for a true two-state momentum? Or would further postponement undermine its credibility?”Lammy showed his frustration with the Israeli leadership’s 60-day ban on aid into Gaza but he proposed no new measures. “The blockade of necessary aid into Gaza is horrendous, the suffering is dire, the need is huge, the loss of life is extreme,” he said.He said he had been clear in person to the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, about Israel’s obligations to provide aid when the two menmet in Londona fortnight ago.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyDavid LammyPalestinian territoriesIsraelFranceEmmanuel MacronSaudi ArabianewsShareReuse this content"

We have so many pieces of evidence that prove his innocence, but nothing is accepted.”According to Iran’s state news agency IRNA, Langarneshin was a “senior spy” for the Mossad who provided critical “technical support” for the assassination of Hassan Sayyad Khodaei, a colonel in the Revolutionary Guards who was shot five times by gunmen on a motorbike outside his home in Tehran, as well as for other alleged operations.The IRNA report said the Mossad recruited Langarneshin in 2020 and that he met with Israeli intelligence officers in Georgia and Nepal. He was arrested in July 2023.Activists fear that Iran scapegoats innocent people after failing to catch the actual agents, who have often escaped overseas by the time investigators identify them.Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of the Norway-based Iran Human Rights monitor, said: “Mohsen Langarneshin, who was sentenced to death in an unfair judicial process based on confessions obtained under torture and charged with espionage for Israel, was hanged at dawn today.”“The Iranian authorities’ execution machine is accelerating every day, taking the lives of more people,” he added, describing the executions as “extrajudicial killings”.At least 335 people have been hanged in Iran so far this year alone, campaigners say. Iranexecuted more than 900 peoplein 2024. A man was executed in December 2023 after he was found guilty of collaborating with the Mossad. Four others were hanged a year earlier over alleged ties to Israel.The US-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, which had campaigned over Langarneshin’s case, said he had been convicted at a revolutionary court presided over by a judge, Abolghasem Salavati, who has been put under US and EU sanctions and is notorious for handing out death sentences.“He denied all charges, stating that his confessions were extracted under torture,” the group said.The revolutionary courts were set up after the 1979 revolution and deliver often summary justice in closed hearings.Israel and Iran have been engaged in a shadow war of assassinations and bombings for decades. A series of attacks attributed to the Mossad has targeted Iranian scientists, experts and academics, many connected to Iran’s nuclear programme. Last year, Israel is thought to have killed Ismail Haniyeh, the most senior political leader of Hamas, with a bomb in a bedroom of a government guesthouse in TehranIn Israel, a 72-year-old manwas sentenced on Tuesdayto 10 years in prison accused of discussing plots with Iranian intelligence services to assassinate senior government officials, including the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.The US president, Donald Trump, isseeking a new deal with the Iranian leadershipon its nuclear programme, with both Israel and its ally the US long refusing to rule out a military strike on Iran.The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said on Wednesday that Iran expected the next round of negotiations with the US to be held in Rome on Saturday, adding that Iran also anticipated having a meeting on Friday with France, Germany and the UK to discuss the talks.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaThe MossadnewsShareReuse this content"

An attack on the Druze-majority Damascus suburb of Jaramana a day earlier left at least 10 people dead, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Residents reported hearing gunfire, explosions and shelling throughout Wednesday morning. The security forces closed off roads leading to the area and sent reinforcements in an attempt to stop the fighting.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also announced that Israeli forces had struck an “extremist group that was preparing to attack the Druze population south of Damascus”.A second Israeli strike killed a member of Syria’s security forces outside Damascus and Israel’s military chief of staff ordered preparations to attack Syrian government targets “if the violence against the Druze did not stop”.Israel has said it will protect the Druze population in southern Syria, an offer that Syrian Druze have said they did not ask for.Syria’s authorities are still grappling with rising tensions a month after anattack by remnants of the deposed regimeof Bashar al-Assad on security forces led tosectarian massacres in the coastal Latakia governoratethat left at least 1,000 people dead.View image in fullscreenArmed members of Syria’s Druze community attend the funeral of those killed during clashes with Syrian security forces in Damascus on 30 April.Photograph: Louai Beshara/AFP/GettyThis week’s clashes are likely to strain the already frosty relationship between the Syrian government and Druze communities, which are engaged in negotiations over their areas’ inclusion in the Syrian state.The Druze are an Arab religious minority of about 500,000 people in Syria, mainly concentrated in Suwayda governorate and small towns south of Damascus. Since rebels toppled Assad on 8 December, the new authorities and the group’s leaders have been discussing how to fully integrate Suwayda into the Syrian state.Negotiations have been slow, however, because Druze leaders have asked for some measure of autonomy from Damascus, wary of the background of the new government, which is headed by Ahmad al-Sharaa, the former leader of the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).‘The streets are empty, no one dares go outside’: Syria’s Alawites terrorised by revenge killingsRead moreTuesday’s fighting was sparked by a fake audio recording attributed to a Druze cleric insulting Islam’s prophet, Mohammad, which was circulated on social media. Unknown gunmen launched their attack on Jaramana seemingly in connection with the audio clip.The cleric supposedly speaking in the clip posted a video on social media later on Tuesday clarifying that he had no connection to the Islamophobic recording.“I did not say that, and whoever made it is evil and wants to incite strife between components of the Syrian people,” said Marwan Kiwan. Syria’s interior ministry confirmed that the recording was falsely attributed to a Druze official, and stressed that people should abide by the law and not engage in acts of vigilantism.Community leaders and government representatives managed to broker a deal to end the fighting in Jaramana on Tuesday with stipulations that victims’ families would receive compensation and attackers would be brought to justice.Fighting quickly reignited several hours later in Ashrafieh Sahnaya, but it is unclear if the attackers were related to those in Jaramana.The clashes inflamed anger in Suwayda, whose inhabitants have been reluctant to allow the Syrian government full access to the area.“In Jaramana there was a massacre, Ashrafieh Sahnaya is surrounded and is being attacked by terrorists. General security is preventing Druze and the military council from helping them,” the head of the Suwayda military council, Tarek el-Shoufi, said by phone.Videos on social media showed armed Arab tribesmen stopping a convoy of cars originating from Suwayda from reaching Ashrafieh Sahnaya.El-Shoufi said: “The Druze men that are in Sahnaya are running out of ammunition. The road has been cut off and a group of Druze that wanted to help came under fire, killing one of them.”Syria’s cash-strapped authorities suffer from a lack of capacity. The nascent state has launched training courses to bolster the ranks of its security forces, but it has struggled to disarm and prevent sporadic attacks by the myriad armed factions that roam the vast countryside.Syria’s minister of interior put out a statement on Wednesday saying “it will not hesitate to deal with these criminals and will strike with an iron fist anyone who seeks to destabilise Syria’s security and target its people”.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The Iran-backed group has attacked merchant shipping and western warships, leading to a sharp drop in trade flows.Trump promised peace but brings rapid increase in civilian casualties to Yemen | Dan SabbaghRead more“A 55% drop in shipping through the Red Sea has already cost billions, fuelling regional instability and risking economic security for families in the UK,” Healey said in a social media post shortly after midnight.Britain had joined with the US to conduct five rounds of airstrikes against the Houthis between January and May 2024, part of the Operation Poseidon Archer campaign authorised by the Biden administration, but had not been involved in the fresh and more intense US effort until now.On 15 March, the Trump administration launched a fresh campaign against the Houthis, Operation Rough Rider. There have been 800 targets struck and it has resulted in the deaths of “hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders”, according to the US military’s central command.1:36Yemen Houthi rebels say 68 dead in US airstrike on prison in Saada – videoThere have also been reports of higher civilian casualties. This week, the Houthis said68 people were killedwhen a detention centre holding African migrants was struck in Saada, north-west Yemen, while 80 civilians were reported to have died in an attack on the port of Ras Isa on 18 April.Annie Shiel, the US director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict, said the “US strikes continue to raise significant questions about the precautions taken to prevent civilian harm, as required by both international law and US policy”, and noted that there appeared to have been a shift in policy under Donald Trump.Overnight on Tuesday, the UK said it had taken steps to minimise the risk of civilian casualties. The Houthi buildings were targeted with Paveway IV missiles once “very careful planning had been completed to allow the targets to be prosecuted with minimal risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure”, the Ministry of Defence said.It emphasised that “as a further precaution, the strike was conducted after dark, when the likelihood of any civilians being in the area was reduced yet further”, though no damage assessment was offered at first.mapHealey later told the Commons that after an initial damage assessment the MoD had said: “The planned targets were successfully hit and we see no evidence of civilian casualties.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re stepping up in the Red Sea. We are alongside them.”There was little immediate comment from the US. Its defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has said the American military must emphasise “lethality, lethality, lethality” and has cut programmes intended to minimise civilian harm.News agencies said the Houthis had reported several strikes around Sana’a, which the group has held since 2014, but there were few other details immediately available. Other strikes hit the area around Saada.The Houthis are targeting shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in support of Hamas and the Palestinians in Gaza, the subject of a renewed offensive by Israel.A statement from the Houthi administration in Sana’a accused the UK of “typical British arrogance” and pledged to fight on. “We emphasise that this attack falls within the ongoing Anglo-American efforts to support the Israeli enemy by attempting to halt Yemen’s assistance to Palestine, so that the Israeli enemy can continue its genocide in Gaza,” it said.The US boasts considerably more firepower than the group, but a $60m (£45m) US navy F-18 Super Hornet jet waslost at seaon Tuesday. US officials said initial reports indicated the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier, on which the F-18 was being towed, made a hard turn to evade Houthi fire. That contributed to the fighter jet falling overboard and sinking.The start of Operation Rough Rider caused controversy in the US over Hegseth’s use of the unclassified Signal messaging app to post sensitive details about the attacks, including in a group containing a journalist.Explore more on these topicsYemenHouthisRoyal Air ForceMilitaryDefence policyJohn HealeyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Much of India andPakistanis already sweltering in heatwave conditions, in what scientists say is fast becoming the “new normal”.Temperatures in the region typically climb through May, peaking in June before the monsoon brings relief. But this year, the heat has come early. “As far as Asia and the Indian subcontinent are concerned, there was a quick transition from a short window of spring conditions to summer-like heat,” said GP Sharma, the meteorology president of Skymet, India’s leading private forecaster.South Asia, home to 1.9 billion people, is particularly vulnerable. Many live in areas highly exposed to extreme heat and lack access to basic cooling, healthcare or water.In Delhi, where spring usually offers a short spell of mild temperatures, thermometers have risen past 40C in April – “up to 5C above the seasonal average” – according to a report by ClimaMeter, a platform that tracks extreme weather events.“Human-driven climate change” is to blame for the “dangerous” kind of heat seen in recent weeks, it said.“These spring heatwaves are not anomalies. They’re signals. We need to move beyond awareness into action,” said Gianmarco Mengaldo, a climate expert at the National University of Singapore and co-author of the report.Delhi authorities urged schools to cancel afternoon assemblies on Tuesday and issued emergency guidelines to ensure water breaks and stocks of oral rehydration salts in first aid kits, and to treat any signs of heat stress immediately.View image in fullscreenDelhi commuters on their way to work on an unusually hot April day.Photograph: Harish Tyagi/EPATemperatures in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, hit 44C, triggering heatstroke reports among construction workers and farmers. Other states are also grappling with intense heat.The Indian Meteorological Department has reported an “above-normal number of heatwave days”. Temperatures are expected to climb steadily across the subcontinent, with the highest readings forecast for Wednesday and Thursday.Pakistan is also reeling. In the city of Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh province, the mercury has soared to 50C – nearly 8.5C above the April average. In other parts of the country, temperatures have hovered in the high 40s.“What was once considered rare has become alarmingly common, as climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of such events,” said an editorial in the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. The country “remains woefully unprepared for the escalating climate crisis”, it said.Urban heat is making things worse. Data comparing 1950–1986 with 1987–2023 shows that cities such as Delhi and Islamabad are now up to 3C hotter on average than nearby rural areas.View image in fullscreenChildren cool off in water from a leaking pipeline in Hyderabad, Pakistan.Photograph: Akram Shahid/AFP/Getty Images“When it comes to heatwaves, the question is no longer if they are linked to climate change, but what kind of thresholds we are reaching,” said Mengaldo. “Preparedness is essential. But right now, our infrastructure is not well adapted.”Natural climate variability such as the El Niño cycle can affect regional weather, but it is now in a neutral phase.ClimaMeter said: “Compared to pre-1986 levels, similar meteorological conditions now produce temperatures up to 4C higher – almost entirely due to human-driven climate change.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We underestimated the speed of change. What we’re seeing now is an acceleration – a failure of our predictive models.”David Faranda, a senior climate scientist with the French National Centre for Scientific Research and co-author of the report, said: “The only sustainable solution is to stop burning fossil fuels and reduce emissions. Without drastically reducing emissions and building climate resilience through better insulation, use of green energy, and other moves, the implications are alarming.”“Even if we act now, the climate system will take decades – sometimes over a century – to cool down,” Mengaldo added. “The sea level rise is already locked in for hundreds of years.”Both researchers stressed economic inequality and infrastructure played a critical role in determining who survives extreme heat. “There are different temperature thresholds – actual temperature, [humidity index] and others,” said Mengaldo. “Economic levels play a huge role in how people can cope and sustain themselves.”Delhi has updated its heat action plan, focusing on vulnerable groups such as elderly people, construction workers, and street vendors. But implementation is inconsistent.Faranda said adaptation was increasingly unaffordable for many heat-prone countries, with electricity grids buckling and causing widespread power cuts. “When multiple events occur, there’s often no escape,” he said.Mengaldo highlighted the need for innovation: “We need better-insulated housing, materials that prevent energy loss, and architectural designs that promote natural cooling. These can significantly reduce energy demand during extreme heat.”Faranda also said people must change their lifestyles. “Energy demand keeps increasing. If we want to survive the coming decades, we must not only build more renewables but also reduce energy consumption overall: through lifestyle changes, efficient architecture, and better materials.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisExtreme heatSouth and central AsiaExtreme weatherIndiaPakistannewsShareReuse this content"

They don’t want to advertise to prospective parents that they might have a problem with relationship violence. But the point is, this is everywhere.”Research by the YEF found nearly a third of teachers taking RSHE classes said they had never received any training, while more than a quarter said they were not confident teaching children how to leave an unhealthy relationship. Almost half said they struggled to explain how to intervene if children witness a sexual assault.Lucy Emmerson, the chief executive of theSex Education Forum, said its research found that only 50% of young people said their RSHE lessons were good or very good, despite recent improvements in the curriculum.“We’re finding that some topics like puberty are covered really well, young people say it’s done really well, and to some extent topics like consent. But topics like pornography and power imbalances in relationships, these are the kind of topics that young people very often say are inadequately covered or not covered at all,” Emmerson said.“That’s often where parents say it’s different from what they encountered as a child – they might remember their sex education being quite technical, quite focused on puberty and biology and not so much on ‘what does it feel like?’ ‘How do I manage my feelings?’ ‘How do I deal with rejection? ‘How can I understand what’s going on here?’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the difficulty remained in getting the training and investment needed for teachers.“To do those so-called trickier topics really well, teachers need to be confident in this subject area, they need to be able to hold high-quality and open discussions with pupils and not just fact-based teaching around it,” Emmerson said.“Children and young people benefit hugely from the skills of listening to each other, to empathise, to respect each other and to negotiate and understand their emotions and express them.

Sorting admin problems is not always easy and can be time-consuming, putting pressure on patients or their families,” Ansari said.Among the reported errors:26% related to personal details such as name or date of birth.16% involved medication a patient had taken.9% of errors incorrectly listed a patient as having had a particular illness9% said a patient had taken specific drugs to treat an ailment.Among that group, 10% said they had been given wrong or inappropriate medication as a result of the error, and 9% said they had received potentially unsafe care or treatment. One in eight (12%) said inaccurate or missing information had led to them being refused treatment.The Patients Association said errors in records, which can occur during care at a GP surgery or hospital, could result in “dangerous delays, misdiagnoses and missed care”.Rachel Power, the association’s chief executive, said: “Since January we’ve received over 100 helpline inquiries about this issue and our patient guide on accessing medical records has several hundred downloads.“Behind each of these errors is a real person facing anxiety and uncertainty about their care. Many of these cases involve incorrect or missing diagnoses and treatments, and callers tell us these errors are predominantly made in GP practices or sometimes in secondary care.“We understand theimmense pressurehealthcare professionals face. But inaccuracies like these can lead to dangerous delays, misdiagnoses and missed care, which is simply unacceptable and deeply concerning to patients. These record errors not only exacerbate illness but add significant stress during already difficult times.”She said patients must be able to trust that their medical records are correct and should not have to recount their medical history repeatedly or spend time seeking to correct their own records.Patients variously told Healthwatch about how errors in their records meant they were given a potentially wrong drug for their diabetes because their GP did not know they had a cyst, or were misinformed about ADHD medication because of an information mix-up involving their GP surgery and a private ADHD diagnostic service.National Voices, a coalition of health and care charities, said mistakes were so common in the paper and digital records theNHSmaintains that some were akin to “Swiss cheese records”.“There’s much talk about how shifting the NHS from analogue to digital will make it more efficient and effective. But realising this brave new future requires a solid foundation of accurate data, not Swiss cheese records, which are creating a mountain of problems for patients and clinicians,” said Jacob Lant, its chief executive.Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College ofGPs, said family doctors would be deeply concerned by the findings.“There may be many reasons for administrative errors occurring. But inadequate IT infrastructure, intense workloads and workforce pressures in general practice, high levels of unnecessary bureaucracy and poor communication between different parts of the health service all contribute to mistakes being made,” she said.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “It is unacceptable that patients are missing out on vital treatments and tests simply because of errors with their medical records.“This government inherited an analogue NHS, but we’re committed to catapulting it into the digital age through our plan for change. We will create a health service fit for the future and put patients in control of their own medical history through a single patient record, summarising patient health information, test results and letters in one place via the NHS app.”Explore more on these topicsNHSGPsHospitalsHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This is our opportunity to be on the right side of history.”On Wednesday, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said it is “absolutely unacceptable” to question the validity of the supreme court ruling that the term “woman” is defined by biological sex.Giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, Mahmood said: “They obviously provided the legal clarity in their legal decision, which is exactly their job.“I think it’s disappointing since then that some individuals have sought to question the validity of the supreme court or cast aspersions, which is absolutely unacceptable.“I think they’ve done their job and I think they’ve sought to do it in a way that recognises that we’re talking about a balance of rights, but sought to give confidence to a minority community that they still have protections.”Some trans rights groups have raised concerns about the practical implications of the ruling.Explore more on these topicsGenderTransgenderUK supreme courtWomenFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Gifted on climate policy, she used all six of her questions to call for another child abuse inquiryWed 30 Apr 2025 14.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 15.12 EDTShareOn days like these,Keir Starmermight come to believe there is a God after all. Fair to say the prime minister has been under the cosh recently. His popularity ratings tanking as people continue to feel fed up that nothing still appears to be working as it should. The local elections on Thursday are unlikely to provide any joy for Labour with Reform ahead in several polls. Even the election of Mark Carney has been a mixed blessing. A reminder that some politicians get rewarded for taking a tough line on Agent Orange. The Lib Dems have declared themselves honorary Canadians.To cap it all, Tony Blairhad just published a report on climate policythat even his best friends might consider to have been “unhelpful”. Tony is a former politician who is unable to go gently into the dark night. Eighteen years after stepping down as prime minister, he still yearns for relevance.Attention, even. If he can’t be meaningful, he can at least be a contrarian. A thorn in Labour’s side, seeking retribution against imagined slights. AgainstLabourMPs, the overwhelming majority of whom weren’t even in parliament at the time he left. Some were even in primary school. But they must be punished nonetheless. For the thought crime of believing they could move on. Nothing less than total obedience and gratitude will do. Never forget who won three general elections. Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.So you might have thought thatKemi Badenochwould have been keen to seize on the report from the Tony Blair Institute. After all, it’s not often that a Tory leader of the opposition finds herself more or less on the same side as Labour’s most successful prime minister. It’s even less often that Labour’s most successful prime minister finds himself Nigel Farage-adjacent. But that’s another story. For now, KemiKaze had an open goal. Six questions to exploit the gulf between Starmer and Blair.But Kemi turned the opportunity down. Maybe she had noticed that Tony had been doing some frantic back-pedalling after realising he had landed in the net zero sceptic camp. That when he had said phasing out fossil fuels in the short term was a strategy doomed to failure what he had really meant was that phasing out fossil fuels in the short term was a realistic endeavour. That he had only been highlighting the problems of developing countries and was totally on board with the Labour government’s focus on renewables and carbon capture.Maybe Kemi had noticed that almost every serious climate scientist had rushed out to rubbish Tony’s report and was having second thoughts about her own position? Unlikely. Reflection is not her style. Most likely, she had got an idea into her head and wouldn’t budge. This was how she rolled. Wake up. Eight double espressos – whichever was closest to hand – and sign in to X. There to join the rollercoaster wild west of conspiracy theories until she found something that suited her mood.That’s the only credible explanation. Because after Starmer had surprised everyone by starting with a gag that was actually funny –a dig at Robert Jenrickfor still running after his outing in the London marathon that creased up the Tory benches: it’s somehow reassuring to find there are so many Conservatives who find Honest Bob objectionable – Kemi used all six of her questions to call for a national inquiry into child abuse gangs.It wasn’t that the topic was not important. It is. The victims suffered horrific abuse. More, there wasn’t a clear reason why Badenoch had chosen to raise it at this Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions. If she hadn’t wanted to go on climate breakdown she could have done bin collections instead. After all, the local elections were the following day. But Kemi insisted on returning to a subject she first raised three months ago after Elon Musk became interested on social media. It goes without saying Elon has long since moved on. He never cared about the victims anyway. He just liked the attention. The frenzy.Nor did Kemi have anything new to say. There was no new information. No new angle of attack. And Keir could hardly believe his luck. He was off the hook. Because no one – with the possible exception of a few QAnon Reform voters – really believe that Starmer is trying to cover up the abuse. After all, as director of public prosecutions he was directly responsible for seeing that some of the perpetrators faced justice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There had been a national inquiry, headed by Prof Alexis Jay, which had made 20 recommendations. None of which the Tories had implemented when they had been in government. Surely it made more sense to act upon the existing recommendations, rather than spending hundreds of millions on another inquiry which might come to the same conclusions? And if Kemi was hellbent on another inquiry, why hadn’t she and the Tories set it up when they had been in power?It was irrefutable logic, but Kemi kept coming back at Starmer again and again. Hoping for what? That he might crack? Unlikely. It all made for a strange impasse. Deja vu. And it left a rather nasty taste in the mouth. Because you couldn’t help feeling that this was all happening at the victims’ expense. They had suffered once at the hands of their abusers. Now they were being used for political advantage.The rest of the session was low-key. No real fireworks. Notable mainly for Tory MPs promoting their VE Day celebrations. Bernard Jenkin tried to drum up interest in a choral evening and sounded almost apologetic that they would be singing some works by German composers on such a patriotic evening. He needn’t have worried. Some of us gladly listen to Bach. Mark Francois hoped for some dosh for a Vera Lynn statue. “Hopefully, we’ll meet again,” he said. Starmer said they would. Though he didn’t sound thrilled by the prospect.All the while, Victoria Starmer looked on impassively from the visitor’s gallery. She gave nothing away. Not even a smile at her husband’s jokes. She’s a tough audience. Also watching on was the erstwhile pop singer, Chesney Hawkes. At least that’s who he said he was.

Much of its policy work promotes technology and artificial intelligence as the solution to challenges facing governments around the world.Those stances have attracted some scepticism from critics, however, given the institute gets much of its money from people connected to the technology industry.One of the TBI’s biggest sources of cash is the foundation set up by Larry Ellison, the billionaire founder of Oracle and ally of the US president, Donald Trump.Filings in the US showthe foundation gave the TBI more than £52m in 2023 and had promised another $218m (£163m).Like many technology companies, Oracle is investing heavily in AI products, including tools for improving healthcare. Ellison has also spokenin favour of using AI for the mass surveillance of civilian populations.Blair’s policy proposals dovetail with Oracle’s corporate interests in other areas too. In his foreword tothe net zero report, he writes: “The new generation of small modular reactors offers hope for the renaissance of nuclear power, but it needs integrating into nations’ energy policy.”Ellisonannounced last yearthat Oracle was designing a new datacentre to be powered by three small modular reactors.The TBI has also worked with fossil fuel companies and petrostates, including signing amultimillion pound dealto advise the Saudi government. Last year, the institute advised Azerbaijan, the oil-rich state which controversiallyhosted the Cop29 climate conference.The TBI says its policies are often focused on helping bolster public services in developing countries. Benedict Macon-Cooney, the institute’s chief policy strategist, told the Guardian in 2023: “There is no conflict of interest and donations are ringfenced.”Longtime Blair allies meanwhile are divided on whether the former prime minister has always harboured doubts about climate policies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I don’t think this is the Tony Blair Institute’s finest hour.”Another former adviser and colleague however said: “Blair always had to be dragged along when it came to climate change. He was generally resistant to green arguments.”Climate experts and politicians round on Tony Blair for ‘wrong message’Read moreMeanwhile the former prime minister has also been cultivating relationships with Labour MPs, holding a series of roundtable discussions with small groups of MPs over the last year.One MP who had attended one meeting said: “His message was that technology companies have deep pockets and so are going to be able to drive change faster than governments can. That message was pretty unhelpful politically and the exact opposite of what the Labour government is trying to tell people.”Others in the Labour party, however, believe he is providing a useful service in making Labour think again about some of its more radical climate policies.“Blair was making a point about the purpose of our energy policy,” said one.“He needs to work on his timing but the point is right – energy security and reducing bills are the goals of UK energy policy because they benefit working people. Everything else is subsidiary to that.”Explore more on these topicsTony BlairEnergyEnergy industryLabourRenewable energyanalysisShareReuse this content"

He told representatives of cancer charities: “You have my whole family’s deepest admiration.”Charles, 76, who isstill undergoing treatmentmore than a year after his diagnosis, said his cancer journey had given him “an even deeper appreciation of the extraordinary work” of the charities. He added that it had reinforced how “the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion”.He hailed the late Dame Deborah James as an inspiration, quoting her final message and encouraging everyone to follow her example: “Find a life worth enjoying; take risks; love deeply; have no regrets; and always, always have rebellious hope.”James died in June 2022 at the age of 40, five years after she was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Her Bowelbabe fund has raised more than £16m since its launch.His message was printed in a booklet given to guests at the palace’s evening reception, including James’s parents Heather and Alistair.A royal source said there was no update on the king’s condition or treatment, but that it continued in a “very positive direction”, reflected in his “very full” national and international diary. They described the words and subject of the message as “deeply personal” for the king.Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIMonarchyCancerHealthCharitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

And we have ended that and we are very aggressively going out and trying to find these children, 300,000 children that were lost by the Biden administration.”During his campaign for the 2024 election, Trump repeatedlymisrepresented government datato falsely claim that 300,000 migrant children who crossed the border unaccompanied had gone missing, and said many of them were trafficked or likely to be dead.The children were not in fact lost or missing. HHS data recorded only the numbers crossing the border, and tracking ceased when they were placed in homes and communities with relatives already in the US.Kennedy did not expand on the “aggressive” efforts his department was making to try to find children who were actually never missing.Much of the rest of the two-hour meeting, and a question-and-answer session with the media, was consumed by Trump talking up the perceived accomplishments of his first 100 days. He attempted to distance himself from Tuesday’sbleak economic datathat suggests the US could be heading for a recession on the back of his tariff policies:“I’m not taking a credit or discredit for the stock market,” he said. “I’m just saying we inherited a mess.”Yet when the stock market was soaring during the final year of Biden’s presidency, Trumpfrequently insistedit was because investors were buoyant at the prospect of him returning to the White House.The president was asked by a reporter on Wednesday if he had spoken with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, about the tariffs that have sparked a potentially costly trade war between the countries, and have led topredictions of empty shelvesbefore the end of the year as imports dry up.Trump said he had not, and offered his own prediction as to how Christmas might look for American families.“Somebody said,‘Oh, the shelves are gonna be open.’ Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,” he said.“So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe US politics sketchUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Failure on the economy, failure on lowering costs, failure on tariffs, failure on foreign policy, failure on preserving democracy, failure on helping middle-class families,” the top Senate DemocratChuck Schumersaid from the Capitol steps.He went on to characterize Republican lawmakers, few of whom have broken publicly with the president since his 20 January inauguration, as “co-conspirators. They are complicit. They are aiding and abetting all of Donald Trump’s failures. They’re not standing up to him once they’re involved and they will shoulder the blame.”The party gathered hours after the release of economic data that showedthe US economy shrankin the first three months of this year, which lawmakers said was evidence Trump had broken the promise of prosperity he made to American voters.“A hundred days into this presidency, we’ve gone from three years of solid growth in our economy to the steepest decline that we’ve seen since the pandemic. That’s the truth,” said the Delaware senator Lisa Blunt Rochester. “Groceries are up, retirement savings are down, that’s the truth. Outbreaks ofmeaslesand theavian flu, that’s the truth.”More than 1,300 days remain in Trump’s presidency, butDemocratsare eyeing a resurgence in next November’s midterm elections. A return to a majority in the House is within reach, as the current GOP majority is just three votes, a historically low margin.Earlier in the day, the House minority leaderHakeem Jeffriessaid that the party can only do so much without controlling at least one chamber of Congress, but promised change as soon as they returned to the majority.“As Democrats, we will fight as hard as we can the next two years to stop bad things from happening. We will protect our system of free and fair elections, and then work hard to convince the American people to entrust us the majority next November,” Jeffries said at a speech at aWashington DCtheater.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Recent surveys have indicated that voters are sour on the party, with a CNN poll released last month findingits approval ratinghas never been lower.The House Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar signaled that the party plans to put economic concerns at the heart of its pitch to voters as it eyes rebuilding legislative majorities in 2026.“We’re going to focus on making life more affordable, making life easier for everyday Americans in these next 100 days and at every turn, until we flip the House and we flip the Senate and we put a check on the Trump administration’s reckless economic policies,” Aguilar said.Explore more on these topicsDemocratsWashington DCTrump administrationProtestDonald TrumpRepublicansUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Shares jumped in after-hours trading.“We’ve had a strong start to an important year, our community continues to grow and our business is performing very well,” said Meta’s chief executive,Mark Zuckerberg. “We’re making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1bn monthly actives.”Speaking on the investor call, Zuckerberg said the company was performing well and its platforms were growing, making it “well-positioned to navigate” any macroeconomic uncertainty.“I continue to think this year is going to be a pivotal moment in our industry,” he said.This continues Meta’s streak of beating Wall Streetexpectationsover the past few quarters. However, it is unclear if it will be enough to quell investor concerns. Analysts were disappointed by the first quarter revenue outlook Zuckerberg shared at the end of 2024. The company has also updated its outlook on spending for the next year with plans to spend anywhere from $64-72bn in capital expenditures including the cost of building out AI infrastructure. That is up from $65bn the company originally said it was expecting to spend in 2025. Total costs and expenditures for the first quarter were already at $24.76bn, a 9% increase compared to the year prior. Uncertainty over Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs may yet roil ad markets, clouding the company’s financial outlook for near future quarters.EMarketersenior analyst Minda Smiley said the company’s “optimistic Q2 guidance signals that the company isn’t expecting any major dips in ad revenue” as a result of the tariffs. But that they don’t expect Meta will be spared from the downturn in the long term.“On the one hand, the company stands to gain from economic instability. Advertisers will allocate more ad dollars to proven, sophisticated networks like Facebook and Instagram – all while pulling back spend on smaller social platforms – while they navigate uncertainty,” Smiley said. “On the other hand, a small but significant portion of Meta’s revenue comes from Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein advertising to US shoppers. That spend is starting to dry up as a result of trade and tariff change.”Meta’s spending also continues to “weigh heavily on investors”, according to analyst Debra Aho Williamson, the founder and chief analyst of Sonata Insights. “But Meta will resist directly monetizing AI this year, focusing instead on building AI usage among its app users, advertisers and developers using Llama,” said Williamson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But aWSJ reportexposed the existing chatbots integrated into the company’s various products, including Facebook and Instagram, were given the ability to perform “romantic role play” even with the platforms’ teen users. Executives at the company, which repeatedly has touted its nearly 1 billion users of its AI chatbots, alsoadmitthat many of those users access the chatbot through its hard-to-avoid takeover of the search bars of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. The company has not detailed how many interactions with the chatbot or how deep those interactions need to be to consider a person a user of the AI chatbot.Paired with Meta’songoing antitrust trial– where the company faces claims that it built an illegal social media monopoly with its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp – the uncertain AI future adds to the concerns some analysts may have around Meta’s financials despite what it may look like on paper.“Meta’s earnings call comes at a precarious time where the company’s future is literally beingdebated in court– the results of which could fundamentally alter the social media landscape,” said Forrester VP’s research director,Mike Proulx. “Meta is smart to direct more resources into improving Threads and Facebook since those could be the only two apps the company is left with.

BE PATIENT!!!”Democrats argued the figures were a damning verdict on the new administration’s handling of the economy.

By the end of the day, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones had eked out small gains while the Nasdaq had dropped marginally.On the eve of Wednesday’s GDP report, Trump claimed at a rally in Michigan that he had built “the greatest economy in the history of our country” during his first presidency, which ended in 2021, adding: “We did great, and we’re doing better now.”Responding promptly to data suggesting otherwise on Wednesday, Trump tried to argue his predecessor was responsible.“I didn’t take over until January 20th,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden ‘Overhang.’”Trump spent much of the first quarter threatening, and fleetingly implementing, sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and targeting China with higher duties on its exports.Days into the second quarter, which was not covered by today’s GDP reading, he ordered even higher tariffs on goods from much of the world, beforepulling back the tariffs on all countries but China. As it stands, Trump is charging a 10% universal tariff on imported goods from much of the world, along with a 145% tariff on imports from China.bar chart showing GDP figures from last quarter of 2020 to first quarter of 2025Seemingly responding to deep fluctuations in the US stock market, Trump has shelved a wave of so-called “reciprocal tariffs” of up to 49% on specific countries, which he halted for 90 days.He offered some relief to US automakers, who were facing a 25% tariff on all auto imports on Tuesday, signing an executive order that would allow them to receive a credit if they import auto parts but assemble the cars in the US.Last week, stocks rallied on news that Trumpsaidhis tariffs of at least 145% against China – which already has exemptions for some electronics – will be reduced “substantially” as the White House negotiates a deal with Beijing, though he said that the tariff would not be eliminated completely. China has placed a 125% retaliatory tariff on American goods.Some economists are pointing out that the decline in GDP over the last few months is largely due to the oversized amount of imports that American businesses purchased in anticipation of Trump’s tariffs. When calculating GDP, imports are subtracted to account for the amount of consumption that is not from domestic production.While the International Monetary Fund hasdowngraded its forecasts for US growth this yearbecause of tariffs, some economists said the plunge in imports the border taxes will cause from April could mean GDP rebounds in the second quarter, sparing Trump a recession for now.Elon Muskalso played a role in the first quarter contraction. A 5.1% fall in federal spending also complicated the data, as the billionaire presidential adviser’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) made huge cuts to the executive branch. And consumption slowed from 4% to 1.8%, amid severe weather and a drop in non-profit spending after election donations stopped.New data released on Wednesday highlighted how new tariffs appear to be significantly slowing trade. In China, factory activity slowed in April, withBeijing blaming“sharp changes” in the global economy as US tariffs pounded exports. Exports from the Chinese e-commerce companies Temu and Shein to the US haveplunged65%, while exports to the EU rose by 28%. Meanwhile, the British sports carmaker Aston Martin said that it wouldlimit exportsto the US in the midst of Trump’s tariffs.Also on Wednesday, the payroll firm ADP said that payrolls in the private sector went up by just 62,000 in April, the smallest gain since July – an ominous sign ahead of Friday’s release of official employment data for April, often used by economists to gauge the health of the labor market.Stock markets rise as Trump backtracks on high China tariffs and firing Fed chairRead moreWhile the White House has said in recent weeks that Trump’s tariffs are meant to be a negotiating tactic, leaders around the world have said they will retaliate if Trump continues to try to bully them into negotiations.“If one chooses to remain silent, compromise and cower, it will only make the bully want to push his luck more,”saidthe Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, on Monday.Trump has been sensitive to criticism of his tariffs and the impact they are having on the economy. At one point over the last month, Trump threatened to remove Jerome Powell from his role as chair of the US Federal Reserve after Powell said that Trump’s tariffscould lead topermanent price hikes.After markets fell, Trump eventuallybacked down, telling reporters that he had “no intention” of firing Powell.Explore more on these topicsUS economyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Shares jumped in after-hours trading.“We’ve had a strong start to an important year, our community continues to grow and our business is performing very well,” said Meta’s chief executive,Mark Zuckerberg. “We’re making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1bn monthly actives.”Speaking on the investor call, Zuckerberg said the company was performing well and its platforms were growing, making it “well-positioned to navigate” any macroeconomic uncertainty.“I continue to think this year is going to be a pivotal moment in our industry,” he said.This continues Meta’s streak of beating Wall Streetexpectationsover the past few quarters. However, it is unclear if it will be enough to quell investor concerns. Analysts were disappointed by the first quarter revenue outlook Zuckerberg shared at the end of 2024. The company has also updated its outlook on spending for the next year with plans to spend anywhere from $64-72bn in capital expenditures including the cost of building out AI infrastructure. That is up from $65bn the company originally said it was expecting to spend in 2025. Total costs and expenditures for the first quarter were already at $24.76bn, a 9% increase compared to the year prior. Uncertainty over Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs may yet roil ad markets, clouding the company’s financial outlook for near future quarters.EMarketersenior analyst Minda Smiley said the company’s “optimistic Q2 guidance signals that the company isn’t expecting any major dips in ad revenue” as a result of the tariffs. But that they don’t expect Meta will be spared from the downturn in the long term.“On the one hand, the company stands to gain from economic instability. Advertisers will allocate more ad dollars to proven, sophisticated networks like Facebook and Instagram – all while pulling back spend on smaller social platforms – while they navigate uncertainty,” Smiley said. “On the other hand, a small but significant portion of Meta’s revenue comes from Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein advertising to US shoppers. That spend is starting to dry up as a result of trade and tariff change.”Meta’s spending also continues to “weigh heavily on investors”, according to analyst Debra Aho Williamson, the founder and chief analyst of Sonata Insights. “But Meta will resist directly monetizing AI this year, focusing instead on building AI usage among its app users, advertisers and developers using Llama,” said Williamson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But aWSJ reportexposed the existing chatbots integrated into the company’s various products, including Facebook and Instagram, were given the ability to perform “romantic role play” even with the platforms’ teen users. Executives at the company, which repeatedly has touted its nearly 1 billion users of its AI chatbots, alsoadmitthat many of those users access the chatbot through its hard-to-avoid takeover of the search bars of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. The company has not detailed how many interactions with the chatbot or how deep those interactions need to be to consider a person a user of the AI chatbot.Paired with Meta’songoing antitrust trial– where the company faces claims that it built an illegal social media monopoly with its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp – the uncertain AI future adds to the concerns some analysts may have around Meta’s financials despite what it may look like on paper.“Meta’s earnings call comes at a precarious time where the company’s future is literally beingdebated in court– the results of which could fundamentally alter the social media landscape,” said Forrester VP’s research director,Mike Proulx. “Meta is smart to direct more resources into improving Threads and Facebook since those could be the only two apps the company is left with. It’s also notable that Meta just laid off a number of employees in its Reality Labs division, which has been a continued and growing leaky bucket for Meta.”Explore more on these topicsMetaQuarterly resultsnewsShareReuse this content"

The parcel delivery service said it made consolidated revenues of $21.5bn, compared with $21.7bn about the same time a year ago. Additionally, the company said it would be shuttering 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June of this year.“The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier,” Carol Tomé, UPS chief executive officer, said in a statement.“The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.”The service currently has roughly 490,000 employees, about 330,000 of whom are members of the Teamsters union. Last year, UPS said it cut its workforce by 12,000 jobs. In Tuesday’s report, the company said it planned to make these latest reductions to its “operational workforce”, or those who are directly involved in package sorting, transport and delivery.The job cuts come as Donald Trump’s sweepingtariffsare discouraging some UPS customers from shipping as many goods, and Americans are anticipating continuous impact on US and global trade.The company cited “current macro-economic uncertainty” as preventing it from providing any updates to its previously issued forecasts for revenue and full-year outlook.The report also said UPS planned to expand on its consolidations of facilities and workforce as well as implement an “end-to-end process redesign” resulting from anticipated “lower volumes” from the company’s largest customer, Amazon. The Bezos-owned retail giant accounted for 11.8% of overall revenue for UPS in 2024, according toCNBC.The Teamsters union responded to the latest earnings report by reminding UPS that it was contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under the current agreement.“If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won’t stand in its way,” the Teamsters general president, Sean O’Brien, said ina statement. “But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsCouriers/delivery industryShipping industryUS unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Chinese exports soared more than 12% last month as businesses rushed toget ahead of the punishing tariffs.The impact of the measures began to show in official data on Wednesday, with the purchasing managers’ index – a key measure of industrial output – falling to 49.0 in April, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the lowest reading since December 2023. Anything below the 50-point mark signifies a contraction.Xi announces plan for Chinese economy to counter impact of US trade warRead moreThe reading for April represented a steeper decline than the 49.7 forecast in a Bloomberg survey. It was down from March’s 50.5, which was the highest figure in 12 months.Zhao Qinghe, an NBS statistician, said the drop was largely down to “sharp changes in [China’s] external environment”.Economists have warned that the disruption in trade between the tightly integrated US and Chinese economies could threaten businesses, increase prices for consumers and cause a global recession.“The weak manufacturing PMI in April is driven by the trade war,” Zhiwei Zhang, the president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, wrote in a note. “The macro data in China and the US will weaken further … as the trade policy uncertainty delays business decisions.”Goldman Sachs has estimated that 16m jobs in China could be at risk if the high tariffs persist, mainly in the export, wholesale and retail industries.A new US measure to close a loophole that had allowed low-value goods to be shipped into the US for free comes into effect on Friday, which will mainly affect Chinese businesses.More than 90% of packages arriving in the US come underthe “de minimis” scheme, which allows items with a value under $800 (£599) to evade duties. From Friday, those goods, which have fuelled the rise of e-commerce companies such as Temu and Shein, will be subject to a 120% levy or a flat fee.China sends back new Boeing jet made more expensive by tariffsRead moreChina’s economy, the world’s second largest, has struggled to fully recover since the Covid pandemic and is also grappling with sluggish domestic demand and a protracted property sector crisis.“China’s economy is coming under pressure as external demand cools,” said Zichun Huang, a China economist at CapitalEconomics, in a note. “Although the government is stepping up fiscal support, this is unlikely to fully offset the drag, and we expect the economy to expand just 3.5% this year.”Authorities last year announced a slew of aggressive stimulus measures aimed at boosting growth, including rate cuts and the easing of some home purchasing restrictions.On top of this, leaders at a key political meeting vowed to create 12m urban jobs in 2025 in March.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But observers have voiced concerns that regulatory oversight in the country hasfailed to keep up with the rush to develop minesto satisfy booming global demand.Leaked documents seen by the Guardian suggest a source of drinking water close to a$1bn (£800m) mining projectowned by the Indonesia-based Harita Group on remote Obi Island, was contaminated with unsafe levels of hexavalent chromium (Cr6), the cancer-causing chemical more widely known for its role in theErin Brockovich story and film.Cr6 cancause liver damage, reproductive problems and developmental harmwhen ingested or inhaled. Long-term exposure through drinking water has alsobeenlinked to stomach cancer. Evidence has shown thatCr6 in drinking water can bea result of industrial processes.Map showing Obi Island, IndonesiaThe leak comes after aGuardian investigation into pollutionat the site in 2022 was disputed by the mining company, which extracts and processes nickel for use in EV batteries.For the 2022 investigation, water samples collected from a spring in the village of Kawasi, less than 200 metres from the mining site, were tested at government-certified laboratories and suggested high levels of contamination fromcarcinogenic Cr6of 60 parts per billion (ppb). Themaximum contaminant levelallowed by law in Indonesia is 50ppb.In response to the Guardian’s original investigation, a Harita company said its own results had shown that the spring water was suitable for consumption and met the quality standards set by the Indonesian government.However, the leaked documents and emails suggest a Harita company found the Cr6 values in Kawasi spring, used as drinking water by villagers, in excess of Indonesian quality standards just one day after its statement to the contrary. It then found even higher values in subsequent days. It does not appear to have made this data public.View image in fullscreenCanals have been built by the company to take wastewater from the nickel mine, some of which flow past villages. They empty into the sea.Photograph: Adlun Fiqri Pramadhani/The GuardianThe Guardian was given a chance to review the material by theOrganized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project(OCCRP) in a joint investigation with theGecko Project, a non-profit newsroom.The material suggests tests of Kawasi’s spring water undertaken by a Harita company found Cr6 concentrations of 70ppb on 1 February 2022, one day after the Harita company provided its statement to the Guardian. On 7 February 2022 a value of 128ppb was recorded.A weekly environment report from December 2022 reported that values of 140ppb had been recorded at the spring.‘We are afraid’: Erin Brockovich pollutant linked to global electric car boomRead moreHarita has not responded to requests for comment on the leaked material and test results but in apress release published on its websitethis month, the company said it conducts periodic monitoring of the water at Kawasi spring to ensure it is safe and uncontaminated.Environmental health experts have said the test results suggest a significant issue with pollution.Matthew Baird, an environmental lawyer based in south-east Asia, said: “These are figures that need to be taken into account not just by the company, but also the Indonesian government.”“Nickel is meant to be one of the transition metals [to move to a green, low-carbon economy] and we require a just transition to ensure the protection of the environment, human rights and the community,” he said.Explore more on these topicsMiningRights and freedomWaterPollutionGreen economyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsGlobal healthIndonesianewsShareReuse this content"

And it was actually pretty special, an exhilarating occasion that resolved nothing but won’t be easily forgotten.The same could be said of Denzel Dumfries, scorer of two goals and forever tearing intoBarcelona, and of Lamine Yamal. They were the most outstanding of many outstanding players on a wild and wonderful occasion in which Barcelona twice came from behind to equalise but couldn’t turn it around entirely, left lamenting their vulnerability at the back. Inter, meanwhile, left satisfied and very much alive, their first task completed. This was a revival they needed, the greatest prize of all still within their reach.Arsenal are talking the talk after PSG loss but can they walk the walk in Paris?Read more“We’re not used to losing,” Simone Inzaghi had said but it had become a bad habit at a very bad time. Three times they lost in seven days. Defeated by their rivals Milanin the Coppa Italia semi-finals, they lost first place in the league at the handsof Bolognaand Roma,Napoli taking advantage. One of three trophies had gone and another was going, the dream of a treble evaporating. Determined that it wouldn’t be the entire season that died away, they could not have started better.The Italians had only been playing for 30 seconds and Barcelona hadn’t yet been given the chance to play at all when they led. A ball into the familiar open space behind the left-back was the Catalan side’s undoing. The first delivery from Dumfries was half cleared, but he got another chance and this time Marcus Thuram – who had missed those three consecutive defeats – guided a glorious flick past Wojciech Szczesny and into the net. It was quick, and the second wasn’t far behind, Dumfries connecting with an acrobatic volley from a corner after 21 minutes.If this was a reminder of the ghosts of theirChampions Leaguepast, and they needed more goals than Inter Milan had conceded in the entire league phase, Barcelona were not to be beaten. Lamine Yamal certainly wasn’t scared. Instead, there he was gesturing for this Olympic stadium to get on its feet and delivering a display that meant they could hardly do anything else.His first delivery had just evaded Ferran Torres and his second set up the striker to fire a fraction wide. That was still at 1-0 and even two down he kept going. The goal which put Barcelona back in the game was almost absurd, the 17-year-old turning away from Thuram, snaking past Henrikh Mkhitaryan and, surrounded by opponents, bending into the corner. A moment later he almost scored one even better, leaving Federico Dimarco on the floor before rattling the bar. Then with the noise rising and the momentum building, Pedri’s lovely ball was headed down by Raphinha and Torres equalised.View image in fullscreenDenzel Dumfries doubles Inter’s first-half lead with an acrobatic volley.Photograph: Joan Monfort/APWhat a game this had become, and it didn’t stop there. If the second half began with Barcelona dominating and Inter sitting deeper, that didn’t mean the Italians had renounced the right to go for the throat when they had the chance. A portrait of the two sides’ approaches came early when a clever pass from Lamine Yamal for Dani Olmo almost opened up Inter and a swift exit from deep did open up Barcelona. Ronald Araújo slid across to stop that attack but, from the corner, Dumfries rose to head past Szczesny, off his line and caught out.Again, the response was immediate, the place exploding when Lamine Yamal allowed a corner to roll through his legs and, from the edge of the area, Raphinha smashed a shot in off the bar and Yann Sommer’s back to make it 3-3 and throw the game wide open. Barcelona were playing with fire, grateful for a superb interception from Pau Cubarsí and relieved to see the flag go up when Dumfries’ wonderful devastatingly ball was finished off by Mkhitaryan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Or perhaps it was just because this is how they are.Either way, it was certainly fun, a microcosm of the game offered when Lamine Yamal pirouetted past two and Szczesny had rush out to deny Dumfries in the same minute. All it lacked was a winner, Lamine Yamal clipping the final shot off the  bar.

In the interview, Hudson objected to a question about how the two had met while Tony Dokoupil referred to her during the segment as being a “constant presence” in the interview.NFL fines Falcons’ Jeff Ulbrich $100,000 over son’s prank call to Shedeur SandersRead more“The final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation which we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career,” Belichick said in his statement. “Instead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative – that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation – which is simply not true.”Belichick also said he told his publicist with book publisher Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews would “agree to focus solely on the contents of the book”. But CBS News pushed back in its own statement Wednesday.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.”The awkward interview added to the attention and curiosity that has followed the 73-year-old Belichick, hired as the Tar Heels’ head coach in December after his ultra-successful run with the New England Patriots, and the 24-year-old Hudson, who has frequently posted glimpses into their relationshipwith social media photos. That has included her role in Belichick’s transition to college coaching, such as a March public records report by The Assembly about Belichick’s request for an athletic official at UNC to copy in Hudson on emails sent to him.In his Wednesday statement, Belichick said he shares “both a personal and professional relationship” with Hudson and that he expected the interview would focus solely on the book release instead of his personal life. He said Hudson had “stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion” in an effort to “ensure the interview stayed on track”.He also said the couple has “been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021”.During the CBS interview, Belichick shrugged off attention on his relationship with Hudson, saying: “Never been too worried about what everybody else thinks, just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what’s right.”When Dokoupil asked how they met, Hudson – sitting at a nearby table – said flatly: “We’re not talking about this.”In a statement Tuesday, InkWell Management – a literary agency working with Belichick on his upcoming book – said the interview “veered” into a discussion of Belichick’s personal life and resulted “in a raft of hostile social media posts about his personal life”.“Bill has written an authoritative and entertaining book about success that should be judged by its contents, not by the clicks generated by the segment,” the agency said.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsCBSShareReuse this content"

However, before Sanders was picked he received a call from someone claiming to be New Orleans Saints general manager Mickey Loomis suggesting his team would select the quarterback with their next pick.The draft roughed up Shedeur Sanders. The NFL will demand even moreRead moreOn Sunday, Ulbrich’s 21-year-old son, Jax, admitted he had written down Sanders’ number after seeing it on his father’s open iPad. Video emerged of Jax Ulbrich and a friend making the prank call to Sanders.“I’m so sorry I took away from your moment, it was selfish and childish,”Jax Ulbrich wroteon Instagram in a message directed toward Sanders. “I could never imagine getting ready to celebrate one of the greatest moments of your life and I made a terrible mistake and messed with that moment. Thank you for accepting my call earlier today, I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.”The Falcons also apologized to Sanders, adding that Jeff Ulbrich “was unaware of the data exposure or any facets of the prank and was made aware of the above only after the fact”.For his part, Sanders did not seem too concerned about the matter when he spoke about it on Saturday. “It didn’t really have an impact on me,” Sanders told reporters. “Of course, I feel like it was a childish act, but everybody does childish things here and there.”Sanders’s father is Deion Sanders, who played for the Falcons during his Hall of Fame NFL career and went on to coach Shedeur in college.Sanders was not the only draft prospect who received a prank call during the draft.Fox Sports reportedthat Penn State tight end Tyler Warren received a call several picks before he was selected 14th overall by the Indianapolis Colts.

It would take a lot for one of the regulars not to show up. The time is almost 11am and cups are being laid out in the Aspmyra Stadion canteen for the Bodø/Glimt old boys’ daily catchup. In walks Ivar Bakke, who can count himself as the group’s elder statesman at 94. “One of the oldest people in Norway!” he laughs before sitting down. Tall tales are retold, memories sharpened in delighting over past and more recent glories; however far those stretch, everyone here knows what it has taken to bring their club to the barely fathomable territory of aEuropa Leaguesemi-final.The raconteur in chief is Jacob Klette, a sharp figure in his late 70s who made almost 400 appearances for a team that broke boundaries. “The northern part of Norway has always had to fight for its rights,” Klette says. “I played for Lyn, the best team in Oslo, in the late 1960s. You would open the newspaper and see adverts: ‘We have an apartment for rent, but not for people from the north.’ You felt disgusted to see it.”How did Djurgården end up in a European semi-final against Chelsea?Read moreKlette and many of his friends at the table would turn convention and outright prejudice on their head. Clubs from all the way up here, 75 miles inside the Arctic circle, were not allowed to play in the Norwegian cup until 1963. They were regarded as poor relations on and off the pitch, the north’s customs and dialect unwelcome in the supposedly more refined south. Promotion to the top flight was made possible for northern sides only in 1972, initially on condition of contesting an additional playoff. But in 1975Bodø/Glimt, while still hammering at a glass ceiling from the second tier, travelled to Oslo and sensationally beat Vard in the cup final.“There are eight champions from that year around this table,” Klette says. “I scored the winner here in the quarter-final against the champions, Viking, right down in that corner of the pitch. After the match everyone swarmed on to the grass, all the children surrounded me. The next year we played Napoli in the Cup Winners’ Cup and their own fans booed them. We showed you can be from northern Norway and play against anyone.”View image in fullscreenHarold Berg (left) in the Aspmyra Stadion canteen for the Bodø/Glimt old boys’ daily catchup ‘coffee table’ tradition.Photograph: Marthe Mølstre/The GuardianAcross the room, the present-day fruit of those endeavours are visible. As Klette chats, the first team are filing in for lunch. They won a routine top-flight fixture against KFUM the previous evening and are three days from the most significant match of their careers; the biggest in Bodø/Glimt’s history. This season’s team went to Italy andknocked Lazio outon penalties to earn their last-four tie against Spurs. For five years that have brought four league titles and a string of European upsets, they have barely missed a beat.“When they’ve done something special and come back here, we treat them like it’s a normal day,” Klette says. “The world keeps turning: been there, done that. But we’re always here drinking coffee and the players tell us they appreciate the stability in this room.”As if on cue, the captain, Patrick Berg, wanders over to exchange greetings. Klette teases Berg, whose first-leg suspension is a significant loss, about the identity of his potential replacement in London. Berg’s grandfather Harald, one of Norway’s best-ever players and another hero of 1975, is sitting further down the table; they are just two parts of a dynasty that has left a profound mark on club and city. Beloved things are handed down here. “We always connect the history to each player,” Klette says. “They find it like a family.”The winter has, even by local standards, been rainswept and harsh. But when KFUM visit the sky is perfect blue; overnight the clouds cleared, darkness never quite shrouding a band of white arctic light that shimmered across the sea through the small hours. The walk past Hålogalandsgata’s sturdy wood-panelled houses to Aspmyra is a picture. Yellow and black flags fly from every second property, the crooked peaks of Borvasstinden gleaming 20 miles in the distance. Everywhere is theoretically walkable in this city of 53,000 although anyone from further afield has it tougher.At least one fan has made the gruelling journey from Harstad, 250 miles further north; some still travel three hours each way by boat from the Lofoten archipelago. When Bodø/Glimt were allowing an entire region to walk tall 40 years ago people would drive for 15 hours from the country’s most remote region, Finnmark, to share in the sense of pride.Now Bodø bursts with it again. “This is basically one big dream,” says Magnus Vindenes, a member of the J-Feltet supporters’ group. “It’s difficult to appreciate right now. But everybody here feels part of it. We still see our players out walking their dogs. A lot of them are local lads and feel the same way we do. It feels good to show the rest of the country that this is how you do it. Bodø/Glimt means something more than being just a good football team; they’ve always been a symbol of northern Norwegian self-esteem.”View image in fullscreenMagnus Vindenes, a member of Bodø/Glimt’s J-Feltet supporters’ group.Photograph: Marthe Mølstre/The GuardianVindenes has followed the club through multiple financial crises and three relegations since the millennium began. In 2017 it seemed an unsurpassable high to win 6-1 at Strømmen, a tiny club outside Oslo, en route to their top-flight return. “There had been a few years where I made peace that we weren’t going to be a good side any more and this was just our lot,” he says. “So at the time it was: ‘My god, we’re going back up, this is massive.’ Four years laterJosé Mourinho’s Roma are being thrashedat Aspmyra. It goes to show anything is possible.”Inside the stadium, Inge Henning Andersen is not inclined to argue. Bodø/Glimt’s chairman uses the folk concept“Askeladden”, the underdog power of battling through using guts and ingenuity, to describe their rise. “It means you came from nothing,” he says. “The fact is that nobody has ever pumped money into this club. Whatever is here, we earned it.“We haven’t always even been No 1 in this city. But now we have come this far we’ll do whatever it takes to stay there. Even at our AGM in 2018, our CEO [Frode Thomassen] said we might win a cup once in a while, but probably not the league. It never crossed our minds to be here.”View image in fullscreenBodø/Glimt fan stickers in Bådin where the J-Feltet supporters group meet up pre-match.Photograph: Marthe Mølstre/The GuardianAndersen sensed something had changed in 2020, when Bodø/Glimt followed a second-placed finish in Eliteserien with their first title. They had rarely strung together consecutive successful seasons. “Have we cracked the code now?” he asked himself. It turned out they had.“Vårres Måte”(our way) is the name of an action plan few, domestically or among their continental scalps, have managed to outsmart.It is Kjetil Knutsen’s way too. The previously little-known 56-year-old has, in seven years as manager, created a machine by trusting in others’ cast-offs and developing from within. Players have been sold but, in many cases, returned to shine again in a formidably high-functioning 4-3-3 system. Berg, who struggled at Lens, and the former Milan prodigy Jens Petter Hauge are obvious examples.“They come back and thrive in the system we have,” says Roger Andreassen, who played for Bodø/Glimt in their embattled 1980s, receiving only a car and petrol money in return. “And in most matches, when it gets to 70 minutes they can step up a gear and just overrun their opponents. Many just aren’t prepared for it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Berg will later, at that coffee table meeting, observe that well-wishers had been approaching him all week offering warm thoughts for the Tottenham tie without any mention of Sunday’s league assignment. In a safe standing area opposite, J-Feltet run through their choral repertoire of songs about friendship and the north, which bring out goosebumps on a packed European night. KFUM, who represent Oslo’s YMCA, do such an efficient spoiling job that thoughts drift to the prospect of their eight away fans performing the appropriate dance.In the end Bodø/Glimt slide up the gears again with three goals in the final 10 minutes. A weaving run by Håkan Evjen, another who must sit out Thursday’s game with a ban, lets Sondre Sørli tee up Kasper Høgh’s opener. Minds in tiny Aspmyra, far from full to its 8,270 capacity, are patently elsewhere.That does not apply to Knutsen, a pragmatist whose celebrations in Rome were tempered by his sense the team had not played well. He is asked after to savour their leap to the big time. “No, it’s too early,” he responds. “Give me 10 years, and then maybe.”View image in fullscreenBodø/Glimt fans cheer their team during their Eliteserien match against KFUM.Photograph: Marthe Mølstre/The GuardianRunar Berg remembers walking out of the pub in 2010 and stopping for a late-night burger at Anna’s, a small pentagonal institution close to the city’s shopping district. He had recently retired from playing and Bodø/Glimt were close to bankruptcy, a fate with which they had flirted previously. Berg, the uncle of Patrick and son of Harald, had begun a collection with his brother Ørjan to stave off the club’s extinction. Both men were club legends who rose to wider fame playing for Rosenborg’s successful teams in the late 1990s.“A guy in there had 200 kroner [£15] and threw it at me: ‘Take it, you need it more than me, save the club!’” he remembers. “It all built up. People sold hot dogs, ran lotteries, it was a big thing.” A local company donated batches oflutefisk, dried cod, so that the club could hold supper nights and sell it. The Berg family, club and community running through their veins, organised a concert that brought in an estimated £130,000. Bodø/Glimt pulled through. A decade later, the picture had changed unimaginably.James Maddison hungry to repay loyal Spurs fans with Europa League gloryRead moreTalking a few yards from his coffee-drinking seniors, Runar Berg runs through a lifetime of footballing stories handed down by Harald. There was the occasion in the 1960s when, unaware a game had been rescheduled, a group of players had to be hurriedly salvaged from a fishing trip in the mountains. Then there was the time when, looking for a grass pitch on which to train for a cup tie further south, the only local option was a campsite outside town. “They turned up and found people with tents up,” he says. “There was nowhere for them to go.”Before Aspmyra was constructed, Bodø/Glimt played on hard, gravelly ground. The climate dictates that nowadays they operate on artificial turf, which should still be little excuse for the multimillion-pound operations that have floundered here. The next step, should plans be realised, is to build a new 10,000-capacity venue a mile along the road. Andersen hopes construction can begin this year.View image in fullscreenFans make their way to the Aspmyra Stadion, which the club plan to vacate for a new ground.Photograph: Marthe Mølstre/The GuardianThere is a balance to strike: the club’s workforce has trebled to 120 since 2017 but the region’s remoteness limits crowd sizes. Whereas they could have housed 40,000 fans for the second leg against Spurs, a fraction of that figure would be willing to watch KFUM. Bodø itself has faced changes to the fishing and air defence industries that once formed its lifeblood, although it has reinvented as an IT hub. It would be difficult for the club to outgrow their home.Some day soon, the coffee table may have to move. “I’m confident in the way this club is built and funded,” Klette says. “In my day, if you asked a player from the south to come here it was: ‘No way, it’s too far and too cold.’ But the people in every department now are so dedicated and know their jobs by heart. If we manage to get the new stadium, I think we can be in this position for the next two decades.”Klette breaks off to hail the previous day’s gamebreaker Sondre Sørli, who is clearing his tray nearby. “We always give the coaches a brilliant impression that we are selecting the team,” he says. Bodø/Glimt’s elder statesmen cannot quite go that far nowadays. But, here in one of European football’s remotest outposts, their decades-long cocktail of perseverance, community, legacy and sheer love is unbreakably entwined in modern miracle.Explore more on these topicsBodø/GlimtEuropa LeagueEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the ensuing celebrations, Antetokounmpo says Haliburton’s father, John, approached him and waved a towel while shouting “this is what we fucking do.”“I believe in being humble in victory,” Antetokounmpo said after the game. “A lot of people out there that are like, no, when you win the game, you talk shit and it’s a green light for you to be disrespectful towards somebody else. I disagree.”Haliburton was unhappy with his father too.“I don’t agree with what transpired there from him,” Haliburton said. “Basketball is basketball and let’s keep it on the court. I think he just got excited, saw his son make a game winner and came on the court, but we had a conversation.“He needs to just allow me to play basketball and stay over there and I’ll come to him to celebrate. But the emotions of the game got excited there. I talked with him. I’ll talk with Giannis. I don’t think my pops was in the right at all there.”Antetokounmpo had a 30-point, 20-rebound and 13-assist triple-double as the Bucks lost in the first round of the playoffs for the third year in a row, and for a second time in succession against the Pacers.John Haliburton,who has been a basketball referee, later apologized on social media for the incident.“I sincerely apologize to Giannis, the Milwaukee Bucks and the Pacers organization for my actions following tonight’s game,”he wrote. “This was not a good reflection on our sport or my son and I will not make that mistake again.”Antetokounmpo was also involved in a fracas with the Pacers’ Bennedict Mathurin after the game. The two initially embraced before Antetokounmpo put his hand on Mathurin’s neck and the two started shoving each other.In Tuesday night’s other games, Jamal Murray erupted for 43 points and Russell Westbrook chipped in 21 in his return from injury, sparking the Nuggets’ 131-115 win over the Los Angeles Clippers that gave Denver a 3-2 lead in their series. The Nuggets also got 23 from Game 4 hero Aaron Gordon and Nikola Jokić’s 21st career playoff triple-double of 18 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists.Elsewhere, Cade Cunningham had 24 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, and Detroit stayed alive in their first postseason appearance since 2019 by beating New York in Game 5 of their first-round series. Ausar Thompson added 22 points and Tobias Harris had 17 for the Pistons, who will have a chance to even things up Thursday night at home in Game 6. If they win that, the deciding game would be back at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.Meanwhile, Jayson Tatum had 35 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds, and Boston pulled away after Magic star Paolo Banchero went to the bench with five fouls, beating Orlando in Game 5 of their first-round playoff series to advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals. The defendingNBAchampions will play either the Knicks or Pistons in the second round. Franz Wagner scored 25 points, Banchero had 19 and Wendell Carter Jr. had 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Magic, who have not won a playoff series since Dwight Howard, Vince Carter and coach Stan Van Gundy led them to the Eastern Conference finals in 2010.Explore more on these topicsNBAMilwaukee BucksIndiana PacersBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

(A lot has changed in four years, never mind four decades.) Four years ago, Wales’ oldest soccer club were at a non-league nadir. Now, they are preparing for life in the Championship, propelled to three straight promotions by the stardust (and money) ofRyan Reynoldsand Rob McElhenney.Birmingham City’s second tier exile was much shorter – just a single season – but like Wrexham their promotion had the spotlight of celebrity on it. While Wrexham have Reynolds and McElhenney, Birmingham haveTom Brady(albeit it in a far smaller profile). The English lower leagues have never been so glamorous, what with Wrexham playersappearing in Marvel moviesand David Beckham attending matches.Wrexham announce record revenue of £26.7m after boost in US popularityRead moreAnd yet both clubs’ ownership have defied the cynics. Birmingham andWrexhamhave spent big – really big in the case of the former, who splurged £25m on transfers last summer – but something meaningful is happening at the Racecourse Ground and St Andrew’s. Two historic clubs have been revitalised.Here’s a five-step plan for other North American owners on how to run a British club successfully.1) Buy low. Really lowReynolds and McElhenney deliberately bought a club that couldn’t sink much lower. That was their plan from the start and explains why they also looked at Hartlepool United, similarly down on their luck in the National League, before buying Wrexham in November 2020. Brady and Tom Wagner did something similar by buyingBirmingham Cityin May 2023 after years of financial uncertainty.Birmingham and Wrexham both had large, passionate fanbases desperate to be re-energised. On size and stature alone, both should have been more successful. The upside was clear for the new owners who both see the Premier League as a realistic target. If the likes of Bournemouth and Brentford can do it, why not these two? Promotion to theChampionshipputs them just one step away.“It’s been hard to buy into the North American optimism, but they have gradually eroded the generational pessimism ingrained in cynical Wrexham fans, who have rightfully been cautious given how the club so nearly went out of business,” says Rich Fay of the RobRyanRed podcast. “This Wrexham team is a winning machine.”View image in fullscreenWrexham players have been followed by a documentary crew near-continuously.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian2) Tell a storyWrexham impressed on the field as they surged to League Two promotion last season, but that’s not why over 80,000 fans came to watch Phil Parkinson’s team in Santa Barbara, Santa Clara and Vancouver last summer. They came to see Paul Mullin and Ollie Palmer and all the other characters from soccer’s most popular reality TV show.Anyone who has watched Welcome to Wrexham knows it’s a series that’s only so much about the actual soccer. It’s actually about the lifelong fan who owns the pub next door. And the club’s powerchair team. And the town which has struggled in the post-industrial era. Wales itself is a character.A Birmingham City documentary series is also coming. That the new Amazon show is to be directed by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight suggests Blues will follow the formula established by Wrexham in telling a story beyond soccer. Star players used to be enough for a club to shift some jerseys around the world. That was before Welcome to Wrexham changed everything. It might not be a fairytale, but Wrexham in particular has been a hugely compelling story to tell.St Andrew’s stardust: Birmingham eye records and Premier League push | Ben FisherRead more3) Invest in yourselfLess than a year after arriving, Birmingham City’s new owners bought 48 acres of land for a new stadium. It was a statement of intent that highlighted Wagner’s ambition with the ‘Sports Quarter’ development on an under-utilised site near the city centre estimated to cost £2-3bn ($2.6-$4m). Money has also been spent to renovate St Andrew’s and the training ground.Fans see Wagner as an honorary Brummie. Outsiders might consider his team talks and fist pumping cringey, but Birmingham fans see someone whose passion for the club can’t be questioned. “On away days, Tom regularly puts his credit card behind the bar for fans to have a beer,” said Chris Goulding of the We Are Birmingham podcast and blog.Wrexham have their own stadium plans. The club hopes to start construction of a new 5,500-capacity Kop stand soon, recently unveiling an updated design inspired by Wrexham’s red brick traditions. This is a town nicknamed ‘Terracottapolis,’ after all. It’s also a town where nearly 8,000 children live in poverty, something the recently revamped Wrexham AFC Foundation wants to tackle.View image in fullscreenChris Davies led Birmingham City to the League One title.Photograph: Nigel French/PA4) Have a clear styleParkinson’s conservative style of play has drawn criticism even as his team have risen through the divisions, but his approach has given Wrexham a clear framework to build around. Only Birmingham have conceded fewer league goals than The Red Dragons this season while goalkeeper Arthur Okonkwo has kept 18 clean sheets, second inLeague Onebehind … Birmingham’s Ryan Allsop.The pragmatism of Parkinson-ball might be even more valuable in the Championship when Wrexham will regularly face opponents with better players and bigger budgets. While other nouveau riche clubs might have grown restless and changed managers, Wrexham stayed consistent with Parkinson who doesn’t always get the credit he deserves. “I feel the entire process has distracted from what a good job Phil Parkinson has done,” says Fay.Chris Davies has similarly given his team an identifiable playing style. Under Brendan Rodgers and Ange Postecoglou’s former assistant, Blues have thrived as an aggressive possession-oriented side capable of magic in the attacking third. Wayne Rooney’s appointment last season was a misstep, but Birmingham quickly corrected that mistake.Beyond the Bernabéu: how and why Modric became an investor in SwanseaRead more5) Keep evolvingSeason by season, Wrexham have shown a willingness to change. Mullin and Palmer were the stars of the seasons in the National League and League Two. This time around, the pair have been part of the attacking rotation along with Steven Fletcher and Jay Rodriguez, two forwards with genuine pedigree at a high level.Okonkwo came in from Arsenal to replace Mark Howard as Wrexham’s No 1. Forward Sam Smith arrived from Reading for a club-record fee. Parkinson also changed formation midway through the campaign, moving away from the dual striker system that had worked so well for him until that point.“With two up front, it was making us … I won’t say predictable, but we needed to adapt, particularly in possession,” said Parkinson. A home defeat to Stevenage in late January prompted a rethink and was the catalyst for a run that saw Wrexham lose just two out of 17 games to clinch promotion.Birmingham’s evolution has been far less gradual, with the signing of 17 new players last summer giving Davies the talent he needed to point the club in the right direction. Jay Stansfield was the most expensive addition, costing a league-record £15m. However, the 22-year-old justified such an eye-watering fee by netting 19 goals in 34 league appearances.Backed by Knighthead, a New York investment fund valued at close to $10bn, Birmingham will spend more. “With these owners I think the Premier League is just their first target,” says Goulding.Wrexham, on the other hand, might be more like a dog catching a car now that they are up to the Championship. This could be why New York’s Allyn family,whose wealth dwarfs that of Reynolds and McElhenney, joined as board members last autumn. Further evolution will be required, as will more money. Reynolds only has so much Mint Mobile cash to plough in.Explore more on these topicsLeague OneWrexhamBirmingham CityChampionshipRyan ReynoldsTom BradyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ina social media video, Zema hurled a mock-up of the red shirt on to the ground in theatrical disgust.Bolsonaro’s politician son, Flávio Bolsonaro, said the supposed plans needed “vehemently repudiating”, insisting: “Our flag isn’t red – and it never will be.”But Bolsonaristas are not the only ones up in arms about the reported attempt to swap Brazil’s blue away shirt – in use since the country won the first of its five World Cup, in 1958 – for a red one.Football purists of all political stripes have clobbered the “leaked” plans since they surfaced on Monday ina viral reportby the football website Footy Headlines.The idea has proved so controversial that the CBF was forced to deny it on Tuesday insisting online images of the red jersey were not official and that it remained committed to yellow and blue shirts. The kit for next year’s World Cup had yet to be designed in partnership with Brazil’s official kit supplier Nike, the CBF claimed.Walter Casagrande, a Lula-voting former player and commentator who is associated with Brazil’s left and pro-democracy movement, called the scheme “idiocy”.Sports writer Paulo Vinícius Coelhosaidthe move showed “a complete lack of sense” and was almost certainly commercially driven.Galvão Bueno, Brazil’s most famous TV commentator, called the idea “a crime” and a “gigantic insult” to the glorious history of a national team which has won more World Cups than any other country.Some leftwing Brazilians were more receptive to the idea of a crimson kit. Over the past decade the country’s iconic yellow jersey has becomea symbol of the far rightand is regularly worn at pro-Bolsonaro rallies. Many progressivesnow refuse to wear it.Ina pro-red shirt manifesto, columnist Milly Lacombe declared that she would wear the jersey with pride and rejected the outbreak of “collective hysteria” over the mooted shirt. “Red is a strong colour that stands for revolution, change, transformation, blood, struggle, life, death, rebirth,” she wrote.Juca Kfouri, a left-leaning football writer who is among those who shun the yellow shirt,also rejected the “bad taste” change, arguing that a red shirt would further fuel the toxic politics swirling around the national team’s attire and divide supporters.“Red doesn’t have anything to do with Brazil,” Kfouri said, although he noted that Brazil took its name from a redwood tree calledpau-brasil(brazilwood in English) and, in the early 19th century,had red in its first flag.Kfouri suspected the red shirt story was “a trial balloon” devised to see how the money-making ruse went down with fans. “Just like politicians sometimes leak a policy, wait to see how the social networks react and, depending on that reaction, give up or move ahead,” he said.For the CBF, the hoo-ha was also a helpful diversion as it sought to shift attention away from its apparent failure to recruit the Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, as Brazil’s next manager anda compromising exposéin a Brazilian magazine. “It distracts from the things that really matter,” Kfouri said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilWorld CupAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He offered his congratulations to Chelsea and, asked how anyone can stop them, he replied: “It’s a good question. Everyone is trying to find the answer. You have to take those head-to-heads. I know this sounds strange but, for probably the finances they spend, I don’t think they’re a million miles [ahead], even though they’ve won it, there’s always a chance to get them and catch them. But they have serial winners. They’ve experienced it for many years. And you’ve got to try and topple that dynasty.”If Chelsea had needed a morale boost after theirhumbling 8-2 aggregate defeatagainst Barcelona, it came in the form of score updates from Villa Park while they were arriving at a sun-kissed Leigh Sports Village, as news of goal after goal after goal continued to trickle up the M6 until it turned into something of a flood of bewilderment, rippling around the stadium.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Lucy Bronze heads the ball past Manchester United’s keeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce to score what proved to be the winner.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/ReutersArsenal had lost 5-2, yes, 5-2, away at Aston Villa. “Really?” fans asked. The team heading to the Women’s Champions League final, after theirhistoric win in Lyonon Sunday, needing a win to keep their own faint title hopes alive, had conceded five goals to statistically one of the worst teams in the league. This was inexplicable. This was the WSL at its very best, offering a storyline scarcely anybody with an ounce of sanity would have predicted. And this was a gift for Chelsea.Quick GuideArsenal's WSL dream ends after thrashing by Aston VillaShowArsenal's faint Women's Super League title hopes ended after they were stunned 5-2 by Aston Villa before Chelsea won at Manchester Un ited.Defeat at Villa Park was only the Gunners' third in the WSL this season, but they were left nine points adrift of Chelsea, who later clinched a sixth successive crown with a 1-0 win at Leigh Sports Village.The former Arsenal player, Jordan Nobbs, came back to haunt her old side after rounding off a swift counterattack on the half-hour mark before Kirsty Hanson doubled their advantage on the cusp of half-time with a stunning strike.Chasity Grant and Rachel Daly piled misery on the Champions League finalists after the break, before two goals in three minutes by Stina Blackstenius and then Alessia Russo cut the deficit.But Grant added her second to wrap up a third straight league victory for Villa.\"That wasn't the performance we expect of ourselves,\" said Arsenal's Kim Little. \"We expect higher standards than that and we're just disappointed in the result.\"It's over now so we have to move on but we'll regroup ... We’ve got two more league games left and a Champions League final.\"PA Media and Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It meant that, before play began in this 8.15pm kick-off, Chelsea knew they needed just one more point to clinch the title, with two more games to follow after this. They were up against a Manchester United side with aspirations of qualifying for Europe, though, and Skinner’s team began the game purposefully. A first half played at a good intensity by both teams saw the world-record signing Naomi Girma produce a block worthy of her high price tag to instinctively prevent Grace Clinton from scoring on the rebound after Melvine Malard’s initial shot had been saved by Hannah Hampton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the other end, Chelsea had looked threatening in wide areas, although they suffered a blow when Mayra Ramírez was forced off with an injury. The Colombia forward had torn United’s defence apart at Old Trafford on the final day of last season, when Chelsea hadcoasted to a 6-0 victory, in what was their final fixture before Bompastor’s arrival.Both goalkeepers were forced into superb saves early in the second half and United began to build up a spell of pressure, as they chased a winning goal for themselves that would have lifted them up to second, before two of Chelsea’s summer signings from 2024 combined to wrap up the title. Sandy Baltimore’s inswinging corner was met by Bronze at the near post and she ran to celebrate in front of the delirious Chelsea fans.It is Chelsea’s eighth WSL title since 2015 and their 17th major trophy in those past 10 years, and they will hope to add another to that tally when these two teams meet again at Wembley in May’s Women’s FA Cup final.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueChelsea WomenManchester United WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

With United in 14th and certain to finish in their lowest position in the Premier League, it would also give Amorim a trophy after taking over in late October. However, the Portuguese is clear it would not make the campaign a success.Bournemouth’s Evanilson reprieved over Manchester United VAR red cardRead more“Everybody knows it’s really important for our season [but] we know nothing is going to save our season,” he said. “This can be huge, winning a trophy, getting in the Champions League to play European [elite level] games next year: [it] could change a lot of things in our clubin the summer. [But] it’s not the most important thing.“Of course people are going to look in a different way for this season, especially at the coach. But it’s something more in the core of our club [that requires addressing]. We need to change a lot of things and need to be consistent.Europa Leaguewill not change our problems – it’s going to give us Champions League next year, more money to spend, but the problems are still there.“We have to change the minds of our fans with consistency, good decisions, good recruitment, good academy. This is what we need to change to take our club back to the top. This [winning the Europa League] is more of a shortcut to go to the European Cup games. Nothing more. The problems we need to solve in a different way with more time and we’re really clear on that.”Amorim was asked about the view that if United win the Europa League and qualify for the Champions League while finishing so low it would devalue the second-tier continental competition. “Maybe you can say it’s not fair because the best teams, the champions, should be in the Champions League,” the 40-year-old said. “It’s the rules, I don’t know if it’s fair or not but if there is that possibility we have to try and reach it.”Amorim has previously stated that his players often feel nervous, particularly at home. But despite next week’s second leg being at Old Trafford, and the tie’s high stakes, he is not concerned. “They are prepared,” Amorim said. “Every player is an international. The context of this season is really complicated in every aspect. I don’t see it as an issue. They are excited to be here and they are capable of winning.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The incident was firstreported by the Guardian.“No, don’t go there,” Redknapp said. “Oh my God, it was a joke, you know, that badly backfired. But it was only a joke.”During the event in London, Redknapp was asked whether it was right for the FA to appoint Tuchel as the third foreign manager of the England men’s team, after Sven-Göran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.“I don’t know,” Redknapp said before making comments designed to amuse his audience. “I’ll be honest with you, I think he’s a German spy. I’m telling you. Seriously, he’s been sent over to fuck us up. He has. I’m telling ya, he’s like Lord Haw-Haw in the war – ‘We have your best soldiers captured’ and all that.”He went on to imagine an instruction to Tuchel – “‘Go over and ruin that team” – before mimicking a German accent, saying “Ja” and lifting his left arm in what appeared to be a Nazi salute.Redknapp never made a secret of his desire to take the England job and was favourite for the role whenCapello stepped down in 2012, only forthe FA to appoint Roy Hodgson.

Eddie would have been perfect but he’s got a great job at Newcastle as well. In this particular time, we needed to look for a foreign manager and Tuchel was available. And he’s got a very good track record.”Al Arabiya is owned and funded by Saudi Arabia, host of the 2034 World Cup. Asked for his thoughts on the tournament, Redknapp said:“It’s going to be fantastic. Safe. Great atmosphere. People just come and have a great time. So as long as they behave themselves, which is what everybody should do anyway.

The letters were written by, among others, current and former players, club staff, volunteers and sponsors.Hull City Ladies chairman asks for club to be relegated ‘to try to punish players’Read moreThe correspondence, some entitled letters of “no confidence” in Johnson and one as a “character ­reference”, included claims that Johnson was verbally aggressive towards players on multiple occasions, and that he created a toxic environment where women felt intimidated. He kicked footballs at players in rage on more than one occasion, according to the letters.Johnson was also alleged to have made a reference, loudly in front of witnesses, to having allegedly slept with a player from the team. Johnson was contacted by the Guardian for a response.The letters submitted to the FA state that several players left because they did not wish to play for the club under Johnson and a number of the squad say they will look for a new club if Johnson stays. A group of sponsors said they were withholding funding and would reconsider only if Johnson goes.An FA spokesperson told the Guardian: “We are very concerned about the allegations raised with us, and we are in regular contact with the club and their legal ­representatives about this matter. We will continue to provide the club with support and guidance to ensure that these issues are appropriately addressed, and that the welfare of their players and staff is protected.”Sources at the club have told the Guardian they are disappointed the FA has not suspended Johnson pending an investigation. However, it is understood the FA has no authority to remove directors at clubs in the Women’s National League, which does not have an owners’ and directors’ test because clubs in the league are not required to have owners or directors, and many members clubs have neither. However, reviewing the governance structure of women’s lower-league clubs is understood to be a priority for the governing body.TheGuardian revealedon 16 April that Johnson had submitted a request to the FA for the club to be relegated, amid allegations of mismanagement of the club’s finances being made against him by his own players.Multiple club sources alleged that Johnson’s relegation submission was an attempt at retaliation after several squad members criticised him in public social media posts. The FA is understood to have ­dismissed his request because it considers such requests for voluntary relegation only if submitted formally by clubs, not by an individual.Several club personnel are understood to have had a meeting to discuss the situation with the Emma Hardy, the MP for Hull West and Haltemprice, who is understood to have requested an urgent meeting with the FA.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although Spurs have reached this stage of the Europa League for the first time since they won its predecessor, the Uefa Cup, in 1984, they have beaten only Southampton in the Premier League since the end of February and are on course for their lowest finish since its formation in 1992.Liverpool surge to Premier League title after emphatic 5-1 win against SpursRead moreMaddison acknowledged that performances – including the5-1 hammering at Anfield on Sunday– had not been good enough but he believes Tottenham’s players have the hunger to make up for it by triumphing in Europe.“It hurts me a lot that we’re having a poor season,” said the England midfielder. “But this is why we’re so motivated for this competition, because the season can still be so special. People talk all the time about Tottenham being without silverware for however many years, but we’re in the last four and we’ve got a great opportunity in a competition we’ve been pretty solid in this year. We want to reward them because we feel the support.”Maddison added: “At the end of games and you’ve lost again, you go over and you want to thank them for the support and I know they don’t want to hear it from us. Even this press conference and the interview on Sunday, they’re not really that bothered because words are just words. But it hurts and we’re trying to put it right.“That’s the main thing, that hunger is there. It doesn’t always work how you want it to, but this is a unique situation that we’re in, in the last four in Europe, when we can go and reward them for their support because they do travel everywhere. We are very grateful for that. Even in the league position we’re in and we’ve got nothing to play for, they’re still selling out Liverpool away.”Tottenham will again be without Son Heung-min, although the captain has returned to light training after a foot injury and could be in contention for next week’s second leg. That will take place on an artificial surface at Bodø’s Aspmyra Stadion – located in the Arctic Circle and with a capacity of just over 8,000. The Norwegian champions overcame the league stage winners, Lazio, in the last round via a penalty shootout and have a strong record at home under Kjetil Knutsen, winning six of their seven European matches there this season. Postecoglou knows all about the likely threat they pose having lost both legs of a Conference League playoff with Celtic in 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we are not in a moment where we can say we decide to save players for Sunday. This is a semi-final, it’s a European competition and we want to be in the final.”Chelsea got a feel for the surface when they trained at the 3Arena on Wednesday night. Players looked unimpressed when they tested the bounce of the ball. There was little give from the turf. The Djurgården striker, August Priske, called it a “shitty pitch” in early April.“It’s completely different,” Maresca said. “I know that in the last weeks even some of their players were complaining about the pitch. They play every week, so for us it’s a different one. But there are no excuses, no reasons why we are not going to compete tomorrow and the second game at home.”Chelsea are the richest club in this competition and the level of expenditure on their squad goes beyond anything that Djurgården could hope to afford. However, Maresca looked to stamp out any possibility of complacency before facing opponents lying in 11th place in Sweden.“You don’t win games and titles with money,” the Italian said. “We know that very well. So it’s not about how much you spend. You are not going to win games or titles just because you spend big money. You have to spend money, but in the right way. We are now in the Conference League semi-final, we are fighting in our league and hopefully we can finish better in both competitions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Evanilson’s suspension was removed after a successful claim of wrongful dismissal byBournemouth.Bournemouth’s club-record signing had been set to miss a home game against Aston Villa and a trip to Manchester City as well as the Arsenal game.“An independent regulatory commission has removed Evanilson’s three-match ban following a successful claim of wrongful dismissal,” read a statement from the Football Association. “The AFC Bournemouth forward was sent off during the Premier League fixture againstManchester Unitedon Sunday, 27 April, for serious foul play.”Evanilson, who cost an initial £31.7m from Porto last summer, was originally shown a yellow card by Bankes for his foul on Mazraoui. But, following intervention from Brooks, the punishment was upgraded to red after Bankes watched replays of the incident on a pitch-side monitor.The Bournemouth manager, Andoni Iraola, and captain, Adam Smith, were both booked for protesting, while home supporters vented their displeasure.

Before one of the biggest home games in their team’s history, this quite dismal effort by the Arsenal hierarchy to generate some in-stadium vibes has been widely ridiculed and may have contributed to a curiously quiet atmosphere that was only exacerbatedby Ousmane Dembélé’s early gut punch.Poor for the first 35 minutes and not much better in the final 20, Arsenal played reasonably well in betweenwithout ever scaling the heights they can, their players and fans often railing against perceived injustices visited upon them by a referee whose most controversial decision actually went in the home side’s favour and helped keep them in the tie. While it has been argued there was perhaps notenoughof a foul in that Jurriën Timber stiff-arm block on Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to award a spot-kick to PSG, we’d almost certainly have heard no end of post-match bleating if the roles had been reversed and Arsenal had been denied what they felt to be their dues from 12 yards.The PSG head coach Luis Enrique’s post-match assessment that “it could have been worse, it could have been better” spoke for the performances of both teams and as things stand, Arsenal remain very much alive before next week’s return leg. “We are at half-time,” parped Mikel Arteta afterwards. “We have a lot of chances to be in that final. As I repeat myself, you have to do something special in the competition to have the right to be in the final. And the time to do it is going to be in Paris.” Arsenal’s players and travelling fans can almost expect a far more hostile reception in the bubbling cauldron that is Parc des Princes than was afforded to their visitors in north London and, even if they don’t get a similar lesson in football dished out to several other Premier League teams in Paris this season, they will almost certainly pick up some tips on how best to design a rabble-rousing pre-match tifo.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Scott Murray at 8pm (BST) for updates on Barcelona 2-1 Inter in Bigger Cup, while Simon Burnton will be on hand at 8.15pm, when the WSL title could be sealed by Chelsea in their 2-0 defeat of Manchester United if earlier results go their way.QUOTE OF THE DAY26 April:“I said before that as long as I’m wanted, I’m very happy.

I’m never satisfied. I’m already almost focused on the treble and the FA Cup final.“I want to thank Emma [Hayes]. I’m sure she’s really happy. She left the club in such a great position for me to build on that legacy.”With their victory, Chelsea also set a new record for the longest consecutive unbeaten run of games in a single WSL campaign [20] and they have still not lost any of their domestic fixtures under the management of Bompastor, who arrived last summer to replace Hayes, who had been in charge for 12 years.Bompastor also said she feels her team’s achievements have been underestimated this term, adding: “Yes, I’m listening sometimes, I’ve heard some noise that perhaps it’s ‘too easy’ for Chelsea – that’s not easy, that’s not easy, to beat two times Manchester City, two times Arsenal and two times United [referring to having clinched league doubles over the rest of the sides in the top four].“That’s unbelievable. I don’t think it’s easy, that’s never easy. It’s a lot of work every day. I never let my players breathe. I know, the last few weeks, it was difficult for them. That’s the mentality you need when you want to be one of the best teams.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also hit the bar in the first half and provided a catalogue of extraordinary passes and touches, but departed disappointed having been unable to get the winner, a last-minute lob also coming back off the bar. Nonetheless, he departed having left a lasting impression.“We could even have won this game against a team who have a player who is difficult to stop,” Inzaghi said afterwards. “We started well, but they created a lot of problems: he created a lot of problems. He is a player I had not seen live before. We had to double up on him. We managed it better in the second half and could even have won. Lamine Yamal is a phenomenon born every 50 years. We made some adjustments to improve how we dealt with him after the break, which is not easy. He really impressed me today.”Hansi Flick, the Barcelona head coach, said: “I think he’s special. I said it, often before, he’s a genius. During the game, when I look at the match from the outside, it’s not like when you see after. You see all the details and it is unbelievable how he does it. At 17 years old, he’s an unbelievable player and for me the important thing is he keeps going.“He was so important for us in the first half. He created a lot of things and scored the first goal. You know, I know, everyone knows, and after today, that he is a fantastic player. He does it always in the big games. In the big matches like the semi-final today, he shows how good he is. This is what we want and need from him. He’s always there. He has to enjoy it too. I am really happy that this talent who comes every 50 years plays for Barcelona.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBarcelonaInternazionalenewsShareReuse this content"

O’Sullivan will meet the Chinese sensation Zhao Xintong in what promises to be a mouthwatering clash.Trump reeled off five straight frames after starting the final session of a high-octane contest at 8-8 to complete a 13-8 win over fellow former champion Brecel. In doing so he made two more centuries that took his total number of hundred breaks for the season to 104, equalling then surpassing Neil Robertson’s 11-year-old record as he sealed his semi-final spot in style.Trump insisted: “I don’t really care about that record. I was just happy to make the breaks at the important times, no matter what they were. It was just about digging in and putting him under pressure.”Looking ahead to the semi-finals he said: “Mark came through an absolute epic. It was a great advert for snooker. Mark has been in quite a few classics at the Crucible, and it just shows the hunger and determination of the Class of 92.”View image in fullscreenRonnie O’Sullivan was made to battle before sealing a 13-9 win against Si Jiahui (right).Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAO’Sullivan, the seven-time champion, twice saw his 22-year-old opponent pull back to within two frames, but held his nerve and a break to black of 76 confirmed his 14th appearance in the Crucible’s last four.Si, a shock semi-finalist on his debut two years ago, showed few signs of repeating that form in the early stages and O’Sullivan was barely forced to break sweat as he took the first frame of the second session to ease into a 7-2 lead.O’Sullivan, playing his first tournament since he dumped his cue in a bin after crashing out of the Championship League in January, had impressed in patches in his wins over Ali Carter and Pang Junxu, and Si did not appear to be the man to test his limits.O’Sullivan, Higgins and Williams stand strong as Class of 92 battle onRead moreHowever, after starting the final session four frames adrift at 10-6, Si’s fluency showed signs of returning, and with O’Sullivan’s game becoming increasingly scattered with errors, the underdog won three from four to reach the interval just two behind at 11-9.Si had a big chance to make it 11-10 but missed a yellow and a vintage run of 36 from O’Sullivan took him one frame away from victory.Still playing fluently, Si got in first in the 22nd frame and fashioned a 43-point lead, before a miss on the brown served up a chance which O’Sullivan seized to confirm his clash against rising star Zhao.Williamsheld off a superb fightback from his fellow former winnerJohn Higginsto triumph in a last-frame decider and reach his eighth World Championship semi-final at the Crucible. The veteran duo, who have won seven world titles between them, were locked at 8-8 at the end of their second session before Williams put himself on the verge by taking all four frames on Wednesday’s resumption.But Higgins, four times the ­champion, though, dug in after the mid-session interval with breaks of 94, 114 and 67 to force a decider, which ­Williams took after his ­opponent missed a tense blue on the top ­cushion to seal a 13-12 victory.View image in fullscreenMark Williams came through an epic quarter-final before beating John Higgins 13-12. He now faces Judd Trump.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersWilliams, who had trailed 5-1 ­earlier in the match, made the most of some unforced errors from ­Higgins to edge in front and then extend his lead to 10-8. A couple of half-century breaks from the Welshman, who claimed the last of his three world titles in 2018, meant he was seemingly closing in on victory at 12-8 heading into the interval.However, Higgins clawed a frame back before firing in 94 to move within two. Williams then gave away a careless foul after touching the blue with his trailing arm when he was leaning over to pot a long red with the rest.Higgins made the most of the opportunity, digging in again to build a fine 114 break. The Scot missed a frame-ball red along the bottom cushion after a break of 67 in the next but was still able to force a final-frame shootout.With both men running out of position when looking set, the deciding frame turned into a safety battle before Higgins caught the bump on the ­middle pocket, which allowed ­Williams in to edge in front 56-52.Higgins sunk a red with the rest after Williams missed a tricky long red, then rolled the brown in on the top cushion only to miss the blue. Williams clipped it in before ­finishing off the pink and black to seal a dramatic 74-69 victory.Williams told the BBC: “I was drained this morning. Two tough sessions, I didn’t finish until half 10. It’s top out there, especially the older you get. You play all day, the next day you play in the morning. It’s just a pleasure playing now. We got the standing ovation walking in and everyone was cheering. You have to enjoy it because you don’t know how many times I’ll be coming back here.”Zhaoduly picked up the one frame he required to turn a 12-4 overnight advantage overChris Wakelininto a 13-5 victory that sealed his place in the semi-finals for the first time. Zhao, playing as an amateur after returning from a 20-month ban for his part in amatch-fixing scandal, had to come through four rounds of qualifying to reach the final stages at the Crucible and has had little trouble in reaching the last four, where he will play O’Sullivan.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipJudd TrumpRonnie O'SullivanJohn HigginsSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

Of those, one quarter were referred for specialist treatment. The service is not designed to provide a diagnosis, only to provide a risk assessment for former players.Rugby’s concussion trial moves a step closer to reality after high court progressRead moreThe news comes as Rylands Garth, the law firm representing a group of former ­amateur and professional players, says it has received a “surge of new sign-ups” and that it now represents 725 former rugby union players, as well as 280 former rugby league players. They have a range of neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s, motor neurone disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and dementia.The brain health service was launched by World Rugby last year to provide aftercare and is available free of charge to any retired player who played elite rugby in Ireland, Australia, Wales, South Africa and New Zealand.The sport’s governing body is hoping to launch it in more territories this year, but progress has been slowed in France, Argentina and Japan by the challenges of translating the service into different languages. It is not, however, available in England, where the Rugby Football Union runs a similar programme in partnership with Imperial College London.During a presentation at World Rugby’s annual player welfare symposium, the team behind the brain health service expressed concern about the high number of former players who dropped out, or who failed to attend follow-up appointments with medical providers.They say that a large number of the withdrawals were because the players were so worried about what the tests might show. The team are planning to encourage face-to-face consultations in an effort to try to reduce participants’ levels of anxiety.World Rugby’s annual review of injuries revealed that the ­number of concussions suffered in elite male rugby during 2023-24 was in line with previous years, at 13 per 1,000 playing hours, or just under one every two matches. In elite ­women’s rugby over the same period, the ­figure was 11 per 1,000 playing hours, or one every 2.3 matches, which is an uptick. On average, each concussed player was out of the game for around three weeks.Concussions, though, are only part of the problem. There is increasing effort to address the impact of sub-concussive blows, which are now being monitored by instrumented mouth guards. The latest research carried out in France on the Top 14 showed that the top 10% of international players were experiencing around 2,000 physical contacts a year, and there is an increasing focus on reducing “player load”. World Rugby is launching new guidelines in partnership with the global players’ union, International Rugby Players (IRP), stipulating that all players should have a minimum of 12 weeks without physical contact every year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The workloads of most domestic players fall within those limits, but many international players, and in particular “cross-border” internationals who play their Test rugby in one country and their club rugby in another, are going well beyond them. Argentinian internationals who play their domestic rugby in the English Premiership, for instance, in effect have a 12-month season.The guidelines have been drawn up by a group of players, coaches and sports scientists, who spoke during a panel discussion about the tension between player welfare and the commercial and competitive imperatives of the sport. The former Wales captain Ken Owens explained that international players in particular often find themselves in a situation where a large part of their five-week off-season is used for pre-season training. “You come back off summer tour and you potentially get four or five weeks off, but the reality is you’re almost straight back into your club season,” Owens said.The Bath coach, Johann van Graan, who is also part of the group, said that his club have a mandatory six weeks of rest for all Test players, but that he has had to give more than one international all February off in order to achieve it. Bath have a big enough squad to get away with it, but not every club has that luxury. “As coaches, we’re not judged on what we say on panels, or how we are as people,” Van Graan said, “we’re judged on whether we win or not.”Explore more on these topicsRugby unionWorld RugbyConcussion in sportRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Draper had not previously won three consecutive clay-court matches at ATP level. He will next face Matteo Arnaldi,conqueror of Novak Djokovicin round two, for a place in the semi-finals. Arnaldi defeated the 16th seed, Frances Tiafoe, 6-3, 7-5.Jacob Fearnley bows out of Madrid Open as tennis resumes after power outageRead more“The more matches I play at this level will keep helping my confidence on this surface,” said Draper. “Obviously a win today, in that kind of way, against someone who is ranked 12 in the world is a big thing for me. I’m just happy with the way I’m approaching the matches and my training and everything, and yeah, I’m looking forward to keep on continuing, hopefully trying to get better and better on this surface and just in general.”Although Draper is the highest-ranked player left in the draw, he is still finding his feet on clay and learning how to fully unlock his game on the surface. He arrived in Madrid with a 10-12 record on clay after a difficult experience last year, where he frequently competed well against top opposition yet finished 2-6 against the top 100.“Professionally with the ATP I haven’t played loads on it, but when I was younger, whether it was in the UK or abroad, playing European events, I always did well on the clay,” he said. “I always thought I was a player who could play well on all surfaces.”“I guess it’s a bit different at this level. Last year I took a few tough losses against top players when I was unseeded. Then this year, it’s just been about trying to stay fit, but also trying to show that I feel good on this surface. In training I felt great, and I just want to keep going, and I think this surface could be amazing for my tennis.”View image in fullscreenJack Draper stretches for a return during his impressive win over Tommy Paul.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APThis week in Madrid had already seen positive progress. Draper set the tone with an excellent performance against a quality opponent, completely overwhelming Tallon Griekspoor with his relentless aggression. He also looked solid in his third round match against an ailing Matteo Berrettini, who retired with an abdominal injury after losing the first set 7-6 (2).As Draper and Paul stepped out on to Manolo Santana Stadium in cool, windy conditions, it was Paul who started cold, struggling badly to control his forehand, which sprayed four unforced errors as he conceded an early break. Although Draper was hardly at his best early on – his first serve percentage stood at 33% as he served for the first set at 5-2 – his movement and defence were excellent, narrowing the court against Paul, and as he suffocated the American with the weight and depth of his wicked topspin forehand, which spun up to the height of Paul’s shoulder and constantly pinned him behind the baseline.With the first set secured, Draper relaxed, found greater rhythm on his serve and dominated the baseline with his nuclear forehand as he closed out an excellent victory.In the women’s draw the fourth seed, Coco Gauff, set up a rematch of the 2022 French Open final against Iga Swiatek after defeating Mirra Andreeva, the seventh seed, 7-5, 6-1. Swiatek, the No 2 seed and defending champion, avenged herAustralian Open semi-final defeatagainst the eventual champion, Madison Keys, recovering to win 0-6, 6-3, 6-2.Novak Djokovic has reacted to his run of poor form by pulling out of the Italian Open in Rome next week. The 24-times grand slam champion is on a three-match losing streak, havingcrashed out of the Madrid Openagainst Arnaldi.Tournament organisers announced on social media that Djokovic would not be playing in the Italian capital, with the Serb writing on Instagram: “Rome, I will miss you. I hope we meet next year.”View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic said he had to adapt to a ‘new reality’ after the 37-year-old’s defeat by Matteo Arnaldi in Madrid.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APAfter defeat by Arnaldi, the 37-year-old Djokovic said he had to adapt to a “new reality”, adding: “Trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament – it’s a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis.”The Italian Open, which begins on 7 May, is the last big ATP Tour event before theFrench Open, and is a tournament Djokovic has won six times. But he faces arriving at Roland Garros without having won a match on clay since his emotional victory over Carlos Alcaraz last summer in the Olympic final.Djokovic has played a fuller schedule than last season, when his bid for a record-breaking 25th slam title fell short, but it hasnot helped him find any consistent form, with the world No 5 losing his opening match in four of his past five tournaments.“Grand slams is where I really want to play the best tennis,” he said. “I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do that in Roland Garros but I’ll do my best. I’m not going into Roland Garros as one of the main favourites. Maybe that can help, I don’t know, we’ll see.”Explore more on these topicsJack DraperNovak DjokovicTennisFrench Open 2025French OpennewsShareReuse this content"

Actually, it was like that.“Certain newspapers just won’t exist in the UK. Which newspapers will still have a print edition in 10 years’ time? Look at what young people do. I don’t see anyone under 45 buying a print newspaper. So there’s a ticking clock. If people don’t listen to that ticking clock beating loudly in their ears, they’re going to get a very nasty surprise. This is the wake-up moment.”Morgan now owns the rights to his YouTube channel, Piers Morgan Uncensored, which hesecured from Rupert Murdoch’s empireafter the expiry of a News UK deal that paid him a reported £50m over three years. After just turning 60, he admits the transition has been a “learning curve”, but he is now an evangelist for YouTube and its combination of flexibility and low costs.He said his decision to go “full fledged” into the streaming service was driven by his four children. “All of them watch YouTube,” he said. “None of them watch actual television, other than for live sport. Until a year ago, I was trudging into an old-fashioned, structured, 8pm live news show, when in fact there was no need to do that. It was a very expensive way of disseminating something I can do to a global audience, a lot cheaper – but also much faster and much longer.”While Morgan is a figure who divides opinion, his move into YouTube is part of a wider trend that has seen media figures – particularly on the US political right –forge channels with millions of subscribers. Morgan is aiming to replicate the success of The Daily Wire, a US conservative media company co-founded by the rightwing political commentator Ben Shapiro. Its roster includes the Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson.YouTube is becominghugely influential right across the media, with broadcasters such as ITV and Channel 4 now placing some content on it. Podcasters also increasingly stream their shows there. It has led to significant financial muscle. In the first three months of 2025 alone, YouTube’s advertising revenue was $8.9bn (£6.64bn), an increase on the previous year of more than 10%. Meanwhile, revenue at Channel 4 for the whole of 2023 was about £1bn, the latest year available.Morgan pointed to the US election last year. YouTube said more than 45 million people in the US watched election-related content on polling day. Meanwhile, an average of 42.3 million viewers watched across 18 cable and broadcast networks that evening. While the figures are not directly comparable, Morgan said: “If that doesn’t tell you where the eyeballs are going, I don’t know what will.”He said some “big, big names” in journalism have been in touch to ask if they could make the switch. “I also think that legacy media companies have to look at people like me and others and think, why are they going off on their own and into this world,” he said. “A lot more people will do what I’m doing. I’m getting a lot of very interesting calls from journalists.”Morgan is now drawing up plans to attempt something similar to Gary Lineker’s Goalhanger Productions, which has created a series of successful podcasts in the UK. Morgan wants to create channels under the Uncensored brand covering genres like true crime, history and sport. However, he is aiming squarely and unapologetically at the US and a global audience, not Britain – whose audience he describes as “pretty well irrelevant” to his plans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s the history one. Those guys go over to America and do big live shows, and it’s huge over there.“I hardly ever cover UK news. We didn’t even touch the last election, because my whole prism is through the lens of: ‘Will an American want to watch this? Will somebody in the Middle East want to watch this? Will someone in Australia want to watch this?.’”Morgan said his expansion plans were in part to lower the reliance on him personally and build something that could stand on its own – a much harder task than building a following around an established figure. He said it was “early days”, but was being bullish with potential investors as the business was already profitable.“I don’t need the money,” he said. “We’ve got nearly 4 million subscribers … My question to investors is not so much, ‘Give me your money.’ It’s ‘Why should I take your money and what are you going to bring to the party?’”Explore more on these topicsPiers MorganYouTubeSocial mediaNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesDigital mediaTelevision industryShareReuse this content"

Shares jumped in after-hours trading.“We’ve had a strong start to an important year, our community continues to grow and our business is performing very well,” said Meta’s chief executive,Mark Zuckerberg. “We’re making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1bn monthly actives.”Speaking on the investor call, Zuckerberg said the company was performing well and its platforms were growing, making it “well-positioned to navigate” any macroeconomic uncertainty.“I continue to think this year is going to be a pivotal moment in our industry,” he said.This continues Meta’s streak of beating Wall Streetexpectationsover the past few quarters. However, it is unclear if it will be enough to quell investor concerns. Analysts were disappointed by the first quarter revenue outlook Zuckerberg shared at the end of 2024. The company has also updated its outlook on spending for the next year with plans to spend anywhere from $64-72bn in capital expenditures including the cost of building out AI infrastructure. That is up from $65bn the company originally said it was expecting to spend in 2025. Total costs and expenditures for the first quarter were already at $24.76bn, a 9% increase compared to the year prior. Uncertainty over Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs may yet roil ad markets, clouding the company’s financial outlook for near future quarters.EMarketersenior analyst Minda Smiley said the company’s “optimistic Q2 guidance signals that the company isn’t expecting any major dips in ad revenue” as a result of the tariffs. But that they don’t expect Meta will be spared from the downturn in the long term.“On the one hand, the company stands to gain from economic instability. Advertisers will allocate more ad dollars to proven, sophisticated networks like Facebook and Instagram – all while pulling back spend on smaller social platforms – while they navigate uncertainty,” Smiley said. “On the other hand, a small but significant portion of Meta’s revenue comes from Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein advertising to US shoppers. That spend is starting to dry up as a result of trade and tariff change.”Meta’s spending also continues to “weigh heavily on investors”, according to analyst Debra Aho Williamson, the founder and chief analyst of Sonata Insights. “But Meta will resist directly monetizing AI this year, focusing instead on building AI usage among its app users, advertisers and developers using Llama,” said Williamson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But aWSJ reportexposed the existing chatbots integrated into the company’s various products, including Facebook and Instagram, were given the ability to perform “romantic role play” even with the platforms’ teen users. Executives at the company, which repeatedly has touted its nearly 1 billion users of its AI chatbots, alsoadmitthat many of those users access the chatbot through its hard-to-avoid takeover of the search bars of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. The company has not detailed how many interactions with the chatbot or how deep those interactions need to be to consider a person a user of the AI chatbot.Paired with Meta’songoing antitrust trial– where the company faces claims that it built an illegal social media monopoly with its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp – the uncertain AI future adds to the concerns some analysts may have around Meta’s financials despite what it may look like on paper.“Meta’s earnings call comes at a precarious time where the company’s future is literally beingdebated in court– the results of which could fundamentally alter the social media landscape,” said Forrester VP’s research director,Mike Proulx. “Meta is smart to direct more resources into improving Threads and Facebook since those could be the only two apps the company is left with. It’s also notable that Meta just laid off a number of employees in its Reality Labs division, which has been a continued and growing leaky bucket for Meta.”Explore more on these topicsMetaQuarterly resultsnewsShareReuse this content"

The result exceeded analyst predictions that revenue would grow to $68.42bn, or 10.6% year-over-year, and that earnings-per-share would come in at $3.22.Shares in the tech giant jumped more than 5% in after-hours trading.Microsoft says everyone will be a boss in the future – of AI employeesRead moreAnalysts viewed the earnings report as a temperature check on Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) business, which has announced it will invest around $80bn in this fiscal year alone, though it has alsoterminated some data center leases in recent months. The company has invested billions in OpenAI in recent years, giving it a large stake in the ChatGPT developer.“Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth,” Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement.All in on AIMicrosoft’s heavy bets on AI, which extend to deals with companies beyondOpenAI, has led to Microsoft and its investors being reliant on the technology’s success and widespread adoption. Microsoft has, meanwhile, framed its investments in AI as putting it at the forefront of a world-changing technology it claims is crucial to the future of American industry.“Not since the invention of electricity has the United States had the opportunity it has today to harness new technology to invigorate the nation’s economy,” president Brad Smith claimed in aJanuary blogpost. “In many ways, artificial intelligence is the electricity of our age.”Microsoft executives have also been heavily touting an AI-driven future in recent appearances. Satya Nadellaclaimed earlier this weekthat 20% to 30% of the company’s code was written by AI, although did not give specifics on how that number was calculated. Chief technology officer Kevin Scott, meanwhile,predicted on a podcastthis month that 95% of code would be AI-generated within the next five years.Last quarter, Microsoft reported a 12% increase in revenue and touted growth in its AI business – which it reported saw an increase of 175% year over year.Investors have also been keeping an eye on how Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service is performing after afall in revenuelast quarter. The company has been seeking to expand Azure throughout Europe, with Smith also promising Microsoftwill expand its European data centersby 40% over the next two years.Revenue for Azure in particular exceeded analyst expectations, growing 33% year over year. Nadella touted the performance of the company’s cloud services during the earnings call, stating that Microsoft was growing the market and building data centers to meet demand.“When it comes to cloud migrations, we saw accelerating demand with customers in every industry, from Abercrombie & Fitch to Coca-Cola,” Nadella said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tesla, the world’s most valuable automaker, also released its worse-than-expected earnings last week, which revealed the company had suffered a 71% loss in profits compared with the previous year amid a backlash against Elon Musk.While other tech giants such as Apple and Amazon are exposed to heavy financial risks related to the Trump administration’s erratic tariff policies, Microsoft has been relatively insulated, given that its products and services are less dependent on trade.Shares in Microsoft have fallen around 7% overall since January, a downturn in part caused by wider economic instability as well as China-based developers closing the gap in AI.

Mobile signal was disrupted, traffic lights stopped working, supermarkets went dark and resorted to cash as digital payment systems stalled, and people were stranded far from their homes as the blackout stretched on for much of the day.EU residents were urged last month tostockpile 72 hours’ worth of essentials, but the blackouts seem to have revealed the vulnerability of many people to widespread disruption.After the outages, with service returning to normal levels, the Guardian spoke to people who got in touch as they reflected on what lessons to learn from the incident in terms of preparedness and resilience.For Iñigo, even though the hospital outages felt like “a complete disaster” at the time, looking back, he’s thankful no one was physically harmed. “The best thing we can do [in future] is have more backup generators and fuel to keep things running as smoothly as possible,” he said.View image in fullscreenBeibei from Barcelona.Photograph: Beibei/Guardian CommunityIn Barcelona, Beibei, 41, at first found the outages “quite exciting”. It was only when her neighbour knocked on her door with her four-month-old baby and said: “You know it’s Europe-wide,” that she started to worry. “I saw my own fear in her face,” she said.She wanted to pick up her six-year-old son from school, but needed to buy food first. “In nearly total darkness the shopkeepers were turning cashless customers away,” said Beibei, who works as a climate campaigner and has lived in Spain since the Covid pandemic. She picked up some essentials, but seeing other customers with trolleys full of food, she began to worry she didn’t have enough.Beibei went out a second time with her neighbour. Their nearest supermarket had stopped letting in new customers. Another supermarket Beibei tried was on its last energy reserve: “As the cashier was taking items from my basket, I realised I didn’t have enough cash. Just then the last bit of power went completely, and she said: ‘Now you cannot take anything’.”After collecting her son and reuniting with her family, Beibei said she will no longer take things for granted. “I’ve already taken out cash so I’m prepared for next time,” she added.“It’s reset my perception of what matters in life. Every bit of food, the presence of people around us, the ease of cooking and washing with appliances, are all miracles that I’ll never overlook again.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She went home and filled up on water in case the pumps stopped carrying it to her third-floor apartment. She listened for updates on a wind-up radio she’d bought last month, after the EU urged people to make emergency precautions.View image in fullscreenCatarina, in Porto, listened for news updates on a wind-up radio she bought last month, and stored water in case the pump stopped working.Photograph: Catarina/Guardian Community“No one knew what to do, where to go, how long it would take,” she said.“On the other hand, there’s a lot of discourse on how humanity is lost because of technology, but if yesterday shows us anything, it’s that it isn’t. When necessary, people stick together, go outside and act like a community again.”With power still down at 5pm on Monday, Catarina went for a walk with her boyfriend – and what she saw made her feel hopeful. She saw cars stopping for pedestrians without traffic lights, large but orderly lines for buses, gardens full of people reading, playing sports, making BBQs with family, friends and neighbours, residents talking to passersby from their doorways.“It was amazing,” she said. “Despite everything that went wrong, it gave me a lot of hope in humanity to see how quickly people got together and helped each other.”Explore more on these topicsSpainPortugalEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

From PC classicSystem Shockto the DickensianDishonored 2, these system-heavy sandboxes are video gaming’s equivalent to avant garde electronica or the films of Darren Aronofsky, adored by critics and genreheads but largely baffling to everyone else. Much like those elitist fandoms, the im-sim’s loudest cheerleaders often look down on linear blockbusters with similar sneer. No, Assassin’s Creed player, you cannot sit with us.While massive games such as Tears of the Kingdom have recently flirted with elements of the genre, there’s still a surprising lack of breezier, beginner-friendly immersive sims. EnterBlendo Games’ Skin Deep– an attempt to cosy-fi the genre. Doing away with the sour-faced sci-fi of Deus Ex, Skin Deep sends you hurtling into space with a premise ripped straight out of a noughties web comic. You play Nina Pasadena, an insurance commando sworn to rescue feline fleets from raiding pirates. As you answer each well-insured tabby’s urgent distress call, Nina quietly sneaks across the raided ship, using whatever tools she can cobble together to rescue her kitty clientele.View image in fullscreenStalk your prey with whatever comes to hand: a book and a lighter? … Skin Deep.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveThe story is incredibly silly – more on that later – but Skin Deep’s cacophony of colliding systems deserves to be taken seriously. As I stalk my prey with a book and a lighter, I quietly release a cloud of hand sanitiser before bashing his head in with a hefty novel. Before he can draw his gun, I leap backwards, chucking my flickering lighter into the cloud of sanitiser, engulfing the poor pirate in an explosion of glistening flames. It’s this gleefully slapstick approach that sees Skin Deep at its best – a playground that embraces the absurdity of its simulation with a Cheshire’s grin.It’s not all design by worship and tribute, however, with Blendo introducing some fun gameplay twists of its own. Pirates can respawn after being taken out, detachable floating “skull savers” attached to their heads hovering desperately back to their lifeless bodies. Nina must swiftly dispose of each screaming head before they can seek revenge. From shattering ship windows and sending a skull hurtling into outer space, to flushing screaming heads down a toilet, finding new ways to bin each bonce adds a welcome layer of variety. The duplicating “duper gun” is another fun innovation, allowing players to sneak up to unsuspecting guards and instantly copy whatever items they hold – from weapons to those crucial cat-freeing keys.View image in fullscreenA cartoony playground … Skin Deep.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveEach fully mapped ship exterior also allows you to leap out of the airlock and scale the outside of the ship, surveying the vessel for sneaky new entry points. In one mission, I come crashing through the ship’s external window. As I land on the bridge feet first, I pull a bloodied glass shard from my foot and fling it straight into a pirate’s face, leaving me grinning like a cat-loving John McClane.BlendoGamesunderstands that the best immersive sims are inherently cartoony playgrounds, sandboxes where every item is a tool for maleficence. From chucking pepper at a guard and making them sneeze so hard they pass out, to riding a pirate’s back and charging them straight into a wall, you certainly couldn’t accuse Skin Deep of taking itself too seriously.Unfortunately, I started to wish that the writers took it all more seriously. As freed cuboid cats leap from their rectangular cages with a sparkle and an enthusiastic MEOWW, and I reply to paw-penned emails asking me to find quirky VHS tapes, it dawns on me that I’m playing Deus Ex for Disney adults. While Skin Deep’s gags may well be catnip for the right player, the never-ending feline puns and overly-zany tone had me cringing, eliciting more grimaces than guffaws.If the cat-filled concept wasn’t millennially coded enough, Skin Deep is made using Doom 3’s 2004 id tech engine. Swapping thePCclassic’s dimly-lit corridors for brightly coloured environments, it’s a knowingly nerdy-nod to the hardcore. While a cool idea on paper, in practice the archaic aesthetic falls short of the intended retro cool chic, instead looking disappointingly primitive.Still, if beauty is only Skin Deep, for £15, this is a colourful, breezy introduction to an infamously inaccessible genre. The end result is an enjoyable, if muddled game, a deceptively deep immersive sim that may be too silly for genre fans and too low-poly to entice newcomers. This isn’t the genre’s breakout hit then – a slapstick immersive sim using Doom 3’s engine was likely always destined to be niche – but if you can stomach Skin Deep’s saccharine silliness, there’s 10 hours of futuristic feline fun batting its paw in your direction.Skin Deep is out now, £15Explore more on these topicsGamesPCSimulation gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

People often say something like, “Oh, I don’t really play games,” which is surely an odd thing to tell a game designer moments after you’ve been introduced; I don’t really eat croissants, but that’s not the first thing I bring up if I meet a patissier.So one of the joys of publishing my first novel last year was the option to sidestep all of that, and say: “Oh, I’m a writer.” I wrote a novel; I’m working on another one; job done, the conversation can move on. Nobody says, “Oh, I don’t really read books,” even though that’s at least as likely to be true.It’s become clear to me that I’m not alone in switching between the two media. Why is this?Well, for a lot of people, it’s the money. Writing novels is a notoriously difficult way to make a living, and novelists have always wrangled together careers out of whatever’s going.A 2022 reportcommissioned by the Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society (ALCS), found that professional authors are paid a median of £7,000 a year from their writing. Mallory Marlowe is a romance writer – her debut Love and Other Conspiracies made the USA Bestseller list last year – and her day job writing for video games is part of what makes that possible. “Thankfully, I have a consistent paycheck coming in,” she says, “which is an advantage because the payment structures in publishing aren’t exactly sustainable.”At the same time, game writers are also having a rough time of it – GDC’s 2025 State of theGamesIndustry report claimed that one in five narrative designers and writers had been laid off in the previous year. So of course some game writers are looking for opportunities elsewhere.View image in fullscreenScots sci-fi … Raik.Photograph: Harry Josephine GilesSometimes, writers even find the forms feed into each other, with a direct relationship between the two. Harry Josephine Giles’ game Raik, written in Scots and English, feels like a precursor to her book Deep Wheel Orcadia, a verse novel written in the Orkney dialect thatwon the 2022 Arthur C Clarke award. And Jon Ingold, co-founder of narrative game studio Inkle (80 Days, Expelled!), released two novels set in the world of the studio’s game Heaven’s Vault, with a third to come in May. Inkle published the books themselves; for Ingold, writing them was a way to spend more time in the world of the game, although, he says, “the plot in the novel was harder to construct. In a book, the protagonist needs focused motivation, all the time, or they stop doing things. But in a game, a player will investigate simply because the world exists”.When I ask all the novelist-game writers I know what the biggest difference between the forms is for them, I’m surprised by how different the answers are. For some, it’s a matter of process – novels can act as a release from the compromises of collaboration, while games can provide a break from sitting in a room on your own. Joe Dunthorne (Submarine, The Adulterants) has written novels, poetry and most recently a memoir (Children of Radium), and a few years ago he did a huge amount of work on a big-budget video game that got cancelled without ever being publicly announced. Even though the game didn’t work out, he says that, “after the loneliness and madness of novel-writing, I was relieved to go to an office every day. I loved working with games designers, in particular. I was in awe of their ability to think through these dizzyingly complex structures.”View image in fullscreenPost-apocalypse mystery … Saltsea Chronicles.Photograph: Die Gute FabrikSharna Jackson has written children’s novels including High-Rise Mystery and The Nine Night Mystery. She also worked on Die Gute Fabrik’s post-apocalypse mystery game Saltsea Chronicles and an audio experience for Yoto. For her, the key difference is that with most games, you’ll write “many, many words that may never be read or heard – it all depends on the pathways your players take through the experience”. Some of your best work may end up in the “rare outcomes and Easter eggs” that only a few players will encounter. Mallory Marlowe, meanwhile, talks about how novels offer, “a strange amount of independence” to writers used to working in games, while novelists might take a while to get used to creating game stories that work for players with wildly varying degrees of investment in the writing. “Some people just want to press buttons and cause trouble,” she says. “Others are going to engage with everything on a story level”.Sooner or later, almost everyone I talk to brings up the radically different cultural status of games and books – their equivalent of my complaint about people at parties. Jim Munroe (We Are Raccoons, Unmanned) has been writing games and books for more than 25 years, and he talks about how books are culturally valued in a way games aren’t. “Creators are in games in spite of the low status of games,” he says. Naomi Alderman, author of Disobedience and The Future, echoes some of this experience. There was a week in which both her novel The Power and her game Zombies, Run! (co-created with Six to Start) won awards. The award for her book made the papers, even the front page of the Times of India, while the Zombies, Run! award barely made the specialist games press.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Munroe says that it means games tend to draw creators with a more independent streak. Marlowe enjoys the way that people are intrigued and confused by the idea of game writing, and relishes the follow-up conversations. And for Harry Josephine Giles, the position that games occupy is part of what makes them joyful. She points out that games are still young compared with the novel, their conventions less fixed. Early English novelists like Aphra Behn and Laurence Sterne could mess around more, print a page entirely black, push at the still-forming edges of what a novel was. Nowadays only the most experimental novels have that freedom, “ossified” by their place in culture. Games – newer and with a lower cultural status – remain malleable. Plus, as Dunthorne says, “writing often comes pretty far down the list of priorities in game design – and that’s OK. Games are not novels.”Clearly, the emerging generation of young writers grew up as native video game players, so they’re willing and able to switch between the two cultural forms without finding it weird, and without seeing one as necessarily “better” than the other. And sure, if you work in games, there are still people at parties who will say: ”Oh, I don’t really play those.” But sometimes that might mean you get to make something weirder and more surprising, while nobody’s looking.Holly Gramazio’s novel The Husbands isavailable now in paperback.Explore more on these topicsGamesFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Civil and human rights are being trampled upon. The economy is in disarray.At this rate, we will not make it through the second 100 days.Federal judges in more than 120 cases so far have sought to stop Trump – judges appointed by Republicans as well as Democrats, some appointed by Trump himself – but the regime is either ignoring or appealing their orders. It has evenarrested a municipal judge in Milwaukeeamid a case involving an undocumented defendant.Recently, Judge J Harvie Wilkinson III of the court of appeals for the fourth circuit – an eminent conservative Reagan appointee who is revered by the Federalist Society – issued a scathing rebuke to the Trump regime. In response to its assertion that it can abduct residents of the US and put them into foreign prisons without due process, Wilkinson wrote:If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home? And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies? The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present, and the Executive’s obligation to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed’ would lose its meaning.Wilkinson’s fears are already being realized. Ice recently deported three US citizens – aged two, four and seven – when their mothers were deported to Honduras. One of the children, who has stage 4 cancer, was sent out of the US without medication or consultation with doctors.Meanwhile, the regime continues to attack all the independent institutions in this country that have traditionally served as buffers against tyranny – universities, non-profits, lawyers and law firms, the media, science and researchers, libraries and museums, the civil service and independent agencies – threatening them with extermination or loss of funding if they do not submit to its oversight and demands.Trump has even instructed the Department of Justice toinvestigate ActBlue, the platform that handles the fundraising for almost all Democratic candidates and the issues Democrats support.We are no longer Democrats or Republicans. We are either patriots fighting the regime or we are complicit in its tyranny. There is no middle groundMeanwhile, Trump is actively destroying the economy. His proposed tariffs are already raising prices. His attacks on the Fed chief, Jerome Powell, are causing tremors around the world.Trump wants total power, even at the cost of our democracy and economy.His polls are plummeting yet many Americans are still in denial. “He’s getting things done!” some say. “He’s tough and strong!”Every American with any shred of authority must loudly and boldly explain the danger we are in.A few Democratic members and progressives in Congress (Bernie Sanders, AOC, Cory Booker, Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy) have expressed outrage, but most seem oddly quiet. Granted, they have no direct power to stop what is occurring but they cannot and must not appear to acquiesce. They need to be heard, every day – protesting, demanding, resisting, refusing.Barack Obama has spoken up at least once, to his credit, but where is my old boss, Bill Clinton? Where is George W Bush? Where are their former vice-presidents – Al Gore and Dick Cheney? Where are their former cabinet members? They all must be heard, too.What about Republican members of Congress? Arenonewilling to stand up against what is occurring? And what of Republican governors and state legislators? If there were ever a time for courage and integrity, it is now. Their silence is inexcusable.Over 400 university presidents have finally issued a letter opposing “the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education”. Good. Now they must speak out against the overreach endangering all of American democracy.Hundreds of law firms have joined a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the law firm Perkins Coie’s appeal of the regime’s demands. Fine. Now, they along with the American Bar Association and every major law school must sound the alarm about Trump’s vindictive and abusive use of the justice department.America’s religious leaders have a moral obligation to speak out. They have a spiritual duty to their congregations and to themselves to make their voices heard.The leaders of American business – starting withJamie Dimon, the chair and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who in normal times has assumed the role of spokesperson for American business – have been conspicuously silent. Of course they fear Trump’s retribution. Of course they hope for a huge tax cut. But these hardly excuse their seeming assent to the destruction of American democracy.We have witnessed what can happen in just the first 100 days. I’m not at all sure we can wait until the 2026 midterm elections and hope thatDemocratstake back at least one chamber of Congress. At the rate this regime is wreaking havoc, too much damage will have been done by then.The nation is tottering on the edge of dictatorship.We are no longer Democrats orRepublicans. We are either patriots fighting the regime or we are complicit in its tyranny. There is no middle ground.Soon, I fear, the regime will openly defy the supreme court. Americans must be mobilized into such a huge wave of anger and disgust that members of the House are compelled to impeach Trump (for the third time) and enough senators are moved to finally convict him.Then this shameful chapter of American history will end.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

The answer is that the country’s rightwing leader,Javier Milei, is Donald Trump’s “favourite president”. Amid unease over handing a third of the IMF’s global lending to its largest debtor, the deal passed with $12bn upfront. The IMF has long been intellectually compromised – promoting stability while enforcing neoliberal orthodoxy. Under Mr Trump, it is ethically compromised too.Mr Milei’s bailout marks the second Trump-era rescue for Argentina. In 2018, the fund handed Buenos Aires a record $57bn – but cut it off when its then president, Mauricio Macri,a Trump family friend, was not re-elected. That deal now looks nakedly political. With the US holding an effective board veto, the fund’s independence was always fragile. It’s now completely subordinated. A US takeover of the IMFthreatensdeeper instability than any Argentinian default.Mr Milei shouldn’t have got the loan on these terms. Apart from Argentina’s atrocious record of repayment, its president is operating by emergencydecree, without congressional backing. Since winning power last year, Mr Milei has usedauthoritariantactics – suppressing protest rights and attacking press freedoms – to imposeshock therapy. The plan has been to engineer austerity, spike inflation and deepen poverty, then claim victory when falling prices lowerpoverty metrics.The hard part starts now. Argentina is a classic “stop-go” commodity exporter. It builds up dollars by exporting its produce during a short harvest season, before exports slow naturally or due to a climate event. Argentina burns through dollars importing machinery and medicines. The trouble starts when those dollars are used to prop up the currency, until they run out. Can’t defend the peso? Then the options are to crash it or freeze capital outflows. The IMFdealclearly suggests the former, leading to spiking inflation, stalling growth and eroding wages.Against this backdrop, Mr Milei’s strategy of export-led recovery and spending cuts appears dangerously optimistic. He risks causing private domestic demand to collapse, unless Argentina can attract foreign money. Homegrown private investment will probably prefer dollar assets over industrial expansion. This is unsustainable, as Mr Milei is already facing massiveprotests. The October congressionalmidtermscould become a referendum on his “chainsaw” economics. If cuts trigger recession or inflation returns, his approval will plummet. Mr Milei could stabilise Argentina more effectively by taxing dollar export windfalls and saving the greenbacks in a sovereign wealth fund. This worked in neighbouringChile. Better still: follow South Korea’smodelof subsidies and currencydepreciation, using its US alliance to reinvest export earnings in state-led industry.What’s economically rational is politically toxic to Mr Milei’s libertarian creed.Austerityisn’t buying time for industrialisation. It’s locking Argentina into a capital-friendly, resource-exporting model aligned with US interests. That suits the agro-export bloc thatsupportsMr Milei. Long asick manof South America, Argentina remains trapped in low-value commodity exports instead of building high-value industry. Mr Milei sees the real cure – state-led green development – as worse than the disease. In chasing ideological purity and Trumpian favour, he deepens Argentina’s chronic instability and drags the IMF’s global credibility down with him.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But Carney’s win isn’t as comforting as it should be, especially when we look at all the events leading up to it.It’s no secret that over the last decade, Canada’s image as a welcoming, pacifist, melting pot has completely unravelled, revealing a rightwing underbelly that has seen the rise of the “manosphere” and adeepening ofits influences on young people, as well as a sharp increase inanti-immigrant sentimentand hate crimes. When it came down to this election, it was Trudeau’s forced resignation and people’s ability to credibly accuse the Liberal party of spending a decade basically twiddling their thumbs while the cost of living soared, that pushed Canadians to the right and helped the Conservative party coast to a near win.Trump’s chaotic threats won Mark Carney the Canadian election – but only just | Colin HorganRead moreThenDonald Trumpwon a second term in the US and in effect killed the Conservative party’s momentum here.

A Trump presidency now meant that this election was about who was going to protect us from the madman south of our border – and in that regard, Liberals had Conservatives completely beat.Pierre Poilievre wasendorsedbyElon Musk, publiclysupportedthe 2022 Ottawa “freedom convoy” protests, has never openly condemned the Maga movement, and repeatedly parroted Trump talking points such as ending “woke ideology” (whatever that means), and promising to come down hard on academic institutions whose positions he disagrees with. Carney, on the other hand, has been vocally anti-Trump, and hasbeen clearon the fact that “the possibility that Canada could be part of the US is not on the table and never will be”.So if we understand Poilievre as the Trump-like figure he fashioned himself to be (although he’s reallymore of a Ron DeSantisat this point, as Drew Nelles noted), you can see why it’s so troubling that he came so close to winning, and why it will be hard to wash out the stench of his campaign or forget what it revealed about who Canadians are as a people right now.Poilievreembracedbaseless conspiracy theories about global elite cabals,attackedthe media, has been conspicuouslynon-committalon the climate crisis, has repeatedlyopposedvaccine mandates and praised the “manosphere”, all while indulging the very real fears and anxieties of Canada’s working class and using them as validation for his nonsense ideas. If he had any charisma, the shameless demagoguery might actually be noteworthy. Meanwhile, this is a candidate who before mid-January, was projected as the obvious winner of this election. We simply cannot un-ring that bell.So when I say that Carney may have won, but Canada’s federal elections should make us all worried, that is no exaggeration. And even though he has developed a reputation as the guy you want around when there’s a crisis (Carney was the Bank of Canada’s governor from 2008 to 2013 and was praised for helping getCanadathrough the 2008 financial crisis, and became governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, where he was again pivotal in managing the economic fallout from Brexit), he still has the provincial governments to contend with on major issues such as healthcare and housing, as well as a volatile White House managing the affairs of our southern neighbours.The Guardian view on Canada’s Liberal election: Carney’s triumph is a rebuff to Trump | EditorialRead moreCarney said definitively last month that theold relationshipCanada had with the United Statesis over, and that Canada would “need to dramatically reduce our reliance on the United States” and “pivot our trade relationships elsewhere”, doing “things previously thought impossible at speeds we haven’t seen in generations”.And while it’s left to be seen how he will handletroublesomeconservative provincial leaders and the multiple socialissues left unaddressedin an abrupt campaign (the rights and wellbeing of Indigenous people and public funding, for one), it is clear that he has much to grapple with internally in the coming months, as he simultaneously navigates a radically new relationship with a country that was once one of our closest allies.It may have been a stupid idea, but in all the ways that matter, Canada really has shown itself to be America’s 51st state – a slightly more polite extension of the same destructive far right we’ve seen growing throughout the west.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionAmericasMark CarneycommentShareReuse this content"

We don’t yet know what will be erected in its placeWed 30 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 13.23 EDTShareIt’s possible that later, when we know more about how the Trump regime reshapes the US and about how it ultimately comes to an end, we will look back at this moment in 2025 and conclude that we were already living under an autocracy. Checks on executive power seem to have all but vanished; theTrump administrationis not acting like either the courts, the judiciary or the people have any prerogatives that they must respect.Science is suffering: massive cuts to federal funding of research intomedicine,climate changeor anything that might include a word on a long list of banned ones – like “transition” – has decimated research, made the US a global laughingstock, and set the cause of human thriving back by years. The economy is in chaos, and thebriberyis all but out in the open; it no longer seems to occur to many Americans that their politicians should not be on the take.Immigrantsappear to have lost the entitlement to due process, and the administration appears to be trying to deport as many of them as possible, paying smaller countries in the American sphere of influence to imprison them atforced labor campsfrom which they have no means of petitioning for their own release. Dissidents are beingcaptured on the streets,kidnapped from their homesandarrested in the courtrooms they preside overas punishment for their speech. In light of all this, even without the benefit of hindsight, it is already becoming more difficult to speak of American “democracy” with a straight face.Which is not to say that the developments of the past few months are unprecedented. In many ways, the first 100 days of Trump’s restoration are much like the first 100 of his initial term, in 2017: they are marked by a dizzying whirlwind ofscandals, so numerous and preposterous as to be difficult to keep up with; by a cartoonish incompetence; and by public displays of aggression, cruelty, malice and dominance – be it over thefederal workforce,his political rivals,foreign leaders,major institutionsor theAmerican peoplethemselves.But the second Trump term has also been more reckless, more focused and more frictionless in its work to consolidate power and cut off its political opposition. Long gone are the first-term administration staff members who sought to have some sort of moderating influence on Trump – the bureaucrats and institutionalists who thought they could slow him down with procedure, the more cynical Republican opportunists who thought they could bend his charisma to their own ends. What is left in Trumpworld are only the true believers, or those with the zeal of converts. They are no longer being slowed down from the inside.Nor are they being opposed much from without. In 2017, when liberal Americans could still comfort themselves with the notion that Trump’s election was an anomaly, and in the early months of Trump’s first term, an uncharacteristic level of civic engagement and pride sprang up. The Women’s Marches attracted millions, and crowds swarmed the airports to lend support to travelers from the countries that Trump had targeted with his Muslim ban. But while the early resistance movement had tremendous amounts of feeling, it ultimately lacked direction: all that outrage did not find a useful place to go, and eventually it ebbed. It is hard to find hopefulness, now, among American liberals, and the Democratic party is showing few signs of life. On the Sunday talkshows last week, the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer was asked about the administration’s attacks on institutions of higher education, which have lost federal funding as the regime attempts to restructure their curricula and faculties. Schumer replied that he had sent a strongly worded letter.The United States has long been in a state of constitutional erosion. The role of Congress, the most representative of the federal branches, has been dwindling for decades, as gerrymandering and malapportionment have made its two chambers less competitive and more partisan, leading to permanent gridlock and dysfunction. Congress was once endowed with both the power of the purse and the sole power to declare war; it has largely handed the latter off to the executive, endowing the president with broad powers to use the US military abroad even without congressional approval and has not seemed interested in taking that power back.Trump 100 days: Trump’s whirlwind start to his second presidencyRead moreNow, theTrump administrationseems to have also usurped Congress’s power of the purse for the executive, declaring that the president may refuse to appropriate congressionally allocated funds by personal fiat. This is a profound constitutional change, one that shifts a massive power into the hands of one man; and again, Congress does not seem to be interested in this assault on its own prerogatives, with even many Democratic leaders seemingly preferring to have less power – and, hence, less responsibility.For a long time, the decline of Congress meant the ascent of the federal judiciary, which appropriated large swaths of de facto policymaking authority to itself in light of congressional paralysis. This was already a degradation of democracy: the unelected judges came to have far too much influence over federal policy. And the judges were not the neutral, non-ideological referees that they claimed to be: many interpreted the law to be maximally deferential to the whims of the powerful and only minimally respectful to the rights of the less powerful.The US supreme court, in particular, seemed to change its doctrine almost as whim based on whatever outcome would best serve conservative priorities. Indeed, the judiciary itself seemed more than willing to share in democratically unaccountable power with the president, so long as that president was a Republican: it declared last year that the executive was immune from almost all criminal prosecution, thereby carving out a category of person – Donald Trump – to whom federal criminal law mostly does not apply. But even this wildly partisan federal judiciary does not seem to be good enough for the restored Trump regime, which wants to eliminate all possibility that its agenda might be checked by the courts: JD Vance, the vice-president, has taken to complaining in public when judges rule against the administration,claiming, falsely, that they do not have the authority to check the executive. But such petulant little demonstrations may not long be necessary: increasingly, the Trump regime issimply ignoring judicial ordersthat it does not like.Critics of the Trump administration have called this state of affairs a constitutional crisis. I have come to think of it more like a constitutional collapse: long vacant, the vestiges of the US’s democracy are crumbling to the ground, falling like an empty tent. We don’t yet know what, exactly, will be erected in its place.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The media hasn’t learned its lessonNorman SolomonThe myth that news coverage turned Americans against the war persists. In fact, it was largely complicit in perpetuating the conflictWed 30 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 13.24 EDTShareThe last helicopter liftoff from the roof of the American embassy in Saigon on 30 April 1975 marked the end of theVietnam war. Fifty years later, mythology about US media coverage of the war is locked into the faulty premise that news outlets were pivotal in causing Americans to turn against it. Some say that mainstream media undermined a noble war effort, while others say that coverage alerted the public to realities of an unjust war. Both assertions are wrong.Scapegoating the media fits neatly into “stab in the back” theories of Americans who can’t stand the fact that their country lost a war to impoverished Vietnamese fighters. And praising the media as catalysts for the nation’s roused conscience gives undue credit while fostering illusions about mainstream news coverage of America’s wars.Today, the bulk of the populace remains nearly clueless about what the Pentagon is up to on several continents. Fleeting news reports about US missile strikes on various countries – including Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Somalia since last year – habitually rely on official sources. In addition, the Costs of War project at Brown Universityreports, the United States has “military operations and programs run out of civilian departments for military purposes in at least 78 countries”.WhenUS militaryaction is involved, the reporting routinely amounts to stenographic services for the White House and Pentagon. The pattern for the Vietnam war was set in early August 1964, when American media credulously reported claims from President Lyndon Johnson and his defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that North Vietnamese gunboats had made “unprovoked” attacks on two US Navy destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.The official narrative,filled with deception, led Congress to quickly pass (with only two dissenting votes) theTonkin Gulf resolution– providing an unconditional green light for war on Vietnam. Reporting absolute lies as absolute truths, the country’s most esteemed news media cleared the way for escalation of a war that tookupwardof3 million livesin Vietnam.Typical coverage came from the Washington Post, which ran this banner headline on 5 August 1964, two days before passage of the war resolution: “American Planes Hit North Vietnam After 2nd Attack on Our Destroyers; Move Taken to Halt New Aggression”. Twenty-four years later, I inquired about whether the newspaper had ever retracted its bogus reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin events. When I reached the reporter who had written much of the Post’s political coverage of those events, the former chief diplomatic correspondent Murrey Marder, he said: “I can assure you that there was never any retraction.”When I asked why not, Marder’s voice was tinged with sorrow. “If you were making a retraction,” he said, “you’d have to make a retraction of virtually everyone’s entire coverage of the Vietnam war.” He added: “If the American press had been doing its job and the Congress had been doing its job, we would never have been involved.”On the home front, opponents of the war had to fight an uphill battle against the media establishment. Contrary to the myth that news coverage stoked the fires of anti-war sentiment, mainstream outlets actually lagged way behind. In February 1968 – the same month 49% ofpolledAmericans said sending US troops to Vietnam was “a mistake” while 41% said it was not – the Boston Globe conducted a survey of 39 major US newspapers. Not a single one had editorialized in favor of withdrawing American troops from Vietnam.Meanwhile, the war reportage had numbing qualities, with coverage scarcely able to convey human realities. After reporting from Vietnam during the late 1960s, the Esquire correspondent Michael Herr wrote in his book Dispatches that the US media had “never found a way to report meaningfully about death, which of course was really what it was all about. The most repulsive, transparent gropes for sanctity in the midst of the killing received serious treatment in the papers and on the air.” Reporters being fed the latest from military spokespeople could easily become jaded, as “the jargon of progress got blown into your head like bullets” – and after wading through the deluge of war-related news stories, “the suffering was somehow unimpressive”.No aspect of mythology about Vietnam coverage has been more tenacious than the firmly held belief that television brought the war into America’s living rooms, stirring up disapproval in the process. While entrenched as a truism, the notion that TV served as an anti-war asset is contradicted by abundant facts, as documented by researchers who actually went back to painstakingly watch the news broadcasts of the three American networks.View image in fullscreenPeople mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam war.Photograph: Richard Vogel/APIn his exhaustively researched book The ‘Uncensored War’: The Media and Vietnam, the journalism scholar Daniel Hallin summed up how the televised news regularly suited the warmakers in Washington: “Television coverage of Vietnam dehumanized the enemy, drained him of all recognizable emotions and motives and thus banished him not only from the political sphere, but from human society itself. The North Vietnamese and Vietcong were ‘fanatical’, ‘suicidal’, ‘savage’, ‘half-crazed’. They were lower than mere criminals … they were vermin.”TV news played a much larger role in promoting the Vietnam war than challenging it. That was especially true during the several years of escalation that brought the number of US troops in the country to 500,000 by the end of 1967. Midway through the year, when Newsweek commissioned a Harris poll to find out how television affected public opinion, the magazinereported: “TV has encouraged a decisive majority of viewers to support the war.” The poll found that 64% said TV coverage had actually increased their support for the war, while only 26% said it had boosted their opposition.But what about the memorable TV news reports that showed American military actions in a distinctly unfavorable light? Well, they’re memorable because they were so rare.CBS Evening News caused a stir in August 1965 when the correspondent Morley Safer did astandup reportnext to US Marines using cigarette lighters to burn down huts in the village of Cam Ne. “The fact that this particular journalistic endeavor is now celebrated by virtually everyone who writes on the subject does not, however, mean that it exemplified the coverage of the war during this period,” the journalist Edward Jay Epstein wrote in an investigative series that TV Guide published eight years later. “On the contrary, in examining network newscasts and scripts from 1962 to 1968, I could find few other comparable instances of indiscriminate American destruction or brutality” – even though “hundreds of South Vietnamese villages were destroyed and evacuated in ‘relocation programs’ during this period”.A leading scholar on the history of broadcasting, Lawrence Lichty at the University of Wisconsin, conducted an exhaustive analysis of filmed reports that aired during the same span of a half-dozen years and concluded that such American TV reports showing cruel actions by US troops in Vietnam “could be counted on one hand”.Overall, the American press was careful to stay away from atrocity stories about the troops. Instead of signifying intrepid journalism, the media saga of the war’s most famous massacre was quite the opposite.In March 1968, US army soldiers killedseveral hundred unarmed civiliansof all ages in the Vietnamese village of My Lai. Within months, “evidence of the massacre was presented to top national news media by Vietnam veteran Ron Ridenhour and others, but not one outlet would touch the story”, my RootsAction colleague Jeff Cohen haspointed out. “It wasn’t until November 1969, more than a year and a half after the My Lai slaughter, that the story was finally published by the small, alternative Dispatch News Service and dogged investigative reporter Seymour Hersh.”As the war dragged on, with a US victory nowhere in sight, controversies became fierce – but neither the hawks nor the supposed doves of medialand questioned America’s “right to carry out aggression against South Vietnam”, Noam Chomskyobserved. “In fact, they didn’t even admit that it was taking place. They called it the ‘defense’ of South Vietnam, using ‘defense’ for ‘aggression’ in the standard Orwellian manner.”View image in fullscreenAmerican soldiers from the 173th airborne in 1965.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesWith few exceptions, the framed issues in mass media were matters of efficacy rather than morality, much less international law. And so it was when the CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite – known as “the most trusted man in America” – provided the most fabled minutes of wartime commentary in the history of American television.After several years ofcheering on the war, Cronkite returned from a trip to Vietnam and put together a one-hourCBS special reportthat aired on 27 February 1967, ending witha commentarythat startled viewers with downbeat words: “To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe, in the face of the evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past … To say that we are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, yet unsatisfactory, conclusion.”Cronkite closed his solemn assessment by declaring: “The only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.” His anguish was evident, while his message was far more centered on military failures than moral ones.Cronkite’s commentary was hardly the antiwar turn that some cracked it up to be. His words reinforced rather than challenged the official claims of virtuous intent that he and so many other US journalists had done so much to propagate – insisting that leaders who proceeded with the horrific war year after year were “honorable people” who sought to fulfill “their pledge to defend democracy”.In the world according to dominant media, the US is a defender of virtue against wrongful deeds by bad actors. Along the way, distorted narratives about the Vietnam war have served as parables for the next American wars, in keeping with George Orwell’s dictum: “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.With scant media pushback and much affirmation, one president after another during the last 50 years has turned upside down what the US did in Vietnam. News watchers aware of the war’smethodical liesand enormous cruelties have gritted their teeth while presidents twisted history to depict Uncle Sam as a benevolent giant.American presidents have never come anywhere near offering an honest account of the Vietnam war. None could imagine engaging in the kind of candor that the Pentagon Papers whistleblowerDaniel Ellsbergbluntlyprovidedwhen he said: “It wasn’t that we wereonthe wrong side. Wewerethe wrong side.”Two months after taking office in early 1977, President Jimmy Carter was dismissive when a reporter asked if he felt “any moral obligation to help rebuild” Vietnam. “Well, the destruction was mutual,” hereplied. “We went there to defend the freedom of the South Vietnamese. And I don’t feel that we ought to apologize or to castigate ourselves or to assume the status of culpability.”A dozen years later, Ronald Reagantolda gathering at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington that the war had been a “noble cause” – “however imperfectly pursued, the cause of freedom”.While announcing formal diplomatic relations with Vietnam in July 1995, President Bill Clinton felt compelled to fabricate history. “Whatever we may think about the political decisions of the Vietnam era, the brave Americans who fought and died there had noble motives,” hesaid. “They fought for the freedom and the independence of the Vietnamese people.”View image in fullscreenA Palestinian woman mourns the death of a family member killed during an Israeli strike on Gaza.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesAt the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington in May 2012, President Barack Obamaspokeof “honoring our Vietnam veterans by never forgetting the lessons of that war” – which included “that when America sends our sons and daughters into harm’s way, we will always give them a clear mission; we will always give them a sound strategy”. But Obama was far along in replicating the tragic folly of the Vietnam war.During his first years as president, Obamamore than tripledthe number of US troops in Afghanistan, reaching a peak of 100,000 in 2011. Jingoistic flattery was irresistible. In the spring of 2010, Obamatoldassembled troops in Afghanistan: “All of you represent the virtues and the values that America so desperately needs right now – sacrifice and selflessness, honor and decency.” Obama had been five years old when Johnson traveled to Vietnam andtoldassembled troops: “No American army in all of our long history has ever been so compassionate.”Since October 2023, the latest two presidents have taught a new generation of Americans what Johnson and Richard Nixon taught baby boomers during the Vietnam war. When the warfare state calculates massive profits for the military-industrial complex and geopolitical advantages for the US government, moral entreaties do not enter into the policy calculus. Joe Biden and Donald Trump have enabled the daily,systematicmass killingof Palestinian civilians in Gaza,made possibleby continuous US arms shipments to Israel – making the US a full partner in genocide, as documented byAmnesty InternationalandHuman Rights Watch.Presidential impunity runs parallel to media pliability. While controversies have abounded about a wide range of US war efforts, the standard arguments featured by news outlets do not question the prerogative of the United States to militarily work its will on the world as much as feasible. The Vietnam war was no anomaly in its profusion of official government mendacity or the overall compliance of the nation’s mass media.Two years before he died in June 2023, Ellsbergtoldme: “That there is deception, that the public is evidently misled by it early in the game, in the approach to the war, in a way that encourages them to accept a war and support a war, is the reality.”It’s not difficult to deceive the public, he added: “You’re often telling them what they would like to believe – that we’re better than other people, we are superior in our morality and our perceptions of the world.”Norman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

Trump claimed he had won an enormous historic mandate to impose a counterrevolution. “The American people have given us a mandate, a mandate like few people thought possible,” Trump boasted on 6 March in his address to the Congress.His election rested on two principal issues, immigration and inflation. He demonized immigrants (“poisoning the blood” of the country), raised the bogeyman of transgender people, and racialized the Democratic candidate, Vice-PresidentKamala Harris, whom he claimed haddecided herself she was Black. In the minds of the marginal voters who swung to him, however, immigration and inflation were conflated, factors impinging on their standard of living and economic security. Trump stigmatized migrants as the source of crime and cultural impurity, but swing voters mainly (and falsely) regarded them as economic competitors for jobs and government resources.Trump’s formula in the first 100 days of his second term, and onward, is to reverse an extraordinary success into spectacular failure. His ironclad approach is that problems that don’t exist can be solved by policies that won’t work. On 19 October 2024, the Economist ran a cover story headlined “The envy of the world”. “The American economy has left other rich countries in the dust,” it reported.Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve Board, had announced cuts to interest rates based on the economy approaching the fabled “soft landing” of low inflation with high employment. On the edge of achieving a glide path toward stable prosperity, he cautioned that the policies in place would have to be maintained to reach an equilibrium. “We haven’t completed that task,” he said.On 2 April, Trump’s “liberation day”, he proclaimed astronomical tariffs on nearly every country in the world based on a nonsensical equation he got from his crackpot adviserPeter Navarro, whose academic work is studded with footnotes referencing the work of a non-existent scholar named Ron Vara, an anagram of Navarro’s name. Navarro, who served a prison sentence for contempt of Congress, refusing to testify about January 6, is considered an absurd figure among virtually all professional economists.In response, the reality-based Powell felt compelled to announce that the US now faced a “challenging scenario” of “higher inflation and slower growth”, and that the Fed would halt rate cuts, which would increase inflation further. The “soft landing” has disappeared from sight.Trump 100 days: from cornerstone of the west to unreliable allyRead moreTrump ruminated aloud that he wanted tofire Powell. The market tanked. Wall Street and CEOs freaked out. Trump reluctantly backed down, at least for the moment. The market went up. When Trump crashes, the market rises. But uncertainty rules the day. Trust has evaporated. His gyrations have made business planning impossible.Trump’s feat is unprecedented in US economic history in the speed with which he has created the most profound harm. The only precedent was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President Herbert Hoover, raising rates by an average of 20%. The act provoked retaliation from other nations and deepened the Great Depression, which had begun with the stock market crash in September 1929. William Hague, the former British foreign minister,wrotein the London Times about Trump’s plan: “It makes Herbert Hoover look like a far-sighted and enlightened economist.”Trump’s pattern is predictably monotonous. First, he claims omnipotence: “I alone can fix it.”Then, if anything goes wrong, he disclaims responsibility. “I’m not involved,” he said, for example, about the wrongful expulsion ofKilmar Ábrego García. Then he blames others for the misfortune he has caused.Trump inevitably squanders his inheritance. His behavior is repetitive. The combination of his malignant narcissism, grandiosity and impulsiveness led to his blowing thenearly half-billion dollarshanded to him from Fred Trump, the founding father of the family fortune, insix flame-out bankruptcies. Trump’s first presidential term imploded in his incompetence when he was confronted with a true crisis in the Covid pandemic and exploded finally in his January 6 insurrection. Having re-entered office with the best economy in a generation, he has single-mindedly used every stick of dynamite to blow it up to usher in his proclaimed “golden age”. He has strangled the golden goose.Meanwhile, Trump’s reckless illegality in dealing with immigration has caused a majority of the public to turn against him on the question that had been his strongest issue. His fall in support here is related to his contempt for due process, individual cases of specific outrage (abducting atwo-year old US citizenand afour-year-old with cancer), and his disdain for the courts that frequently rule against him.Trump 100 days: delusions of monarchy coupled with fundamental ineptitudeRead moreTrump’s spreading economic disaster, so clearly attributable to his own actions, decouples immigration as an economic cause. What do immigrants have to do with this, as the Financial Timesreports: “Meanwhile, the Port of Los Angeles, the main route of entry for goods from China to the US, expects scheduled arrivals in the week starting May 4 to be a third lower than a year before. The number of ‘blank sailings’, where scheduled sailings from China are cancelled, are rising sharply. US-China air freight volumes have also plunged.”Trump’s self-induced economic crisis drastically reduces the effectiveness of his demagogy while making his need for a scapegoat that much more urgent. He continues to propagandize about migrants, but if Trump’s policies are plainly the cause of economic pain, immigrants diminish in stature as a looming menace. Fewer people care whether they are eating the dogs and the cats.The same cycle of demystification and disillusionment applies to Trump’s demonization of the “radical left elites”, the “deep state”, the “snooty” law firms, “radical” universities and students snatched off the streets and having legal visas voided for participating in pro-Palestinian protests. As the economy pulls back, it reveals his retribution for what it is: nothing but a personal vendetta.Cui bono?Who benefits? The voters are not benefiting. His grudges do nothing to assist them. The tech billionaires at his side can no longer be depicted as representative of privileged Democrats.Elon Muskis greatly responsible for Trump’s election through his $270m contribution, and Trump is then responsible for Musk’s chainsaw destruction of government workers and services. Everything that Musk’s name is attached to is less popular. Musk’s prancing at a Republican rally in Wisconsin, donning a triangular cheese-head hat, and providingmassive campaign moneyturned a state judgeship race into a referendum on him and Trump. The Democrat won by 10 points. Musk’s company Teslalost 71% in profitsthis year amid consumer repulsion.But, ultimately, Trump owns the damage. He authorized Musk’s wild ride. Musk exists as a function of Trump’s splenetic vengeance.Trump’s instinct is to deepen and accelerate his retribution and propaganda. But the damage is already done, and the worst is ahead. In the shortest disorder possible, he has created the recessionary stagflation to come, which by its very nature is sticky and difficult to undo. He is angry at the Fed for not rescuing him by cutting interest rates. But if the Fed followed his dictate, inflation would only increase more. Trump’s frustration is that he is trapped within a failure of his own making. Even if he were to reverse himself overnight, it is too late. The effects of his uncertainty and instability have delivered a body blow to both supply and demand, shattered consumer confidence, upset the bond market, undermined the dollar, forced other nations to reorganize global trade and empowered China above all.It’s all too late. Trump has destroyed Trumpism. “I alone can fix it.” Trump’s fix is in.Tracking Trump – everything that’s happened in the president’s first 100 daysRead moreTrump invariably reverts to his tried-and-true method: he blames someone else. Yet Trump has not quite done the damage alone. He has had accomplices, without whom he could not have perpetrated his rapidly growing calamity. He required the complicity of the Republicans in the Congress. They are more than his handmaidens; they could have restrained him at any moment. They chose to abdicate their power to enable him.Trump’s crusades have been made possible by his invocation of emergency powers. But his executive orders declaring emergencies are rooted in fictions. There is no real war to justify his use of the Alien Enemies Act. The Venezuelan migrant targets are not the instrument of the Maduro government,according to the US intelligence community. There is also no national security basis for Trump to grab all tariff authority from the Congress.But rather than staging an intervention to assert their rightful constitutional authority, the Republicans have allowed Trump carte blanche for his rampage. In the House, theRepublican leadershiptwice refused to allow a vote on a Democratic bill to repeal Trump’s emergency power for tariffs. They can no more escape responsibility than he can for the consequences.Then theHouse Republican leadership refused to funda delegation of Democratic members to inspect the El Salvador maximum-security prison where migrants have been jailed. But neither the continuing incarceration ofKilmar Ábrego Garcíanor the indictment of aMilwaukee county judgewill serve as a sufficient political distraction except on Fox News. The migrant and the judge did not declare a tariff war.Trump’s foreign policy ventures have been rattling fiascos. He has his feigned efforts at negotiation over Ukraine, in which he echoed Russian demands. His attempt to bring China to heel in his trade war has led only to being ghosted while China has busily been making deals with our repelled allies to their advantage. Trump’s bellicose imperial ambitions for a nostalgic 19th-century colonialism have boomeranged. Trump’s threat to annex Canada as the 51st state has led to the sudden collapse of the Conservative party there and the phoenix-like ascent of theLiberal prime minister Mark Carneyon widespread Canadian loathing for Trump. Vice-President JD Vance’s visit to Greenland, a semi-independent territory of Denmark, to stir up support for annexing it to the US was a farcical episode that met with an icy reception.The Guardian view on Canada’s Liberal election: Carney’s triumph is a rebuff to Trump | EditorialRead moreThe Economist, which just months ago touted the supremacy of the US economy, featured a cover on 26 April of a bruised and bandaged American eagle. “He has already done lasting harm to America,” the magazine wrote about Trump’s first 100 days.Trump arrives at his 100 days themost unpopular presidentat that point in the history of recorded polls. His limited mandate was to lower inflation and to deal legitimately with immigration, both of which were already largely resolved issues. He had only to do nothing or little. But self-control and clarity of vision are not among his traits.Trump’s infernal war is with his designated enemies within. He is left to hiskulturkampf, his culture war against the professions, the law firms, the media, the medical research centers, the universities, the arts and humanities, the libraries and museums, against reason itself and, as always, the judiciary. But he never had a mandate for his imposition of an authoritarian regime. “I have nothing to do with Project 2025,” he said during the campaign. Then he implemented its extremist agenda point by point.Once again, inevitably, Trump finds himself back in court. Trump had signed 137 executive orders by 27 April, almost all facing legal challenges. According to the Just SecurityLitigation Trackerof the New York University law school, as of 26 April, 211 complaints had been filed against the Trump administration.Trump is a recidivist. The convicted felon in the White House cannot help but break the law and attempt to justify his lawlessness. “He who saves his country does not violate any law,” Trump declared three weeks into his new administration. But he is not saving the country; he is wrecking it.Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of EarthExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

If I leave the country, will I be allowed back in?Arwa MahdawiEven a summer holiday isn’t straightforward any more - and all across the US, millions of people are having to make calculations like mineWed 30 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTShareLet me start with a message to my wife. SORRY!!! I apologise in advance for everything you are about to read.My more sensible half, you see, is a US citizen, who keeps telling me (a green card holder) that I should stop making jokes about getting sent to a detention centre or deported.Not only are my jokes inappropriate; my wife seems to think they’re suspicious.“I think you secretly want to get deported so you can take a break from childcare and have a lie-in,” she said the other day. I can’t remember what prompted this allegation – perhaps a dire knock-knock joke about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials – but it’s obviously nonsense. I read that Guardian article about theBritish artist who was detainedby US authorities because of a visa mix-up and she was woken up every day at 5:30am and given an Ice-cold potato. There are no lie-ins at Club Fed!Look, it should go without saying that nothing that is happening in the US at the moment is remotely funny. The fact that Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil wasrobbed of seeing his first childbeing born because he’s locked in a cell forprotesting against a genocideis not funny. The fact that a judge has said thatthe Trump administrationjust deported a two-year-old US citizen to Honduras with “no meaningful process” is not funny. The fact that Trump is disappearing people to a prison in El Salvador – and threatening to send “homegrown” Americans there next – is not funny.But while the US’s slide into authoritarianism is no laughing matter, I’m afraid I can’t stop making jokes. It is a compulsion, a sickness. It is simply how I cope with terrible situations. Although, honestly, I’m not coping particularly well. It feels as if everything has been unrelentingly bleak for a very long time now. It’s been over 18 months of watching helplessly as starving kids get slaughtered inGaza, 100 days of Trump inflicting chaos and cruelty in the US. My nerves are shot.In an attempt to brighten things up, my wife and I have been thinking about where we might take our four-year-old this summer. But even a summer holiday isn’t straightforward any more. First, there’s the question of whether it’s too much of a risk to even leave the country as a green-card holder. I reached out to a few contacts who work in immigration law and civil liberties, expecting them to tell me not to be so dramatic and I’d be fine. But they all sort of went: “Ehhh, deportation is definitely a possibility under this unpredictable and lawless regime! You should be prepared! Even flying domestically carries risks!”So now, even though I am in the US perfectly legally, even though I have done nothing wrong (apart from the crime of being Palestinian), summer holiday planning involves extensive risk assessment – tickets, money, passports, a lawyer’s number in case things go south.Across the US, millions of people are making calculations like mine. Should I leave the country or not? Should I go to a protest or not? Should I delete my mean tweets about Trump in case a guard looks through my phone at the border? Should I carry a burner phone when re-entering the US –something foreign journalistsare now being advised to do? You can see, amid all these individual calculations, amid all the self-censorship and self-policing, how easy it is for fear to spread and authoritarianism to take hold.While I may sound cavalier about all this, I am taking my situation seriously. I am lining up possible lawyers in case the worst happens. And I’m coming up with a comms plan. By which I mean I have picked out a cute picture of my dog for my wife to give to the press if I do get detained, in order to foster public sympathy. My dog is a scruffylittle 8lb mongrel called Rascalwho has lost a few teeth in his old age and whose tongue lolls out of his mouth. He has a face that would melt even the Trumpiest heart and he is my secret weapon. It’s very hard to get many Americans to give a damn about Arabs, but dogs are a different story. People will always go to battle for a dog.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Inflation remained steady at 2.4% and underlying inflation fell below 3%. BecausePeter Duttonhad made such a big deal about that measure, he now looks bereft of an argument.A good campaign really should be able to see what is coming. It was clear to anyone with an understanding of economics that when theMarch quarter CPI figureswere released, underlying or “core” inflation would definitely be lower than the 3.3% figure in the December quarter.And so it came to pass. The official CPI remained steady at 2.4% (a slight fall from 2.42% to 2.40%), underlying inflation fell to 2.9% and so too did other measures that attempt to remove volatile price changes:If the graph does not display, click hereSo it was rather extraordinary that this week Dutton kept talking as though the opposite was about to occur.In the last leaders’ debate on Sunday he argued that “if we can manage the economy well, it means that we can bring inflation down”.Rate cut likely as underlying inflation falls within RBA target rangeRead moreWell, it is down now, so I guess that means the economy is being well managed?He also claimed that “core inflation in this country is twice that of G7 nations”.That line was always pretty dodgy given it appeared he was only counting France and Italy. But it looks even more weird now given our core inflation is essentially the same as the US (though it is measured differently – they exclude food and energy whereas we exclude, or “trim”, the biggest 15% price rises and falls):If the graph does not display, click hereIt also is silly because no one really has any clue what core inflation is. Given this quarter it excludes things such as medical and hospital services, childcare, automotive fuel and electricity, you might quite correctly wonder why any politician would think that a good measure.Talking about inflation is treacherous because voters mostly don’t understand it. When an economist says inflation is coming down, most people think that sounds odd, because they know prices have not fallen.Inflation is just the measure of the growth of prices over a certain period. So, if you talk about inflation not falling, and then it does fall, you look silly. You’ll also have lost the message because you should be talking about prices, not inflation.But then Dutton has also been pretty careless with facts when it comes to prices.His favourite line of the campaign has been that grocery prices have risen 30% under the ALP. In the debate on Sunday the moderator, Mark Riley, tried to get him to explain where he got that figure from.If the graph does not display, click hereRather than 30%, grocery prices on average have risen 13.3% since the last election. And yes, that is more than the 10.4% increase in wages, so clearly cost-of-living problems are real. But why exaggerate numbers?He also sometimes claims electricity prices have gone up $1,300 when they have not. Even using his favourite measure of “default price offer”, the most Sydney users would havepaid is $684. That seems more than enough – so why use a bigger number?As to the real numbers, electricity prices remain lower in most cities than they were a year ago, even with a jump in Queensland due to the end of the state government rebate:If the graph does not display, click hereThe big driver of inflation over the past year has been rents – accounting for 14% of all the increase in inflation over that time:If the graph does not display, click hereThe issue has been most pronounced in Perth, where rent went up nearly 20% in the past year and 26% since the last election:If the graph does not display, click hereBecause all columns on inflation must concern themselves with interest rates, let us at least acknowledge that nothing in these figures will change the likelihood of a rate cut on 20 May. A 25 basis point cut is all but certain, and the likelihood of more than that remains very much alive.The Reserve Bank likes to check service prices as they are closely linked to wages. The past six months has seen a strong slowing of services prices growth and the annual growth of 3.7% is very manageable:If the graph does not display, click hereA large share of all prices are now growing by less than 3%, which suggests the level of inflation is widespread:If the graph does not display, click hereNone of this, however, should have you thinking that cost of living is no longer a problem. The past four years have not been kind – especially to those on low and middle incomes who spend a greater share of their income paying for necessities such as food, energy bills, petrol, transport costs and other “non-discretionary” items.Thankfully we are finally seeing the price rises of non-discretionary items rise slower than wages, but the past four years show that a great deal has been lost:If the graph does not display, click hereOver the past four years wages have risen largely at the same pace as the prices of discretionary items such as entertainment, travel and clothes (because you can actually put off buying a new pair of shoes, while you cannot put off paying an electricity bill). But the cost of necessities has risen 1.6 times faster than wages.Such figures should have made for a pretty compelling campaign message for the opposition. But getting tangled up talking about inflation and core inflation and exaggerating numbers blunted Peter Dutton’s message and blew the opportunity he was handed.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsInflationGrogonomicsAustralian economyAustralian election 2025Reserve Bank of AustraliaInterest ratesAustralian politicsPeter DuttoncommentShareReuse this content"

Stop banging on about renewables; won’t someone think of the things wedon’tknow how to do, like carbon capture and such wizardry as is still locked in tech bros’ imaginations? Basically, net zero had lost the room, according to the former prime minister. And if anyone knows where the room is, and how to get it back, it must be him.The Tony Blair Institute (TBI) issued a statement on Wednesday saying that, in fact, it believes the government’s net zero policy is “the right one”. But this is a familiar trajectory for the former prime minister. He said something similar about “woke”, which sadly lost the room in 2022. “Plant Labour’s feet clearly near the centre of gravity of the British people,” Blair advised Starmer. “[They] want fair treatment for all and an end to prejudice, but distrust and dislike the ‘cancel culture’, ‘woke’ mentality.” What exactly does “woke” mean, if not an end to prejudice? Just how effective is cancel culture if Blair himself could work as a lobbyist for aSaudi oil firm in 2016,advise the government of Kazakhstanafter it brutally suppressed public protests in 2011, and yet still walk among us as the voice of the progressive left? Memo to my fellow cancellers: we are bad at this.Two years later, just after the general election, Blair wasvictorysplaining the populist rightto Keir Starmer: you don’t beat them by arguing with them. “To close off their avenues for increasing support, you’ve got to deal with the grievance.” In practice, this means meeting them halfway on immigration. Promise to cut it, promise to be tough on it, promise to make migrants’ lives as hard as they possibly can be – and Blair has form, here, of course, as the instigator of the life-altering policy ofdenying asylum-seekersthe right to work. The funny thing about meeting populists halfway is that it never works; it almost seems to drive them further into the reaches of their extremism, just to get away from you.But no time! Because net zero extremists are coming for the progressive cause, and the sensible centre needs to head them off at the pass. This issue differs from immigration, in so far as there’s no easy out-group (unless you count “supporters of net zero”), and differs from “woke” in so far as it has a meaning, one that the climate journalist James Murray has handily recapped: “Net zero is a scientific term referring to the balance of anthropogenic emissions and carbon sinks required to stop temperatures spiralling out of control, bringing with them drastically increased risk of food insecurity, catastrophic weather and civilisation-level disaster.” There is no happy medium, where ordinary people get to have slightly less net zero and lower bills. There is only action that is fast enough or not, and political decisions that distribute the cost of that action fairly or not.Many situate Blair’s otherwise incomprehensible position with the allegiance of his largest donor, Larry Ellison, a Trump-affiliated tech billionaire who, as of January 2024,had given $100mto the TBI and pledged to take his donations up to $375m. Don’t panic, anyone; Ellison also spent $200m building aJapanese-inspired villa in Palo Alto. It’s just not that much money to Ellison, so he could easily have bunged it to a mate and not intended to derail any nation’s environmental policies, least of all one as tiny as ours. It makes no sense, he’s not a fossil fuels guy, why would he oppose net zero? Maybe he’s lobbying for tech optimism, maybe he’s working against state regulation. Either way, you didn’t vote for him, nor could you.There’s a more soothing theory still, which is that Blair has always pushed corporate interests and had a deep distaste for grassroots movements for social change. There’s a direct through-line, from the man whopushed PFIand was rumoured to have banned beards on the frontbenches, to the man who finds everything, including wildlife and clement weather, too woke.The last person to voice this anti-net zero position was, of course, Kemi Badenoch. She was asked at a conference in March, by someone who worked at the Eden Project, the only two cogent questions I heard anyone put to her: on what scientific basis did sheresile from the 2050 target? And what would she like the target to be instead? She had no answer at all to the first, and to the second, something whimsical and impressionistic: “Why did we set the target at 2050? Why not 2051, why not 2049? Because there was a zero at the end of the year, not because there was a clear plan.” It was unprepared, undergrad stuff; this politician alone could not hold back the energy for action on climate.That’s what’s often so chilling about anti-climate action – the case for change is so established that you expect its opponents to be at the top of their game, to have an argument so strong that it had never occurred to a waiting world; you expect them to be extraordinary. When they aren’t, it’s as if their paymasters are just dialling it in, because they’ve already won.The do-nothing lobby needs as many voices as it can get: the upstart, the elder statesman, the right, the centre, the household name, the maverick, the lot. Those of us who would prefer to do something, to halt climate change, need to situateTony Blaircorrectly: he’s not the charmer of crowds in the service of low-key progressive medicine they might not otherwise swallow. He’s part of a different chorus; you can call it “corporate”, you can call it the “tech broligarchy”, but you can’t keep calling it the “left”.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

My siblings and I would stick out our tongues to compare how blue they were. Sometimes as blue as the milk in our Lucky Charms cereal bowls, where the marshmallows shaped like blue moons, horseshoes and rainbows coloured anything that got in contact with them. Candy corn was a staple on Halloween, and corn syrup jugs were ubiquitous at Thanksgiving to bake pumpkin and pecan pies. These were rare treats – we were an immigrant family who largely ate traditional Indian food – and for that caution, I’m grateful.We now know how artificial food colourings affect the cognitive, behavioural, metabolic and nutritional development of children, and how they are linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This includes my favourite brilliant blue dye. A 2024 scientific review of theevidencetitled Synthetic Colors in Food: A Warning for Children’s Health refers to the possible toxicity levels of these additives, and suggests substituting dyes from completely natural sources instead.Finding any of those dyes in Britain and the EU is pretty difficult, and they’re covered with warnings when you do. In 1995, the UK government passedlegislation(the colours in food regulations) that banned certain colours in food production and required labelling (either by name or by something called an E number) if any of a certain list of chemical food colours were used in manufacturing. Going further, in 2008,the Food Standards Agencysuggested that UK manufacturers should remove artificial food colours, given emerging evidence linking these chemicals to ADHD in children.The UK did not go as far as a complete ban on these colourings, like most EU countries did, but since 2010, food and drink containing certain artificial colourings must carry a warning on the packaging: “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children”. Rather than carry this warning, most food manufacturers have switched to natural sources of food colouring such as beetroot, turmeric, matcha and spirulina.View image in fullscreenThe US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy, at a cabinet meeting at the White House in February 2025.Photograph: ABACA/REX/ShutterstockEU governments and the UK government had to step in with this legislation because just leaving it to the food industry wasn’t enough. Unfettered capitalism is dangerous, with the motivations being sales and producing products in the cheapest way possible, even if they have probable negative health impacts. How is a busy parent supposed to know which cereal is full of E colours that could adversely affect the development of their child, and which cereal is using natural colours? Labelling is a large step forward, as well as warnings. Even better would be to make sure what’s on the shelves isn’t going to make you or your loved ones sick or impaired.I was recently back in the US, and those artificial dyes are still being sold in the same products from my childhood 30 years ago. In one of his last acts in office this January, former president Joe Bidenbanned the dyered 3 in food manufacturing after studies linked the chemical to cancer in male rats. However, food manufacturers have until 2027 to phase the colouring out, meaning foods with this dye such as cakes, candies and cookies are still being sold without any warning on the label.While in EU countries and Britain food safety guidance has evolved with the evidence and to protect consumer safety, US supermarkets and shops are full of products being marketed and sold to children with multiple Es in them, and additives and colourings that are banned or being phased out in other countries.The larger portion sizes and ubiquitous fast food might be most visible when comparing the US to Europe, but the hidden, more insidious difference is what chemicals are regulated and allowed in the food supply.At least a dozen US states rush to ban common food dyes, citing health risksRead moreWith a potential UK-US trade deal including food, the difference in standards presents challenges, and potential slippage into a lower safety bar. We’ve heard of concerns about antibiotics in US meat, and chlorinated chicken, but not about the import of products from the US that don’t meet UK safety standards. We actually have more in common with Europe in terms of food safety, and a trade deal with the EU would improve our food safety baseline.Things are slowly changing in the US, from a surprising source. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health and human services secretary, has a range ofbizarre and dangerous views, buthe’s speakingabout regulating these additives and food colourings under the Maha – or “make America healthy again” – slogan. Maha supporters like to proclaim that this is pioneering. It’s not. Americans love to think we’re world-leading. Sometimes, we’re just behind the curve. In this case, very far behind Europe, and more than a decade behind Britain.While back in the US, I caught up with a friend from England who now lives in Miami. I told her that I had gone into multiple supermarkets looking for ultraprocessed products that didn’t contain something banned or regulated in Europe. Ingredient lists were full of possibly toxic chemicals, yet being sold with no warning or flagging to consumers of what they were buying. She laughed and said, “You’re looking in the wrong section. Go to the British section of the supermarket and you’ll find safer food there.” Who would have thought that the British options would be the healthier options?Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghExplore more on these topicsFood safetyOpinionHealthFood & drink industryFoodcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s partly ignorance, but politicians don’t helpWed 30 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 07.06 EDTShareMy local area has a thriving community website mainly based around things such as recommendations for plumbers and restaurants, or people selling sofas. But every now and then I feel the need to scan its pages to make sure a near-neighbour hasn’t libelled me. Why?Cycling, of course.As Jeremy Vinehas found out, there is something very peculiar about riding a bike. It seems to make otherwise sensible people on the roads around you lose all reason and perspective. Vine has spent years posting informative and amusing video vignettes of his bike commute, pointing out the many and frequent ways that some drivers seem oblivious or, at times, openly homicidal to those on two wheels.The broadcaster is about as courteous and agreeable a cyclist as you could meet – Ionce joined himon his ride home – but he has finally given up sharing clips in the face of endless comments on X either insulting him or, fairly often, openly wishing him harm. Part of this is simply down to the depressingly grim culture of what used to be Twitter. But it is magnified by the way discussions about cycling inevitably bring out the worst in certain people.I am not by any margin as well-known a bike advocate as Vine. But I havewritten a bookextolling the joys of everyday cycling, pluscolumns on the same subject. For some people, this is enough to make me the object of scorn or even hatred.My irregular appearances on the local website began when the council started introducing so-called low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), filtering schemes intended to make walking and cycling safer and more convenient. The fact Ihave arguedfor such schemes in principle was apparently enough to make me part of a conspiracy to force cars off the road and make cycling mandatory, in league with the council and a shadowy cabal of cycling advocacy groups.View image in fullscreenA still from a YouTube video showing a motorist repeatedly driving at cyclists in London, August 2018.Photograph: MrClifCam/YoutubeWhen I was still a user of X, things were even more feral. Ostensibly serious and sane people, including a Labour councillor and the head of a respected campaign group, would argue that I was not simply wrong about bike lanes and LTNs, but that I knew this and was acting in bad faith.So what is it about cycling? In part it’s sheer ignorance, given that even in most big UK cities, riding a bike is a fairly niche pursuit. To take one example, about twice a week I will have a driver asking (or yelling) about me riding “in the middle of the road”. If I did have the time and patience to explain, the response is simple. First, it’s the middle of thelane; and second, this is a very basic riding tactic recommended by everyone from the Highway Codeto the policeto disincentivise over-close passing when there is not enough room.Similarly, much recent coverage of dangerous cycling is based on what are termed e-bikes – but with their throttles and powered speeds well above the legal maximum of 15mph, these are not bikes. They are illegal electric motorbikes.Such antipathy, of course, takes places within a cultural context. For the UK – plus similar low-cycling countries such as the US and Australia – this is the concerted demonisation of bikes and cycling by everyone from the media to politicians. For certain newspapers and broadcast outlets, bike-bashing is a form of punching-down they can never get enough of. Cyclists are simultaneously so slow and obstructive that they hold up traffic, yet sufficiently rapid and reckless to be a major threat to pedestrians.You can repeatedly point out,as doesthe saintly Chris Boardman, head of Active Travel England, that statistically cyclists are less deadly than lightning and cows – but as ever with culture wars, facts are somewhat futile here.Speaking of culture wars, politicians play their part. Yes, we are thankfully beyond the slightly ridiculous peak of the Rishi Sunak era, when ministers commissioned a report intended to show LTNs didn’t work andsought to cover it upwhen the study found they did. But it is nonetheless notable that the first major intervention linked to cycling by Keir Starmer’s government was to use limited legislative bandwidth toannounce a planned new lawlast week targeting what parts of the media term “killer cyclists”.No one becomes a saint when they start pedalling, and my long-held idea is that the very same people who zoom through a red light on a bike will also speed in a car, recline their seat as the meals are served on a plane or push past to get the last seat on a train. They are multi-modal nitwits.But as Vine, and to a lesser extent myself, have found out, it is only when someone’s legs straddle a crossbar that they are somehow defined by their transport, and logic, reason and courtesy disappear. I’m not a “cyclist”. I just sometimes ride a bike.

Incumbents say things are going in the right direction; don’t let the opposition screw it up! Challengers say everything is screwed up already; it’s time for change!There is a less orthodox, third option, innovated by theConservativesin competition with whichever party Nigel Farage happens to be leading: our opponent is right; don’t vote for him.From Europe and immigration to climate and culture, the Tories tested this strategy to destruction under Rishi Sunak. Now, Kemi Badenoch wants to test it some more on the smouldering ruins. Her programme is not easy to distinguish from the familiar Faragist fulminations. Herreward will be a batteringin local and regional devolved elections on Thursday.Badenoch is unlucky to face her first ballot-box test as leader in a defence of councils that were last contested when Boris Johnson was popular, buoyed up by a “vaccine bounce” as Britain emerged from pandemic lockdowns. A brutal cull of councillors seems certain.Reform UK will be the main beneficiaries. Some of the winners will be former Tories. Farage’s candidate to be mayor ofGreater Lincolnshire is Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative MP until last May. If she wins – and polls suggest she can – she will be Reform’s most powerful elected politician.Farage’s knack for luring voters and activists from the Toriesprovokes endless speculationthatthe two forces could combine. Enthusiasts for this model of a “united right” point to parliamentary seats where Labour’s winning majority last year was smaller than the sum of Reform and Conservative vote shares. Basic arithmetic then suggests an elegantly simple solution to the problem of how to remove Keir Starmer from Downing Street.On Britain’s election battleground, I learned what people want from Starmer: the change he promised them | Polly ToynbeeRead moreBut that isn’t how elections or people work in real life. Reform and the Conservatives are separate parties for a reason, and it isn’t just that Farage’s ego needs its own tour bus.An overlap in ideology masks the conceptual difference between a party that has evolved over generations to inhabit established institutions of power, and a challenger party that wants to see those institutions torn down. The Tories are indigenous to Westminster; Reform are an invasive species.Farage understands this. He knows that speculation about pacts and coalitions expresses panic in the absence of a plan for recovery, which makes the Tories look weak, as the supplicant party. The vulture doesn’t need to do a deal with the carrion.Badenoch appears to have understood this asymmetry of interest. She points out that Farage, having pledged to destroy her party, is clearly not its friend. But she doesn’t have a strategy for differentiation, still less an agenda to rehabilitate Conservatism as a proposition for serious government.The problem goes back to Brexit, the thrill of insurgency, Johnson’s triumph in the 2019 election and the paradox of revolution overseen by a party whose name means wariness of change. Conservatives are still chasing that high, but without a connection to the voters that might supply it. The more desperately they crave the buzz of rampant radicalism, the less appealing they are in the old heartlands of respectable Tory sobriety.That has turned the Liberal Democrats into a refuge for moderate middle Englanders, as they hope to show on Thursday. The geographic spread of councils up for election, with contests inWiltshireandGloucestershire, for example, is another factor that makes this particular round of ballots look precision-targeted to inflict Tory pain.That means Labour should escape an equivalent mauling at council level. Unfortunately for Starmer, there is also a byelectionin Runcorn and Helsby. ALabour majority of 14,696is sure to be drastically reduced and very possibly overturned by Reform.That, in combination with a strong showing in devolved mayoral contests, will give Farage licence for a victory parade on Friday morning, boasting of his credentials as the scourge ofLabourand Tories alike – the man with unstoppable momentum on a road that leads all the way to Downing Street.Since Tory discomfort at Reform’s hands is a familiar story, and Westminster treats byelection results as oracles of political destiny, a Labour defeat in Runcorn will be treated as a harbinger of ineluctable doom for the prime minister.The underlying electoral dynamics – and what Starmer can do to change them – will take some time to unpick. Farage takes many more votes from the Tories than from Labour. But Labour’s position is made vulnerable when liberal and left-leaning voters, whose main priority last year was ousting Sunak’s government, lose heart with the replacement. Starmer has a tricky balance to strike. He must attend to the socially conservative sensibilities of voters who might be tempted by Reform, but without Farage’s crass illiberalism, which propels others towards the Greens or Lib Dems.Some Labour strategists view those progressive defectors as midterm malcontents who will return to Starmer when he is the only thing stopping a coalition of Tories and Reform from seizing power. That dynamic might be accelerated if Farage’s well-advertised enthusiasm for Donald Trump can be mobilised to his detriment, along with his recorded admiration for Vladimir Putin.That line of attack looks more viable in the light of this week’s extraordinary comeback for theLiberals in Canada’s general election. The ruling party was moribund in polls just months ago. But Mark Carney rallied the nation in solidarity against Trump’s tariff wars and revulsion at his deranged talk of making Canada the 51st US state. The opposition Conservatives found their Maga-inflected rightwing style suddenly out of fashion. Their leader, Pierre Poilievre, was once lauded by British Tories as a model to emulate.He lost his seat.The practical applications of that case study are limited. Carney was newly installed as prime minister just before the snap poll. Trump has not threatened to annex Britain. But the US president is toxic enough that Farage ought to be contaminated by association. And if there is a credible prospect of him becoming prime minister, liberal waverers should be spooked into reprising their 2024 tactical votes for Labour.There is a long way to go before that is even the question. Any strategy based on assembling voters into blocking coalitions assumes their behaviour can be accurately modelled and channelled through a wildly dysfunctional electoral system. If party allegiances continue to fragment on current trends, first past the post could go from being an erratic method for allocating seats in parliament to an insane one. This, too, is likely to be showcased in Thursday’s elections. None of the winners of the devolved mayoralties is likely to have secured an overall majority of votes.That volatility, the unwinding of two-party politics in England, will be the real story on Friday morning. It makes any attempt to forecast what might happen in the rest of the parliament, and what will work in an election not due until 2029, quite futile. With perhaps one exception. It will still be true that agreeing withNigel Farageis a terrible method for beating him.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLocal electionsOpinionNigel FarageKeir StarmerKemi BadenochReform UKLabourConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

The article heralds the arrival of “a crop of conservative personalities … convincing young women of a gender-essentialist worldview”.What does such essentialism entail? The woman holding a sign reading “Make him a sandwich” is a strong clue. “Be thin, fertile and Republican” is the Guardian’s conclusion.Yes, the people whose values brought January 6, Ice raids and Trumponomics to an abandoned container port near you are heaving resources intoa cultural propaganda assaulton young womanhood.Now comes the ‘womanosphere’: the anti-feminist media telling women to be thin, fertile and RepublicanRead moreEvie magazine is one of the new fronts in the hard right’s endless culture war. As the Guardian article points out, it’s an old-school glossy magazine, offering makeover suggestions and lifestyle advice, but for women who find suffrage a burden. It’s less voting, more vibes as well as sex tips for women who are self-certified as virgins when they marry. Evie’s format recalls the glamour days of Cleo and Cosmopolitan, before those old magazines went full communist by saying such radical things as “nothing is worth dying of an eating disorder over” and society as we knew it collapsed.Evie is American, but the culturally coercive gender messaging it represents knows no borders. Australia may be less polarised in its gender politics than that other place, but recent research showsa small but notable conservative influence has grown among local young women.Evie itself reclaims the vintage appeal of the western woman’s magazine, which I remember fondly from my youth, offering the Photoshopped propaganda of self-hatred to girls compelled to compare their performance of femininity to unattainable external standards. A recent edition of Evie featured Ballerina Farm’s Hannah Neeleman as cover girl, modelling her unique brand of crispy blond locks and volunteer domestic servitude in neo-milkmaidian styling. The message here, girls, is clear: yes, if you marry the son of a billionaire, you too can have the life of a medieval peasant!Evie and Hannah are, of course, agents of a broader campaign. Conservative bandwaggoner Candace Owens is apparently rebranding her ubiquitous web presence in “orchid” tones, positioning herself as a more mainstream women’s lifestyle influencer and part-time Hollywood gossipist for those who want Blake Lively content that’s antisemitic adjacent. Seeking out cultural commentary from a woman so bereft of virtue she wasrefused entry to Australiaover her “capacity to incite discord” hardly accords to any traditional mission of “how to be good in a bad society”.The projects themselves may be coincidences, but there’s shared ideology to this. The American conservative legal activist and rightwing supreme court justice picker Leonard Leo spoke in 2024 of a need for Trumpism to “crush liberal dominance” in entertainment media; now America is here. Trump has appointed ageing rightwing crank Mel Gibson as a Hollywood “envoy”. His administration is shaking down news media, and money is flowing through his movement to any “content creator”, male or female (but certainly not in between), willing to sing its hymnal of gender binaries, illiberalism and dominant order.The genius of this movement’s true leader, Steve Bannon, was to recognise way back in his Breitbart days that “politics flows downstream from culture”. The “monster power” he identified in the online 4chan community was absolutely the place to normalise hate speech as political speech; Trump’s emotionally dysregulated performances made him a candidate so familiar to that community, his politics didn’t need to be explained to them for a cultural alliance to form.Australia’s gen Z men aren’t monsters in the making – they just feel short-changed | Intifar ChowdhuryRead moreThose still struggling to understand how so many Americans seemed to have voted against their direct economic advantage and liberty have not studied Bannon’s cultural calculations. Consider Trump’s history as an avatar of reality television’s “immorality is entertainment” flavour. His visibility at WWE and UFC events marks Trump not only as culturally allied to the fandom but positioned within it, so that his political behaviour on everything from immigration to trade policy can be viewed through the fandom’s men-punching-men cultural frame.Now consider Trump’s relationship to the Fox “infotainment” audience. The “who needs an expert when you’ve got me” podcast environment.Edgelord comedians. Cultural familiarity can act as shorthand that avoids getting bogged down in confusing policy information. We have a saying in the theatre that’s relevant here: “If you have to explain it, you’ve already lost the audience.” When you’re a low-information voter, “he likes what I like” becomes all the information required to vote your preference.The womanosphere is an attempt by this same movement to now colonise the enormous and powerful fandoms of makeup and clothes, crushes on boys and pop culture gossip.Will it work? Not if the young women who have beenheading in the liberal and opposite direction to the boyson the Jugend-train hold the line. The politics of boys insisting on women’s servitude and humiliation only tends to last until they decide they’d really prefer to get laid.It’s to head off this oncoming challenge that the womanosphere is being created and promoted. It’s standard authoritarian “for every soldier a wife” stuff.Girls, your future freedom and ours depends on your discernment, now.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsThe far rightOpinionFar rightWomen (Life and style)FeminismWomen (Society)MagazinescommentShareReuse this content"

In a context where Ukraine iscalling foran unconditional 30-day ceasefire, and the US a permanent one, Russia wants concessions before a lasting pause or permanent peace can even be discussed. Central to the Kremlin’s demands is theremoval of sanctions– especially thoserestricting its aviation sector.We must be cautious not to make concessions prematurely, under the guise of quick progress. The short pause offered would not make a meaningful difference to the war, and accepting it would enable a regime that has repeatedly shown intent to prolong its war of aggression and undermine this chance for a just, fair and lasting peace.Current measures restrict access to the western market for Russian airlines and block imports of critical spare parts, maintenance services and other equipment – including dual use goods that could be used for military applications. On the surface, Moscow’s demands for concessions look simple and easy to fulfil – the definition of a quick win for both sides.However, the apparent humanitarian and economic nature of Russia’s request masks the political and military advantage that any softening of aviation sanctions would hand the Russian president and his war machine. At present, these sanctions are testimony to how significantly and successfully the Kremlin’s military capabilities are being constrained.Sanctions on aviation serve as both a powerful symbol and a practical impediment to Russia. The lines between private and public sector in Russia’s war economy are blurred – especially for aviation. Airlines are not mere collateral victims of the sanctions regime but active participants in supporting Russia’s illegal invasion ofUkraine. Just like Russian propagandists who continue to freely travel to Europe and purchase real estate abroad with blood money, or chemical plants that evade restrictions on fertiliser exports while fuelling Russia’s war machine.It must be understood that Russia’s so-called civil aviation sector has become a front for transportation, logistics and smuggling on behalf of its military. Russia’s civil airlines and airports are actively involved in circumventing international sanctions by delivering critical components to sanctioned Russian industries. Cargo firms such as Volga-Dneprprovide transportation servicesfor military purposes. I Fly – a charter service –transports soldiersfor deployment to the frontline, the Ukraine Centre for National Resistance believes. Moscow’s Vnukovo airport, once a tourism hub, has been sanctioned by the EU for being used in support of the war on Ukraine. Pskov airport operates commercial flights and as abase for military transport aircraft.Additionally, normalising air links would lift a key restriction on Russians’ daily lives, relieving Moscow of any public pressure for peace. Viewing this as another Putin victory, they would rather increase their support for continuing the war instead of negotiating.These sanctions represent more than mere inconvenience: they are a direct obstacle to Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine and a visible reminder of the consequences of its aggression. Rather than unwinding them, we need to build on the success of the current sanctions regime. The airports and airlines that serve as dual-use facilities trafficking sanctioned goods must face consequences. Companies facilitating military logistics must remain blacklisted. Monitoring of supply chains needs to be strengthened to prevent the diversion of parts for military purposes.The fact that Russian officials have made lifting aviation sanctions a priority in diplomatic channels underscores their effectiveness. Policymakers should understand that this is proof the sanctions are working. Russia is growing desperate to save its aviation sector – relief in this area should be conditional on significant commitments by Moscow to peaceful and prosperous relations with Ukraine. Not bargained away.As long as Russiaremains committedto its unlawful aggression, the skies must remain closed to Russian carriers. Any action that weakens this stance will strengthen Russia’s capacity to procure sanctioned technology, bolster its military logistics and appease its population. Since Russia launched its unprovoked and illegal war of aggression, Ukrainian airspace has been crisscrossed by fighter jets and missiles, not civilian aircraft.

Could this be it for good?Martin BelamWed 30 Apr 2025 06.41 EDTShareThe Doctor has fought enemies like the Daleks and Cybermen all through time and space, but the Time Lord may now be facing their greatest threat: viewer apathy in a time of television industry upheaval, as rumours of cancellation and the departure of its leading actor swirl.Withthis year’s series of Doctor Whoapproaching its midpoint and seeing record low ratings, there is still no sign from the BBC or streaming partner Disney+ if the show has a future beyond May.Showrunner Russell T Davies has insisted that it was always the plan not to commission more episodes until after this season aired in full, but that stance contrasts with his promise of “annual Doctor Who, no gap years, lots of content, on and on and on”, made when he returned to the show in 2023. With nothing in production, it would already be a tight squeeze to have a series ready for the start of 2026.View image in fullscreenDone for? … Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor in Lux.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC Studios/Bad WolfDaviesrecently told viewersof BBC Newsround: “I kind of know that the Doctor’s reached the status of, like, Robin Hood. Sometimes there might be a pause, and during that pause, the viewers of Newsround now will grow up a few years and start writing stories and they’ll bring it back.”If Disney+ decides not to renew its distribution and funding deal, that would leave theBBCwith three choices: cast around for a new international streaming partner, go back to making the show in-house on a more constrained budget, or put it on hiatus.This year’s season has also been dogged by rumours of a premature exit for the show’s leading light, 32-year-old Ncuti Gatwa, whofirst appeared in the role in 2023. Afteran acclaimed runin The Importance of Being Earnest in the West End last year, Gatwa is to tread the boards again in 2025. He will star as playwright Christopher Marlowe opposite Edward Bluemel’s William Shakespeare inBorn With Teethat London’s Wyndham’s theatre from mid-August until 1 November. That doesn’t suggest the actor expects to be in the Tardis any time soon.Reports of belated reshoots to the current series in February this year have only added to the rumour mill. A Gatwa exit would mean he had appeared in only two series, fewer than any Doctor,with the exception of Christopher Eccleston.However, viewer apathy may be a bigger problem than money or casting. Nowadays, overnight ratings are far from the be-all and end-all, but the second episode of this year’s run,Lux, set the unwanted record of lowest overnight rating in the 62-year history of the show at 1.58m. Davies and BBC executives might be buoyed, though, that season openerThe Robot Revolutionwas still the second most viewed BBC show of the day, and gained a huge uplift via streaming, with nearly 75% of views online. Saturday’s episode,The Well, bounced back up to1.9m BBC One viewers. The BBC is confident it is still enough of a draw toscreen the series finale in UK cinemas.View image in fullscreenTheatre calling? … Ncuti Gatwa in The Importance of Being Earnest at the National Theatre.Photograph: Marc BrennerTaken overall, though, even with changes in viewing habits, those figures suggest the new iteration ofDoctor Who, made by Bad Wolf and part-funded by Disney+, has not halted a long-term trend of declining viewing figures.After the final episode of this Doctor Who season airs on 31 May, the only known remaining Whoniverse production isspin-off The War Between the Land and the Sea. Co-written by Pete McTighe and Russell T Davies and starring Russell Tovey andGugu Mbatha-Raw, the limited series is expected to air in autumn or winter. It runs the risk of being a spin-off from a show that is no longer being made.Doctor Who has survived interruptions and cancellations before. An attempt by BBC bosses to axe it in the mid-80s was converted into an 18-month hiatus. The show’s original run eventually came to an end in 1989, and perhaps history is in the process of repeating itself. Fans now regard some of those final Sylvester McCoy stories, such asRemembrance of the DaleksandThe Curse of Fenric, as some of the best of the entire series. But by then, few were watching and the writing was on the wall.Maybe, regardless of how good some of the Gatwa episodes have been –Boom,73 Yards, andDot and Bubbleremain likely to be well regarded by fans for decades – time is simply up forthisversion of Doctor Who inthistelevision landscape.Without a regular TV series between 1989 and 2005, creativity among fans flourished, with different strands of books,audio stories,comicsand webcasts featuring a multitude of different takes on what Doctor Who could be. Some dream of that freedom again, although it is likely the BBC would keep a tighter leash on its franchise IP than it did in the 90s.Whatever format Doctor Who might take in the future, as Davies has implied, it is unlikely we have heard the last of the Time Lord for ever. “Face-changing alien with a magic box that travels anywhere in time and space” will always remain an irresistible storytelling formula.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDoctor WhoFantasy TVNcuti GatwaRussell T DaviesBBCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the Grand National tour, a four-month stadium circuit for the Grammy-sweeping album GNX and SZA’s reissue album Lana, Lamar takes the music industry’s most bitter rivalry match into overtime.Beyoncé review – ever-evolving star kicks off electrifying Cowboy Carter tourRead moreThe score-keeping has not stopped. The Grand National tour’s opening date in Minneapolis last week totaled more than $9m from more than 47,000 spectators, giving Lamar claim to the highest-grossing hip-hop concert of all time – surpassing the record Eminem set after playing Melbourne, Australia, in 2019. That’s what you get when you pair the hottest rapper in the game with an R&B queen who is coming off the critical and commercial success of the buddy comedyOne of Them Days, SZA’s film acting debut.Tuesday’s date at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium was yet another cross-cultural moment that drew 45,000 spectators on the same night Pearl Jam was playing across the street at State Farm Arena – a traffic twofer reminiscent of the spring 2023 weekend when Janet Jackson and Taylor Swift helddueling midtown concerts.“Jesus is more important thanKendrick Lamaror Eddie Vedder,” one curbside evangelist shouted along the boulevard between the two show venues – but his message was lost on a crowd that was too busy adding to the city’s legendary gridlock.There was some sense that even Lamar knew to expect a few thousand late arrivals given how the show kicked off. After an opening DJ set by Mustard, the Marquis de Lafayette in Lamar’s rap war with Drake, the lights went back up for 30 minutes as the speakers blared quiet storm classics from Anita Baker and Luther Vandross – GNX album inspirations whostoked feud rumorsin their heyday. But the enthusiasm and marijuana smoke thickened again when Lamar rose up on to stage in his now-trademark black Buick GNX and set the tone for a multimedia cavalcade that was more of a gapers block than a groove.View image in fullscreenSZA performing on stage.Photograph: Cassidy MeyersWhile Lamar rapped the first few bars of wacced out murals from inside the car, a giant backdrop screen showed him inset from the inside against an animated graffiti that echoed the tributes that Lamar makes in the song. The car and the screen were critical storytelling vehicles for a concert where conflict is a prevailing theme. Even Lamar andSZAare stylistically at odds.Where he represents the cold and unforgiving concrete jungle (and Los Angeles more specifically), SZA is at home in nature among the caterpillars and praying mantises – which her dancers personified, Katy Perry-style, for SZA’s performance of Garden. For most of the three-hour show, the big-screen treats Lamar and SZA with extreme prejudice – flattening the color in Lamar’s flared slacks and red tee to black and white while accentuating all the hues for SZA’s lush set pieces.But early on in the show, the figurative wall between the two artists comes crumbling down on screen during SZA’s performance of The Weekend, revealing an orange-glowing wood – an unmissable nod to the recent LA wildfires. For her mid-show performance of Garden, SZA mounts a giant ant called Anthony while her dancers and backing orchestra are covered in vines and moss. The act crescendoes with her taking to the air in butterfly wings and a cocoon-shaped ballgown (that drops dramatically on to the stage floor) and “flying” into the twilight to Nobody Gets Me – her first time this year touring the song, about her ex-fiance. In an aside to the crowd, it wasn’t immediately clear whether it was her ex or her team that told her “to stop performing the song”. Either way, she didn’t “give a fuck. It’s about y’all.”But the conflict that ultimately wins out is the one between Lamar and Drake. At various points between act breaks, the big screen played snippets of Lamar sitting for a deposition – a direct shot at Drake’s recent efforts to respond to their ongoing rap beef through legal channels. Initially, an (off-screen) counsel asks Lamar if allusions to violence were just him “being metaphorical” or whether they should be taken as a threat. (“Take it how you want,” was Kdot’s response.) In another deposition scene, Lamar is asked if his disappearing acts between albums are “just another form of attention-seeking”, which is how Drake has framed his dynamic with Lamar. Even SZA gets in on the legal back-and-forth, pushing back when the off-camera lawyer mispronounces her name and accuses her of seeking out dysfunctional relationships for their creative potential.Not surprisingly, Lamar brings the house down with Not Like Us (before closing the show with Luther, his current chart-topper with SZA). And while the a-minorsingalong and other Drake callouts hit as hard as ever, it was a bit of a disappointment to see the crowd not connect with the song’s painstaking references toAtlanta. (Lamar dedicates a whole verse to the city’s history while exposing Drake as a culture vulture.) What’s more, Lamar’s political strokes struggled for urgency without Donald Trump and a worldwide Super Bowl audience to play against.While this show will no doubt go down as another victory for Lamar against the erstwhile biggest name in rap, it was still hard to come away from the night without thinking that Drake may have had a point when he suggested that Lamar’s oeuvre doesn’t easily convert to concert fare. Take Not Like Us and Be Humble off the 50-plus set list, and the “big numbers” – the ones that get the crowd holding their hearts and swaying and recalling those moments years later – are all SZA’s. In the end it takes two to take Drake down, but Lamar still gets the last shot.Explore more on these topicsKendrick LamarSZAHip-hopRapAtlantaR&Blive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

I sawKen Dodd showsback in the day where he broke up the tattifilarious nonsense with sentimental ballads and wartime songs. Can you imagine a 21st-century comic doing anything so uncool? Reader, you no longer have to – as one of the coolest comedians in the world wings his way to London with a show as much about the heartfeltchansonas the layers-of-ironic millennial bantz.The man in question is John Early, scene-stealing camp superstar of theHBO comedy-thriller Search Party, and sidekick to another whip-smart standup brain,Kate Berlant. Like Berlant – and likeCatherine Cohen, Bo Burnham or theUK’s own Leo Reich– Early’s work fashions the navel-gazing, always-online, identity-as-performance spiritual anomie of his generation into outrageous comedy. Or at least, he does in his screen work. Onstage, it’s a bit different, and includes straight-bat performances of pop/rock standards with the backing of six-piece band the Lemon Squares. “In the beginning,” he says, “I just felt, ‘wouldn’t this be groovier if I did this with a full band? Wouldn’t it be fun to do a Britney Spears song with a 70s-inflected arrangement?’”Back then, the songs were – like everything else – a part-ironic posture. “I would immediately find some jokey delivery to protect me through the song.” But things changed when Early recorded his first special last year.Now More than Everincludes a celebrated 16-minute routine lamenting the millennial generation’s wasted youth, spliced with a plangent performance of the Neil Young number After the Gold Rush. “That was a choice I made that changed my life,” says Early now, chatty and self-deprecating over a transatlantic Zoom. “I always used to trust the audience to find the humanity underneath the irony. But people didn’t often see that part of it, for some reason. Maybe today you can’t trust them to, because we live in such an antisocial time, and people are so ‘mallet to the brain’ by the internet.”“So with After the Gold Rush, for the first time ever, I fully just spoon-fed it. It was ‘this is me baring my soul’.”View image in fullscreenWhip-smart duo … John Early with his frequent collaborator Kate Berlant in 2017.Photograph: Ben Gabbe/Getty ImagesIt was the songs wot done it – so much so that Early subsequently released the show as an album. “It’s actually a very old cultural instinct, funny people doing sincere covers. Those are my heroes: the Bette Midlers, the Sandra Bernhards.” In the olden days, comedians performed sincere songs because the art form itself couldn’t handle sincerity. That changed as comedy matured – but changed back again, Early argues, with millennials, so lost in irony’s hall of mirrors, they must turn again to song to help free themselves. “I am part of a generation of people that are like stuck together, a bunch of internet phrases that have been Frankensteined together. Singing takes you out of this poisonous, ironic-banter internet speak and lets you sit in time for three or four minutes, being wistful or sincere.”One might marvel that a lifelong satirist of millennial self-fashioning should himself feel trapped by it. But that’s not all Early had to contend with. A self-described “good Presbyterian boy”, the son of church folk in Nashville, Tennessee, Early ascribes much of his work – ie portraying himself as “a narcissistic monster” – to that background. “I always thought there was something gross about portraying yourself in a flattering light,” he says, and so developed an oeuvre – his role as Elliott in Search Party prominent within it – that accentuated his “psychotic, anxious, socially oppressive” tendencies. Away from the cameras, meanwhile, he delivered standup that felt like “a safe way for me to actually be myself, to use the parts of me that are good at bringing people in and making them comfortable.”For years, he resisted broadcasting that live work, because “I felt very allergic to putting a camera on that.” With Now More than Ever, he finally did so – and it came as a cathartic release. “Because you can only take the monster for so long. It gets a little grating after 10 years of that.”All of which explains why London audiences are getting a rare glimpse of Early’s live work this spring. “Doing these shows has been very meaningful to me,” says the 37-year-old. “I get schmaltzy on tour, I really love doing it. And as the [US] tour was ending I was like ‘we have to keep going! It can’t be over!’ So we booked these London shows.” Content-wise, “I don’t want to promise anything too coherent,” he says, but it’ll be “my usual bloated, sweaty, wild show,” with guest appearances from his YouTube and Netflix “southern Christian mom alter egoVicky with a V. She will do – I was going to say a surprise set, but I’ve just given it away.” For comedy fans, it’s a must-see – and perhaps, after all these years of Early hiding between inverted commas, worth a look for sincerity fans, too.John Early: The Album Touris at Soho theatre Walthamstow, London, 28-29 MayExplore more on these topicsComedyTV comedyTelevisionSoho theatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Could it still thrill me 19 years later?When Bethesda surprise-released a remake last week, I revisited its world with my son to see if the magic was still thereKeza MacDonaldWed 30 Apr 2025 10.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 30 Apr 2025 10.02 EDTShareFor a 10-day period the summer of 2006, in between handing in my resignation at my first job on a games magazine and returning to Scotland to start university, I did almost nothing except eat, sleep and playThe Elder ScrollsIV: Oblivion on my Xbox 360. I hauled my TV from the living room of my small, unpleasantly warm flatshare into my bedroom so I could play uninterrupted; it was all I could think about. My character was a Khajiit thief, a kind of manky lion in black-leather armour with excellent pickpocketing skills. One afternoon, I decided to see whether I could steal every single object in the smallish town of Bravil, and got caught by the guards a couple of hours in. I did a runner, dropping a trail of random plates, cheese wheels and doublets in my wake, and the guards pursued me all the way to the other side of the map, where they finally got entangled with a bear who helpfully killed them for me.I bet a lot of you will have had a similar experience with a Bethesda game – if not Oblivion, then Skyrim or perhaps Fallout 3. There’s something intoxicating about these role-playing games, the way they lay out their worlds for you like a buffet, inviting you to gorge. Go where you like! Learn some weird spells and try them out on bandits! Nip into a cave to fight a necromancer and end up getting ambushed by vampires! Open-world games such as this are exhaustingly common now but Oblivion was the first one I ever played. Lately I’ve been devouring it all again, after Bethesda surprise-released a remake last Friday.I say it was a surprise. In fact, the Oblivion remake/remaster has been one of the games industry’s worst-kept secrets for months, just behind the Switch 2. Nonetheless, I am thrilled about it. Oblivion has, over two decades, become at least as famous for its technical weirdness and amusing glitches as for its pioneering design, and I was relieved to find Bethesda has not tried very hard to fix it. Characters still get stuck in walls, repeating their asinine lines of dialogue. The facial animations are still off. The game crashed on me two minutes into Patrick Stewart’s opening lines as the soon-to-be-murdered emperor of Cyrodiil, and I have twice fallen through the world into the endless void beneath. Weird stuff happens all the time, and it’s rarely intentional. They’ve even preserved aninfamous voice-acting blooper. It is a perfect time capsule of 00s accidental gaming comedy, and I wouldn’t change it for the world.View image in fullscreenA game of choice with no consequence … The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.Photograph: Bethesda Game StudiosI remembered Cyrodiil as enormous and picturesque, full of gently glowing magical ruins and rivers that caught the light in just the right way. By 2025 standards, though, it is weeny, perhaps the size of the opening section of any current game’s gigantic map. (I’m thinking particularly of Avowed, therecent Elder Scrolls-alikefrom fellow Microsoft studio Obsidian.) The imposing-looking Imperial City at the centre is a village of tiny interconnected districts with around 30 people in it. I don’t know how I managed to spend more than 100 hours in such a relatively small space as a teenager, but as I rode around last weekend I found, unexpectedly, that I still knew it intimately. I’d meet a new character and remember details of some quest I hadn’t thought about for years, or ride around a corner on my armoured horse and know exactly where I was from the view.In Oblivion, your character develops according to what you do with them. You don’t meaningfully have to choose between magic, stealth and strength; pick up a greatsword and start using it and your heavy-weapons stat will start increasing. (The trick back in the day was to crouch into a sneak position, use a rubber band to pull the controller’s analogue sticks together, and spin around in circles until your stealth stat hit maximum.) This is part of what makes it feel like a buffet: you can become a master thief, run the mages’ guildandbe a combat arena champion all at once. It is a game of choice with no consequence, beguilingly frictionless and generous. A small world that revolves entirely around you.I have a theory that the Bethesda RPG spell only really works once. You get one life-consuming experience with an Elder Scrolls, and then whatever you play next feels like a repeat; I played Skyrim and Fallout 3 for ages but never finished either. It turns out Oblivion is stillmygame; I can lose myself in it for hours where newer, more sophisticated open-world games start to get on my nerves. I still hate the Oblivion Gates, portals to a generic hellscape where you have to spend a tedious 20 minutes fighting demons in towers with flaming corpses hanging from the ceilings; their vibe is very 00s metal album art. But the beauty of a game like this is that you can effectively ignore the entire plot and fool around as you please.The Oblivion remaster illustrates that old games don’t always need fixing. It looks different, but it’s got the same soul. I imagine my teenage self would say the same about me.What to playView image in fullscreenOne of the best puzzle games I’ve ever played … Blue Prince.Photograph: Dogubomb/Raw FuryIf you haven’t yet playedBlue Prince, stop whatever you’re doing anddownload it now. You are the teenage heir to a giant mansion, with one catch: if you want to keep it, you must find its secret 46th room. Also, every time you go to sleep, the mansion resets, so your route through it will be different every day, drafting each room from a random selection of blueprints, occasionally finding a chamber you’ve never seen before.I spent 40 hours playing through this with my eldest son, who acted asnote-taker, and it is up there with the best puzzle games I’ve ever played. Even after you’ve found Room 46, there are deeper mysteries to probe at; a couple of people I know have truly gone off the deep end with it.

I thought the interactive medium reallyenhanced its emotions and themes. Can its story still have the same impact in a passive medium? On that note, what great video game narratives do you think absolutely cannot be adapted into a movieor a TV series?”I have just watched the third episode of the second season ofThe Last of Us, and it’s clear that they’re diverging more from the game’s plot this time than they did in season one. They kind of had to, because as you point out, the game’s impact largely comes down to playing it from both points of view, which won’t necessarily work on TV. That said, the first game also owed a lot of its emotional heft to the fact that you, Joel, were the one doing terrible things, whether you as a player agreed with him or not. The TV series couldn’t pull those same levers, so it expanded The Last of Us by showing new perspectives, going into deeper detail on things that wouldn’t have been practical or fun to play through; I’m thinking particularly of that wonderful episode about Bill and Frank, which would never have worked in a game. This is the art of the adaptation: finding something fresh to offer.On that basis: there is no great video game narrative thatcouldn’tbe adapted for film or TV by a sufficiently talented and understanding writer. The key word there is adapted, not transliterated – because a film or show has to offer a new interpretation or perspective. That said, there are plenty of games whose plots are simply toobadto ever make for a good TV show or film. It’d take a true visionary to get anything worth watching out of, say, Heavy Rain.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterRole playing gamesThe Elder ScrollsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The latter was a 2023 gameshow hosted by Danny Dyer, notable for being forgettably bad. The former is a 2025 reality show hosted byAmanda Holden, notable for being the single worst thing that has ever been created in the history of humankind.You might think this is an exaggeration, but that’s only because you haven’t just watched four episodes of Cheat: Unfinished Business in a row, and haven’t found yourself involuntarily clawing at your eyes in a doomed bid to injure any part of your brain that might remember watching it. I have. Quite frankly it’s a wonder I can still type.Best described as a mutant cross between Jeremy Kyle and Love Island, Cheat: Unfinished Business is a reality show where eight former couples, whose relationship ended after real or perceived infidelity, are taken to stay in a luxury villa and either a) reconcile, b) fight or c) get off with each other behind their exes’ backs. In other words, it’s exactly as grim as it sounds.Holden has two roles here, depending on what time of day it is. If it’s light outside, her job is to pull a concerned face and nod whenever any of the contestants say anything emotionally vulnerable. If it’s night, she shines her legs to a high reflective sheen, puts on a see-through dress and struts backwards and forwards in slow motion while making an expression as if she were holding in a potentially catastrophic bout of gastroenteritis.Slightly more useful is Paul C Brunson, the show’s relationship coach. As an expert in his field, Brunson is able to offer genuine insight into the behaviour of the contestants, and tools to help them fix it. And though the filming traps him in a perpetual doom-loop of TikTok glow-up filters, he may be the best thing about the show.View image in fullscreenNot yet ready to move on … contestants on Cheat: Unfinished Business.Photograph: NetflixThe point of Cheat: Unfinished Business (the colon and subtitle hinting at a wider Cheat Cinematic Universe floating about in the ether like some awful televisual night hag) depends on who you are. If you’re one of the contestants, then you ostensibly signed up to work through your relationship problems, even though you haven’t seen your former partner for months – or, in one case, years – and realistically should have started to move on by now. Also, you might be there because you are gripped by the bizarre desire to dig through the darkest and most personal moments of your life on a globally streaming television series rather than behind closed doors like a normal person, which suggests that you are at best insincere and at worst freakishly fame-hungry. At this point, it’s worth noting that some of the people here are from Love Island, so there’s a risk that they might shrivel up like a salted slug if people stop paying them attention.On the other hand, if you’re one of the producers of the show, the point is clearly to create something emotionally manipulative enough to rival the viral clip from the Spanish reality showLa Isla de las Tentaciones, in which a man named Montoya ripped his shirt open and howled at the sky after watching live footage of his girlfriend having sex during a thunderstorm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the basis of the first four episodes, there is a comprehensive absence of drama here. Maybe a bit of sobbing. Maybe the sort of hushed “Leave him, he’s not worth it!” talk you hear outside pub toilets at half 10 on a Friday night. But that’s it. Entire episodes pass without a single thing happening. For something so desperate to be exploitative, it’s all unforgivably boring.So, one star or zero stars? I’ve landed on the former because it isn’t entirely without merit – as far as I can tell, the cameras were all pointing the right way – but mainly because a zero-star rating suggests that this will be an entertainingly bad hate-watch. There is nothing entertaining to be found here. Don’t waste your time.Cheat: Unfinished Business is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionReality TVAmanda HoldenreviewsShareReuse this content"

Newcomers are typically better placed than natives when it comes to deciphering unwritten social codes. Unencumbered by textbook propaganda and excessive knowledge, the stranger’s-eye view very often has the merit of freshness, even originality. Bertolt Brecht dubbed this theVerfremdungseffekt, or alienation effect, from which Owen Hatherley takes his title.The Alienation Effect is a collective biography of the central Europeans who washed up on British shores between the wars. In the decades that followed, Hatherley argues, they exerted a colossal influence on British cultural life. Sometimes the influence manifested itself transparently, as when Thatcher whipped out a copy of Hayek’s The Constitution of Libertyfrom her handbag and said to her party colleagues: “This is what we believe!” At others, it hid in plain sight, as in the iconic moquette used for London Transport, designed by the Czech Jacqueline Groag, or in films such as Get Carter, where brutalist Newcastle deserves joint billing with Michael Caine; it is through the Viennese lens of the cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky that we see this unforgiving landscape.They didn’t exactly get a warm welcome. Nearly a third of the 100,000 refugees from fascism were interned on the Isle of Man as “enemy aliens” in 1940. Many more of these supposed Nazis were briefly deported to Australia and Canada, where they surprised their wardens with kosher food requests.So why, then, did they elect to stay in England? It was a peaceable, conservative society that had “somehow sat out the 20th century”, Hatherley says. It appealed to the likes of Arthur Koestler. Here was a land “bored by ideologies, sceptical about utopias … enamoured of its leisurely muddle, incurious about the future, devoted to its past”. Even British communism was a tame affair; Communist Party of Great Britain meetings “were like tea parties in the vicarage”. As a fairly recent migrant, it’s a picture I instantly recognise: a land that sets great store by ancient universities, members’ clubs and quaint cathedrals – a land where even a Crosland-like Corbyn was presented as Stalin reincarnate.They didn’t exactly get a warm welcome. Nearly a third of the 100,000 refugees from fascism were interned on the Isle of ManSuch migration, the Marxist historian Perry Anderson argued, paradoxically made Britain more parochial, not less. The Hayeks and Koestlers, Namiers and Poppers, did not so much challenge as vindicate insular received wisdoms. Hatherley, who describes himself as a “sentimental English socialist”, offers a gentle critique here. Where Anderson focused on the intelligentsia, Hatherley looks instead at architecture, publishing and film, where radicals dominated the landscape. His conclusion is that the net effect of central European migration was “largely positive”.The adverb there does some heavy lifting since many figures come in for rough treatment as exhibits of the wrong kind of migrant. The Hamburg-born photojournalist Bill Brandt, for instance, is condemned to Hatherley’s sixth circle of hell for his “extreme Anglophilia”: “One can make out a sickly sexuality, a class-climbing obsession with upper-class women in some of the more ornate nudes.” The popular art historian Ernst Gombrich, meanwhile, stands accused of neglecting social history for the reassuring empiricism of “Oxbridge English culture”.Hatherley’s heroes are the Jewish architects Berthold Lubetkin and Ernő Goldfinger, both unabashed Marxist modernists, the latter of whom was famously turned into a gold-loving Bond villain. Perhaps John le Carré was on the money when he said that there was “something neo-fascistic” about Ian Fleming’s taciturn spy.The radicalism of the émigrés, Hatherley convincingly shows, has been concealed by the manipulations of national memory. Take Pevsner. These days he’s remembered solely as a stone-fancier and building-cataloguer rather than a tireless champion of the pioneers of modern design. What’s more, he didn’t uncritically suck up to the Anglos. There’s a touch of Teutonic energy, the spirit of the art historian Aby Warburg, in the grand, 48-volume series he edited, the Pelican History of Art.Warburg’s credo wasKulturwissenschaft, a scientific approach to cultural studies that turned on connections and juxtapositions. Hatherley is a worthy heir to that tradition, and he has a canny eye for lineages. His potted genealogies are dazzling performances in concision, effortlessly gliding from the new brutalism of his home patch of Camberwell, London, through the works of art historian Rudolf Wittkower to the 15th-century Renaissance humanist Leon Battista Alberti – all in a single page.To be sure, Hatherley might tell you more than you might care to know about every inch of Hampstead. But these perambulations still yield some lively vignettes. We meet the artist Marie­-Louise von Motesiczky, doyenne of the north London enclave, who painted a voluptuous naked woman on a small boat crossing the Channel to escape Hitler. Solemn critics took the precious piece of cargo she is clutching in the painting to be a Torah scroll – before she revealed that it was in fact a large Austrian wurst.The Alienation Effect: How Central European Émigrés Transformed the British Twentieth Century by Owen Hatherley is published by Allen Lane (£35).

The books are among the most popular children’s titles in the world, with The Gruffalo having sold 3.2m copies to date, and The Gruffalo’s Child 2.1m copies.The new story “sees the return of much-loved characters in a fresh and exciting adventure that has all the hallmarks of a Julia Donaldson andAxel Schefflerclassic,” according to the book’s publisher Macmillan.“It’s always a challenge to write a sequel,” Donaldson said. “I actually had the basic idea for the story a long time ago, but couldn’t think how to develop it.”It was only when the charity National Literacy Trust (NLT) used the first two books as part of one of its campaigns last year that the writer was “spurred on to get my idea out of the cupboard and see once and for all if I could turn it into a really satisfying story,” she said. “To my surprise, I managed to do just that! I was of course delighted when Axel came on board, and am even more so now that I’ve seen the brilliant sketches he’s already done for the new book.”How Julia Donaldson conquered the world, one rhyme at a timeRead moreScheffler said: “Never say never – a lesson learned for me who, whenever asked, denied the possibility of another visit to the deep dark wood. Till one day out of the blue there came a wonderfully clever and inspired new text by Julia. How does she do this? Could I decline? Of course not!”The German illustrator and British writer’s first collaboration was a picture book about an unhappy elderly lady who brings a group of farmyard animals into her small home, A Squash and a Squeeze, published in 1993. Since then, Scheffler and Donaldson have published more than 30 books together, the most famous being the Gruffalo titles.The original Gruffalo story is written in rhyming couplets and follows a mouse walking through a wood where he comes across a number of predators before finally meeting the large and terrifying Gruffalo. It was inspired by a Chinese folk tale called The Fox that Borrows the Terror of a Tiger, about a child who cons a jungle tiger into submission.“I intended the book to be about a tiger, but I just couldn’t get anything to rhyme with ‘tiger’,” Donaldsontold the Observer in 2004. “But then I came up with ‘Silly old fox, doesn’t he know / there’s no such thing as a blank-blank-oh.’ Then I began with ‘Grrrr’, which I hoped would sound quite scary. Then all I needed was a word of three syllables, ending in ‘oh’. Somehow, ‘Gruffalo’ came to mind.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In a climate where the cost and risk of making UK-specific dramas that have limited international appeal is becoming increasingly challenging, this special award champions ITV’s brave commission and honours the social and public impact television can have.“As Mr Bates vs the Post Office has proved, audiences want and need to hear these important British stories.”The show centres on former post office operator Alan Bates, charting his sacking by the Post Office, his formation of the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance, and his campaigning for victims of the Post Office scandal.Polly Hill, ITV’s director of drama, said:“Commissioning Mr Bates was without doubt the proudest moment of my career and has shown us the power a story can have on the nation.“Everyone involved in the drama wanted their story to be heard and we are glad the drama did that, but justice won’t be done until they are all paid what they are owed. In this moment though, we will enjoy the recognition for ITV and remember the power drama can have.”The Bafta television special award will be presented to ITV’s managing director, Kevin Lygo and Hill during the 2025 Bafta television awards on Sunday 11 May at the Royal Festival Hall in London.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBaftasAwards and prizesITVPost Office Horizon scandalnewsShareReuse this content"

My therapist said something years ago that has been a gamechanger, ‘no one can make you believe something about yourself that you don’t already believe about yourself’ and if I ever do have any feelings about it then it’s an opportunity to investigate the feeling underneath it. When the ‘online’ world tries to make me a human piñata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed.”She added: “I’m not perfect, and I actually have omitted that word from my vocabulary, I’m on a human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall but … I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level unlocks.”Perry is currently on her Lifetimes tour, which began in Mexico on 23 April. Short clips from the tour have been mocked in some quarters online, for the choreography and staging.Perry was also castigated – arguably more than anyone else – for taking part in Blue Origin’s flight on 14 April, along with an all-female crew including TV presenter Gayle King and Bezos’s fiancee Lauren Sanchez. AGuardian op-eddescribed the flight as “the utter defeat of American feminism … indulgent and morally hollow”. Celebrities including Joe Rogan and Emily Ratajkowski criticised it, with actor Olivia Munn saying: “There are so many other things that are so important in the world right now.”Lily Allen was another of the critics, though this week she apologised to Perry. “There was actually no need for me to bring her name into it, and it was my own internalised misogyny,” she said on her podcast Miss Me. “It was just completely unnecessary to pile on with her. I mean, I disagree with what it was that they did, but she wasn’t the only person that did it.”Perry’s most recent album 143 underperformed, with none of its singles reaching the UK Top 40.The US leg of the Lifetimes tour begins on 7 May in Houston, followed by stints in Australia, Canada and countries across South America. A European tour begins on 7 October in Glasgow.Explore more on these topicsKaty PerryPop and rockBlue OriginnewsShareReuse this content"

This year is the 50th anniversary, but how do you follow that? For the Carduccis, the answer was to look outwards: programming theShostakovichquartets they’ve played so often across five concerts alongside works by the Russian composer’s students and sharing their platform with newer, up-and-coming groups.The Carduccis opened this penultimate concert with Shostakovich’s String Quartet No 4, which runs from spare, plaintive folksiness to full-throttle pseudo-klezmer. The former showcased the Carduccis’ exquisitely blended tone. The latter, the drama that can be generated from rustic pizzicatos, the hard catch of bow hair on string, the intensity of a cello melody eked out of a stratospheric thumb position. But there was also a hint of business as usual – the first violin always dominant, energy always injected by the cello, the overall sound always mellow.No such danger with theElmore Quartet, which played Shostakovich’s String Quartet No 13 with the ferocity of musicians determined to make an impact. Vibrato was banished; the vibrant array of tone colours came from bow control alone. The results were sometimes unearthly, sometimes brutal – the first violin’s interjections at one point picked off the string in nasty little wedges and Shostakovich’s wooden knocks (bow against instrument) terrifying. The audience fell absolutely silent.After the interval, the Elmores returned withElena Firsova’s String Quartet No 4 “Amoroso”, with the composer present. The violins fired pizzicatos like gunshots and contrapuntal lines were served searing. But there were also moments of sudden beauty, poised amid the tumult.No Shostakovich quartet is better known than his Eighth, played here in Rudolf Barshai’s chamber arrangement by the Carducci,Kyanand Oculus quartets plus two of the Elmores and double bassistChris West. Such a lineup created a strange, occasionally scrappy blend: quartets, after all, fashion their own distinct sound and don’t easily merge into an ad hoc string orchestra. But this remained gripping in parts, its stabbed chords grizzly, its repeated theme nightmarish, the double bass casting shadow across the texture like a bruise.The Carducci festival at Highnam, Gloucestershire, is on 16-18 MayExplore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its rhythmic repetition, unceasing momentum and layering of phrases provides a useful framework for movement, as inLucinda Childs’ Danceset to Philip Glass andAnne Teresa de Keersmaeker’s Fase, to Steve Reich. Now German choreographer Sasha Waltz tackles Terry Riley’s seminal 1964 piece In C.Riley had an interest in psychedelia and altering consciousness (it was the 60s after all) and this is music that can lead you to zone in or zone out, lose track of time or be vividly aware of every quaver. It’s built on 53 cells, like riffs, repeated as many times as the players choose, on any combination of instruments. Here they are played admirably by the London Sinfonietta as part of the Southbank’s cross-disciplinaryMultitudes festival.View image in fullscreenStructuring community … Sasha Waltz, In C.Photograph: Pete WoodheadIn fact, the whole thing feels admirable. Waltz’s choreography, created in 2021, is a movement score with its own 53 figures and set of rules, a structured improvisation that has been performed in numerous permutations with professional and amateur dancers since its inception. Waltz intended her In C as an exercise in structuring communities, thinking about democracy, having agency within a group.Waltz’s company of dancers are a delightfully diverse collection of bodies and ages and striking movers. You can see the atoms of the dance – a shoulder shrug, a head turn, a simple lunge and sweep of the arm – which build to make the work. Motifs emerge, fade or morph, as in the music, while groups form and disperse, dancers peeling off in new directions. It’s a huge feat of stamina, for players and dancers alike.At first the body is open, the angles wide, the energy bright but easy. As the hour progresses, the palette expands. The result can feel purposeful or aimless; brief moments of unison are energising. It never feels less than controlled but as time goes on the world seems to deliberately fray: bodies lie down, spill off the stage, smiles are cracked – there’s a beautiful moment when dancer Jaan Männima comes face to face with another performer, suddenly moving in sync, and their face breaks into a spontaneous smile (of elation, relief, solidarity?) In a second you see the humanity not the algorithm, the community in action and the work come alive.AtQueen Elizabeth Hall, London, until 30 AprilExplore more on these topicsDanceTerry RileyreviewsShareReuse this content"

From PC classicSystem Shockto the DickensianDishonored 2, these system-heavy sandboxes are video gaming’s equivalent to avant garde electronica or the films of Darren Aronofsky, adored by critics and genreheads but largely baffling to everyone else. Much like those elitist fandoms, the im-sim’s loudest cheerleaders often look down on linear blockbusters with similar sneer. No, Assassin’s Creed player, you cannot sit with us.While massive games such as Tears of the Kingdom have recently flirted with elements of the genre, there’s still a surprising lack of breezier, beginner-friendly immersive sims. EnterBlendo Games’ Skin Deep– an attempt to cosy-fi the genre. Doing away with the sour-faced sci-fi of Deus Ex, Skin Deep sends you hurtling into space with a premise ripped straight out of a noughties web comic. You play Nina Pasadena, an insurance commando sworn to rescue feline fleets from raiding pirates. As you answer each well-insured tabby’s urgent distress call, Nina quietly sneaks across the raided ship, using whatever tools she can cobble together to rescue her kitty clientele.View image in fullscreenStalk your prey with whatever comes to hand: a book and a lighter? … Skin Deep.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveThe story is incredibly silly – more on that later – but Skin Deep’s cacophony of colliding systems deserves to be taken seriously. As I stalk my prey with a book and a lighter, I quietly release a cloud of hand sanitiser before bashing his head in with a hefty novel. Before he can draw his gun, I leap backwards, chucking my flickering lighter into the cloud of sanitiser, engulfing the poor pirate in an explosion of glistening flames. It’s this gleefully slapstick approach that sees Skin Deep at its best – a playground that embraces the absurdity of its simulation with a Cheshire’s grin.It’s not all design by worship and tribute, however, with Blendo introducing some fun gameplay twists of its own. Pirates can respawn after being taken out, detachable floating “skull savers” attached to their heads hovering desperately back to their lifeless bodies. Nina must swiftly dispose of each screaming head before they can seek revenge. From shattering ship windows and sending a skull hurtling into outer space, to flushing screaming heads down a toilet, finding new ways to bin each bonce adds a welcome layer of variety. The duplicating “duper gun” is another fun innovation, allowing players to sneak up to unsuspecting guards and instantly copy whatever items they hold – from weapons to those crucial cat-freeing keys.View image in fullscreenA cartoony playground … Skin Deep.Photograph: Annapurna InteractiveEach fully mapped ship exterior also allows you to leap out of the airlock and scale the outside of the ship, surveying the vessel for sneaky new entry points. In one mission, I come crashing through the ship’s external window. As I land on the bridge feet first, I pull a bloodied glass shard from my foot and fling it straight into a pirate’s face, leaving me grinning like a cat-loving John McClane.BlendoGamesunderstands that the best immersive sims are inherently cartoony playgrounds, sandboxes where every item is a tool for maleficence. From chucking pepper at a guard and making them sneeze so hard they pass out, to riding a pirate’s back and charging them straight into a wall, you certainly couldn’t accuse Skin Deep of taking itself too seriously.Unfortunately, I started to wish that the writers took it all more seriously. As freed cuboid cats leap from their rectangular cages with a sparkle and an enthusiastic MEOWW, and I reply to paw-penned emails asking me to find quirky VHS tapes, it dawns on me that I’m playing Deus Ex for Disney adults. While Skin Deep’s gags may well be catnip for the right player, the never-ending feline puns and overly-zany tone had me cringing, eliciting more grimaces than guffaws.If the cat-filled concept wasn’t millennially coded enough, Skin Deep is made using Doom 3’s 2004 id tech engine. Swapping thePCclassic’s dimly-lit corridors for brightly coloured environments, it’s a knowingly nerdy-nod to the hardcore. While a cool idea on paper, in practice the archaic aesthetic falls short of the intended retro cool chic, instead looking disappointingly primitive.Still, if beauty is only Skin Deep, for £15, this is a colourful, breezy introduction to an infamously inaccessible genre. The end result is an enjoyable, if muddled game, a deceptively deep immersive sim that may be too silly for genre fans and too low-poly to entice newcomers. This isn’t the genre’s breakout hit then – a slapstick immersive sim using Doom 3’s engine was likely always destined to be niche – but if you can stomach Skin Deep’s saccharine silliness, there’s 10 hours of futuristic feline fun batting its paw in your direction.Skin Deep is out now, £15Explore more on these topicsGamesPCSimulation gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

In Brassed Off (1996), escape came in the form of communal music; in The Full Monty (1997), it was male striptease; and in Billy Elliot (2000), the romance of ballet.Setting the template for all these wasRestless Natives(1985), a cult Scottish favourite in which two Edinburgh dreamers turn highway robbers and, in the gentlest possible way, take to holding up coachloads of American tourists while disguised as a wolfman and clown.Written by Ninian Dunnett, the whimsical comedy reflected on how a small nation could assert itself at a time of high unemployment, diminishing global significance and a tourist industry hungry for cliche. The land of William Wallace, Rob Roy and Robert the Bruce was no longer a country for heroes. With self-deprecating humour, the film imagines that role being taken on by two bumbling lads from a joke shop. The majestic music ofBig Country, with Stuart Adamson’s yearning vocals and bagpipe-like guitar lines, was an ironic counterpoint to their amateurish scheme.The Big Country connection seems to have inspired Dunnett, working with the film’s director Michael Hoffman, to bring Restless Natives to the stage as a musical. The band’s songs, such as Come Up Screaming, I Walk the Hill and Ships, now sit alongside new musical-theatre numbers by Tim Sutton, most rather different in style. They range from It’s Good to Be Bad, a bar-room knees up that could have been in Oliver!, to I Am the Wolf, a dark music-box lullaby that might have worked in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.They are sung brightly by a lively cast led by Kyle Gardiner as Ronnie, Finlay McKillop as Will and Kirsty MacLaren as Margot, Will’s Beauty and the Beast love interest.But Restless Natives is not a story of high passions and grand dramatic moments. Little calls out for song. The pleasure is in its undulations and quiet observation. However briskly arranged, the songs – and there are many – only slow down the narrative. Extending the film’s 90 minutes by nearly an hour, the production drains the comic momentum and labours a delicate idea.AtPerth theatreuntil 10 May.

This description comes from Keiko, the 36-year-old narrator ofConvenience Store Woman. Keiko’s conformist family and friends can’t believe she can be happy being single and working a dead-end job at a convenience store. Keiko finds an unexpected way to make it look as though she is normal: she keeps a man in her bathtub, hoping that everyone will simply assume they are a couple. A similar idea appears in Murata’s short story Poochie, from the collection Life Ceremony. A young girl takes a friend to a shed in the mountains to meet her pet; the friend is surprised to discover that the pet is a middle-aged man. Murata is interested in the lengths humans will go to in order to domesticate one another. Something in that has touched a nerve – Convenience Store Woman became a surprise bestseller.Vanishing World, Murata’s latest novel to be translated into English, is set in a speculative Tokyo where artificial insemination is ubiquitous and sex is considered “unhygienic”. The narrator, Amane, grows up with a mother who is still attached to the vanishing world of sex within marriage. Although Amane considers it a shameful secret that she was conceived via intercourse, as an adolescent she experiments beyond the passionately imagined relationships with anime characters that are more typical among her friends. Her first experience is disappointing: her friend Mizuuchi has trouble finding “the mysterious cavity” where he can insert his penis. By the time she gets married, Amane has come round to the view that marital sex is “incest”. When her husband initiates a kiss, she vomits into his mouth and reports him to the police.Murata's writing is compulsive, and she has an uncanny gift for intimate observations that get under the skinAmane marries a second time to a more suitable man. She compares him to “a beloved pet”, and they both like stews. They would have a comfortable domestic life together, if it weren’t the norm to have chaste romantic relationships outside marriage. Amane, still holding on to her mother’s way of doing things, tries once again to teach one of her lovers how to have physical sex. “By trial and error,” she says, “we stimulated our sexual organs, and eventually some liquid came out of Mizuto.” Mizuto tries his best, but never finds pleasure in the “ritual”.In Murata’s fiction, ordinary activities – drinking tea, wearing clothes, making love – seem very strange. Reading Vanishing World, I felt the profound oddness of the heterosexual family unit, with its legal, sexual and child-rearing rituals. Dissatisfied with their domestic arrangement, Amane and her husband are seduced by the promise of the “Paradise-Eden System” set up in a place called “Experiment City”, where sex does not exist, both men and women are artificially inseminated, and parenthood is a collective responsibility. But the reality of Paradise-Eden freaks Amane out. She is unsettled by the identical outfits, haircuts and smiles of the children raised in the Centre, doted on “as though they were pets”.Murata dispenses with conventional world-building and incidental detail, focusing on the points where character and society come into conflict. Her writing is compulsive, and she has an uncanny gift for intimate observations that get under the skin. It doesn’t matter that I can’t tell you how Experiment City looks and feels; I won’t forget the description of Amane’s husband’s pregnant belly as a distended “testicle” with the outline of a baby inside. At the same time, there is something strangely reassuring about the way this fiction boils down the bewilderingly complex prohibitions and obligations of ordinary social life to clear choices between resistance and assimilation.Vanishing World narrates the creep of a new worldview – that all sex is wrong, unclean, and masturbation the only appropriate way of relieving unwanted urges – radiating out from the scientific and social experiments of Experiment City. As its grip on Amane tightens, her relationship with her stubbornly old-fashioned mother deteriorates. The final stages of the plot rehearse a scenario familiar from Murata’s previous books, in which one character takes the urge to control the behaviour of others to its logical extreme. This recycling is evidence, I think, of the strength and singularity of the author’s vision. It’s also a reminder of how quickly even the strangest ideas can become convention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A joint of meat is a magnificent offering, but it can sometimes be hard to carve cleanly, and you end up leaving chunks of meat and flavoursome fat on the bone. These scraps are perfect for turning into succulent, tasty tacos. Cut any meat and fat off the bone, then shred with two forks. I’ve added black beans to bulk out the meat; if you have less meat, or want to make a vegetarian version, just use an extra tin of beans.Leftover lamb barbacoa tacosBarbacoa de Borregois a traditional Mexican dish of tender slow-cooked lamb (or mutton) that’s often wrapped in agave or banana leaves and baked in an underground pit. Rich, smoky and deeply spiced, it’s typically served shredded in tacos with salsas, lime and fresh herbs. This speedy but satisfying shortcut version captures the essence of the dish using leftover roast lamb and pantry spices.Roast meat is an incredible resource – it takes so much energy to produce, from the land, water and fuel used to farm, transport and store the meat, to the time and energy we put into cooking it – so any extras we make from it are delicious meals in waiting. The meat can simply be reheated until piping hot for a quick, comforting “ready-meal”, or you can turn them into something more elaborate such as today’s dish.Try this recipe and many more of Tom’s thrifty creations on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Mexican chillies are well worth seeking out for this dish, and larger supermarkets are starting to stock them more regularly; alternatively, look in specialist shops and online. I used a ready mix of guajillo, ancho and chipotle flakes, which are all classic chillies commonly used in traditional barbacoa. Chipotle and other Mexican chillies add an extra layer of smokiness and depth to the dish, but a mix of chilli flakes and smoked paprika will also work, if need be. And if you don’t have a mortar and pestle, it’s fine to leave the chilli flakes and cumin whole – just be sure to mince the garlic finely before mixing it with the rest of the ingredients.The green apple salsa verde, meanwhile, is inspired by Mexican tomatillo sauces, and adds a refreshing, tangy kick that cuts through the richness of the meat and balances the dish beautifully.Makes6 tacos3 tsp chilli flakes or powder, Mexican, ideally (guajillo, ancho and/or chipotle), or regular chilli flakes and smoked paprika1 tsp cumin seeds(optional)3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped1 tbsp lime juice, or cider vinegar2 tbsp vegetable oil1 tbsp brown sugar1 tsp sea salt, plus extra for the salsa1 tsp ground cinnamon1 tsp oregano200–250g leftover cooked roast lamb, shredded1 medium white onion, peeled and thinly sliced400g tin kidney, blackor black eyebeans, plus a little of the liquid from the can (if making vegetarian tacos, use 2 tins of beans)6 small tortillasLime wedges, to serve (optional)Fresh coriander, to serve (optional)For the green apple Mexican-style salsa verde (optional)1 green apple(such as a granny smith), cored and roughly chopped, core removed1 fresh green chilli(jalapeño or serrano, ideally), finely chopped, with or without seeds, depending on your liking for heat½ small white onion, roughly chopped1 garlic clove, peeled20g fresh coriander, chopped from stem to leafJuice of 1 lime, plus the finely grated zest, if unwaxed and organicToast the chilli flakes or powder and cumin seeds in a dry pan for a couple of minutes, until they smell spicily aromatic. Transfer to a mortar, grind to a coarse powder, then add the chopped garlic and crush to a paste. Mix in the brown sugar, lime or vinegar, a tablespoon of oil, the sea salt, cinnamon and oregano.Put a tablespoon of the oil in a thick-based frying pan on a medium heat, add the sliced onion, lamb and the spice paste, stir to combine, then saute gently, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, until the lamb and onions are caramelised. Add the beans and enough of their tin liquid to make the mix saucy, then simmer, stirring often, until thick and sticky.Meanwhile, make the salsa verde. Put everything in a blender, then pulse until everything is evenly and finely chopped; if need be, add a splash of water to loosen and help things along. Season to taste with sea salt, and transfer to a bowl.Serve the lamb mix in warm griddled tortillas with lime wedges, coriander and an optional spoonful of my salsa verde to taste. Any excess salsa will keep in a sealed container or jar in the fridge for up to four days.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteMeatLambMexican food and drinkMain coursefeaturesShareReuse this content"
