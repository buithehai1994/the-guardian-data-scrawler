A TV reboot that is a genuinely great ideaThis hugely fun version of the 00s life-swapping show works even better than the original. First up: a posh Surrey estate agent tries running a market stall in BoltonRebecca NicholsonTue 20 May 2025 17.15 EDTShareIhave long held a soft spot for Faking It, the 00s proto-reality series that was conceived as a modern-day Pygmalion. Twenty years ago, it saw people exchanging one job for another, though its idea of what constituted a polar opposite seems almost quaint now. There was a decorator trying their hand at fine art, a posh student who became a bouncer, a ballet dancer who turned into a wrestler. It was about learning new skills, but really, it was about participants experiencing a life that was unfamiliar, among people who were not necessarily like the people they already knew. It was a wholesome culture clash, with a little class war mixed in.As with any long-retired television series that people remember with affection, here comes the reboot. TV revivals are often lazy, and tend to rely on nostalgia rather than quality to attract an audience. That may well be the reason people tune in, to begin with, but Faking It is such a solid idea that it still has plenty of the old charm left to spare. In fact, it may work even better now, in the fractious 2020s, than it did in the optimistic glow of the early 00s.The first episode sees Rex, a plummy public schoolboy who sells luxury property in London for a living, attempting to pass himself off as a Bolton market trader. The semi-puns about Rex going from penthouse to pork ribs are the most painful part of the episode. They ham up the class differences – Rex is being shipped to a generic north, because to be honest he isn’t sure where Bolton is; he has a drink with a friend he last saw at the polo – but despite these exaggerated Made in Chelsea moments, Rex is up for the challenge and seems well aware of his “privileged and fortunate” life situation.In Bolton, Rex learns to sell meat from a market stall under the guidance of Tony and Elliott, who note Rex’s floppy-fringed resemblance to Hugh Grant. Despite some gentle mockery, they all seem to get on nicely, and their enthusiasm for the task at hand is contagious. By the end of his intensive training, Rex will set up his own butcher’s stall and attempt to fool three market inspectors into believing that calling out the low prices of steak and chicken wings is the job he’s done for his entire adult life.View image in fullscreenSwapping polo for pork ribs … Elliot Schofield, Rex Adams and Tony Frame in Faking It.Photograph: Channel 5/DSPThe only real problem is that not only does Rex have to pass himself off as a market trader, he has to pretend to be from Bolton, too. He’s a hard worker who throws himself into learning, so I suspect the added pressure of the accent is to inject some necessary drama and tension. If you’ve ever wanted to see a posh southerner dying a death while compering a pub quiz in Bolton, in an accent that lands somewhere between Newcastle and the Caribbean, here it is. Even if it’s not essential, it is funny, and a little informative: if you’re curious and not from Bolton, apparently the best way into the accent is to say “ya big bad bastard”.Modern reality TV thrives on conflict and high drama, so the Faking It model – setting someone a tricky task that involves getting along with people, while giving them everything they need to succeed and ensuring viewers are right there in their corner – is as much of a 00s relic as low-rise jeans and velour tracksuits. It shouldn’t work in the 2020s. We’ve gotMarried at First Sight, we’ve gotThe Traitors, we’ve gotLove Is Blind. We’ve got squabbling and cliffhangers and emotional high stakes and on-camera meltdowns.But Faking It does still work, and perhaps it is more valid now than it was when it began. Class barriers are more pronounced. We’re living in the tumultuous age of the echo chamber. Our beliefs are self-reinforcing, and we are becoming less likely to socialise with people who are not like us. (If Keir Starmer wants to locate the real causes of his“island of strangers”, he could start by looking at the tech companies he is so avidly courting.)Without putting too much weight on the shoulders of light entertainment, it’s notable that people from different places and different backgrounds can be thrown together, get along just fine and still make for entertaining TV. The original Faking It had an occasional special episode, updating us on how the show had changed people’s lives. I hope they continue the tradition. I’d love to see how Rex gets on when he’s next at the polo.Faking It is on Channel 5 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sorry, that should have read the deal that completely reset Britain’s relationship with the EU paving the way for years of growth and plenty. Or, as the Brexiters put it, the greatest betrayal since the last one. Take your pick.The Labour and the Tory benches filled up in anticipation. Government backbenchers primed to take full advantage of a rare vaguely good news story. The Tories? They were there to refight the past. Because that has worked so well for them. A new YouGov poll showed the Tories in fourth place. Behind even the Lib Dems. ThoughKemi Badenochwon’t be happy until she has steered her party into fifth. A bit more climate denial and the Greens could overtake her.Mind you, Kemi was not wholly alone in her desire to explore the Tories’ existential futility. The Unbearable Lightness of Their Being. Priti Patel was there on the frontbench, urging Kemi on to new levels of stupidity. Only that morning, Priti Vacant had toured the broadcast studios with her own peculiar brand of insanity.Britain was suffering “the indignity of being a rule taker”, she said. She wouldn’t be happy until the UK had no trade deals with anyone. Better to be poor than to be subject to any joint regulations.Then there was Victoria Atkins. The final member of the three who had embarrassed themselves at a press conference the day before. Vicky is quite good at wide-eyed innocence, though you suspect she may secretly be a bit brighter than KemiKaze and Vacant even if she tries to keep it well-hidden. She has the look of someone on whom it has dawned that the “surrender” narrative is a crock of shit. But she just can’t help herself.Vicky had come to the Common with her pet fish. Harry the Hake. With his eyes bulging and gasping for breath, Harry was a dead ringer for Mark Francois. He had a story to tell about one of his friends: Gary the Gurnard. Gazza would rather die than be caught by a Spanish trawler and be eaten by a foreigner. And now Starmer had made it easier for him to be caught by a British trawler and eaten by a foreigner. It was the thin end of the wedge. Of lemon. Gazz – like many fish – was gutted. RIP.Meanwhile, Starmer gave the impression of a man living his best life. In his usual dour kind of way. He’s not a man given to many displays of emotion. Butthe EU deal was his own personal hat-trick, after the India and US deals. And he wasn’t going to hear it from anyone that these were anything less than seismic, gamechanging agreements. The EU deal reset was the deal of the century. Business and industry had fallen on it. Like people dying of thirst in a desert. The Tories had said these deals could not be done. It just turned out that they were the party who couldn’t get them over the line.Up stepped KemiKaze and we were immediately whisked back into the Brexit past. Where Tory failures get rewritten as blue-remembered triumphs.The fishing dealwas nothing less than a surrender, she said. Momentarily forgetting it was the same deal that Boris and Frosty had negotiated. Ah, yes, she said. They had purposely negotiated a rubbish deal to wrongfoot the fiendish Europeans. The plan had always been to strike it out after five years and agree the deal they had always wanted.For a nanosecond or two, you could see the light begin to dawn on Kemi. That the script she had in front of her was garbage. That the country had moved on. People wanted a better deal withEurope. They just didn’t want to be reminded they had voted for a worse one. That there was no Platonic ideal of Brexit. No land of plenty. And it wasn’t as if she was about to reverse any of this if the Tories somehow found their way into government. There would be no prizes for more red tape.But then KemiKaze remembered she had nothing else and felt obliged to continue. It was a very public embarrassment. Even Vacant and Vicky didn’t know where to look. Starmer barely graced her with a reply. The Tories just weren’t serious. Her MPs rather agreed. They began to slip away in droves. Led by the usually ever loyal Desmond Swayne and Chris Philp. Soon Kemi only had a miserable Mel Stride and Alex Burghart for company.There were a few diehard Tory Brexiters – Bernard Jenkin, Francois and Esther McVey – keen to die on the hill they had spent years climbing. But they just looked lost. Pitiful really. Moaning about young people getting experience of other countries. There was something sad and defeated about them. Xenophobia on autopilot. Just going through the motions because that’s all they have ever known.Most tellingly, there was no sign of Nigel Farage. He knew only too well there was no mileage for Reform in this. Immigration is now all that matters to him. So he allowed his half-witted deputy to fill in for him. Dicky Tice is so challenged he can normally only talk in mindless alliteration – Bungling Brussels Bureaucrats – but now he could only manage to repeat the word “Surrender” a few times. He sounded pathetic. Out of time. The world had moved on.Explore more on these topicsBrexitThe politics sketchEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policyKeir StarmerKemi BadenochConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

Physicians on five common pelvic floor mythsWhat you need to know about the essential yet misunderstood body part, including common issues and helpful exercisesMadeleine AggelerTue 20 May 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 14.47 EDTShareThepelvic flooris an essential but often overlooked and misunderstood part of the human body. Some people don’t even know they have one.“We’re never really taught about it,” says Dr Sara Reardon, a board-certified pelvic floor therapist and author of Floored: A Woman’s Guide to Pelvic FloorHealthat Every Age and Stage. “We don’t really get any education about how these muscles work and what’s normal.”The pelvic floor is “a basket of muscles that sits at the base of your pelvis”, Reardon explains. It supports the pelvic organs: the bowel, bladder, and uterus or prostate. These in turn support the spine, and play an important role in sexual health and urinary and fecal continence.When the pelvic floor is working well, we tend to take it for granted, says Dr Ekene A Enemchukwu, a urogynecologist and director of urology at the Stanford Pelvic Health Center. But when it is not functioning correctly, “it can significantly impact functionality and quality of life,” she says.Common pelvic floor disorders include urinary or fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, pelvic pain and sexual dysfunction, says Enemchukwu.We asked pelvic health experts what are the biggest myths about the pelvic floor, and how to care for yours.Myth No 1: Pelvic floor issues are a women’s issue“Everyone has a pelvic floor – males, females, children,” says Reardon. The three biggest risk factors for developing pelvic floor disorders – pregnancy, birth and menopause – tend to affect women, but pelvic floor disorder is still common in men, says Reardon.Men with pelvic floor disorders can experience urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, rectal prolapse (from chronic straining or constipation) and pelvic pain from tension in the pelvic floor muscles, says Enemchukwu.Even in people who don’t experience pregnancy or childbirth, the stress and strain of everyday life can take its toll on the pelvis, says Dr Cassandra Kisby, a urogynecologist and assistant professor at Duke University hospital. “The pelvis can respond to our environment, our emotions, our traumas,” she explains. “We carry stress in our pelvic floor, and that affects its function.”Myth No 2: Pelvic floor disorders are inevitableOne of the biggest mistakes people make when it comes to their pelvic floor health is not distinguishing between common and normal symptoms, says Kisby.“Many things that happen to the pelvic floor are common, but don’t need to be accepted as the norm,” she says.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Pelvic floor issues are extremely common. Urinary leakage, for example,affectsroughly 50% of adult women, and 75% of women over the age of 65. Anestimated75% of women will experience pain during intercourse.“I have women come in and say: ‘I have three babies, and I leak sometimes when I sneeze and I have to change my clothes, but that’s normal for my age.’” But it doesn’t have to be, says Kisby. “I really urge patients to think about quality of life and what we can do about it because there are treatment options.”Myth No 3: Your doctor will know to ask about your pelvic floor healthPatients often have to advocate for themselves when it comes to pelvic health.“Physicians aren’t screening women for these issues,” says Reardon. Because the pelvic floor affects so many systems in the body, it can also be difficult to know which doctor to ask about it.“Our medical world is so siloed,” says Reardon. “There’s one doctor who looks at the uterus, one who looks at the colon, one who looks at the bladder – but nobody’s looking at the muscles, which is the intersection of all these things.”The people who do look at these muscles areurogynecologists. But according to Kisby, “many women don’t know what a urogynecologist is.”“We need to find ways to improve awareness, screening and access to multi-disciplinary care,” says Enemchukwu. “Patients do not need to suffer in silence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop sells multiple Kegel-relatedproducts.Celebritiesboastabouttheir Kegel routines. But according to experts, Kegels are not the be all and end all of public health. And for some, they could do more harm than good.We don’t really get any education about how these muscles work and what’s normalDr Sara ReardonKegels are a pelvic floor exercise in which the muscles of the pelvic floor are contracted. “It’s closing those urinary and anal sphincters and lifting that basket of muscles up,” explains Reardon.The exercise shortens and tightens the muscle. It can be helpful for regaining some strength after childbirth, or to address mild cases of incontinence. But for some, pelvic floor issues are a result of the muscles already being too tight, and Kegels only worsen symptoms.For tension in the pelvis, Reardon recommends working on relaxation: “more yoga-type stretches, breathing, massaging the muscle internally and externally to release some of that tension”, she says.But talk to an expert first.“Ideally, care should be individualized and guided by a professional,” says Enemchukwu.Easy wins: strengthen your pelvic floor a little more every dayRead moreMyth No 5: You can only address pelvic floor issues when you’re youngIn some cases, pelvic floor injuries present years after they first occur.“Many women have a childbirth injury of some degree, and oftentimes it will temporarily get better during the initial healing that our body does,” explains Kisby. But then, patients come back 10 or 20 years later “when their symptoms start to become more prominent”.Fortunately, it’s never too late to start working on pelvic floor health, experts say.“Some folks feel like if they’ve experienced something for a long time, they’re beyond help,” says Reardon. “But at any age you can start working on this and you can get improvement.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Friends and supporters had gathered to greet him, but the moment of release felt bittersweet and he struggled to adjust back to civilian life afterwards. In the weeks that followed he developed a habit. He’d drive his car back and forth on the road that paralleled the high prison walls, pining for those who were still inside. “These people had become my people,” he says. “I thought, ‘How could I go and leave them behind?’”Panahi makes humane, heartfelt pictures about life inIran. He refers to these as “social films”, although this definition cuts no ice with the Iranian government, which has ruled them to be “propaganda against the system” and therefore hazardous, offensive material. He has to date been imprisoned twice, undergone a hunger strike and sold his house to make bail. Panahi is officially banned from making movies, although he continues to make them all the same. This is his first press interview in more than 15 years. Technically, he’s not allowed to do this either.They would take me out blindfolded and question me – sometimes for eight hoursHis new social film is a prison story of sorts, born out of his experience and playing in the main competition at Cannes. A Simple Accident is a morality play dressed up as a tense revenge thriller, nuanced and gripping as it steers a van through Tehran. Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri) is a former political prisoner who abducts his state interrogator. But Vahid needs to be sure that he’s got the right man and enlists the help and advice of various dissident friends. The captive in the van swears that he’s innocent, except that in modern Iran almost everyone lies. Both sides of the wall have learned it’s the only way to survive.View image in fullscreenKidnapped interrogator? … A Simple Accident, which is showing at Cannes.Photograph: Jafah Panahi Productions Les Films PelleasThe director beams in from his base in Iran. He wears sunglasses indoors and smokes with grim determination, but he speaks with the authoritative air of a practised orator. Prison, one senses, has not broken his spirit. It might even have emboldened him.There were two main factors behind the film, he explains. “The first time I was in prison I was in solitary confinement. I was on my own in a tiny cell and they would take me out blindfolded to a place where I would sit in front of a wall and hear this voice at my back. It was the voice of the man who would question me – sometimes for two hours, sometimes for eight hours. And I would just hang on his voice all that time, fantasising about who this person was from his voice. And I had an intuition that someday this voice would be an aspect of something I’d write or shoot and give a creative life to.”He draws on his cigarette. “My second time in prison was different. This time I was in a large space with other political prisoners. Some of them had been there for 10 or 15 years. Their experience – their stories, their take on what captivity meant to them – was inspiring. It was like the world opened up to me. Gradually, I had an idea for a film that gathered these pieces together.”Assuming that Vahid’s instinct is correct, the captive in the van is guilty of torture and rape. One of Vahid’s friends suggests showing mercy. Another, Hamid (Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr), demands immediate retribution. What would Panahi do if he met his interrogator on the street and recognised him by his voice? “I don’t know,” he says softly. “I really don’t know. I wish to say that my reaction would be the one I’ve chosen as a director, the [even-handed] response of my films. But I’m not sure. I’m a human being, so maybe I’d have a reasonable, sensible reaction but maybe I’d react in a way that I can’t foresee.”View image in fullscreenShot in his own car … 2015’s Taxi Tehran.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyPanahi is now 64 years old and has fashioned a career out of poking the bear, testing the patience of the Islamic Republic. For the past 15 years he has made his films illegally, deploying ingenious methods to avoid being caught. He shot 2013’s Closed Curtain at home with the windows draped, while 2015’s Taxi Tehran repurposed his car as a mobile film studio. His 2011 iPhone documentary This is Not a Film was famously smuggled out of the country on a USB stick. Every production becomes its own high-stakes thriller. But then pretty much every day in Iran is the same.“The fear of being arrested is constant,” he says. “Any moment the authorities can come and stop everything that’s happening in your life. That said, once you learn to work in secret, you become more clever than they are. Some of my colleagues have had problems. They tried to make clandestine films and had all their material confiscated. But by reducing the cast and crew – and by taking various precautions that of course I can’t share with you – we were able to complete almost all of the film.”Two days before the end of shooting, the crew were waylaid by a team of 15 plain-clothed officers (“police in plain clothes is never a good sign,” he points out). They told Panahi that he had to stop shooting and give up all his footage. When the director refused, they made do with whatever they could seize. “A laptop. Some discs. Perfume. Cigarettes.”What protected him, he thinks, was that his shoot coincided with the second round of Iran’s presidential elections. The authorities may have reasoned that arresting the director – arguably the country’s most high-profile dissident – would generate too much unwanted publicity. Panahi, in effect, had become too big to stamp out.View image in fullscreenSolidarity … Juliette Binoche at Cannes in 2010.Photograph: François Guillot/AFP/Getty ImagesPossibly the threat against him has eased. His longtime travel ban is now in abeyance. He was able to edit his film in France and is now due in town for the Cannes premiere – although the consequence of this visit remains anyone’s guess. “Nothing in Iran is predictable,” he says. “I hope we can come back home afterwards.”In 2021 the director’s son, Panah, made an excellent film of his own. Hit the Road depicted a family jaunt to the Turkish border and was loosely inspired by his sister Solmaz’s decision to start a new life in Ireland.Discussing the film in a Guardian interview, Panahi Jr admitted that his father’s political stance has put undue strain on the family: “From our family’s perspective, you sometimes think that, well, maybe it wasn’t worth it.”It is Panahi’s fate to have spent his career as a touchstone for Iran’s pro-democracy movement: forever looking over his shoulder; constantly running the risk of arrest. But it’s a decision which, he feels, has been forced upon him.I have become a film-maker in spite of restrictions“When you live in an ideological dictatorship – a closed system – you have no choice,” he explains. “Even when you walk on the street [the authorities] can ask you why you’re walking, where you’re going and why you are dressed in the way that you are. They create restrictions for every citizen, not just film-makers. There is no escape. Your life is conditioned by the system. So you learn how to adjust in order to keep living, working, eating, speaking in spite of this system. I have become a film-maker in spite of restrictions.” He pauses. “As to what Panah said, I don’t know what he meant, but I would ask myself this question – was it worth it? – only if I felt ashamed by one of the films I have made. And that’s not the case. I’ve put my heart into every one of them. I’ve made a positive choice by making them. I’m happy with the choice I’ve made.”It’s nice to picture Panahi walking the red carpet at Cannes. It will be his first time at the festival since 2003. For 14 years he wasn’t allowed to travel at all. The prospect, however, leaves him altogether unmoved. Iran is his home; he feels no desire to leave. He jokes that this might even count as a character flaw. “Why do I put up with my life in Iran?”As for being in Cannes, who knows? “Maybe I’ll feel as I did when I was released from prison. I knew that my friends and family were waiting for me outside. But when I stepped out I had very mixed feelings. I stood in the road and looked back at the wall. Maybe in Cannes I’ll feel the same way. I’ll look back and think about the people left behind in my country.”Explore more on these topicsJafar PanahiIranCannes film festivalFestivalsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Three hours later, it had become Judi Dench’s head, 50% larger than usual, twinkle-eyed even in terracotta.At Claridge’s hotel in London on Monday evening, Frances Segelman hosted her latest ticking-clock sculpt: paying guests watch as she kneads a celebrity bust on stage, the subject sitting quietly beside her. In the past, Segelman has done Simon Rattle, Joan Collins, Joanna Lumley, Boris Johnson, Mr Motivator and major-league royals, almost always for charity.This was a fundraiser for lymphoedema research. Ticket sales raised over £20,000 and it’s hoped that, when it’s cast in bronze, the finished piece will fetch double that (St George’s hospital Charityin Tooting, London, has begun accepting bids).The pair began a little before the audience arrived, sitting on a platform in the hotel’s mirrored, slightly chilly art deco ballroom. Segelman, 76, glamorous in black lace gown despite mucky hands; Dench, 90, immaculate in cream coat with grey shawl and sausage-shaped water bottle. Another throw appeared courtesy of her daughter, Finty Williams. “Oooh hello!” said Dench. “I’m swathed in blankets, that’s wonderful, thank you.” Beside her were a cappuccino, bouquet and numbered helium balloons in honour of last December’s landmark birthday - in fact, she’ll soon be nearer 91.View image in fullscreen‘She was so sweet and kind and she never moved’ … Frances Segelman and Judi Dench.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAThe lump became flesh. Nostrils were poked out, Covid swab-style. Segelman measured Dench’s skull using wooden tongs and metal callipers – half tailor, half surgeon. “It’s weird,” said Williams. “At first, it didn’t look like her. Then after 10 minutes I was like: ‘Oh yes, that is Ma.’” It wasn’t unnerving? “I’m quite used to seeing her bigger than she normally is.”Then the binbags of sludge were removed and guests entered: around 200 supporters of the lymphoedema charity, which has been working with Dench’s friend, photographer Gemma Levine. They first met in 1989, when Levine was dispatched to snap Dench at the NationalTheatre, who was playing Gertrude opposite Daniel Day-Lewis’s Hamlet. “We kept in touch,” says Levine. “And once I had lymphoedema I kept asking Judi to do events and she never said no.”View image in fullscreen‘When she got hold of that clay, she was loving it’ … Segelman measures Dench.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PALevine studied under Henry Moore. His “hard” art would have been a bad fit for her friend, she thinks. “Judi’s a great subject. She’s a true professional and someone with great depth and sensibility and humour. I don’t know anyone else like that – and I know a lot of film and theatre people.”An address about lymphoedema began the evening proper: its causes, symptoms, incidence and cost to the NHS of late diagnosis. It is, said Dr Peter Mortimer of St George’s, a “hidden epidemic” with “little recognition”. He talked the audience through elephantiasis and how “a big arm, following lymph gland removal after breast cancer surgery” can be fatal should the swelling spread to the central organs. Waiters offered fizz and nibbles.Segelman then spoke, asking the audience to mingle while she worked. (“Talk makes me quicker.”) They duly milled, and debated in spitting distance of the artist how she was doing. “It’s like focus,” said one accountant. “It goes in and out. It’s out at the moment, but it’ll go back in.”View image in fullscreen‘Watching Judi turn into a monument’ … Simon Callow addresses the audience at Claridge’s.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAHis favourite Dench role was M in Skyfall; informal canvassing of the crowd for her key performances saw a big win for the James Bond films, but also strong results for the sitcoms As Time Goes By and A Fine Romance, as well as the Iris Murdoch biopic (there were a lot of doctors in the room). One GP reported he’d seen almost all her Shakespeare productions and been in love with her for four decades, while the composer Karl Jenkins – whose music soundtracked some of the evening – remembered seeing Dench in Twelfth Night when he was a schoolboy.There was quiet as Simon Callow recited Christina Rossetti’s A Birthday. Were Maggie Smith present, he said, “she’d say how wonderful it’s been today to watch Judi turn into a monument”. Williams read a self-penned poem to her mother, To the Moon and Back, which brought both women – and a few others – to tears. A soprano sang Happy Birthday. Cake came.As the evening wore on, Dench swapped her coffee for champagne. She did not speak publicly but, during a brief break, told the Guardian she was enjoying the experience, despite her macular degeneration now being so advanced she would be unable to assess the results.“I can’t see a thing,” she said. “I can’t really see your face and you’re right in front of me.” She gestured round. “I’m just in the play. I sit on the stage. It’s very nice and Frances is brilliant, as is the charity. I just hear this sea of friendly people.”View image in fullscreen‘I think a lot of people want her to take up more space than she does’ … Finty Williams, who read a poem to her mother.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAHer sense of her own features hasn’t changed with age. “I don’t have a relationship with my face,” she said. “Never have!” If she couldn’t appreciate the finished bust visually, would she have a feel? An impish grin. “If they let me.”And as Segelman fiddled with the chin and entered the final furlong, Dench did toy with a spare ball of terracotta. “When she got hold of that clay,” said Segelman later, “she was loving it. She could do something with it.”It’s not just a passing interest, reports Williams. Her mother attends a weekly art class that includes pottery. Like Segelman, Dench prefers figurative work – just last week, says Williams, she shaped a little Bottom from A Midsummer Night’s Dream.View image in fullscreen‘Frances is brilliant’ … the finished bust.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAFinally the head was complete. Segelman would make some small tweaks in her studio the next day, she said, as an assistant spritzed it. “But I’m not worried. It went well. I didn’t meet Judi before I sculpted her. That’s hard. But she was so sweet and kind and she never moved.” Segelman was surprised by her youthfulness. “She has a cuteness. Pixie-like.”Williams concurred. “I think Ma’s got like quite an elvish little face and I think a lot of people want her to take up more space than she does. To give her a bigger, cookie cutter outline.” Her verdict was complimentary, especially the jawline.And what does she think her mother would make of it? “She’s a Quaker so she’s not a big fan of looking at herself. And she wouldn’t really be able to see it any more. But I think she’ll love touching it.”As everyone headed out of the ballroom, two footmen edged gently by, bearing a huge metal box containing Dench’s still-wet supersized head. Guests gulped and shrank back. The possibility of a slip was a sobering thought on the way to the exit.Explore more on these topicsFilmJudi DenchSculptureCharitable givingTheatreArtnewsShareReuse this content"

Either way, give Lauren Sánchez an awardMarina HydeThe hemlines were high and the diamonds hefty as the world’s second-richest fiancee and her entourage stormed the Seine. Formez vos bataillons!Tue 20 May 2025 08.23 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 11.53 EDTShareTo Cannes, in the country of France, where last night Jeff Bezos’s fiancee, Lauren Sánchez, got what she deserves: a philanthropy award. Lauren was honoured at something called the Global Gift Gala, where she received the women empowerment award for her commitment to climate justice, social justice and coming off at absolutely all times as a woman who refers to her breasts as “my girls”. Regular readers will know I have ahugeamount of time for her. She accepted her gong wearing a necklace with a diamond pendant slightly larger than an Amazon warehouse, once again redrawing the blueprint that other humanitarians will simply need to watch and learn from.Meanwhile, if there were awards for hen nights – or bachelorette parties, in the American style – then Lauren would surely have taken one for her full-scale invasion of Paris last weekend, after French forces withdrew and declared the city open. Hand on heart, I initially assumed Lauren was the new US ambassador to France, but then remembered that state department randos were probably seated in some windy overspill gazebo for Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, while Lauren had pride of place ahead of the actual cabinet as part of Oligarchs’ Row. Plus, having just Googled, I discover the Senate yesterdayconfirmedTrump’s pick for the ambassador to France – his own son-in-law’s former jailbird dad.So this was very much a private visit to Paris for premarital pleasure on Lauren’s behalf, a mood later reflected in her official Instagram communique to attendees and her 930,000 followers. “To my girls … thank you for surprising me, lifting me up, and reminding me how much I needed this moment.” Remember, Lauren dresses everything in this same flattened palette of solipsism: a spa day,a space trip, a humanitarian award, new swimwear.Anyway, attendees for the hen weekend included fellow astronaut Katy Perry, the two most prestigious Kardashians – Kim and materfamilias Kris Jenner – as well as Eva Longoria, who travelled onward to Cannes to present Lauren with last night’s humanitarian award. If you’re wondering which of the party goes back furthest with Lauren, I wouldn’t waste your time. Typically, celebrities do not have old friends. They regard it as a moral failing and a sign that you don’t really want the big time enough.View image in fullscreenLauren Sánchez with her fiance, Jeff Bezos, in Santa Monica, California in April 2025.Photograph: CraSH/imageSPACE/REX/ShutterstockAs for what was worn during the Paris festivities, the dress code wasn’t specifically themed as Marie Antoinette – necklines did plunge deep, in the late 18th-century style, but hemlines had been guillotined somewhere near the Kármán line. One pharmaceutical billionaire’s wife sported a vintage bronze-effect Issey Miyake breastplate recently purchased at auction for $54,000 (the girl brunch equivalent ofthat timeNicolas Cage outbid everyone for a stolen T-rex skull).Activities over the weekend included posting diligently toInstagram, the platform owned by fellow Oligarchs’ Row occupant Mark Zuckerberg, all while making sure to tag in their travelling makeup artists, hairstylists and lesser support-retinue members. There was also an ostentatiously open-top boat ride down the Seine, where I think the ladies went to view the floating corpse of a trend once known as “quiet luxury”.In truth, it must be said, those curated and filtered Insta photos of the attendees looked startlingly different to the candid ones snapped by Parisian street photographers as they left the various venues. Had you shown some of the faces in the latter snaps to the average person 40 years ago, they would have assumed something awful must have happened to the women. Luckily, our eyes have grown accustomed after decades of Botox, fillers and extreme “work” going mainstream, so we don’t notice the weirdness and read it instead as maximum hotness. Thank you, progress!All in all, the entire special Parisian operation has served to heighten interest in the forthcoming Bezos and Sánchez nuptials, which are due to take place inVeniceat the end of next month, after extensive lobbying by local Italian politicians for it to be chosen as the host city/organism. Venice’s mayor informed the Times that “we were in competition with other places but we won out”. As one Venetian official put it: “It’s going to be on par with a G7.” Truly, the fairytale. And if you happen to be visiting Venice as a tourist over the same dates, you should probably know that Lauren and Jeff already “booked every water taxi in the city”.In terms of securing other things, Lauren has become quite the expert in acquiring trophies – and I’m not talking about Jeff. This women empowerment award is far from Lauren’s only humanitarian award in the past year or so. She and Jeff also picked up Conservation International’s global visionary award, while madam alone somehow beat out the competition to win a humanity award from a charity called This Is About Humanity. Look, I don’t pretend to understand the precise economics of throwing hugely glitzy charity galas to give climate awards to individuals who right at this moment are staying in Cannes aboard their megayacht, a vessel that emitsmore than 7,000 tonnes of CO2 a yearand is so large it requires its ownsupport yachtto trail around after it, carrying simple amenities such as the helicopter pad and some kind of personal submarine. I don’t think normies CAN understand these things. Our role is to simply admire them.Even so, perhaps I’m not alone in feeling that it is becoming harder and harder work. In fact, the choice of Italy as host for the Bezos-Sánchez nuptials feels almost too on the nose. A few centuries ago, the super-rich of that country kicked off the Renaissance, commissioning a vast array of jewels of the visual arts. Our modern-day power players simply give us Instagram or red-carpet pictures. More of a dark ages dynamic, really, from which we might all fervently wish to be delivered.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCelebrityOpinionJeff BezosClimate crisisCannes film festivalParisInstagramVenicecommentShareReuse this content"

Seventeen of the 27 states backed the move. The EU is Israel’s biggest trading partner, accounting for 32% of Israel’s total trade in goods in 2024.Lammy, unleashing language he has not used since the latestGazaconflict began, said the further planned major military incursion into Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces was “morally unjustifiable, wholly disproportionate and utterly counterproductive”.As the foreign secretary made his opening remarks in the Commons, backbenchers shouted “genocide”.Sounding genuinely outraged with the government of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Lammy said: “We are now entering a dark new phase in this conflict. Netanyahu’s government is planning to drive Gazans from their homes into a corner of the strip to the south and permit them a fraction of the aid that they need.”2:46'End this blockade now': UK calls out Netanyahu and suspends trade talks with Israel – videoIsrael’s foreign ministry accused the UK of having an anti-Israel obsession.Responding to the suspension of trade talks, the Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein said: “If, due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations, the British government is willing to harm the British economy – that is its own prerogative.”He said the sanctions in relation to the West Bank were “unjustified and regrettable”. And he added: “The British mandate ended exactly 77 years ago.“External pressure will not divert Israel from its path in defending its existence and security against enemies who seek its destruction.”Lammy told MPs: “Yesterday, minister [Bezalel] Smotrich even spoke of Israeli forces ‘cleansing’ Gaza, ‘destroying what’s left’, of resident Palestinians ‘being relocated to third countries’. We must call this what it is. It is extremism. It is dangerous. It is repellent. It is monstrous.”He added that the Israeli ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, was being summoned to hear British demands that the latest assault on Gaza be halted.Lammy said Israel had suffered a “heinous attack” on 7 October 2023 and that the UK government backed Israel’s right to defend itself.But the military escalation in Gaza was “morally unjustifiable, it’s wholly disproportionate, it’s utterly, utterly counterproductive – whatever Israeli ministers claim, this is not the way to bring the hostages safely home”.Israel has held back aid, saying it was being stolen by Hamas and claimed the renewed assault was necessary to wipe out the terrorists and release the remaining hostages.But Lammy said Israel would not secure the release of the hostages by creating a humanitarian catastrophe. He said: “Civilians in Gaza facing starvation, homelessness, trauma, desperate for this war to end, now confront renewed bombardment, new displacement and new suffering. And the remaining hostages kept apart from their loved ones by Hamas for almost 600 days are now at heightened risk from the war around them.“They are going to take control of the strip and will allow just enough to prevent hunger. Fewer than 10 trucks entered Gaza yesterday. The UN and WHO have issued stark warnings of the threat of starvation hanging over the heads of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. This is abominable.”View image in fullscreenUN aid lorries wait to enter the Gaza Strip at the Kerem Shalom crossing, southern Israel on Tuesday.Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPAHe warned that the Israeli government was damaging the country’s global reputation. “They are isolating Israel from its friends and partners around the world. Undermining the interests of the Israeli people. And damaging the image of the state of Israel in the eyes of the world. I find this deeply painful, as a lifelong friend of Israel and a believer in the values expressed in its declaration of independence.”But many Labour backbenchers in the Commons found a gulf between Lammy’s rhetoric and the government’s actions limited to a symbolic suspending of talks on a free trade deal.Backbenchers including many Tories called for a tightening of controls of UK arms exports to Israel, recognition of the state of Palestine at a UN conference next month and a full ban on Israeli trade. Lammy said further concrete action would be considered but in conjunction with allies.The Conservative former minister Kit Malthouse said Lammy’s “anger and the outrage” was “appreciated by us all”, but added: “He knows as well as I do that the Israelis couldn’t give a damn what he says in this chamber.” He added: “Does the frontbench need us to beg for the lives of those Palestinian children before they’ll trigger this concrete action, whatever it might be?”Lammy said it was “wrong” of Malthouse to claim that “Israelis couldn’t give a fig what [was] said from this frontbench”, adding that the government announced further sanctions “because of the position of this Netanyahu government and the language that we see from these ministers”.He also imposed sanctions on a further three Israeli settlers and four entities on the West Bank, including the veteran settler extremist Daniella Weiss, the head of the Nachala movement, who featured in Louis Theroux’s recent documentary,The Settlers. Other individuals targeted were Zohar Sabah, an Israeli who the US imposed sanctions on in November. It was from the Zohar Zabah farm that settlers, some of them minors, set out to attack the principal of a Palestinian school in the grounds of the school.When contacted by phone, Weiss shrugged off the sanctions, which she attacked as “childish” and claimed they would not affect her personally or the broader settler movement.“My husband ordered tickets already for an around the world tour, without including Britain,” she said.“It is not mature, it is not serious. If it were a child doing it I could say that the child doesn’t understand.“Britain knows, the [British] government knows, that we were attacked, and if it were up to the Israeli government we wouldn’t have started any war.“But as we were attacked and as there are intentions to continue attacks, so we fight. And we will have the upper hand.”However, Lammy again held back from imposing sanctions on two Israeli cabinet ministers, the finance minister, Smotrich, and the interior minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, although he said some of their language would be kept under review.Smotrich said this week: “Just as we levelled Rafah, we will level all of Gaza.”Lammy said there was a UN plan ready to deliver aid at scale with more than 9,000 trucks at the border. He called on Netanyahu to immediately end the blockade and allow aid in.Sanctions were also imposed on Libi Construction and Infrastructure Ltd, Harel Libi and Coco’s Farm Outpost, and Neria’s Farm Outpost, including “persons residing in the outpost, for involvement in human rights abuses”. Earlier Keir Starmer said Britain “cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve” and that levels of suffering there were “utterly intolerable”.“The recent announcement that Israel will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza is totally and utterly inadequate,” he told MPs.“So we must coordinate our response, because this war has gone on for far too long. We cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warDavid LammyGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

However, this could change once EES is introduced.”Starmer said on Monday he had “urged EU member states” to allow Britons to use e-gates as soon as possible. “We will be pressing hard on that. There’s no inhibition now on this, so I want to see it done quickly.”Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, accused him of promising more than the agreement actually delivered.“The prime minister is boasting that we will now avoid airport queues because we will get access to EU e-gates,” she said.“It sounds great, except it is not true; some airports already allow that, and this deal does not guarantee it anywhere, as each country still has to agree.”Sources close to the government said even with passport stamping, access to e-gates would be a huge improvement as it would separate British from other third-country nationals, who need visas checked, something that can add hours to a journey in busy hotspots such as Madrid, Paris and Rome.“The biggest impacts will be felt when wet stamping is removed, but in the mean time opening up e-gates will still help, giving UK citizens more options at ports and helping fluidity,” said one government insider.A spokesperson for the European Commission said the introduction of the EES “will open the possibility to use e-gates for all non-EU citizens, including UK citizens. This will contribute to fluidity at borders for both entry and exit.”The Spanish government has confirmed that British travellers will be able to use electronic gates at Spanish airports once the system is up and running.“When the EU orders the entry/exit border control system to begin operating, British citizens will be able to use electronic entry points as long as they have a valid travel document, such as a passport,” said a source at the interior ministry.Under the new EES system, EU member states will require non-EU visitors, business or leisure, to provide biometric data including fingerprints and facial images when entering the Schengen area.Each visit after that will verify the biometrics and “if your digital file is clear of any impediments to travel, you will usually not need to go via a passport control officer”.The system is not currently in operation, and airports and ports including Dover and Folkestone Eurotunnel will have scanning systems in place once the EES is given the green light.The system hasalready been delayed three timesamid concerns it would cause delays at the Olympics in Paris last year and over problems with an EU database.There were also technical problems with each member state’s system for interfacing with the agencyeu-Lisa, which manages the technology and databases for the bloc in relation to free movement, security and justice.Ultimately all travel in the EU will be digitally controlled with an electronic visa waiver system,Etias, pencilled in for the last quarter of next year and long-term plans fordigital passportssimilar to those already operationalin Ukraine’s DIIA app.Explore more on these topicsBrexitEuropean UnionKeir StarmerKemi BadenochnewsShareReuse this content"

He earned six Emmy nominations for his work on the show.“The Norm you see in Cheers has been years in the making,” Wendtonce saidof his character. “I have some characteristics in common with him besides our fondness for beer. But I think I’m a lot happier than Norm.” He also added: “I was a beer drinker long before Cheers. When I put a couple of six packs on top of my grocery shopping cart, people are pleased. I tell ‘em I’m taking them home to rehearse.”He went on to play the character of Norm in a number of other shows including Frasier, Wings, The Simpsons, Family Guy and The Tortellis.On Tuesday, his Cheers co-stars paid tribute, including Ted Danson, who played the barman Sam. “I am devastated to hear that Georgie is no longer with us,” he said in a statement. “I am sending all my love to Bernadette and the children. It is going to take me a long time to get used to this. I love you, Georgie.”Rhea Perlman, who played waitress Carla Tortelli, remembered him as “the sweetest, kindest man I ever met.”“It was impossible not to like him,” she added. “As Carla, I was often standing next to him, as Norm always took the same seat at the end of the bar, which made it easy to grab him and beat the crap out of him at least once a week. I loved doing it and he loved pretending it didn’t hurt. What a guy! I’ll miss him more than words can say.”John Ratzenberger, who played fellow Cheers regular Cliff Clavin, said he was “heartbroken”.“For 11 years on Cheers, we shared a stage, a lot of laughs and a front-row seat to one of television’s most beloved friendships. George brought Norm to life with a subtle brilliance — the kind that made it look easy. That was his gift,” he said in a statement.Kelsey Grammer, who appeared in Cheers and Frasier with Wendt,told the Hollywood Reporter:“I believe mourning is a private matter. But I liked George a lot. He was beloved by millions.”After Cheers, Wendt also led short-lived sitcom The George Wendt Show in 1995 which was cancelled after six episodes. His other television credits included Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Colombo, Portlandia and The Goldbergs.His film credits included Guilty by Suspicion with Robert De Niro, Fletch with Chevy Chase, Space Truckers with Dennis Hopper and Forever Young with Mel Gibson. He also played Macaulay Culkin’s father in Michael Jackson’s Black or White video.On stage, Wendt also starred in Hairspray on Broadway, playing Edna Turnblad. “It was one of my two favorite roles, apart from Norm,”he said. “Absolute utter joy and entirely different from anything in my world.”Most recently, he appeared in a season of The Masked Singer and 2022’s festive comedy Christmas with the Campbells. He also reunited with members of the Cheers cast at the 2024 Emmys.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionTV comedyComedyTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Once a brain tumour is found, a sample is taken during surgery and cells are immediately studied under a microscope by pathologists, who can often identify the type of tumour. However, genetic testing helps to make or confirm the diagnosis.“Almost all of the samples will go for further testing anyway. But for some of them it will be absolutely crucial, because you won’t know what you’re looking at,” said Prof Matthew Loose, a co-author of the research from the University of Nottingham.Loose noted that in the UK there could be a lag of eight weeks or longer between surgery and the full results of genetic tests, delaying the confirmation of a diagnosis and hence treatment such as chemotherapy.Writing in the journalNeuro-Oncology, Loose and colleagues report how they harnessed what is known as nanopore technology to cut this timeframe.The approach is based on devices that contain membranes featuring hundreds to thousands of tiny pores, each of which has an electric current passing through it. When DNA approaches a pore it is “unzipped” into single strands; as a strand passes through the pore it disrupts the electric current.Crucially, the different building blocks of DNA – and modifications to them – disrupt the current in characteristic ways, allowing the DNA to be “read”, or sequenced. These sequences are then compared against those relating to different types of brain tumours, using a software program built by the team.Loose said the process costs about £400 per sample – on a par with current genetic testing.GraphicThe researchers first trialled the approach on 30 samples that had previously been extracted from patients, before using it on 50 samples at the time they were removed.They said 24 (80%) and 45 (90%) of these samples respectively were fully and correctly classified by the new approach after 24 hours, a success rate on a par with traditional genetic testing methods.However, 38 (76%) of the 50 samples that were prospectively collected were confidently classified within one hour, meaning the time from sample removal to surgeons having the results could be as little as two hours.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Young people’s health has reached a “tipping point”, the authors warned.By 2030, 464 million young people will be living with obesity or overweight, up 143 million from 2015, the report by theLancet commission on adolescent health and wellbeingforecasts.Becoming obese under age of 30 ‘raises risk of early death by at least 75%’Read moreThe burden of excess weight is already being disproportionately felt in high-income countries; Latin America and the Caribbean; and north Africa and the Middle East, where more than a third of 10- to 24-year-olds are living with overweight or obesity.The report also found a “significant decline” in young people’s mental health, and said the climate crisis posed “significant new threats” to their health.“Today’s adolescents are the first cohort of humans who will live their entire life experiencing the growing reverberations of climate change,” the authors noted. The review calculated that by 2100, 1.9 billion adolescents would be living with the effects of global heating, which bring “catastrophic risks” to their wellbeing such as heat-related illness and food and water insecurity.Areas in which some progress had been made included substance misuse, with the proportion of 10- to 24-year-olds smoking or drinking alcohol declining in every region. The number of young people not in education, work or training also reduced, the report found. But “progress has been undermined by the Covid-19 pandemic and a chronic lack of funding”, the authors noted.Prof Sarah Baird, from George Washington University in the US and co-chair of the Lancet commission, said: “The health and wellbeing of adolescents worldwide is at a tipping point … Investing in the health and wellbeing of young people is crucial for safeguarding our collective future.”The report concluded: “Without political will, policy initiatives and financial investment … large numbers of adolescents will grow up with poor health.”Dr Anshu Banerjee, director of maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and ageing at the WorldHealthOrganization, said: “Advancing the health and rights of young people is the foundation of a better future for us all. From ending child marriage to tackling the mental health crisis and obesity, we must confront both old and emerging threats to their health.“Every young person deserves access to essential health services and information – without stigma or discrimination. As backlash against gender equality grows and harmful commercial influences spread, standing up for young people’s health and rights is more urgent than ever. These problems do not know national boundaries, neither should our solutions. This is why international collaboration to promote, protect, maintain and restore young people’s health and wellbeing is more important than ever.”Johanna Ralston, the chief executive of the WorldObesityFederation, said: “This commission makes clear what many of us have long warned: the health of the world’s adolescents is being undermined by failing food and health systems.“The rise in obesity and related diseases is not just a matter of individual choices – it’s the result of environments flooded with health-harming products including ultra-processed food, alongside policies that fail to protect young people.“Governments must act urgently to create healthier food and health systems and prioritise adolescent wellbeing in national health strategies.”Explore more on these topicsObesityYoung peopleHealthClimate crisisMental healthChildren's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Labour backbenchers claim more than 100 colleagues have signed a private letter telling party whips they are unable to support it.In a speech to the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, Kendall will argue for the need to restrict eligibility for some benefits, insisting that without urgent intervention the cost of the system will run out of control.“Unless we ensure public money is focused on those with the greatest need and is spent in ways that have the best chance of improving people’s lives, the welfare state simply won’t be there for people who really need it in the future,” she will say.“That is why we are grasping the nettle of welfare reform. Not for the sake of it, but to save it.”Disability benefit cuts to hit 700,000 families already in poverty, DWP forecasts showRead moreThe cost of the welfare state has been broadly stable in recent years at about 10% of GDP, but spending on disability benefits has risen sharply.The cutswere announcedin the run-up to Rachel Reeves’s spring statement, as the Treasury cast about for savings to ensure its independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, could show the chancellor was still on course to hit herself-imposed fiscal rules.Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, acknowledged that with an ageing population and some parts of the welfare safety net fraying, change was necessary.However, she stressed: “Reform should consider the whole population – from low-income working families to wealthy pensioners – and be driven by the goal of improving livelihoods, rather than a rush to hit fiscal rules.”Scepticism about the plans among Labour MPs has intensified since the party’sdisastrous performancein the local elections, which many blamed on the unpopularity of welfare cuts and the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance.Some of those threatening to rebel over the changes are committed Keir Starmer loyalists. The 100 backbenchers said to have signed the letter are described by MPs as broadly distinct from the 42 who signed a public statement this monthcalling the package “impossible to support”.The government’sown impact assessmentshowed that the cuts to the personal independence payment (Pip) and the health element of universal credit would result in 3.2m households losing an average of £1,720 a year in benefits.Analysis by the Disability Poverty Campaign Group,circulated among Labour MPs, pointed to more than 200 of them whose majority is smaller than the number of Pip claimants in their constituency.Kendall is keen to focus more attention on the £1.8bn in additional spending on back-to-work measures, which forms the other part of the package she fought for in negotiations with the Treasury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To give people a better future. To create the jobs and opportunities, and decent public services, people need to build a better life.”However, labour market experts have warned that any increase in employment as a result of the additional support is likely to be dwarfed by the impact of the cuts.Stephen Evans, the chief executive of the Learning and Work Institute thinktank, said: “The employment support will get a significant number of people into work and it will save the taxpayer money, so it’s a good thing to do, and it’s substantial: it’s almost doubling the amount that is being spent now. It will genuinely make a difference. But it cannot plausibly offset the 3.2 million people having cuts to their benefits.”The thinktank estimates that between 45,000 and 95,000 people are likely to find work as a result of the extra spending – but warns that this is hard to predict, given the government has not yet laid out how it will allocate the money.Meanwhile, Resolution Foundation analysis of data published by Kendall’s department shows the groups hit hardest by the Pip cuts in particular are likely to be the over-50s and those with musculoskeletal conditions, including back pain and arthritis.These are the groups that are more likely to score less than four points in the eligibility test for the daily living component of Pip – the new threshold set under the changes. Almost 80% of claimants with back pain, 77% with arthritis and 68% with chronic pain syndromes failed to score four points in any category, for example.Explore more on these topicsBenefitsDisabilityWelfareLabournewsShareReuse this content"

This is the big question in Britain at the moment and the winners wrote brilliantly about these very people.”Starmer pays tribute to Andrew Norfolk, who exposed child sexual abuse scandalRead moreButler, the Guardian’s social policy editor, told the Private Eye podcast: “This is a story about injustices in the benefits system and how these injustices have inflicted debt, misery and untold stress on some of the most vulnerable and poorest people in our society who have dedicated their lives to looking after loved ones.”Halliday, the north of England editor, said: “When you speak to these people it really affects you. This is devastating sums of money, people who are already living extremely difficult lives, trying to do their best, coping with the ongoing trauma of caring for a loved one.”Padraig Reidy, chair of the judges, said: “This was an enraging and heartbreaking campaign on behalf of a group the government has called ‘unsung heroes’.“You couldn’t read these articles without thinking of the Post Office scandal – another story of ordinary, decent people persecuted by an uncaring bureaucracy.

He added that Republicans had agreed to allocate $25bn in initial funding and Canada had expressed an interest in taking part.“Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world, and even if they are launched from space,” Trump said, “forever ending the missile threat to the American homeland.”US army parade could cost up to $45m and involve 6,600 soldiersRead moreWhat exactly the Golden Dome will look like remains unclear. Trump has not yet decided which of three options proposed by the defense department he wants to pursue. Pentagon officials recently drafted three proposals – small, medium and large – for Trump to consider.The proposals all broadly combine ground-based missile interceptors currently used by theUS militarywith more ambitious and hi-tech systems to build a space-based defense program.The option that Trump chooses will determine its timeline and cost. The $25bn coming from Republicans’ budget bill is only set to cover initial development costs. The final price tag could exceed $540bn over the next two decades, according to the congressional budget office.Trump said on Tuesday evening that he had settled on “architecture” for the project and suggested the total cost of putting it into service would reach $175bn, but gave no specifics.

The project’s baseline capabilities are set to depend on existing systems including the Thaad and Aegis Ashore systems made by Lockheed Martin and Patriot surface-to-air missiles made by Raytheon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, the Defense Intelligence Agency released an assessment that said China has about 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles, Russia has 350 and North Korea has a handful.Initially, the White House had named the options for a space-based missile defense system “Moonshot Plus” and “Moonshot Plus Plus”. They were later renamed by Hegseth to be called silver, gold and platinum-dome options based on the three tiers, two former Pentagon officials said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS militarySpaceTrump administrationPete HegsethSpaceXUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The promenade is home to a gaggle of evening sunbathers while the steps to the beach club contain neither fans nor protesters. It is what is known in the trade as a soft relaunch.Spacey is guest of honour at the Better World Fund’s gala dinner, where he is receiving a lifetime achievement award for “excellence in film and television”. It marks a return to the limelight for the two-time Oscar-winner, whose career stalled after allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by more than 30 men. This is the actor’s first visit to Cannes since 2016, one year before the #MeToo movement began.Inside the hotel beach club, the photographers jockey for position and complain of the party’s lack of celebrity wattage. The more enterprising guests hold up their phones with their names displayed. The others risk going entirely unrecognised. “There’s no guest list,” one photographer grumbles to his friend. “Who even are these people?”Spacey’s gala dinner is a breakaway event, not officially sanctioned by theCannes film festival, although it takes place at the nearby Carlton hotel, the centrepiece berth for the event’s A-list guests. The Better World Fund is a charitable foundation set up by the American entrepreneur Ted Turner, with a focus on the arts and a mission to “build a more secure, prosperous world”.One of its longstanding supporters is the Indian-American film-maker Mira Nair, the director of Salaam Bombay! and Monsoon Wedding. On arriving, Nair says that she only learned of Spacey’s invitation the day before. Asked if she is happy that the actor has been invited to the party, she says: “I can say that I’m happy that I’ve been invited to the party. I’m happy that people are here, being honoured.”When Spacey belatedly appears on the red carpet, the photographers surge forward and knock over the cordon. Tables are upset and champagne glasses smashed. “Thank you for coming,” he says, maintaining a stiff rictus smile, before pausing for a brief word with a TV crew. The actor ignores all further questions and is quickly steered past the gathered reporters. His gaze is fixed like a limpet on the dinner tables inside.Out on the prom, one lone demonstrator has now set up camp. Ramiro Magalhães is a Brazilian climate change activist who is in Cannes to protest against the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. He has a push-cart made up as a hospital stretcher, with the charred bough of a tree playing the role of the patient. Magalhães says he has never heard of Spacey. “I don’t know any actors,” he says. “Is he a good actor?”Spacey, 65, is in Cannes for business as well as pleasure. He is starring in a low-budget independent thriller, The Awakening, that is being sold to foreign buyers inside the festival’s Marché du Film. The Awakening’s writer, producer and star, Matt Hookings, this week told reporters the actor’s attendance at the gala dinner was part of a “guerrilla marketing” campaign to promote the film. “If anyone speaks to him, he could say he’s in Cannes and receiving an award,” Hookings said. “But he’s also here with The Awakening, so the film gets plugged.”Inside the beach club, the guests take their seats for the dinner. Spacey will be hoping that the gala signals a new dawn. But out on the beach the sun was going down.Explore more on these topicsKevin SpaceyCannes film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Those people love karaoke so much that they want it in their family car.This was not something the European mind could comprehend a few years ago, according to Volkswagen’s chief financial officer, Arno Antlitz. Yet the technology, included in electric cars sold by China’s BYD and Xpeng, is just one example of the lessons that Volkswagen and its European counterparts have had to learn as they scramble to keep up with Chinese rivals on track to dominate the global electric car market.“Nobody in Wolfsburg thinks you need karaoke in the car,” said Antlitz last week at a conference run by the Financial Times. “But you do need it.”View image in fullscreenAn Xpeng G6 family SUV on a test in London.Photograph: Jasper Jolly/The GuardianA decade ago, such humility from the world’s second-largest carmaker would have been surprising. Few people in Europe had driven Chinese brands, which were associated with shoddy workmanship. The global industry was dominated by longer-standing car-making countries led by Germany, France and the UK in Europe, and Japan and South Korea in Asia. Yet the advent of batteries offered a clear run for Chinese manufacturers – with huge state subsidies – to try todominate the nascent electric vehicle industry.They have seized the opportunity. Chinese brands achieved more than 10% share of European battery EV sales in some months of 2024, according to data from Matthias Schmidt, an electric car analyst – although that fell back to 7.7% in February. But the scale of China’s home market is unrivalled, with 12.8m battery and hybrid cars sold in China in 2024 – more than the entirety of the European car market.China’s rapid progress took rivals by surprise, particularly after technological leaps during the years of coronavirus pandemic isolation.Bentley boss Frank-Steffen Wallisertold the FT conference that the technology presented to the world at the Shanghai motor show in 2023 “was kind of a shock coming back after the cold pause”.Chinese carmakers are increasingly racing towards a future in which the car is completely integrated with the rest of users’ digital lives and does most of the driving itself. Of the western carmakers, Tesla is still the leader on this front, but it ceded its technology lead to China’s BYD while its chief executive, Elon Musk, focused on getting Donald Trump elected as US president. Despite Musk’s support, Trump’s policies areexpected to leave America’s carmakers far behind.Chris McNally, an analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, wrote last week, in a note to clients, after visiting the latest Shanghai show, that “investors have yet to grasp just how far ahead China may be” when it comes to the future of the car. He cited the experience of sitting in massage seats in the Aito M8 luxury SUV, watching a film on a retractable projector screen while Huawei computer chips handled the driving. That was all available for half the price of a western luxury competitor.The global market share of the big three carmakers in each of Detroit, Germany and Japan has dropped from 74% to 60% in five years, McNally said. “If you are a US/EU manufacturer and do not have a plan to come to market with an affordable/scaled EV in next five years, you may be out of business in the 2030s.”He added: “Is the game lost for western manufacturers? We can only say they appear down big at an auto evolutionary half-time.”View image in fullscreenThe Shanghai motor show in April.Photograph: Go Nakamura/ReutersBYD’s Seagullhas ruffled featherswith a price of about £6,000 in China – far below any rival but with autonomous technology, dubbed “God’s Eye”, which matches that available on much more expensive cars. It has achieved that price by using heavier sodium ion batteries that sacrifice range for affordability, but it is still a stark illustration of what European manufacturers are up against.Chinese carmakers are on average able to develop cars at 27% of the cost of European rivals, according to analysis by Bain & Company, a consultancy.It is not just at the cut-price end. Chinese manufacturers were out in force at a test day last week run by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a UK lobby group. BYD’s new £33,300 Seal U DM-i, a plug-in hybrid family SUV, is going up against Volkswagen, whose plug-in hybrid Tiguan can be £10,000 more expensive.State-owned Chery (under the Omoda and Jaecoo brands) was accompanied by Leapmotor, Geely (owner of the Volvo, Polestar and Smart brands), and Xpeng – whose electric G6 was the first from the brand to make it to the UK. On a week’s test, the Guardian found a wealth of driver assistance features and a smart, spacious interior that rival the Tesla Model Y – even if some reviewers found the ride a little too bouncy.All of them offer keenly priced cars with little to separate them from European rivals, with relatively smooth rides and often impressive voice assistants that allow a driver to open the sunroof without taking their eyes off the road. One of the most popular vehicles for test was the ferociously quick MG Cyberster electric sports car, made by state-owned SAIC.There has been some sign of a fightback from Europe. The Renault 5, starting at £23,000, has already achieved huge popularity as one of the first affordable European-made electric cars. Renault has taken pains to cut the production cost of the vehicle as much as possible, and it has been rewarded with huge popularity – although it is unclear how profitable the model will be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Volkswagen has invested in Xpeng (or more properly, Xiaopeng), Stellantis is selling Leapmotor cars in Europe, and is expected to use its technology, while purportedly Scandinavian brands Volvo and Polestar will rely more and more on technology from their owner, China’s Geely.Britain’s JLR is working with Chery to make cheaper vehicles under the previously retired Land Rover Freelander brand. Those cars, due to launch late in 2026, “have the potential to go global”, according to JLR boss Adrian Mardell. Nissan boss Iván Espinosa suggested the Japanese carmaker couldbuild Chinese cars in Sunderland, north-east England, to use spare capacity.Even if they wanted to, avoiding Chinese tech is next to impossible for many companies: batteries are mostly made in China, with some competitors in Japan and South Korea. Europe’s battery champion, Northvolt, collapsed. Meanwhile, BYD revealed in March that its new batteries could add 250 miles of range in five minutes of charging, only forChinese rival CATLto say it could do more than 300 miles in the same amount of time. Shares in CATL jumped by 16% on their stock market debut in Hong Kong on Tuesday.Europe has some defensive strengths. There are huge networks of dealerships – still the preferred model of purchases – and garages who can carry out maintenance. That will slow down the advance of Chinese brands.“The European buyer is actually a very conservative buyer, very loyal to their car brands,” said Eric Zayer, who leads on automotive in Europe at Bain & Company. “It is very hard for the Chinese to enter Europe and replicate the success.”He added that buyers will need to be persuaded that Chinese brands are not going to disappear –as happened to US electric brand Fisker– causing chaos for owners of vehicles built with regular software updates in mind.European bosses insist that the game is not lost, even if it is clear that China is at the very least going to win a significant chunk of the global automotive market.Bentley’s Walliser said the “Chinese are better at risk taking, quicker, working harder” and embracing new technologies. “It’s not magic,” he said. “It could also be done here.”Luca de Meo, Renault’s chief executive, said: “We have to not underestimate the resilience of our automotive companies.”Explore more on these topicsChinaChinese economyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoringSelf-driving carsAutomotive industryAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is recognition that is 370 years in the makingRaphael Rashidin Damyang county, South KoreaTue 20 May 2025 19.38 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 20.30 EDTShareIn the lush foothills of Damyang county, South Jeolla province, rows of earthenware jars stand under the Korean sky. Inside each clay vessel, a quiet transformation is taking place, one that has been occurring on this land for centuries.This is the domain of Ki Soon-do, South Korea’s solegrand master of traditional aged soy sauce, where patience isn’t just a virtue but the essential ingredient in her craft.“Here, try this,” Ki says, removing the heavy lid from one of the 1,200 pots. She dips a ladle into the dark liquid, releasing a complex aroma. “Smell it first, then taste just a droplet.”The flavour unfolds slowly, first salty, then deeply savoury, with hints of something almost floral. It bears little resemblance to the bottles labelled “soy sauce” in western supermarkets.“Korean traditional soy sauce needs three things: soybeans, water and salt,” Ki explains. “And care and time. Without time, there is no flavour. In modern life, everyone is rushing. But some things cannot be rushed.”View image in fullscreenMaster Ki carefully breaks down lumps in doenjang (fermented soybean paste), ensuring consistent texture before the next stage of ageing.Photograph: Raphael Rashid/The GuardianAt 75, Ki is the 10th-generation custodian of her family’s sauce-making legacy. When she married into a prestigious family at 23, she inherited not just a household but the responsibility for preserving fermentation techniques dating back 370 years.Ki is a traditionaljangmaker, a term that describes a family of fermented soybean condiments that season virtually every Korean dish: ganjang (soy sauce), doenjang (soybean paste), and gochujang (fermented chilli paste). These aren’t just seasonings but the foundational flavours that define Korean cuisine.‘My face is leaking’: taste testing the spicy ramen deemed too dangerous for DenmarkRead more“Our jang and doenjang are like the roots of Korean people,” Ki says firmly. “When we talk about Korean food, we’re talking about jang. Without it, you cannot call it Korean cuisine.”What began as a domestic obligation for Ki has since transformed into a mission to safeguard a cornerstone of Korean culinary heritage. In December 2024, after years of dedicated work by Ki and other traditional jang makers, their craft wasofficially recognised by Unescoas an intangible cultural heritage of humanity, a testament to generations of meticulous preservation.‘We begin only after bathing to purify ourselves’Unlike mass-produced commercial sauces and pastes, Ki’s process begins in winter when soybeans are boiled, crushed and shaped into blocks called meju.View image in fullscreenA block of meju, made from crushed soybeans and fermented with beneficial bacteria, forms the foundation of Korean jang-making culture.Photograph: Raphael Rashid/The GuardianView image in fullscreenMeju blocks float in brine made with water drawn from 160-metre-deep wells and bamboo salt. Red chillies for sterilisation, charcoal for purification, and jujubes to enhance fermentation surround the fermenting blocks.Photograph: Raphael Rashid/The GuardianThese blocks are tied with rice straw and hung indoors, where the beneficial bacteria from the straw help develop unique flavours during fermentation. After around 50 days, they’re submerged in brine made with bamboo salt, which Ki creates by baking sea salt inside bamboo at high temperatures.“The day for boiling meju must be a good day,” she says. “We begin only after bathing to purify ourselves and saying prayers. This requires extraordinary devotion, but our family has followed these same rituals for 370 years. It’s how we’ve always done it.”The resulting solids that sink to the bottom transform into doenjang, while the liquid will become ganjang after around a year of fermentation. The most precious of all is her jinjang, a soy sauce aged for more than five years that has developed a depth of flavour that has captivated top chefs from around the world who have made pilgrimages to her sanctuary.Her dedication gainedinternational attention in 2017when her then 360-year-old “seed sauce” known as ssiganjang, a family heirloom continuously replenished with each year’s best batch (in a way similar to a sourdough starter), was selected to season beef ribs served to then US president Donald Trump during a state banquet. The press marvelled at a sauce that was “older than American history”.Ki also produces gochujang. In the seventh month of the lunar calendar, she ferments meju made specifically for the paste, which is then powdered and mixed with steamed glutinous rice, chilli powder, ganjang, and malt syrup from sprouted barley. Among her creations is a distinctive strawberry gochujang, which uses Damyang strawberries for a natural sweetness that balances the heat and saltiness.View image in fullscreenKi Soon-do checks the colour and aroma of her ganjang (soy sauce), assessing its development through sensory evaluation developed over decades of experience. \"You just know when the flavour won't develop further.\"Photograph: Raphael Rashid/The GuardianKi believes that her devotion to traditional fermented foods has benefited her own health. “I’ve never been hospitalised or taken regular medication,” she says matter-of-factly. “Everyone pursues happiness, and to be happy, you need to be healthy. People now eat fast food, but fermented foods maintain health. What could be better than that?”Today, Ki works alongside her family, who also help manage their traditional food company. Together, they’re committed to preserving ancient methods while finding ways to share their heritage with a wider audience. To share her traditional knowledge, Ki established a fermentation school in 2023.Changing seasonsYet Ki worries about the future of traditional jang-making. Where once every Korean household had its own jang recipes and jars, today most Koreans reach for factory-produced bottles and tubs.The climate crisis poses another challenge. “Korea used to have four distinct seasons, but winter is shorter, spring passes quickly, and summer is long,” Ki laments. The heat affects fermentation, turning doenjang darker and accelerating moisture loss. Unwanted bacteria proliferate in the warmer temperatures, forcing adaptations.“We used to make larger meju, but too many different bacteria would grow,” she says. “So we cut the meju size in half to shorten the fermentation time. I’ve also planted balsam flowers around the pots to provide shade during the summer. If the climate continues to warm, we may need to move our jang to cooler storage places.”Beyond her own productions, Ki sees herself as part of a broader struggle to preserve cultural knowledge in an age of convenience. The Unesco recognition of jang-making as an intangible cultural heritage has given her both pride and a sense of responsibility.As the afternoon light casts shadows across her precious jars, Ki reflects on her life’s work. “This isn’t just about jang,” she says. “It was my fate to inherit this tradition, and it has become my destiny to preserve it.”Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaFoodAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet in the aftermath of four days of cross-border drones and missile strikes – themost technologically advancedconflict either side has ever engaged in – the question remains: what now?While both India and Pakistanhave claimed victory, some experts fear that a return to hostilities is almost inevitable.There is a sense among analysts and diplomats that Delhi has not emerged from the conflict as triumphant as it had hoped, leaving little room for further de-escalation or political engagement. In a speech last week, India’s prime minister,Narendra Modi, insistedthat the military offensive against Pakistani terror groups, named Operation Sindhoor, was still continuing and that the ceasefire was simply a pause.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s army, after going through a period of reputational decline, is once again the country’s most revered institution – proving that nothing works better for the fortunes of Pakistan’s generals than an altercation with India.Pakistan’s use of J-10C jets and missiles exposes potency of Chinese weaponryRead more“India has made it clear they are still on a state of alert,” said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for south Asia at the Chatham House thinktank. He was sceptical that India’s missile strikes into Pakistan had done much to deter any future militant attacks, which India’s defence minister said would be taken as an “act of war”.“With the hyper-nationalist rhetoric we are still seeing from both sides, it seems like there’s limited space for any lasting rapprochement,” said Bajpaee.‘The India-Pakistan hyphenation’While India is seen to have achieved some tactical victories – successfully targeting known militant bases in Pakistan, firing targeted missiles into Rawalpindi, the heart of Pakistan’s military and largely rebuffing Pakistani missiles – the strategic wins have been more elusive.Instead, India is now grappling with some more uncomfortable outcomes. As noted by Pratap Bhanu Mehta, an Indian political scientist, in hisIndian Express column, the armed conflict has “no decisive victory and no clear political end simply reinstates the India-Pakistan hyphenation” – a reference to an age-old tendency to lump the two countries together as a singular quarrelling entity on the international stage. In recent years, as India soared ahead of Pakistan and positioned itself as a global economic and geopolitical superpower, there was a feeling in the corridors of New Delhi that they had broken free of the hyphenation burden. However, recent events showed that perceptions, particularly in the US, had not changed much.Among diplomats and observers, the view was that India had been left on the back foot in the critical battle over narrative.The deep-rooted instinct of the Modi government to tightly control the flow of information (Modi has not done an in-person press conference in 10 years) meant that as Operation Sindhoor was launched, their accounts of the operation were limited to a few brief, highly choreographed press conferences led by civil servants.In Pakistan meanwhile, ministers were at the end of the phone and on TV news shows non-stop, briefing the world constantly on the Pakistani version of events, such as claims that Pakistan had downed five Indian military jets. The Modi government has still not publicly responded to the allegation, but instead put pressure on Indian news outlets to avoid any mention of the alleged downed planes.Amid vast information gaps left by the Indian government an unprecedented amount of misinformation and disinformation proliferated. False claims fuelled an insatiable appetite for war among the Indian public.As a result, on 10 May, whenDonald Trumpabruptly announced a ceasefire before India or Pakistan had a chance, it was met with a widespread reaction of betrayal and anger in India. Many could not understand why the government would agree to a ceasefire, let alone one that seemed to have been imposed by the US. The fury among the hyper-nationalist far right – Modi’s political base and where much of the disinformation originated – was particularly potent and the clamour for a return to war has still not entirely dissipated.Trump interventions add insult to injuryTrump’s boastful claims of brokering the ceasefire have been a source of frustration to New Delhi. While he joins a long line of US presidents who have been drawn into disputes between the neighbours, it is historically done far more discreetly and largely on terms favourable to India.This time, India was so infuriated at Trump’s version of events, including that coercion over trade led both sides to lay down arms, that it openly repudiated several of the president’s statements.Trump’s involvement has also resulted in another strategic upset for India: the re-internationalisation of the Kashmir issue. India’s immovable position is that its dispute with Pakistan over the region, whichdates back to 1947, is a purely internal issue that should have no outside interference or third-party negotiation. But in flagrant disregard for this, Trump offered, post-ceasefire, to mediate between the two countries to find a “solution”. Pakistan leapt at the offer; in India it was met with stony silence.The Indian political strategist Brahma Chellaney accused Trump of “playing right into the hands of Pakistan which has long weaponised theKashmirissue to justify its export of terror”.Much remains up in the air between the two sides. The land border between the countries is still closed and both sides are still denying visas. Perhaps most critically, the Indus River treaty, which ensures Pakistan gets a vital supply of river water from India, remainssuspended by New Delhi.But while among the political class in Islamabad there is optimistic chatter of post-ceasefire talks in the Gulf or London – where even Kashmir could be on the table – New Delhi has avoided the subject. “The dilemma is that this war does not compel negotiations. Nor is it likely to build even a modicum of trust that can allow a political negotiation,” wrote Mehta.On a deeper, existential level, analysts say there remains little incentive on either side to de-escalate. In India, anti-Pakistan fervour has only driven up support for Modi and helped his strongman Hindu nationalist government win elections. In Pakistan, the ever-present threat of India has long been used to justify the dominating role of the military in running the country.Bajpaee is among those who has a pessimistic view of any suggestion of post-conflict political dialogue between the two countries, calling that a “dead end” as both sides are “essentially talking past each other”.“It seems very unlikely that we’re going to see any sort of credible peace process,” he said. “Frankly, at this point I would say it’s not a question of if, but when we will see a resumption of some sort of military hostilities between both countries.”Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaPakistanSouth and central AsiaDonald TrumpTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

For the first time, programming at the venue’s flagship Wire festival, in its fourth edition, would extend from Friday evening to Sunday evening: 50 straight hours of music, presented by some of the world’s best in the electronic underground. The prospect of such a long stretch filled the space with an air of both commitment and mania; some local nightlife regulars I greeted throughout the weekend would stay for periods up to 15 hours. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” a friend reminded me as we settled in, canned yerba mates in hand.Split payments and second jobs: how music festival fans afford soaring costsRead moreJuliana Huxtable, the multidisciplinary artist who splits her time betweenNew Yorkand Berlin, and DJ Stingray 313, a techno futurist who came up with the genre’s originators in mid-1980s Detroit, established the festival’s intrepid tone on the main stage. While perhaps less outwardly sensual than Huxtable’s usual entries, it was no less provocative as it zigzagged between terrifying noise and playful electro. The pairing of the two iconoclasts — as well as curation from queer parties such as Berlin’s Pornceptual, Amsterdam’s Sprielraum, and the annual Whole festival in Germany — exemplified the aims of Wire co-founders Téa Abashidze and GeGa Japaridze (also the masterminds behind the club Basement) to “promote cultural exchange” by connecting local icons with international talent from countries where there is more government funding for dance music. “One of the main goals for Wire festival is to help electronic music come back to the US [where it was invented], and have it be the primary place for it to reside,” Japaridze said.View image in fullscreenBerlin’s D Dan and DJ Tool delivered one of the weekend’s most transcendent moments in the wee hours of Saturday.Photograph: Giorgi ZatiashviliThe resulting lineup, which notably did not include any figureheads made famous by the likes of TikTok and other mainstream channels, has made Wire a necessary festival in maintaining New York’s reputation as a techno destination, which has arguably fizzled in the past decade. Some of the city’s most exciting emerging talents – such as Morenxxx, who has gained an underground following for their world-hopping, relentlessly fast sets, and Makadsi, the Lebanon-born DJ who happens to be Beyoncé’s creative director – were tasked with opening each evening, establishing that the scene is far from dead.However, the musicdidshockingly stop when a wannabe DJstormed the barricade, removing a USB from the decks during D Dan and DJ Tool’s set, in a supposed attempt to take over the show. In the couple minutes of jarring silence, the man struggled with security as he sat atop the equipment; these are new risks as venues increasingly opt for setups where spectators can hover closely behind the DJ, made popular by streamers such asBoiler Room. The Berlin mainstays eventually recovered, delivering one of the weekend’s most transcendent moments in the wee hours of Saturday morning. At that same time, Berlin’s Boris and New York’s Volvox began commanding the decks in stage two’s smaller space to a freaky throng of mostly shirtless meatheads who made the air so thick it was as if the room itself was sweating. While the festival crowd was overall more considerate – and willing to move their bodies – than attenders at a club, the festival also didn’t sell food at night, making it feel like a larger-scale version of a regular night at the rave; I subsisted off fig bars and electrolyte packets I had stashed in my hip bag until eventually going home at 7am to eat breakfast.The next evening the Turkish DJ Bashkka broke open the weekend’s bro-y vibes with her mix of sassy, pop-sampling techno in the smaller room, just as the sun started creeping into the windows. This intimacy was a necessary counterpoint to the main stage’s expansiveness – which welcomed grimy, head-screwing sets from Planetary Assault Systems and DVS1, some of the genre’s most influential, as well as early morning trance from Dutch star Ki/Ki. The ambient stage also offered respite, as a standout set from Japanese legend Wata Igarashi and a live flute performance from Concrete Husband warped time in a different way. Amid incense smoke and overlapping limbs stretched across astroturf, I felt like my skin could eventually grow moss if I stayed long enough. At its most packed, I heard a man at the crowded entrance say: “I’m not nearly high enough for this,” before promptly turning around. A kind woman assisted me in some stretches, and I took naps on a beanbag to stay alive.View image in fullscreenBy Sunday morning, an overwhelming sense of optimism filled the backyard ruins – a feeling that could only come from greeting the day alongside a mass of strangers.Photograph: Giorgi ZatiashviliBy Sunday morning, Octo Octa and Eris Drew, New Hampshire-based founders of the label T4T LUV NRG, carried through the overwhelming sense of optimism – a feeling that could only come from greeting the day alongside a mass of strangers – with their love-drenched mixing of well-researched house vinyls in the center’s backyard called the ruins. I downed an overpriced grilled cheese while reveling in the 8am breeze. The DJs that would follow – the Carry Nation, Mike Servito, and Massimiliano Pagliara – are known for playing the kind of house and disco that draws in a mostly white, gay, male crowd, who surely did take over the festival as it hurtled towards a full-send closing set from Copenhagen’s Schacke as the sun went down. I wondered if the vibes could have been diversified if there had been some swaps from Saturday’s lineup with some of New York’s other beloved selectors: Dee Diggs, Kilopatrah Jones, and Kevin Aviance.After a total of 20 hours at Wire, I only began to feel my joints ache once I stopped dancing; the music and the energy from the dancers around you could bring you to a state that was beyond human, machinelike. This was the beauty of techno, a genre invented in the face of Detroit’s declining automotive industry byBlack technicians imagining a post-industrial future. After doing my time at the dance factory, I took my creaking body home, where I could still feel the echo of a steady bass drum keeping tempo within me.Explore more on these topicsMusic festivalsNew YorkDance musicFestivalsElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is that a problem?Dreading the thought of giving a speech, or stressed about a big work event? Your GP may prescribe beta blockers to reduce the effects of adrenaline on your heart. Here’s what happened when I took themPolly HudsonTue 20 May 2025 05.00 EDTShareIfirst took beta blockers two years ago, when I was asked to give a eulogy. Terrible at public speaking on a good day, let alone at a funeral, my first instinct was to refuse to do it. I had made a speech at a friend’s wedding 15 years before and my legs shook so violently throughout that I thought I would collapse. This isn’t a case of being overcritical or dramatic: I find it almost impossible to stand up in front of a crowd and talk. It is an ordeal, for all involved – or it was before I took beta blockers.Beta blockers are a prescription medication that blocks adrenaline and therefore temporarily reduces the body’s reaction to stress. Routinely given to patients with heart and circulatory conditions, including angina, atrial fibrillation and high blood pressure, as well as to prevent migraines, they are also prescribed for some kinds of anxiety. Some doctors will suggest taking them regularly, at certain times of the day. Others will suggest taking a specified dose when you feel you need it. “They work by reducing the effects of adrenaline on the heart, so you don’t get that heart-racing feeling, you may not get short of breath or sweaty, and they can reduce the symptoms of a full-blown panic attack,” says doctor and broadcaster Amir Khan, who has been a GP in Bradford for 16 years.Prescriptions for anti-anxiety medication have soared in recent years – driven mainly byincreases among women and young people. According to a 2022 study by the University of Bristol’s medical school, which looked at prescriptions issued for anxiety between 2003 and 2018, for every man prescribed beta blockers, there were 2.33 women. The reasons for the uptick in prescriptions are complex – butGPs interviewed for the studysuggested that women and young people tend to be more open about anxiety. Also, beta blockers are generally considered lower risk and quicker-acting than other anxiety medications such as benzodiazepines, which are known to be addictive, and antidepressants, which can come with side effects. Patients did not consider beta blockers as “mental health drugs”, the study found, and therefore perceived them as “less stigmatising”.There has also been a cultural shift – celebrities including the actor Kristen Bell,Khloé Kardashianand cook Prue Leith have all spoken about taking beta blockers. When Robert Downey Jr went to collect his Golden Globe for Oppenheimer, he told the audience: “I took a beta blocker so this will be a breeze.” The writer and actor Sharon Horgan toldLouis Theroux on his podcast recently: “They do something very practical, physically, but I think the sort of mental stuff that goes with it … has had a real calming effect on me, and in situations that would normally kind of terrify me.”Beta blockers are generally considered lower risk and quicker-acting than other anxiety medicationsIt was a friend who suggested I try beta blockers for the funeral. She had been taking them on and off for years, although this was the first I had heard about it. “I’m not ashamed that I take them, but I also don’t need to advertise it,” she says. “I suppose I’m worried people would think it meant I’m not coping with life. I don’t know. But most people largely keep their medications to themselves, don’t they? It’s private.”Well, yes, but once I told a few people that I was thinking of taking beta blockers, it was like a domino effect, with more and more of them revealing they had taken them, either for specific events or just now and then.“I never leave home without them,” another friend tells me. “I bet I’m far from the only frazzled mum at the school gates who has them.”Someone else I know takes them for perimenopausal anxiety, instead of upping her HRT, which could be another way to remedy the symptom. She says: “I’m also trying wild swimming, yoga and meditation. I’m really being proactive, not just leaping to drugs. But beta blockers work well for me.”Despite the anecdotal evidence, the University of Bristol study says there is “no conclusive evidence” for the effectiveness of beta blockers for anxiety. They do not feature in guidance from the National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence (Nice) on treating anxiety. So why do doctors prescribe them?“Although beta blockers can help with some of the physical symptoms of anxiety, they don’t treat the biology behind it,” says Khan. Instead, he says, Nice recommends a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which work by boosting levels of serotonin – known as the “happy hormone” – in the brain, alongside talking therapy, especially for those with generalised anxiety disorder.“Saying this, many GPs and prescribers use beta blockers for situational anxiety – when you know you are going to be in a situation where you are likely to become anxious,” says Khan. “So, ‘if and when’ rather than long term.”When I spoke to my GP, she said she prescribed beta blockers relatively often, to people who had to do big presentations at work, or lawyers about to make their closing speech in a trial. She advised me to have a practice run rather than trying them for the first time on the day of the funeral. Within 10 minutes of taking them, I felt like me, but calm. When I gave the eulogy, I was as fine as anyone could be in those circumstances.Like most medications, beta blockers are not suitable for everyone. Dr Adrian Hayter, medical director for clinical policy at the Royal College of General Practitioners, says: “GPs take a holistic approach to assessing their patients and proposing treatment plans, in conversation with them. This will take into account a patient’s unique circumstances, the severity of their symptoms and their medical history, as well as possible side-effects and other medication they may be taking.”Side-effects of beta blockers includetiredness, dizziness and difficulties sleepingand they are not suitable for people with asthma. Taking more than your prescribed dose can be dangerous and you could end up in need of urgent treatment in A&E. Khan says: “Beta blockers are not addictive, but if you are taking them long term, you can’t suddenly stop them.” You need to be weaned off them. And he adds: “Interestingly, they have been linked to higher rates of depression, so I wouldn’t prescribe them for anyone who has depression alongside their anxiety.”Khan says that in the broader picture of more and more patients being in contact with mental health services, he is seeing a rise in the number of patients with anxiety, and in particular work-related anxiety. “I don’t think I am specifically prescribing more beta blockers, but I am certainly treating more people for anxiety overall … I think life is becoming harder and harder for so many people that this is manifesting as anxiety.”Last November, I lost the job I had been doing for 20 years, because of budget cuts. As I worked as a freelance, there was no redundancy pay out, just thank you, have a lovely Christmas. From the moment the bombshell was dropped, I felt constantly on the verge of a panic attack, as if sheer blind terror instead of blood was coursing through my veins. As an already anxious person, a phone call out of the blue that shattered my family’s financial security in an instant did not improve my mindset. After a discussion with my doctor, I now take beta blockers three times a day. They are helping to make my life manageable as I navigate my new normal.We did talk about antidepressants instead, which I have taken in the past, but they didn’t feel like the right way to go at this time. The anxiety I was feeling was a reaction to my situation, to circumstances beyond my control, rather than a longer term issue.And while they are working for me at the moment, I hope that I won’t need to take them indefinitely. Hayter says: “Wherever possible, GPs don’t want patients to have to rely on medication long term, and most patients don’t want that either. Best practice is for medication reviews to be held at regular intervals, where GPs and patients discuss whether there are opportunities to reduce the dosage or stop taking medication altogether.”At some point, I’m sure I will feel able to stop taking beta blockers as regularly. But if another stressful public speaking event came up again, I can see myself heading back to my doctor.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingHealthAnxietyDepressionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Westminster is playing catch-upTue 20 May 2025 12.31 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 12.33 EDTShareLike a Hollywood studio churning out the umpteenth sequel in a stale franchise, Westminster has manufactured another episode in the interminable Brexit Wars saga. The Resetis based on the true story of a prime ministernegotiating improved terms of tradewith the EU, against a backdrop of global insecurity and rising economic uncertainty. Many familiar elements of the Brexit cinematic universe are represented: talks that go to the wire; French obstinacy; cries of betrayal from militant Eurosceptics; fish.We have been in this movie before, although each iteration is slightly different. The big plot twist this time is a Labour government that is prepared to say aloud that Brexit inflicted harm on the UK economy, and that closer relations with European neighbours are in the national interest.Keir Starmer hasn’t exactly torn up the old script. His Brussels deal quest has innovative features – defence and security partnership, energy market integration – but it doesn’t stray far from conventional Brexit lore. The substance is still confined to that narrow terrain where economic reality overlaps with domestic political acceptability.The action of The Reset takes place in that valley of magical thinking where frictionless commerce with the European single market is understood to be desirable, but talk of rejoining it is taboo.To his credit, the prime minister has nudged the dial a few notches. He accepts the logic that favourable terms of trade with a huge continental bloc require regulatory alignment, and that streamlining the process – restoring more automatic recognition of common standards – is not a dissolution of national sovereignty tantamount to treason.This is a battle Starmer is prepared to fight. He thinks most British people can tell the difference between eliminating costly paperwork on sausage exports and colonial submission. No one who isn’t already signed up to a Eurosceptic battle re-enactment society will be persuaded to join by the sound of their blood-curdling howls over the past 48 hours.Keir Starmer says ‘hat-trick of deals’ shows Britain is back on world stageRead moreKemi Badenoch was calling Monday’s gathering of EU leaders in London a “surrender summit” before there was even an agreement to denounce. Maybe she thought it sounded like the kind of thing Boris Johnson would say. She couldn’t have anticipated how far off the hinges Johnson hangs these days. He called Starmer “the orange ball-chewing manacled gimp of Brussels”.There is no sequel that could satisfy the hardcore Brexit Warscosplayers. They won and haven’t stopped pining for the struggle ever since. They are victors with no spoils. They cannot say the deal Johnson signed in 2020 is good, but since it gave them everything they wanted, they struggle to say how it might be improved if not by reversal.They accuse Starmer of selling out British fishing fleets when the terms he has agreed are just the existing ones on a longer lease. So the continuity leave argument seems to be that even more of Johnson’s Brexit is a reversal of Brexit. These arenot serious people.The same conclusion has to be drawn from the allergic reaction to talk of a youth mobility scheme. The proposal for a dedicated 18-30s work permit would look much like the model already available to young Australians, Canadians, New Zealanders and South Koreans. But in the paranoid Brexit mind,anymovement of European citizens to the UK – even if controlled with visas and limited by quotas – smells too much like the oldfreemovement.Failure (or, more likely, wilful refusal) to understand what is really being discussed here is dismal enough. The more dispiriting element is an inability to conceive of a world in which young British people might be grateful for an expanded right to travel and work on the continent.When European officials first raised the prospect of youth mobility withLabourministers, they pitched it as a mutual benefit – an obvious win-win. It was received instead as a demand, as if the privilege of living and working in Britain is a precious and exclusive mineral resource that Brussels wants to extract, and for which a price must be paid in concessions elsewhere.Even a Labour government, ostensibly committed to restoring closer ties, struggles to find a vocabulary of reciprocal advantage through continental integration.This is a conceptual barrier to wholehearted participation in the European project that dates back to well before the referendum. It is the plot ofBrexit Wars: Origin Stories–the sting of humiliation through post-imperial decline that made accession to the European Economic Community a necessity in 1973; the edifice of rebate and opt-outs that preserved a culture of transactional separateness; the evolution of conspiracist Europhobic mythologies in the press over many years and the cowardice of successive prime ministers in refusing to confront them.For decades, the facts to support an argument that Britain was stronger in the EU weresubmergedin a swamp of national neurosis – the inferiority complex manifest as self-aggrandising exceptionalism. They never rose to the surface when membership was on the ballot paper in 2016.Selling our sole? Brixham fishers divided on UK’s new EU dealRead moreInstead, leave and remain became proxies for other cultural and economic divisions that could never be settled by Brexit. Nine years later, they are still visible in election results and opinion polls, like a watermark in the post-referendum currency of party political allegiance.The Tories are in desperate trouble because Badenoch can’t compete with Reform UK to consolidate a Brexit-coded electoral coalition, and she won’t reach out to more liberal, centrist voters who feel more at home with the Liberal Democrats.Starmer’s position is stronger in terms of seats currently held but brittle in similar ways. Labour is struggling to reconcile its modern reliance on a remain-dominated voter base with a foundational and nostalgic idea of itself as the natural party of the former industrial working-class heartlands that voted leave.Those electoral faultlines track deep cultural scars, but they don’t have to disfigure politics for ever. Britain is on a more European trajectory as a matter of strategic necessity in a dangerous world. Donald Trump is anunreliable allyand Vladimir Putin is a determined foe. People can see that change in the geopolitical climate, even if the tone of Westminster debate, stuck on the old script, fails to respond with suitable urgency.Solidarity with our continental neighbours is a national mission that transcends the tedious, juvenile idiom of Brexit Wars fandom and the sniffing of treason in renewable fish quotas. Or we have to hope it is. This is the test of The Reset.It won’t be the last episode in a genre shaped by fantasy, but it could be the start of a new storyline where reality fights back.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July join Pippa Crerar, Raf Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government and plans for the next three yearsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This pretty-sounding package of tax breaks and spending cuts is just the latest exampleTue 20 May 2025 07.52 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 11.15 EDTShareWhat’s big, beautiful and kept a lot of Republicans up late on Sunday night? There might be various responses to that question, but the answer I’m looking for isthe One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Coming in at 1,116 pages, the bill isn’t quite War and Peace but it’s definitely big. Whether the mega-package of tax breaks and spending cuts is beautiful, however, is up for debate.And there has certainly been a lot of debate. The bill has been in limbo for a while because a few Republicans who consider themselves “fiscally conservative” are happy with the package’s extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and increased spending for the military and immigration enforcement, but don’t think enough social and climate-related programmes have been slashed to pay for it all. In particular, they want deeper cuts to food stamps andMedicaid, which is a government programme providing health care to low-income people. Late on Sunday, however, in an unusual weekend vote, the hardliners relented a little and the House Budget Committeerevived the bill. It still faces some challenges, but it is now closer to becoming law.If you are in a masochistic mood you can read all 1,116 pages of the bill. But the TLDR is that a more accurate name for the package would be the Screw Poor People and Make the Rich Richer Act. Or the Kick Millions Off Medicaid So a Billionaire Can Buy Another Yacht Act. This isn’t to say that every single element of the package is bad. There is one part, for example, where children under eight are given $1,000 for “Money Accounts for Growth and Investment”, AKA“Maga” savings accounts. In general, though, it’s pretty on-brand for Republicans.The deceitful name is on-brand too. The right is very cunning when it comes to legislative framing: it loves hiding nasty intentions behind noble-sounding names that are difficult to argue with. Emotive words such as “protect” tend to come up a lot. If a bill has “protect” and “women” in its name, you can be sure it’s not about protecting women, but about bullying transgender people. The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025 (which wasblockedby Democrats in the Senate in March), for example, focused on banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. As the National Education Associationsaid at the time, however, it “does nothing to promote equity in resources, funding, or opportunity, or to tackle the sexual abuses of athletes and subsequent cover-ups that have occurred in women’s sports”.Another thing Republicans love to do is to pass entirely unnecessary bills with highly emotive names, in order to amplify misleading information. Take, for example, the rightwing lie (repeatedly amplified by Trump) that Democrats want to execute newborn babies. This is obviously nonsense – infanticide is very much illegal in the US – and is a willful misinterpretation of the fact that doctors may sometimes give palliative care to dying babies. This didn’t stop cynical lawmakers from coming up with theBorn-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act(a bill that has gone through a number ofiterationsbut was passed by House Republicans earlier this year) requiring doctors to provide care for children born alive during an attempted abortion. Again, there are already laws in place that cover this. The bill was completely unnecessary but it gave Republicans a great opportunity to conflate abortion and infanticide. “Tragically, House Democrats opposed the bill, voted for infanticide, and opted to deny medical care to crying newborns on operating tables struggling to live,”Republican House Speaker Mike Johnsonsaid after most Democrats voted against the legislation.Republicans have always understood how to use language to manipulate people far better than the Democrats. You may have forgotten the name Newt Gingrich but the former Republican House Speaker has been anintegral partin the rise of Trumpism and the current culture wars. Back in 1990 his political action committee distributed a pamphlet called “Language: A Key Mechanism of Control” that instructed Republican candidates to learn to “speak like Newt”. Gingrich was very keen on exploiting emotive language andsaying outlandish thingsthat would make headlines and get the media inadvertently amplifying a preferred narrative. The Republican party may now be full of toadies – but you can’t deny they’re all fluent in Newt.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Current lenders will have to agree to write off many billions of pounds’ worth of debt, or have the pain forced upon them. Courts have to sanction the main steps. There is a risk (still) that the whole thing falls apart.But one aspect should have been easy to understand from the outset: if Thames had thoughts of paying bonuses to some of its executives merely for staying on the payroll during the process, the only way to do so would be to get approval in advance from the regulator or government ministers, or both.Why? First, because Thames, at risk of collapse, is a political football like never before and has beenunder special regulatory supervisionsince last summer. Second, because Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has beentaking aim at undeserved bonusesfrom his first day in office. Third, because Ofwat, the regulator, is about to get new powers to block bonuses, as has been known for months. Fourth, because Thames’s board would risk enraging its senior staff if it promised them mega retention payments and then was unable to deliver them.That last scenario is the one that has come to pass. When Sir Adrian Montague, Thames’s chair, revealed the existence of a retention scheme, complete with “very substantial” payments in three stages,to a committee of MPs a week ago, it came as news to both the government and Ofwat. A spokesperson for the formersaid ministers would block the plan. The regulator demanded details.Now the inevitable U-turn has happened. Thames has“decided to pause”the retention scheme while it awaits guidance from Ofwat. Good luck with any resuscitation effort: it is probably doomed already, thanks to the clumsy manner in which Thames has handled this affair.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is a former Treasury official and boardroom veteran with a central role in clearing up two corporate messes of a generation ago, British Energy and Railtrack. It is astonishing that, seemingly, he could not see how the retention payments would cause a political stink.To compound matters, he told the MPs a week ago that it was the class A lenders to Thames, not the company, who had “insisted” on the payments to prevent an exodus of top staff at a bad moment. “To be honest, this is the first time that I have encountered this,” he volunteered. One week on, Montague says he “may have misspoken” when he pinned the scheme on the insistence of the creditors behind a £3bn emergency loan to the company.In the grand scheme of things, this mini-drama won’t affect the restructuring plan; KKR, the preferred bidder,is doing its due diligenceand outline terms could be announced by the end of next month. At a push, one can concede that a board of a company in Thames’s dire position has to consider the risk of top staff walking away or getting poached. But come on, if your solution is to throw cash at those individuals, or to get the lenders to do so, don’t kid yourself that you have a free hand when you are in a hole as deep as Thames’s.The precise interpretation of bonus-blocking powers in the new Water (Special Measures) Act is almost irrelevant. If the minister can derail your retention scheme at a stroke, you risk being humiliated if you didn’t seek political cover in advance. The corporate naivety, or just plain arrogance, is extraordinary.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterNils Pratley on financeExecutive pay and bonusesSteve ReedWater industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Last week, a stunning parliamentary intervention was delivered by the Tory backbencher Kit Malthouse. In a question to Hamish Falconer, Labour’s Middle East minister, he noted that “it’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with theslaughter in Gaza”, adding that “crimes come daily”. Given Britain was signatory to various conventions imposing a “positive obligation to act to prevent genocide” and other crimes, Malthouse asked what advice the government had taken as to the liability of the prime minister, the foreign secretary, Falconer himself and previous ministers “when the reckoning comes”.The idea of a “reckoning” is clearly playing on the minds of western politicians. Perhaps it is even keeping them up at night. This week, Britain joined France and Canada indenouncing the sufferingin Gaza as “intolerable”, threatening an unspecified “concrete” response if Israel’s current onslaught into the Gaza Strip continues. Speaking in the Commons today, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, announced the UK wassuspending trade talkswith Israel, summoning its ambassador to the UK and imposing sanctions on a few extremist settlers. “The world is judging. History will judge them,” he said, in reference to Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.Lammy is right. But the problem for him is that this “judgment” will extend far beyond the direct perpetrators. It will also include Israel’s enablers.The foreign secretary might have announced his measures with great pomp and gravity, but they amounted to tokenistic nonsense. Even David Cameron tried to go further a year ago when he was foreign secretary, beforeabandoning plansto directly sanction two senior Israeli government ministers, the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, and the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. With the international criminal court havingissued arrest warrantsagainst the Israeli leadership six months ago, panic is clearly breaking out in government. And yet it is still not doing all it can to stop Israel. Just last week, the UK was in court defending Britain’scontinued exportof F-35 fighter jet parts that end up in Israel.This is about much more than just a failure to act now. It is about what led us to this moment. Keir Starmer, you see, once agreed that it was appropriate for Israel to impose a siege on Gaza cutting off power and water. (“I think that Israel does have that right. It is an ongoing situation.” He added: “Obviously, everything should be done within international law.”) He later claimed to have said no such thing, despite having said it. He thenpresided over an exodusof disgusted predominantly Muslim councillors – an adviser briefed that this was Labour “shaking off the fleas” – and took disciplinary action against pro-Palestine MPs. His government has suspended just 8% of arms deals to Israel under immense legal pressure, andapprovedmore military equipment in the three months that followed than had been approved by the Tories in the three years between 2020 and 2023. Nothing the government now does can scrub these facts from the coming reckoning.Another Tory MP, Edward Leigh, stood up last week, declaring himself a member of Conservative Friends of Israel “for over 40 years, longer than anyone here”. His question was direct: “When is genocide not genocide?” He has been joined by his Tory colleague Mark Pritchard, who noted he had backed Israel for 20 years “pretty much at all costs, quite frankly”. Withdrawing that support, he too alluded to the coming reckoning: “I’m really concerned that this is a moment in history when people look back, where we’ve got it wrong as a country.”The scale of that reckoning must be proportionate to the scale of the crime. A month into Israel’s onslaught – after which at least 5,139 civilians had been killed, according to conservative baseline figures by theNGO Airwars– the Economist publishedan editorialheadlined “Why Israel must fight on”. Amore recent offering, long after the territory has been essentially wiped from the Earth, is titled “The war in Gaza must end”. Or look at Rupert Murdoch’s Times. Usually a reliable supporter of Israel, it now runs opinionpiecesaskingwhy we are “closing our eyes to Gaza’s horror”.Is Britain breaking international law over Israel to avoid offending Trump? We may find out in court this week | Yasmine AhmedRead moreA truth is dawning: that this will be remembered as one of history’s great crimes. Right now, the UN warns that14,000 babiescould perish in the next 48 hours without aid. The Israeli opposition leader and former general Yair Golan – who earlier this yeardeclared, “We’d all like to wake up one spring morning and find that 7 million Palestinians who live between the sea and the river have simply disappeared” – now declares his country is “killing babiesas a hobby”.Still, Israel acts with impunity. Having imposed a total siege since the beginning of March, Netanyahu yesterday declared “minimal humanitarian aid” would be allowed in. Why? Not to alleviate Palestinian suffering, but because even zealous pro-Israel politicians “have warned that they cannot support us if images of mass starvation emerge”. A pinprick, in other words, for cosmetic purposes. Meanwhile,Smotrich declares: “We are disassembling Gaza, and leaving it as piles of rubble, with total destruction [which has] no precedent globally. And the world isn’t stopping us.” Zvi Sukkot, a parliamentarian in Smotrich’s party, boasts: “Everyone got used to the idea that you can kill 100 Gazans in one night … And nobody in the world cares.”On 24 October 2023, Iwrote a columnon these pages with the headline “Israel is clear about its intentions in Gaza – world leaders cannot plead ignorance of what is coming”. Why? Because Israel’s leaders and officials made devastatingly clear what they would do from day one.“As the calamity of Israel’s onslaught against Gaza becomes apparent, those who cheered it on will panic about reputational damage and plead their earlier ignorance,” I wrote. “Do not let them get away with it this time.” As the people of Gaza now prepare for the worst, being right has never felt so bitter. But it took no special insight or powers of prophecy, for here was a catastrophe foretold from the start.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The evidence shows we need different solutionsTue 20 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 12.24 EDTShareIt’s Saturday afternoon and my friend’s five-year-old daughter is lying next to me on her living room floor. She explains to me that she does this at school. She lies on her back with the rest of the class and they do something called the body scanner, where they all pay attention to various body parts in turn. I know she is describing a mindfulness exercise, because I’m a psychologist who researches mental-health lessons. I listen as she explains it all to me, but in my head I’m thinking something else: she shouldn’t be learning mindfulness at school.On the face of it, mental-health lessons in schools seemed like an excellent idea. Young people’s mental healthis worse nowthan it was in the past, and one-to-one treatment is hard to access. If you teach young people about mental health at school – which often includes teaching techniques based on therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or mindfulness – it’s more accessible. If you teach these concepts to everyone in a class – so-called universal interventions – you avoid missing the under-the-radar kids who aren’t seeking help, and avoid the potential stigma of singling anyone out. If you teach the information when pupils are young enough, even better: you might prevent mental-health problems from starting in the first place.At least, that was the idea. The reality is more sobering. Researchers have now run many studies testing the impact of universal school mental-health interventions and have found that they don’t really improve mental health. When improvements are found, they’resmall– a tiny average shift on a symptom questionnaire – and thequalityof the research is often poor, meaning it’s hard to trust the findings. The best-designed studiesshowthat interventionsdon’tworkat all:no improvementin mental health symptoms, either immediately after the course of lessons or later down the line.In fact, some studies have found that universal mental-health lessons actually make things worse. There are now high-quality studies showing that school lessons based onCBT,mindfulness,dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT)andgeneral mental-health awarenesslead to a small increase in symptoms of mental-health difficulties. There is evidence of other bad outcomes too, such asdecreased prosocial behaviourordecreased relationship qualitywith parents.It is not every study, but it isenoughthat we should take this seriously – not least because all schools in England are nowrequired to teachsomething about mental health. And these are the ones that have been tested: there are many, many interventions being sold to and taught in schools that haven’t been evaluated at all.I have nowreached the conclusionthat we should stop these all-class mental-health lessons. My view is that the only information we should teach en masse is where a young person should get help, both inside and outside school, if they’re struggling. That’s it. Then we should focus the time, energy and money on supporting the smaller group of young people who are actually unwell.I have not come to this conclusion lightly. Like so many others, I was once enthusiastic about the potential of the universal approach. It is a logical, intuitive idea that mental-health lessons in schools are a good idea, an obvious solution to an obvious need. But once you can accept the evidence, something surprising happens. It starts to become clear why all-class mental-health lessons don’t improve young people’s mental health, and why they were never going to.In any one classroom, young people vary enormously. For starters, the majority of them do not have mental-health problems. This means some pupils are being asked to engage in effortful practices at home – mindfulness meditation, CBT-based thinking exercises – when they are not struggling in the first place. When you ask them in qualitative studies, where they can convey openly what they think, some young people say such lessons areirrelevant to them, and they are right. Proponents of these lessons would say that the exercises are still worth learning, that positive effects may appear later down the line – but this is not supported by the evidence.At the other extreme, in every class there will be students who already have significant mental-health problems, and thus will need morethan what is on offer in universal lessons. They will need focused one-to-one support: therapy tailored to their specific challenges, built on a meaningful, trusting relationship with a qualified adult. Others will need changes in their external circumstances, not guidance about how to cope better in their own minds. For these students, mental-health lessons will be far too light touch, like being given plasters and paracetamol when they have a broken leg.Other students say that these lessons make them focus onnegative feelingsand memories, which thenupsets them. Others simply do not understand what they are being taught, and find the exercises confusing and stressful. We have very little understanding about how specific groups – such as neurodivergent children or those with language difficulties – experience these all-class lessons and whether they are able to correctly implement what they are being told to do.I won’t be taking exam leave to support my teens – just hovering, worrying and driving them mad | Zoe WilliamsRead moreAnother problem is that the classroom may not be the rightsettingto learn about mental health. Some young people feel socially secure at school and have good friends, but others are lonely or bullied. Many young people do not feel safe at school. In one study, several studentssaidthey didn’t want to do mindfulness meditation at school because they didn’t trust what their peers would do to them if they shut their eyes. Hearing this, it suddenly seemed obvious: without resolving these social challenges, the classroom is just not the right environment for a young person to do vulnerable work on their mental health.Importantly, this doesn’t mean there should be no mental-health support in schools. School is a logical, equitable place to provide help, and there isevidencethat one-to-one and small-group support in schools, given to those who need or want it, can work well, at least in the short term. But when it comes to all-class lessons, we should listen to the evidence, and to young people themselves. We came up with a good idea, we spent a lot of time and money testing it, and we have our answer. Given the evidence, we should now stop doing those lessons.The people running this research, and those making decisions to teach these lessons in schools, really want a solution to this crisis. We all want to figure out what to tell young people about mental health, and how to best help them when they are struggling. Against a backdrop of ever rising mental-health problems, and lack of affordable alternatives, I completely understand why it feels wrong – unethical even – to call a halt to these lessons.Yet it is also unethical to ignore evidence, and to continue delivering something that doesn’t work. At best, the universal lessons we have are a waste of time; at worst, they are harmful. The numbers tell us these lessons don’t improve mental health. The qualitative data tells us that many young people don’t like or want them. We need to listen.Dr Lucy Foulkes is an academic psychologist at the University of Oxford, where her group researches mental health and social development in adolescence.

This astounded my teensTue 20 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 12.30 EDTShareWhen you book your kid on a university open day, places tend to have a pretty strict specification: no more than one guest. Me and the middle teen kicked this around a bit, planning her trip to Bristol. Her friends could book their own place; it definitely wasn’t a cocktail party; so what kind of guest, exactly, did they have in mind? “They mean a parent. Didn’t you go with your parents?” Oh boy, no, we did not.My sister and I used to tell our mum that one of us had to go to, say, Newcastle, and the other one should go too, in case she got lost. Then we’d trouser the train fare – even in 1990, it was a lot – and spend the day in the Arndale centre in Wandsworth. Sometimes we went to the cinema. We never did anything lavish, like go out for lunch. We spent an awesome amount of time and a not negligible amount of money inthe Body Shop.The flaw in this plan was that we didn’t have the internet then, so there was no way of knowing, after a busy day in “Birmingham”, what Birmingham was actually like. I guess we could have looked it up, but you didn’t find many Ordnance Survey maps in the Arndale centre. We’d come back freestyling wildly, using what we could pick up from the prospectus. Yes, the people seemed nice, though a lot of them were wearing chinos. The science facilities were excellent, for anyone who wanted to do science, which was neither of us.This, by the way, was absolutely standard. I had adventurous friends, who took the money to go to, say, Sheffield and then went somewhere completely different, which didn’t even have a university, just to see what was what. I had one friend who accidentally fetched up in Manchester on the same day as the open day, and still didn’t see the university, because she was there to see theInspiral Carpets.When I described this to the assembledgen Zof the household, they seemed genuinely impressed, which was gratifying for about five seconds, until it turned out that they were just amazed we ever found a way to lie, before the internet.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHigher educationOpinionYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

Benjamin Netanyahu fears that foreign politicians could see too many pictures of Palestinian children like these.Two months after all supplies were cut off, the Israeli government denies the obvious truth: that Gaza is on the brink of famine. But on Monday night the prime minister announced that “minimal” aid deliveries would restart,sayinghis country’s “greatest friends in the world” had told him that they could not “accept images of … mass hunger”. His entirely cynical response saw a handful of trucks permitted to cross; reportedly, 100 a day will now be allowed – grotesquely inadequate given the vast scale of need. Reaching the most vulnerable will be perilous and difficult anyway amid Israel’s intensified offensive. Mr Netanyahu vowed that Israel would “take control” of all of Gaza.His words show both that western allies can shift Israeli behaviour, and that they are insufficiently willing to do so. The trickle of supplies is meant toensure the continuationof a war that enables his political survival, but has killed more than 53,500 Palestinians. That death toll may be a grave underestimate, say researchers.Foreign leaders are finally stirring as Palestinians starve and the enormity of Israel’s plan sinks in. Britain, France and Canada havedescribedconditions in Gaza as intolerable and threatened further “concrete” actions if Israel’s “egregious” campaign continues and aid restrictions are not lifted. An unrepentant Mr Netanyahu accused them of “offering a huge prize” for the murderous Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, which triggered Israel’s assault. In a separate statement, 23 countries including Australia and New Zealand condemned the aid blockade and military offensive. On Tuesday, the European Commissionlaunched a review of trade ties. Relatives of Israeli hostages haveagain pressedfor a ceasefire and release deal. Outrage has broken through in mainstream domestic politics, with Yair Golan, leader of the Democrats,sayingthat Israel was “on the path to becoming a pariah state”.The growing condemnation is spurred not only by the grotesque suffering in Gaza and ministers’ explicit calls for ethnic cleansing but also by a new distance between Mr Netanyahu and the Trump administration. Donald Trump didn’t bother stopping in Israel and repeatedly overrode its interests – on Syria, on the Houthis and on Iran – on his Middle East tour. He has emboldened the Israeli government’s annihilationist approach and would be happy to see a Gaza without Palestinians, but may betiring of the conflict. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, reportedlycalled Mr Netanyahu three timesin 24 hours over the aid blockade. The limited return on his efforts shows that the shift in approach should not be overstated. Strikingsupport for Israel enduresin Washington even as other governments – and American voters – think again.Others must match rhetoric with action. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, condemned the “repellent” words of the extremist minister Bezalel Smotrich. But suspending trade talks is barely a start. The same goes for the sanctioning of settler activists: David Cameron has said that as foreign secretary hewanted to impose sanctionson Mr Smotrich and his colleague Itamar Ben-Gvir last year. The UK should follow the example of France, which has said it is “determined” to recognise a Palestinian state. Most of all, it should ensure that no arms,including parts for F-35 jet fighters, continue to reach Israel. Until it does so, it will be complicit in these crimes.The US has the ability to stop the slaughter and achieve a desperately needed ceasefire. But pressure from other allies can make a difference. If they care about saving lives – and not just their own optics – it is time for decisive action.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Hosting the tens of thousands of delegates who make the trip is a big undertaking for any city. But the decision to host Cop30 inBelém, at the mouth of the Amazon river, has multiplied the complications.After three consecutive Cops in autocratic nations, the stated aim of Cop30’s chair, André Aranha Corrêa do Lago, is to make this year’s event a showcase for civil society, including the Indigenous groups andforest defenderswho play such a vital role in conservation. But the lack of affordable accommodation and other infrastructure, as well as the distance that must be travelled to reach the Amazon port, mean this commendable ideal will be hard to realise.Dom Phillips’ posthumously published book,How To Save the Amazon: A Journalist’s Deadly Quest for Answers, is a compelling reminder of what is at stake. It is nearly three years sincehe was killedalong with Bruno Pereira, a Brazilian government employee whose job was monitoring isolated Indigenous groups. The pair were on the way back from a trip to the remote Javari valley. The search and investigation were initially botched. Two men will go on trial for murder later this year.Phillips and Pereira understood the risks they ran, in struggling to document the destruction that was then taking place. Between 2019 and 2023, under the far-right presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, progress on rainforest conservation went into sharp reverse anddeforested areas grew rapidly. Illegal loggers, miners and ranchers effectively had carte blanche, as the agencies tasked with upholding environmental regulations were weakened and disbanded. Over the same period, and encouraged by the government’s laissez-faire approach,competition between drug traffickersover lucrative smuggling routes intensified. Owing to its remoteness, the Javari reserve, near the border with Peru, became a key battleground.Under President Lula the situation has stabilised. His environment minister, Marina Silva, is the right person to oversee the government’spolicy of zero net deforestationby 2030. But plans toexpand the country’s fossil fuel productionare impossible to square with these environmental goals.The risk that global heating and deforestation could cause a mass diebackof the rainforest, triggering the release of vast stores of carbon, continues to trouble scientists. At the same time,doubts are growingabout whether this year’s deadline for certification of the beef supply chain as deforestation-free will be met. Under strong international pressure, JBS, the world’s largest meat company, is putting new systems in place. But the huge number of farmers (Brazil has a cattle herd of 240m), the terrain, gaps in land registration, and systems set up tobypass checks, mean the prospects for success are not high.Having the global spotlight on the forest should at least focus minds. The Amazon’s biodiversity, and role in climate regulation, make it too important to lose. Indigenous defenders, some of whom worked with Pereira and Phillips, continue the vital work of championing the landscape that is their home. The journalist’s book, completed by his friends, shows the urgency of supporting their courageous efforts.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They were in the Pret a Manger, they were in the Pizza Express, they were in the Wagamama, but mostly they were standing gawping at the destination board, which featured a baffling number of Vueling flights to Bilbao, a squeezing of the schedule that led to inevitable delays and confusion.The queue for the three open booths at passport control in Bilbao was a vast python of white shirts, speckled with the occasional tree green or purple. The bus into town was almost entirely Spurs, with a handful of businessmen and a bewildered older couple returning from their holidays, who admitted they had no idea their city was hosting a major European final.Postecoglou adamant work at Spurs is not done but sounds resigned to his fateRead moreIn fairness, it has not felt much like a major European final. This is 16th against 17th in the Premier League, a battle of two sides who have each won one of their past 10 league games. As such, it has been regarded as an indictment of the inequitable distribution of resources in the modern world and something from a Victorian freak show, simultaneously an English boot grinding its studs forever into the face of Europe and a bout between a blind bear and a pair of three-legged badgers. None of which is entirely unfair, and yet it is a major European final, as the mass migration of excited fans attests.That a final could comprise two such struggling teams is undeniably funny, but the game matters. For Tottenham, this could be a first trophy since 2008 and a first European trophy since 1984; for United, it could, inexplicably, be a third piece of silverware in successive seasons, and a seventh European trophy.Neither side will need reminding that their ostensibly more successful local rivals have won nothing this season.Almost more importantly in the remorselessly capitalistic environment of the modern game, victory on Wednesday would secure passage to next season’s Champions League, with all the financial benefits that will bring. It could rival the Championship playoff final as the most valuable game in English football. The way potential qualification for the Champions League has been touted as a means of salvaging dismal seasons is itself indicative of the way football has been financialised.View image in fullscreenSupporters, who have arrived en masse from Britain, gather at the fan park in Bilbao.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAA trophy may havemeant the world for Crystal Palaceon Saturday, but for at least some at United and Spurs (although not Ange Postecoglou, as he was determined to point out), the Europa League feels like a means to a more lucrative ends; winning silverware in order to generate the revenue that will allow them to generate more revenue. The game, as Danny Blanchflower nearly said, is about glory, it is about doing things in style and with a flourish, about going out and creating sustainable revenue streams for the future.When Postecoglou arrived at Tottenham, heseemed a natural fit. His attitude to the game had been shaped by Ferenc Puskas, who coached him at South Melbourne, and there was a stylistic congruence between Arthur Rowe’s Tottenham of the early 1950s, which established the push‑and-run style, and the ethos of Hungarian football in the same period.For all Postecoglou’s cussed insistence that the way he plays is the way he plays, Spurs’ best performances this season have been in away games when they have played in a style that would not be described as Angeball. When they beatManchester City 4-0 at the Etihad Stadium, it was by playing on the counter and controlling the game in the second half. The Europa League winsat Eintracht FrankfurtandBodø/ Glimtwere almost like tactical plans devised by José Mourinho, stifling their opponents and assuming superior quality or physicality would tell in the end.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tottenham have beaten United three times this season: twice with classic Angeball and once in a grim scrap when neither side played remotely well. Does he go with what workedat Old Trafford in the leagueandat home in the Carabao Cupor does he go with what has worked in Europe and opt for something more cautious?He may not have much option. Spurs do not have the natural advantage they had over Frankfurt and Bodø/Glimt, but neither are they likely to have their three most creative midfielders with James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski out and Lucas Bergvall a major doubt. That probably means Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur sitting with Pape Matar Sarr driving forward.It had looked as though Postecoglou’s team without a midfield would be facing Ruben Amorim’s team without a defence, although with Leny Yoro and Diogo Dalot back in training the injury situation at United is not as acute as it had appeared. If there is an explanation for the disparity in United’s European and domestic form this season, it is probably that the lower pace of theEuropa Leagueallows players such as Casemiro and Harry Maguire to play under less immediate physical pressure. The dilemma for Postecoglou, then, is how to press them without losing the defensive structure that saw Spurs through the past two rounds.Despite all the noise around it, the talk of finals of the undeserving and the economic rewards on offer, this is, almost despite itself, a major final. Somebody will win a trophy and whatever else that means it will be celebrated on the night and go down in posterity.

Bernardo Silva and Nico González, De Bruyne’s replacement after Mateo Kovacic was sent off, finished the job to move City up to third but the day was all about De Bruyne as he waved goodbye to the City home support, who will get a statue by which to remember him. He means a lot to fans and his impact on the club was shown by Pep Guardiola crying during the post‑match commemorations.De Bruyne started in his 421st appearance for the club with the captain’s armband, and was accompanied by his three children when he walked out of the tunnel to be greeted by a 60ft tifo depicting his image. This was his day but there was business to be done.It never seemed likely that the post-match lap of honour from De Bruyne would be anticlimatic. After failing to score in their past two matches, City’s duck was broken with a De Bruyne-esque rocket into the top corner. The firepower, however, was not provided by the Belgian but instead Marmoush, who used a pocket of space to his advantage, getting the ball out of his feet and smashing a shot that dipped and swerved, bringing gasps before igniting the atmosphere.View image in fullscreenOmar Marmoush opens the scoring with a wonderful strike worthy of his departing City teammate.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Neal Simpson/Apl/SportsphotoThe moment everyone had been waiting for came in the 25th minute when Marmoush burst down the left and slid a pass along the six‑yard line to De Bruyne to tap into an empty net. In his previous 141Premier Leaguehome games for City, he would have completed the task with eyes closed. On this occasion, his focus went for a split second and he somehow pinged the ball against the bar.De Bruyne walked away head in hands, knowing he would never receive a better chance for the perfect finish. “It was terrible, terrible,” De Bruyne said of the miss. “There are no excuses. My son is going to be very hard on me today.”Silva made up for the rare slip of the foot from De Bruyne to double the lead and City were in control from then on. The only time it was questioned came when Kovacic was dismissed for pulling back Evanilson but the one-man deficit lasted minutes because Lewis Cook saw red for a reckless challenge on González, who went on to score a fine solo goal.View image in fullscreenDe Bruyne is thrown in the air by his City teammates.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersThere was a notable return for Rodri off the bench – his first appearance since sustaining ligament damage in September – on a night of positives for City, not tainted by Daniel Jebbison’s late consolation.De Bruyne’s child and wife joined him for a guard of honour from colleagues and chants of: “There’s only oneKevin De Bruyne.” He was asked to say a few words in the centre circle but struggled to hold back his emotion as Guardiola shed a tear watching on.A video of former teammates, family and friends was shown to the crowd to moisten eyes. Like on the pitch throughout his time at City, De Bruyne was able to find his composure when it mattered. “It is time to say goodbye. We love you and I will see you soon,” he said.“Manchester is home. Manchester is where these little kids were born. I came here with my wife, Michele, to stay here for a long time. I didn’t expect to be here 10 years to do what we have as a club, supporters, my teammates. We won everything. We made the city, the club bigger.”View image in fullscreenRodri returns to the pitch eight months after injuring his ACL.Photograph: Neal Simpson/Getty Images/AllstarThe decade is coming to an end, De Bruyne leaves with six Premier League titles, one Champions League winner’s medal and supporters with a lifetime of memories. “It is a sad day, he will be missed, there is no doubt about that,” Guardiola said.The final act will come on Sunday at Fulham where he can give the next generation the best platform to repeat his feats. “It’s been unbelievable, to have the 10 years that I had. It’s been an unbelievable ride,” De Bruyne said. “I wanted to have fun and we had a lot of fun these 10 years.”No one inside the Etihad Stadium was arguing with him.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueKevin De BruyneManchester CityBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

If this is Premier League season that has, in the view of its critics, featured far too little jeopardy, then this result mattered little but the evening will be remembered as the nightCrystal Palacebrought the FA Cup home.For the record, Palace were victors via two goals from Eddie Nketiah, a deflected free-kick and another Eberechi Eze strike. In truth, the main event did not arrive until after full time and the end of Selhurst Park’s 101-year wait toshow off a major trophy.David Squires on … moving scenes and mind games as Crystal Palace win the FA CupRead moreEagles supporters can now dream of next season’s European tour, the club’s first, with the hope and expectation the precise but emotionally charged leadership of Oliver Glasner will lead them into that promised land. As fans waited for a glimpse of the Cup, the Europa League anthem played over the PA system.Joel Ward, Palace’s longest-serving player of 13 years, had led the team out at kick-off, his 364th appearance. Here, at last, was the night denied to Palace fans in 1990 and 2016. Alan Pardew, player and manager in those losing finalist teams, was sat in the stands between former teammate Mark Bright and club chairman Steve Parish. Ward, emerging from the dressing room, eventually ran out to present the trophy to the Holmesdale Road Stand, before being given a farewell led by an emotional Parish.“I feel honoured and incredibly blessed,” Ward said. “There’s a belief in that changing room and I’m sure these lads will take this club forwards.”Of Wembley’s heroes, Dean Henderson played in goal, and Daniel Muñoz continued his raids down the right flank. Two January additions to “Oliver’s Army” in Ben Chilwell and Romain Esse, were handed firstPremier Leaguestarts. Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton, missing through concussion protocols, were hailed from the stands when joining the post-match festivities.“You always supported us, and that’s why we could write history,” Glasner told Eagles fans. They had implored him all evening to give them a wave.View image in fullscreenPalace fans hold up a cutout of Oliver Glasner as the FA Cup celebrations continued at the Wolves match.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It was a fantastic atmosphere,” he said, clearly unused to the traditions of English football support. “Everybody shouted my name and I didn’t know what they wanted and someone said I should wave. We always want everyone to have a great time at Selhurst Park and that they are happy.” Palace had also reached their highest Premier League points total.Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta, so important in beating Manchester City at Wembley, were among those given deserved rests until later. So too Daichi Kamada, faithful, trusted Glasner lieutenant.With Wolves safe for some weeks, their coach Vitor Pereira also played an experimental team, handing a first Premier League start for the defender, Nasser Djiga. Next season at Wolves is awaited with optimism even if their coach’s CV suggests he usually stays for a good time rather than a long time. “We offered gifts to them,” he said, unimpressed by his team’s performance.His defensive partner, Emmanuel Agbadou, scored Wolves’ 25th-minute opener, his neck muscles doing enough to power the ball inches over the line.That did nothing to quieten Palace fans. Within three minutes, Nketiah’s sharp finish drew the scores level. The south Londoner has been a slow burner but grasped his chance to shine with Muñoz and Ismaïla Sarr combining for his second. “Everyone was firing and we got the win,” said Nketiah, on reaching 50 career goals. “The unity between the fans and the players is amazing. It will be amazing to have European nights here.”View image in fullscreenEddie Nketiah scores his and Palace’s second goal against Wolves.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/ShutterstockWithin five minutes of the second half, Chilwell had scored his first Palace goal, his free-kick deflecting off Agbadou. Those in the Holmesdale Road Stand, shirts off now, paying little attention to the football, maintained their drum rhythm when Jørgen Strand Larsen scored a looping header. That proved the Norwegian’s last action; Matheus Cunha was thrown on. When a tearful Ward was substituted in the 71st minute, Selhurst Park stood as one. Parish could be seen wiping his eyes.As the players departed for their post-match lap of appreciation, Glasner and Ward, walking, talking together, got the loudest roar, Eze not far behind in appreciation. He had just shown that Wembley was no fluke – as if anyone could think that of one of English football’s best players.As Wolves threatened an equaliser, on came Eze. Soon enough, he was gliding through defenders with the grace that makes him both killer and stadium filler, giving the Wolves goalkeeper Dan Bentley no chance with a lovely, disguised finish. After that, Selhurst’s celebrations could truly begin.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The hooker Curtis Langdon, the lock Alex Coles and the full-back James Ramm are all battling to overcome injuries, while management are also waiting to discover if the club captain, George Furbank, can feature in the matchday 23.Saints, who are already without Ollie Sleightholme, George Hendy, Juarno Augustus and Burger Odendaal, will be particularly stretched at hooker and in the back three should Langdon, Ramm and Furbank all be ruled out. Langdon has a shoulder problem, Ramm damaged a shinagainst Saracens last Saturdaywhile the similarly influential Coles has a knee injury. None of that trio could train on Tuesday.The Breakdown | Rare English double in Europe would be a dream result for PremiershipRead moreFurbank has barely played since breaking an arm against the Bulls in December and aggravated the injuryagainst Castres in their quarter-finallast month. The England full-back had a metal plate inserted in his forearm but has been experiencing discomfort since taking a heavy blow to the same arm when scoring a try in the Castres game.Northampton’s director of rugby, Phil Dowson, revealed Furbank had played a “limited” part in training but said a decision on his participation would be delayed until later in the week. “We’ve been down this road before with Furbs so I’m reticent to say ‘he’s great’ but he’s feeling good and we’ll make a decision after he’s trained on Thursday,” Dowson said.In the absence of Sleightholme and Hendy, there will be an obvious temptation to rush Furbank back on to the bench if possible, with Tommy Freeman potentially to start at full‑back if Ramm does not recover in time. If the combative Langdon is also ruled out, Saints may have to name the erstwhile Ealing reserve hooker Henry Walker among their replacements as they seek to lift the club game’s most prestigious trophy for the first time since 2000.Bordeaux, by contrast, are confident that winger Damian Penaud will be fit for the final. The 28-year-old, who has scored 12 tries in the tournament this season, was a doubt after limping off in the semi‑final win against Toulouse, but his ankle injury has responded well to treatment, according to his head coach, Yannick Bru.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Remote (online) betting duty (RBD), on racing and other sports, is currently levied as 15% of an operator’s gross profits, while the rate of remote gaming duty (RGD), for products including online slot machines and casino games, is 21%.The consultation, which runs until 21 July, does not propose a rate for a unified Remote Betting & Gaming Duty (RBGD), but it is unlikely to be any lower than the current 21% level of RGD.“Operators are already cross-selling our [racing] customers on games of chance,” Dunshea said on Tuesday, “and we know, and there is academic research to support this, that the potential for gambling harms is greater in those environments around online casinos and slots.“We’re concerned that this will incentivise operators to reduce their focus on our product, it would make betting on racing more expensive for them to operate, and would also reduce customer incentives, promotions and so forth. This would incentivise [punters to] move away from the regulated markets to the illegal markets, to seek competitive pricing and offers.”Dunshea said that the BHA had commissioned independent modelling of the likely impact of a unified duty rate at both 21% and 30%.“The analysis suggests that a rise from 15% to 21% to harmonise with RGD would have an impact of around £40m a year,” Dunshea said. “If you model it out to consider increases once harmonised, that would be significant. At 30%, it would be roughly £90m a year.”Dunshea’s intervention on Tuesdayfollowed a meeting last weekto discuss the proposed harmonisation, which was attended by BHA executives, Treasury officials, directors of major racecourses and MPs with an interest in gambling issues.The meeting was convened by James Noyes, a senior researcher with the Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank, who coordinated a report last year which concluded that the gap between RBD and RGD should be significantly increased, to reflect the huge rise of online slot machines, widely seen as one of the most potential addictive and harmful forms of online gambling, in recent years. Noyes’s report suggested that RGD should be at least doubled, to 42%, with RBD left unchanged at 15%.The new Labour government, though, seems intent on taking a very different approach, one that will enshrine the belief – or rather, the pretence – that betting and gaming are just two sides of the same coin within the tax code, for the first time.Betting and gaming have superficial similarities, but you need only to scratch the surface to appreciate their profound differences.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Wednesday tipsShowAyr2.00 Nelson Gay 2.30 Underwriter 3.00 Woohoo (nb) 3.30 Garden Oasis 4.05 Hosanna Power 4.42 Sir Garfield 5.17 On The BubbleChepstow2.22 Ammes 2.52 What A Nation 3.22 Italica 3.55 Rosenpur 4.25 Bust A Moon 5.00 Cooperation 5.35 Silky RobinWarwick2.40 Roadshow 3.10 Cusano 3.40 Pride Of Paris 4.15 Ukantango 4.50 A Dublin Job 5.25 Mr YeatsKempton5.05 Believe The Storm 5.40 Deira Storm 6.10 Opening Bat (nap) 6.40 Charencey 7.10 Sayidah Hard Spun 7.40 Newsreader 8.10 Scarboroughwarning 8.40 TatmeenBrighton6.00 Pop Dancer 6.30 Immediate Effect 7.00 Muy Muy Loco 7.30 Devasboy 8.00 Market House 8.30 VoltaicWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Gaming is, essentially, a mechanical process, underpinned by basic maths. The operator’s gross profit is a fixed, immutable function of turnover. Betting, on racing or anything else, involves thought and skill, and the odds – and operator’s margin – are fluid. It requires considerable effort – on both sides of the unending struggle between bookie and punter – to make it pay.Racing, meanwhile, has a uniquely close relationship with betting among major sports. The BHA’s latest estimate of the sport’s total annual contribution to the UK economy was £4.1bn. The 85,000 workers whose jobs are directly or indirectly dependent on the racing are all paying tax and national insurance, and spending their wages in local economies, and rural economies in particular, up and down the country.The main effort required in gaming, by contrast, involves finding new ways to package the drab, attritional, click-click-click process of separating players from their money, a little bit at a time.Dunshea’s comments on Tuesday, like the BHA’s imminent official response to the Treasury consultation, are standing up only for betting on racing, but still represent a big step forward from the days when, for instance, the sport simply stood and watched as £100-a-spin roulette machines proliferated in off-course betting shops and gambling industry bodies insisted – falsely, as it turned out – that high-stakes machines were necessary to keep shops open.In a foreword to the document which launched its consultation, James Murray MP, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, suggested that a single duty would create “a simpler, streamlined system that is easier for operators to navigate”. The introduction to the document itself, meanwhile, states plainly that “gambling taxation should reflect the reality of the gambling industry.”So which is it? A basic reality of the gambling industry is that betting and gaming are fundamentally different things, and the taxation regime around gambling has always reflected that fact.The Treasury (presumably) does not want to do irreparable damage to one of the country’s most popular spectator sports and an industry that has major economic benefits for the UK. There is no surer way to invoke the law of unintended consequences, however, than to impose simplicity on something that is complex for a reason.Explore more on these topicsBritish Horseracing AuthorityTalking HorsesSport bettingHorse racingHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Guardian revealedlast weekthat the club were considering dropping out of the second tier and that the players had been left anxious, angry and feeling as if they were in a state of limbo awaiting a formal decision.The sad demise of Fortuna Sittard Women: ‘I hope the players find new clubs’Read moreIt is understood that WSL Football, the governing body of the WSL and WSL 2, is working with the Professional Footballers’ Association and Sporting Chance to support players and staff.In a statement posted on the club’s website, Rovers said the decision had come after a “comprehensive review of the evolving demands placed on second-tier clubs, which have become unsustainable under our current model”.The intention is still for the WSL 2 to operate with 12 teams next season, although any club joining the league will be required to meet the minimum standards. They are viewed as vital to the further professionalisation of the game as they protect the welfare of all participants and maintain competition integrity.Nikki Doucet, the WSL Football chief executive, said: “This is a sad day for women’s football and our hearts go out to the players, staff and fans at Blackburn Rovers FC Women affected by this decision to withdraw from the Women’s Super League 2. We have been working with the club all season to prevent this outcome and we are disappointed it has come to this.”Operating on what was understood to be a comparatively low playing budget, Rovers finished 10th last season, second from bottom, in the women’s second tier this term, five points clear of danger.The minimum requirements to take part in the renamed division (it was called the Championship in 2024-25) are being increased this summer in a bid to raise minimum standards for the players involved, with WSL 2 sides expected to essentially operate full‑time, professional teams.The list of criteria is believed to include requirements for clubs to commit to appointing a head of women’s football, marketing manager, head coach, assistant coach, physiotherapist or sports therapist, doctor, a strength and conditioning coach, a goalkeeping coach and several people in specific safeguarding and player-welfare roles within one month of the new season kicking off.WSL Football said in a statement: “In line with recommendations for the long-term future of women’s football, every club is asked to comply with the minimum standards as part of their membership of the leagues and a compliance and development review is carried out as standard ahead of each season and monitored throughout.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An FA spokesperson said: “We are in ongoing discussions with Blackburn regarding what level of the women’s football pyramid they can enter for next season, and a decision will be confirmed in due course.”Explore more on these topicsBlackburn Rovers LadiesWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

And to do that it’s not just about what you do on the cricket field.“It’s how you carry yourself, it’s how you interact with the public, it’s the messaging that you give. The ability to play on the biggest stage and under the brightest lights and the pressure is one thing, but also the ability to show some humility and not feel out of touch with the general population is something that I’d like to see us improve on.”Over the last 18 months, some players’ comments have been seized upon as evidence of a cavalier approach. Last monththe bowler Mark Wood saidthat “sometimes we’ve been a bit dumb in the things we say in the press. We come out and we’ll say an off-the-cuff one‑liner, then it looks like we’re Billy Big Boots, above our station.”After England finished bottom of their group at the Champions Trophy this yearRob Key, England’s managing director of men’s cricket, saidplayers “speak a lot of rubbish a lot of the time”, creating the false impression “that they don’t care about winning, that they’re arrogant”.Quick GuideEngland XI to face ZimbabweShowZak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue, Sam Cook, Shoaib Bashir.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It’s not intentional,” McCullum said. “They’re trained cricketers, not trained media folk.

We want them along for the ride, particularly in the next few series, which could be quite amazing. We want people to look back and say: ‘Crikey, that was a hell of a team that we loved following and we felt as if we were part of that journey they went on.’”McCullum confirmed Essex’s Sam Cook will make his Test debut as England, who were ranked sixth in the world when he took over three years ago, try to build ontheir new position at No 2. “To get to where we are is good, and everyone’s happy about that, but at the same time there’s a lot of meat on the bone for us,” he said. “When we took on a project like this, it was not about necessarily settling on good.”The 43-year-old said the decision of his captain, Ben Stokes,to forego alcoholreflects the team’s determination to make the most of their next few months. “I think he’s had the time to look at where he is individually and say: ‘How do I make sure that I get the very most out of the talent I was born with and the opportunity I’ve been given?’ And I think the extra motivation, in the latter part of his career, to maximise the talent he’s got is a massive positive,” McCullum said.“It probably embodies where we’re at as a team.

If Saints make sufficient progress in the coming days, they hope the 32-year-old will be in the stands when they host Arsenal on Sunday.

Compensation with Lens for his staff remains to be agreed. Among others on Southampton’s list has been the Sheffield Wednesday manager and former Saints assistant, Danny Röhl, whom Spors knows from their time at RB Leipzig, though the pair did not work together directly.Saints looked into appointing Röhlafter sacking Russell Martinlast December. The 36-year-old now has strong interest from Bundesliga clubs and is expected to leave Hillsborough after almost two years in the job.Explore more on these topicsSouthamptonnewsShareReuse this content"

If they breach those conditions, they could go to prison.According to Ministry of Justice statistics, 59% of adults released, having spent 12 months or less in prison, reoffend within a year. That figure rises to 62% for those with custodial sentences of six months or less.In contrast, the reoffending rate for offenders who received a suspended sentence with requirements is only 25%.Deferred sentences, when criminals are told they will be sentenced after a period in which they can begin rehabilitation, have also shown promising results in reducing reoffending in Northern Ireland, officials said.Shabana Mahmood: lord chancellor with political nous unafraid to shake up systemRead moreExtending the deferral period to 12 months – similar to models in several Australian states – would give offenders more time to engage with services, stabilise their lives and avoid custody altogether.Pregnant women could use the deferral period to access healthcare, housing and support, the review is expected to say. It would also enable them to avoid the trauma of giving birth in prison and to receive a lesser sentence, which could mitigate the impact of the conviction on mother and baby.If an offender does not comply with the conditions of their deferred sentence, they can be brought back to court.Other recommendations are expected to include allowing prisoners to earn their freedom after serving a third of their sentences under new minimum and maximum sentence plans.Offenders will be able to earn early release if they complete work, training or education assignments and demonstrate good behaviour.The government’s plans are expected to require thousands of offenders to be tagged in the community, and will increase the burden upon probation officers.Reports this week claimed that the government has ordered tens of thousands of extra tags which will be used to monitor offenders in the community.Keir Starmer’s government has demonstrated an appetite for a liberal overhaul of the sentencing system. In July, the prime minister appointed James Timpson, the former chair of the Prisons Reform Trust,as his prisons minister.In 2019, while he was justice secretary, Gaukemade a speech questioning the effectiveness of short prison sentences, arguing that there was a strong case for those of six months or less to be scrapped altogether.Tania Bassett, a national officer at the the probation officers’ union Napo, welcomed proposals to increase the use of deferred sentences but cautioned against the overuse of suspended sentences.“Deferred sentencing allows probation officers to intervene with low level offenders such as first-time drug addicts and [female] offenders before they receive a sentence. It allows people to be signposted towards services and gives them a chance to reform,” she said.“I am more concerned about the use of SSOs [suspended sentence orders] because they are seen as a last chance saloon,” she said.“What I wouldn’t like to see is people being given them unnecessarily when a community order would be more appropriate.”Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justiceSentencingDavid GaukenewsShareReuse this content"

The first, last November, was cancelled by the court after the first round amid allegations of campaign financing violations and a “massive” Russian interference campaign.The winner of the annulled vote, far-right firebrand Călin Georgescu, was barred from standing again and is under formal investigation on counts including misreporting campaign spending, illegal use of digital technology and promoting fascist groups. He denies any wrongdoing.“Just as Călin Georgescu was removed and the elections were annulled, we will challenge the election of Nicușor Dan for exactly the same reasons,” Simion, an EU-critical, Trump-admiring former soccer ultra,said in a statementto local media.“Why? Because there was vote buying,” said Simion, who formally conceded to Dan on Sunday night after first claiming to have won. “Because dead people voted on 18 May, and no calculation in the world can show us over 11.5 million Romanians voted.”The Guardian view on Romania’s presidential election upset: a vote for stability and the west | EditorialRead moreSimion has repeatedly alleged electoral fraud without providing evidence. His belated decision to contest the election’s outcome, while unlikely to succeed, will prolong the political uncertainty in Romania, which is under a caretaker government.The ultranationalist, whose supporters carried out a parallel count at some polling stations, said votes were “correctly counted” but “international observers” had seen “foreign interference” and “social media and algorithms have been manipulated”.He claimed there was “irrefutable evidence” of meddling by France, Moldova and others in “an orchestrated effort to manipulate institutions, direct media narratives and impose a result that does not reflect the sovereign will of the Romanian people”.Simion referenced a suggestion by the founder of the Telegram messaging app,Pavel Durov, that Parishad asked it to “silence conservative voices” in Romania.

He said: “I am very happy indeed that Thames have now dropped those proposals. It was the wrong thing to do. They have now withdrawn their proposal to make those payments.”The Guardian previously revealed thatministers were planning to use a new ban on performance-based bonusesto block bosses from Thames Water taking the bonuses, worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.Ministers to block Thames Water paying bosses bonuses out of emergency loanRead moreReed said at the parliamentary committee on Tuesday that Thames Water had “appeared to be attempting to circumvent that ban, calling their bonuses something different so they can continue to pay them”.In a statement that followed Reed’s comments, a Thames Water spokesperson said: “It has never been the Thames Water board’s intention to be at odds with the government’s ambition to reform the water industry. Following recent discussions the board has decided to pause the retention scheme and await forthcoming guidance from the regulator in relation to the implementation of the relevant aspects of the special measures act, to ensure our approach supports both our turnaround objectives and broader public expectations.”In a letter read out at the same committee session on Tuesday, the Thames Water chair, Adrian Montague, admitted he may have “misspoken” whenhe told the Efra committee last weekthat large bonuses to be paid to senior bosses out of an emergency £3bn loan were “insisted” upon by creditors.Sir Adrian told theselect committee last weekthat the lenders “insisted” that “very substantial” bonuses of up to 50% of salary should be paid to company executives from the controversial loan in order to retain key staff. The proposed bonuses had provoked fury as the company had saidits finances were “hair raising”and that it had come “very close to running out of money entirely” last year.TheGuardian revealedearlier on Tuesday that sources with knowledge of the details of the agreement, the term sheet for the loan, and court documents suggested that while the bonuses were agreed to by the creditors, they were not necessarily proposed by them.After the Guardian approached Thames to ask why its chair claimed the lenders “insisted” bonuses were paid, Montague wrote to the Efra committee to clarify his comments.“Following the session we have been approached by the Guardian who we understand intend to write a story suggesting that we misled the committee in relation to the company’s management retention plan,” he wrote in the letter made public by the Efra committee. “I appreciate that in the heat of the moment I may have misspoken when I stated that the creditors insisted on the management retention plan.”He added that the management retention plan, which included the bonuses, “rose from our discussions related to our liquidity extension transaction”, adding: “It was agreed that a retention plan was important to retain the people best placed to deliver the improved outcomes our stakeholders rightly expect during this current period of uncertainty and this was reflected in the term sheet we agreed with our creditors.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leech said there was no evidence that it had to be approved by the lenders.The Guardian revealed last week the bonuses could be the first to beblockedunder the government’s water (special measures) bill, which gives the regulator Ofwat powers to ban financial rewards for executives presiding over a failing company. Thames Water could be classed as such, as it is presiding overrecord sewage spills,heavily laden with debt, and on the brink of financial collapse.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Following robust and urgent discussions with Thames Water, we are pleased that the company has decided to pause the payment of retention payments.“For too long, customers’ money has been spent on unjustified payouts, rather than investing in vital improvements to the water system. This government has been clear that the era of profiting from failure is over.”Explore more on these topicsThames WaterExecutive pay and bonusesUtilitiesCorporate governancenewsShareReuse this content"

In 2014 the government set a time limit of 26 weeks but it has never been met.In areport published on Wednesday, the NAO says the proportion of children waiting more than a year for a public law case to be resolved increased from 0.7% in January 2017 to 12% in December last year. The figures equate to approximately 70 and 1,200 children respectively.The watchdog is urging the government to do more to tackle delays that can mean children waiting longer for permanent care and living or contact arrangements, increasing risk of harm, anxiety, instability and disrupted friendships or education.Including private law cases, which involve parental disputes such as living or contact arrangements for their child, there were more than 4,000 children in England andWalesin family court proceedings lasting two years in December 2024.Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the chair of the House of Commons public accounts committee, said: “Too many children are suffering as a result of delays to family court proceedings, which are currently still far too long. The longer a case remains unresolved, the more likely it is that there are further delays, increasing the risk of harm to children and driving up public costs.“Responsibilities for family justice are fragmented, with no single body responsible for overall performance. Government has neither the right data to fully understand the causes or impacts of delays, nor does it have an assessment of the capacity required to manage the system efficiently.”In December, nearly two-thirds of the 4,000 cases that had been open for 100 weeks or longer were in London and the south-east. London had an average duration of 53 weeks for cases brought by local authorities and 70 weeks for cases brought by parents.Wales performed best, averaging 24 weeks and 18 weeks respectively. Where there were longer delays, this reflected issues such as lower judicial capacity in those areas, the NAO said.There is no government time limit for private law cases, which took 41 weeks on average last year.The watchdog said the impact of delays on costs was significant, as evidence and assessments needed to be updated. Average spending on legal aid for a case brought by a local authority doubled between 2018 and 2022 from approximately £6,000 to about £12,000 – an annual increase of £314m in legal aid spending.Family courts have recovered much better thancrown courtsafter the Covid-19 pandemic, with 47,662 family court cases outstanding (37,541 of them private law cases), down by more than a quarter since August 2021.But Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “Many cases still take too long to complete and further action is needed to remove the barriers to a more efficient system, including poor-quality data and fragmented decision-making.”A government spokesperson said it had inherited a justice system in crisis, adding: “We are working hard to improve their experience in the family courts further by expanding the successful pathfinder pilot, which has already reduced case times by 11 weeks, and investing £500m in early intervention. Cases are now moving faster.”Explore more on these topicsFamily lawChild protectionLegal aidEnglandWalesSocial carenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s why decisive action is often too late or doesn’t happen at all.“This review points out the cracks but ignores the broken system underneath. We don’t need more reports that dodge the real issue.“We need change. We need a legal duty of care in higher education before more young lives are lost.”Robert Abrahart and wife Maggie are among the founders ofForThe100, a group of bereaved parents campaigning for universities to have a statutory duty of care towards students.The review of serious incident reports, including 79 suspected suicide deaths and 25 incidents of non-fatal self-harm in the 2023-24 academic year, found that mental ill-health was identified in nearly half of the cases, while more than a third mentioned academic problems or pressures. About one in four of the students were in their first year of undergraduate studies.Dr Cathryn Rodway of the University of Manchester, one of the review’s lead authors, said: “We suggest mental health awareness and suicide prevention training should be available for all staff in student-facing roles, and include recognising and responding to risk and neurodiversity.”Debbie Laycock, head of policy at Samaritans, said: “Students face a range of pressures during their time at university, and it’s vital that their mental health and wellbeing are prioritised alongside their academic studies.“Universities must take meaningful steps to create a culture of care and ensure the right support is in place.“A crucial first step is making sure staff who work directly with students are trained in suicide prevention, so they’re equipped to recognise warning signs and potentially save a life.”Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “For too long, families have been left with unanswered questions and denied the transparency they deserve. This must change.“We are committed to working with universities, experts and students to turn the findings of this review into real, lasting improvements.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

It should be 80% lower by 2040 and 94% by 2045, with the remaining emissions absorbed by trees, peatland and technologies that strip CO2from the air.Gillian Martin, Scotland’s acting net zero secretary, said the CCC’s advice would be central to a new climate plan currently being drafted. Opposition parties and climate policy groups said its report bolstered their complaints that ministers were failing to match their rhetoric with action.The Institute for Public Policy Research, a thinktank, said Scottish ministers should draw up new climate “missions” to set overarching policies for sectors with the biggest climate impacts such as heat in buildings, transport and land use, which would mandate action.“It is time to break out of the obsession with price incentives and behavioural nudges,” said Dave Hawkey, an IPPR research fellow.Sarah Boyack, Scottish Labour’s net zero spokesperson, said: “The SNP has already torn up one set of targets – we urgently need a real plan to meet the Scottish government’s remaining targets.”The CCC singled out the rapid rollout of heat pumps and district heating for homes, mass insulation of homes, low-carbon transport, wholesale planning reform to speed up renewables, and far better funding for low-carbon farming for urgent action.The Scottish Green party’s co-leader Patrick Harvie, whose power-sharing deal with the SNP was ripped up by the previous first minister, Humza Yousaf, said: “The Scottish government already knows, as we all do, that without serious effort we will fail to protect our world from catastrophic damage.”The CCC said it believed Scotland’s 2045 net zero target was achievable, but the Scottish government’s internal advice was very gloomy about its prospects.Its current projections suggest it will miss that by 20m tonnes of CO2, unless there is a dramatic increase in policy interventions.The CCC did not endorse Scottish Labour’s calls for new nuclear power stations in Scotland but also warned Scottish ministers they should not allow a new gas-fired power station to be built at Peterhead without carbon capture technology – something the UK government has not yet funded.Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsScotlandGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisScottish politicsRegulatorsClimate Change CommitteenewsShareReuse this content"

Energy giant BP in 2016 sponsored Washington DC’sNational Gallery of Artandcontinues to fundthe British Museum in London. And in 2019, Shell sponsored the golf event the Houston Open for the 26th time.The new evidence of sponsorships were found in internal communications from 2015 to 2021 subpoenaed from big oil via aUS Congressional investigationlast year. They were uncovered by Rebecca John, a researcher at the Climate Investigations Center, andpublished in the climate outlet DeSmog.Revealed: European ‘green’ investments hold billions in fossil fuel majorsRead moreThedocumentsalso shed light on the particular value the companies see in the partnerships. In a 2017email, for instance, the then CEO of API said the Girl Scouts sponsorship came as part of an effort to partner with “nontraditional local allies”, which he described as “some of the best and most influential voices with targeted policymakers on industry issues” who can help the lobby group overcome “policy issues”. API has a largelobbyingpresencein Pennsylvania, which is the country’s second-largest gas producer.The Guardian has asked API, BP and Shell for comment. APIstatesthat it sponsors cultural endeavors because “we are a principles-based organization.”The Guardian also has sought comment from the Girl Scouts, the British Museum, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.The British Museum has previously defended its partnership with BP, including after the companyscaled back its climate goalsthis past February. The museum needs “corporate and private donations from companies like BP to ensure that the magnificent collection stays on display to the public for centuries to come”, a spokespersontold the Guardianat the time.The documents indicate that in Shell’s 2020 “reputation plan” it said it would “secure partnerships with credible external influencers” in an effort to overcome “low credibility and trust” in the company.The oil giant has partnered with a wide variety of majormuseums,sporting events,concert hallsand other arts and cultural institutions. It could not be reached for comment, but its spokespeople previously said institutions canmaintaintheir freedom even as they receive funding from Shell.A 2017 internalmemo from BP Americasays the relationships could provide a shield from “threats to BP’s reputation”, including “overall negative sentiment about the oil and gas industry” and the “policy and politics of climate change”. A separate 2016documentassessing the company’s “position” instructed staff to emphasize the message that more than 50 million people in the UK had “engaged with a BP-supported activity” due to its funding of institutions such as the British Museum and Royal Shakespeare Company.The revelations come as activists have increasingly pressured arts and cultural institutions to cut ties with fossil fuel interests. The Royal Shakespeare Company, for instance, ended its BP partnership in 2019 after eight years, followingmonthsofprotestsover the partnership. At the time, BPsaidit was “disappointed and dismayed” by the decision.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The museum’s director said the firm’s funding “fostered creativity”.DeSmog found evidence of dozens of other cultural sponsorships from the energy companies between 2015 and 2021, including of libraries, music festivals, gender justice initiatives and theaters. There have been hundreds of similar partnerships through history, from a children’sradio showfunded by Standard Oil in the 1930s, to the current sponsorship of amedia podcastby BP.The relationships illustrate a decades-long industry strategy known as “affinity of purpose advertising”, said Robert Brulle, an environmental sociologist at Brown University. The term wascoinedby Herbert Schmertz, the late executive of Mobil Oil (now ExxonMobil).“It’s the idea that if a corporation is associated with a high value, cultural activity that prestige rubs off on the corporation,” said Brulle. In one well-known historical example, Mobil in the 1970s begansponsoringthe television drama seriesMasterpiece Theater.“Apparently this works quite well,” said Brulle, noting that Mobil evaluated the approach in a1980 studyand decided it was worthwhile. “It [has] now become a commonplace activity to burnish their corporate reputation and goodwill by sponsoring these types of cultural activities.”Explore more on these topicsOil and gas companiesDemocracy and justiceOil (Business)Oil (Environment)GasEnergyFossil fuelsClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Stiell said: “In the past, climate plans have often focused mainly on cuts – cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and to old-fashioned energy. This new generation of climate plans are really about growth: growing industries and economies, and building a better future. One where nature is protected, and where people have better opportunities.”He added: “Done right, these plans can attract abonanza of benefits: more jobs, more revenue, and a virtuous cycle of increased investment.”Stiell also warned against “a two-speed transition, where some countries race ahead with clean energy and climate resilience and leave others behind”. However, the climate finance that poor countries need to increase renewable energy investment and protect against the ravages of climate breakdown is under increasing threat.The withdrawal of the US from the Paris agreement and the Trump administration’s dismantling of most forms of overseas aidwill leave tens of billions of dollars lacking in the coming years. Support from other developed countries looks unlikely to fill the gap.The UK has also slashed overseas aid, from 0.5% to 0.3% of national GDP. Although Downing Street has previously indicated to the Guardian that the current climate finance pledge, of spending £11.6bn from 2021 to 2026,would be ringfenced, there are concerns that it could be watered down, and no certainty over what will follow beyond next year.A group of more than 80 civil society organisations has written to the prime minister to point out thattaxing fossil fuel interestscould pay for current climate finance pledges many times over.Over the next five years, the UK could raise £115bn by measures including making permanent the windfall levy on the excess profits of fossil fuel producers; redirecting the current subsidies to fossil fuels; taxing luxury travel such as private jets and super-yachts; and imposing a small tax on the super-wealthy.In a letter seen by the Guardian, they also pointed out that opinion polls showed strong support for such measures among voters.Catherine Pettengell, the executive director of Climate Action Network UK, said: “Climate action is in everyone’s interests, for stability and prosperity at home and all around the world. The UK has demonstrated leadership with its [national plan for cutting greenhouse gas emissions], but domestic action alone is not sufficient. The real test of UK climate leadership is the provision of climate finance to those least responsible but suffering the most devastating impacts of climate change.“As the fifth largest historical emitter and sixth largest economy, the UK has both the responsibility and the capability to do far more to invest in the climate action needed and to ensure no one is left behind in the domestic and global transition.”Signatories to the letter included Action Aid, Concern Worldwide, Greenpeace, Oxfam, Save the Children and the RSPB.A government spokesperson said: “You wouldn’t expect us to speculate on the content of the spending review ahead of time, but the UK remains committed to supporting global efforts to tackle climate change. The UK’s international climate finance has helped 110 million people adapt to the effects of climate change, provided 82 million people with improved access to clean energy, and helped to mobilise billions in private investment. Meeting the £11.6bn ICF commitment by March 2026 remains our ambition.”Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisUnited NationsFaminePanamaHungerGreen economynewsShareReuse this content"

This scenario may unfold even if the average level of heating over the last decade of 1.2C continues into the future.The loss of ice from the giant Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has quadrupled since the 1990s due to the climate crisis and is now the principal driver of sea level rise.The international target to keep global temperature risebelow 1.5C is already almost out of reach. But the new analysis found that even if fossil fuel emissions were rapidly slashed to meet it, sea levels would be rising by 1cm a year by the end of the century, faster than the speed at which nations could build coastal defences.The world ison track for 2.5C-2.9Cof global heating, which would almost certainly be beyond tipping points for the collapse of the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets. The melting of those ice sheets would lead to a “really dire” 12 metres of sea level rise.Today, about 230 million people live within 1 metre above current sea level, and 1 billion live within 10 metres above sea level. Even just 20cm of sea level rise by 2050 would lead to global flood damages of at least $1tn a year for the world’s 136 largest coastal cities and huge impacts on people’s lives and livelihoods.However, the scientists emphasised that every fraction of a degree of global heating avoided by climate action still matters, because it slows sea level rise and gives more time to prepare, reducing human suffering.The century of climate migration: why we need to plan for the great upheavalRead moreSea level rise is the biggest long-term impact of the climate crisis, and research in recent years has shown it is occurring far faster than previously estimated. The 1.5C limit was seen as a way to avoid the worst consequences of global heating, but the new research shows this is not the case for sea level rise.The researchers said the “safe limit” temperature for ice sheets was hard to estimate but was likely to be 1C or lower. Sea level rise of at least 1-2 metres was now inevitable, the scientists said. In the UK, just 1 metre of sea level rise would see large parts of the Fens and Humberside below sea level.“What we mean by safe limit is one which allows some level of adaptation, rather than catastrophic inland migration and forced migration, and the safe limit is roughly 1cm a year of sea level rise,” said Prof Jonathan Bamber of the University of Bristol in the UK. “If you get to that, then it becomes extremely challenging for any kind of adaptation, and you’re going to see massive land migration on scales that we’ve never witnessed in modern civilisation.” Developing countries such as Bangladesh would fare far worse than rich ones with experience of holding back the waves, such as the Netherlands, he said.Durham University’s Prof Chris Stokes, lead author of the study, said: “We’re starting to see some of the worst-case scenarios play out almost in front of us. At current warming of 1.2C, sea level rise is accelerating at rates that, if they continue, would become almost unmanageable before the end of this century, [which is] within the lifetime of our young people.”The average global temperaturehit 1.5C for the first time in 2024. But the international target is measured as the average over 20 years, so is not considered to have been broken yet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It concluded: “Continued mass loss from ice sheets poses an existential threat to the world’s coastal populations.”Prof Andrea Dutton of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was part of the study team, said: “Evidence recovered from past warm periods suggests that several metres of sea level rise – or more – can be expected when global mean temperature reaches 1.5C or higher.”At the end of the last ice age, about 15,000 years ago, the sea level was rising at 10 times the rate today, driven by self-reinforcing feedbacks that may have been triggered by only a small increase in temperature. The last time CO2levels in the atmosphere were as high as today, about 3m years ago, sea level rise was 10-20 metres higher.Even if humanity can bring the planet back to its preindustrial temperature by removing CO2from the atmosphere, it will still take hundreds to thousands of years for the ice sheets to recover, the researchers said. That means land lost to sea level rise will remain lost for a long time, perhaps until the Earth enters the next ice age.Belize moved its capital inland in 1970 after a devastating hurricane, but its largest city is still on the coast and will be inundated with only 1 metre of sea level rise, Carlos Fuller, Belize’s longtime climate negotiator, said: “Findings such as these only sharpen the need to remain within the 1.5C Paris agreement limit, or as close as possible, so we can return to lower temperatures and protect our coastal cities.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisPolar regionsIceSea levelOceansMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday the senior coroner Heidi Connor said there had been gross health and safety breaches at the park.Kyra’s father, Leonard Hill, fought back tears as he read a pen portrait of his daughter to the inquest. “With her naturally enchanting, bright and beautiful eyes, paired with the softest, sweetest and warmest smile, she captivated hearts effortlessly.“A spirited individual, Kyra was resolute in her beliefs. She would stand up for what was right without hesitation, always the first to challenge a bully or defend a friend. Guided by an unwavering moral compass, she was a protector at heart, fiercely caring for her loved ones and always considering the feelings of others.”His Manchester United-supporting daughter had dreamed of being a footballer. “Had that dream not become her reality, she had her backup plan to pursue law and become a lawyer and fight for the truth, stating that she would ‘never defend evil people in court’,” he said.Speaking outside the court after the coroner made her finding, he added: “Summer should be a time of joy and creating happy memories with family and friends. It should never end in tragedy, should never mark the day we mourn our children’s lives, lost in places where they should have been safe.“The terrible reality is that, without urgent reform, more families will face these devastating goodbyes. Kyra’s life was a shining example of resilience and strength. Her memory demands that we demand safer standards now.“No parent should endure this pain, and no child’s life should be sacrificed so recklessly. We must act today for Kyra, and for every family that visits these leisure parks tomorrow. The time for words has passed. Now is the moment for action.”The inquest heard that a lifeguard spotted Kyra in trouble and dived in after her, before getting out to radio colleagues. A manager got there quickly but 37 minutes passed before 999 was called.Shortly before that, the park’s owner tried to phone a divemaster and off-duty firefighter, the inquest heard. The diver, Chris Knight, missed several calls, and CCTV showed him first entering the water more than an hour after Kyra had first been seen struggling.The coroner said there were no signs warning of deep water, despite it reaching 4.67 metres (more than 15ft) in parts. “In fact the only sign present warned of shallow water,” she said.Parents and carers were not advised to attend with children in a ratio of one to four, and young children were permitted to swim without buoyancy aids, the coroner said.There was also no emergency plan or risk assessment that took those factors into account, and no control measures were identified and put in place to “take account of these clear risks”, she ruled.Giving her conclusions, Connor said: “Members of the family, at no point have I forgotten that this was about your 11-year-old, Kyra, and I am so very sorry that you are here today. It must have been incredibly difficult to sit in court and hear some of the evidence that we’ve heard. I offer all of you my heartfelt condolences.”Explore more on these topicsBerkshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This robust decision addresses fundamental wrongs and restores fairness and accuracy to the narrative.”The Charity Commission said the ruling had largely vindicated its inquiry report, saying: “Today’s high court judgment has upheld our finding of mismanagement of the charity’s finances and has confirmed that it was based on ‘ample evidence’.”Kids Company was one of the UK’s best-known charities when itcollapsedin 2015 afterunfounded media reportsof abuse. It had been praised for its pioneering work in London, providing practical, emotional and educational support for thousands of severely traumatised children caught up in poverty and gang violence.Batmanghelidjh, itscharismatic founder, subsequently endured years of political and media vilification before beingdramatically exoneratedin a high court ruling in 2021 that praised her achievements and paid tribute to the charity’s trustees.The Charity Commission’s inquiry report into the collapse of Kids Company published a year later caused surprise when it delivered a formal finding of “mismanagement in the administration of the charity”, triggering the legal challenge by Batmanghelidjh that led to Tuesday’s ruling.Lawyers for Kids Company, whose former clinical director Michael-Karim Kerman continued the challenge on behalf of Batmanghelidjh afterher death in 2024, argued the commission’s report was vague and superficial, ignored positive findings of the previous year’s high court ruling, and “perpetuated stigma” around the charity.Sheldon ruled the commission’s criticism of Kids Company’s management of payments to children in its care amounted to “innuendo” and was “extremely unfair”. He also concluded that a separate criticism of Kids Company’s trustees’ running of the charity was “irrational”.Sheldon said: “Although the commission has a discretion as to what to include in the report of a statutory inquiry, that discretion must be exercised lawfully. Creating such extreme unfairness would not be lawful: in public law terms, it is irrational.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He rejected allegations the commission had predetermined the outcome of its inquiry.He said: “I do not consider that the report, looked at as a whole, was irrational. The fact that the report contains errors, and even a small number of irrational findings or observations, does not mean that the overall document is irrational.”Kerman said he would continue to “carry on the fight for justice for all those who have been stigmatised by the untruthful narrative [about Kids Company] created by the media and the actions of various government bodies since the charity’s closure”.He said: “Since Kids Company’s traumatic closure in August 2015 there has been a concerted attempt to denounce unfairly the charity and all who were touched by it, whether in the capacity of staff, volunteer, supporter or one of the thousands of vulnerable young children and families the charity served for nearly 20 years.”Explore more on these topicsKids CompanyCamila BatmanghelidjhCharitiesChildrenVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Too many people continue to suffer the heartbreak of losing a baby.”In 2015 Jeremy Hunt, the then health secretary, promised tohalve the number of stillbirthsand neonatal and maternal deaths that occurred in 2010 by 2030. These became known as the government’s maternity safety ambitions.The deadline for delivery was later brought forward to 2025, amid acute concern about the poor and sometimes unsafe care many women receive from NHS maternity services.While the NHS has made significant progress since 2015, it looks likely to fail to deliver the much lower rates promised on time.For example, there were 5.1 stillbirths for every 1,000 births in 2010. But in 2023, the most recent year for which figures are available, that had fallen to 3.9 – still well above the 2.6 target – according to Office for National Statistics data cited by Tommy’s and Sands.That meant that about 565 more stillbirths occurred in 2023 than would have done if hospitals had succeeded in getting the rate down as promised, the charities said.Similarly, there were two neonatal deaths per 1,000 births in 2010. But the rate was still 1.4 per 1,000 in 2023, again raising doubt that the target of one per 1,000 by 2025 would be achieved.“Despite a decline in the rates of stillbirth and neonatal death since 2010, progress has stagnated more recently and is not on track to meet the ambitions,” the report says.Clea Harmer, the chief executive of Sands, said: “These are not simply numbers, these are babies who are loved and will never be forgotten by their parents and families.”The drive to reduce premature births is also failing, it adds. Although the targetis to reduce the number of preterm births to 6% by this year, “there has been little progress to reduce the preterm birth rate, which has remained between 7.3% and 8.1% between 2010 and 2023”.The charities want ministers to bring in new targets, of two stillbirths and 0.5 neonatal deaths per 1,000 births by 2035, and ensure hospitals properly implement changes recommended in reports into lapses in maternity care.Gillian Merron, the minister for patient safety, women’s health and mental health, said: “Every instance of stillbirth and neonatal death is a tragedy, and it is unacceptable to know that some of these cases could have been prevented with better care. Far too many women are not receiving the safe, personalised and compassionate perinatal and maternity service they deserve.“There has been considerable progress in reducing the stillbirth rate and neonatal death rate, but we know there is much more to be done. Through our plan for change, we will transform the NHS and maternity and neonatal services by training thousands more midwives, building on the 5.8% increase in the number of midwives we have already achieved since coming into office, and we are setting an explicit target to close the black and Asian maternal mortality gap, so we can get our health service working for women again.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenNHSHealthEnglandPregnancyChildbirthnewsShareReuse this content"

We can see this already in Ukraine, just like in every other walk of life.“We have to do a great deal more in defence to get on top and then get ahead and at the cutting edge of this. I want to put the UK military on the leading edge of innovation inNatoon AI.”Healey will announce his review within the next three weeks, after nearly a year of work by the former defence secretary George Robertson and Gen Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK’s joint forces command.Despite reports that big procurement decisions would be delayed until later in the year, after the publication of the review, Healey said it would set out concrete plans to better equip Britain’s armed forces. “We’re making procurement decisions now, and we’ll continue to do that,” he said. “This won’t be a damp squib.”In February, the prime minister, Keir Starmer,announced a planto increase defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027.The British defence industry is also likely to receive a boost from additional cooperation with Europe, after this week’s UK-EU trade deal paved the way for UK companies to access the €150bn (£126bn) European defence fund.Healey is likely to disappoint some in the defence community who were hoping for the review to promise billions of pounds for eye-catching systems such asa British “iron dome”, created by a new network of domestic surface-to-air missiles.One source said such a plan would probably be an overly expensive way to protect the UK, compared with taking action to stymie potential threats abroad.View image in fullscreenJohn Healey: ‘We have to be capable of upgrading and innovating at a wartime pace if we want to give our armed forces the edge over adversaries.’Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAHealey said he wanted the Ministry of Defence to move away from making purchasing decisions that cost billions of pounds and took many years to complete, by which time the equipment in question was often out of date.Earlier this year, for example, the army received its first delivery of Ajax tanks, 15 years after the decision was made to buy them and eight years after the original delivery deadline.Healey said the UK’s experience in Ukraine had underlined the importance of moving faster with procurement decisions and putting technology at the centre of them.“We now see in Ukraine, on both sides, nearly 80% of the casualties caused by drones, not artillery,” he said. “For the first time ever, we see battlefield technology which has a life cycle measured in weeks, not months, let alone years.“We have to get more tech in the hands of our frontline forces. And we have to be capable of upgrading and innovating at a wartime pace if we want to give our armed forces the edge over adversaries.”One of the most important aspects of Healey’s technology-centred review will be expanding the use of AI. The British military is already trialling AI-enabled tools in countries such as Estonia, where the systems can automatically detect potential threats and select which weapon would be best to target them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Healey told the Guardian he was looking at creating a single pot of money to spend on AI, pulling together millions of pounds from across the department into one fund to spend on new systems.The focus on AI is likely to increase business for companies such as Palantir, one of the world’s biggest suppliers of military technology.Palantir has sold its automatic targeting systems to countries around the world, including tothe Israeli army for use in Gaza. Earlier this year its executives gave Starmer a tour of the company’s headquarters in Washington, and sources say Palantir is aiming to increase the amount of technology it sells to the British military.Despite concerns about how Palantir uses data and the political leanings of its Trump-supporting founder, Peter Thiel, Healey gave a vigorous defence of the company.“Palantir are playing a critical role in supporting Ukraine’s fight against Russia,” he said. “They have great innovations to help equip our armed forces when they work with us. And when they work for us, we set the standards.”Sources said Healey’s insistence on deploying high-technology equipment more quickly would result in some kit being put into the field even if it was not 100% ready.“Part of this is about getting equipment into the hands of troops and then making adaptations when we see what it can and cannot do,” one said.AI has been so central to the defence review that it has even been used to help write it. Officials used an automatic reading tool to summarise and analyse more than 8,000 responses from outside organisations, comprising more than 2m words.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryJohn HealeyLabourNatoArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

The company says the feature will make interacting with its search engine more like having a conversation with an expert capable of answering a wide array of questions.AI mode is being offered to all users in the US just two-and-a-half months after the company began testing with a limited Labs division audience.Google is also feeding its latest AI model, Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy concert tickets and conduct searches through live video feeds.Google agrees to pay Texas $1.375bn over data-privacy claimsRead moreIn another example of Google’s all-in approach to AI, the company revealed it is planning to leverage the technology to re-enter the smart glasses market with a new pair of Android XR-powered spectacles. The preview of the forthcoming device, which includes a hands-free camera and a voice-powered AI assistant, comes 13 years after the debut ofGoogle Glass, a product that the company scrapped after a public backlash over privacy concerns.Google didn’t say when its Android XR glasses will be available or how much they will cost, but disclosed they will be designed in partnership with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker. The glasses will compete against asimilar productalready on the market from Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Ray-Ban.The expansion builds upon a transformation that Google began a year ago with the introduction of conversational summaries called “AI overviews” that have been increasingly appearing at the top of its results page and eclipsing its traditional rankings of web links.About 1.5 billion people now regularly engage with “AI overviews”, according to Google, and most users are now entering longer and more complex queries.“What all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,” Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, said before a packed crowd in an amphitheater near the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, California.Although Pichai and other Google executives predicted AI overviews would trigger more searches and ultimately more clicks to other sites, it hasn’t worked out that way so far, according to the findings of search optimization firm BrightEdge.Clickthrough rates from Google’s search results have declined by nearly 30% during the past year, according to BrightEdge’s recently released study, which attributed the decrease to people becoming increasingly satisfied with AI overviews.The decision to make AI mode broadly available after a relatively short test period reflects Google’s confidence that the technology won’t habitually spew misinformation that tarnishes its brand’s reputation, and acknowledges the growing competition from other AI-powered search options from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity.The rapid rise of AI alternatives emerged as a recurring theme in legal proceedings that could force Google to dismantle parts of its internet empire after a federal judge last year declared its search engine to be an illegal monopoly.In testimony during a trial earlier this month, longtime Apple executive Eddy Cue said Google searches done through the iPhone maker’s Safari browser have been declining because more people are leaning on AI-powered alternatives.Google has cited the upheaval being caused by AI’s rise as one of the main reasons that it should only be required to make relatively minor changes to the way it operates its search engine because technology already is changing the competitive landscape.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The feature also warns that web publishers should be concerned about AI mode reducing the traffic they get from search results.Google’s upcoming tests in its labs division foreshadow the next wave of AI technology likely to be made available to the masses.Besides using its Project Mariner technology to test the ability of an AI agent to buy tickets and book restaurant reservations, Google will also experiment with searches done through live video and an opt-in option to give its AI technology access to people’s Gmail and other Google apps so it can learn more about a user’s tastes and habits. Other features on this summer’s test list include a “deep search” option that will use AI to dig even deeper into complex topics and another tool that will produce graphical presentations of sports and finance data.Google is also introducing its equivalent of a VIP pass to all its AI technology with an “ultra” subscription package that will cost $250 per month and include 30 terabytes of storage, too. That’s a big step beyond Google’s previous top-of-the-line package, which is now called “AI Pro”, that costs $20 per month and includes two terabytes of storage.Explore more on these topicsGoogleArtificial intelligence (AI)AlphabetComputingSearch enginesnewsShareReuse this content"

The stories were originally written in Kannada, the official language of the state of Karnataka in southern India.Described by the author and chair of judges Max Porter as “something genuinely new for English readers: a radical translation” of “beautiful, busy, life-affirming stories”, Heart Lamp’s 12 tales chronicle the lives of women in patriarchal communities in southernIndia. They were selected as well as translated by Bhasthi, the first Indian translator to win the award. She chose them from around 50 stories in six collections written by Mushtaq over a 30-year-period.The £50,000 prize – shared equally between writer and translator – was presented at the Tate Modern in London on Tuesday evening, where a video of actorAmbika Modreading from the winning title was also shown.Ambika Mod reads from Heart Lamp by Banu Mushtaq, translated by Deepa Bhasthi.Writing about the shortlist in the Guardian, John Self said Mushtaq and Bhasthi’s “wonderful collection” would be a “worthy winner”. The tone of the book “varies from quiet to comic, but the vision is consistent”, he wrote.Porter said he and his fellow judges – poet Caleb Femi, writer and Guardian critic Sana Goyal, author and translator Anton Hur and musician Beth Orton – spent six hours deliberating, during which they “argued a lot” before “unanimously” deciding the winner.Though Porter said they were looking for the “best book” above all else, he called Heart Lamp a “really special book in terms of its politics”. The stories “contain the feminism for which [Mushtaq] is known. And they contain extraordinary accounts of patriarchal systems and resistance,” he added. “But they aren’t activist stories. First and foremost they’re beautiful accounts of everyday life and particularly the lives of women.”Porter also praised Bhasthi’s translation, which he said “celebrates the movement from one language to another. It contains a multiplicity of Englishes. It is a translation with a texture.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Combs, 55, is facing charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. He wasarrested in September 2024and has pleaded not guilty.On Tuesday morning, Combs’s former personal assistant David James, who worked for Combs from 2007 and 2009, continued his testimonyafter first taking the stand on Mondayafternoon. His testimony was followed by that of Regina Ventura and exotic dancer Sharay Hayes, whose nickname is “The Punisher”.A timeline of allegations and charges against Sean ‘Diddy’ CombsRead moreRegina Ventura testified that in December 2011, her daughter emailed her and Combs’s assistant while flying home for Christmas. She told them that Combs was threatening to release explicit videos of Ventura after learning she was dating rapper Kid Cudi. Ventura also said in the email that Combs had told her that he would “be having someone hurt” her and Cudi.Regina Ventura said that Combs demanded $20,000 to reclaim what he said he had spent on Cassie. She and her husband took out a home-equity loan to get the money for Combs because she was “scared about my daughter’s safety”. Regina Ventura allegedly received instructions from Combs’s bookkeeper about how to wire the money and sent it to him. However, the money was returned several days later.When Cassie Ventura returned home for Christmas, her mother said, she then learned of Combs’s alleged violence. The elder Ventura took photographs of the bruises on her daughter’s body to document them.Earlier in the day, during James’s testimony, he detailed his duties, which had included setting up hotel rooms for Combs, laying out Combs’s clothes and toiletries, and procuring “personal items” such as baby oil, lubricant, condoms and snacks. He also described Combs’s medicine bag, which allegedly contained dozens of pill bottles that contained ecstasy and Percocet.In one part of his testimony, James spoke of a New Year’s Eve party where he took an ecstasy pill. After the event, James said, Combs had a video of him dancing at the party and allegedly told him: “I want to keep this footage in case I ever need it.”James also recounted an incident from 2008 when he, along with a member of Combs’s security detail, saw rival record executive Suge Knight at a diner in Los Angeles. He said Combs ordered them to return with him to the diner, noting that en route he saw three guns on Combs’s person but that when they arrived, Knight was gone. James told the jury he was “shook up” by the incident.“This was the first time as his assistant that I realized my life was in danger,” James said, adding that after the incident, he gave his six-month notice.On cross-examination, Combs’s defense attorneys pointed out inconsistencies in James’s account of the Knight incident, referencing prior statements James had made to the government.They questioned James about a physical altercation with Combs’s chef, which he admitted to, saying that he “squeezed her wrists” and told her to “stay in her lane”. James testified that after the incident, Combs told him: “You can’t be putting your hands on a woman.”After Regina Ventura concluded her testimony, the prosecution called on exotic dancer Hayes.Hayes said that he had been hired by Ventura and Combs between eight and a dozen times to take part in Combs’s “freak-offs”, with the last session being in 2016. He testified that Combs had never appeared intoxicated and gave directions during the sexual encounters.Asked whether Ventura seemed to enjoy herself during the “freak-offs”, Hayes said that his understanding had been that “we were creating a scene, a sexy scene, that was enjoyable to her partner”. He noted that sometimes he observed her “wince” and “sigh” at the frequency of Combs’s instructions.Under cross-examination, Hayes said he had not perceived any discomfort from Ventura “with what was going on” and never saw any violence.After Hayes, Gerard Gannon, the Homeland Security Investigations special agent who led the March 2024 search of Combs’s Miami Beach home, took the stand.Gannon testified that AR-15 rifle parts had been found in closets in the main bedroom. Jurors were also shown photos of other items found in the room, including high heels, sex toys, baby oil, lubricants and lingerie.Gannon’s testimony will resume on Wednesday morning.Earlier this week, the jury heard fromsinger Dawn Richardand Kerry Morgan, a former close friend of Ventura’s during her relationship with Combs. Both womentestified that they had witnessed Combs assaulting Ventura.Morgan also recounted a separate incident from 2018 when she said she was personally attacked by Combs, telling the court that Combs struck her on the head with a wooden hanger and choked her while Ventura was in the bathroom.Morgan claimed that after the attack, Combs sent her money and she signed a non-disclosure agreement. She also testified that during Ventura’s relationship with Combs, Ventura would tell her that she couldn’t leave him because he “controlled everything” in her life.The trial is expected to last seven more weeks. If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.In the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

The motive is under investigation, but Brugada promised that her government would “continue its relentless fight against insecurity”.The attack took place at about 7am on a busy road in the Moderna neighbourhood, near an entrance to the Xola metro station.Initial reports indicate that Muñoz was waiting in the street for Guzmán, who came to pick him up.Video from a security camerashow a man in a white top and a motorbike helmet waiting by Guzmán’s car before he suddenly pulls out a pistol and starts firing – first at Muñoz, then Guzmán – before running off screen. He reportedly fled with a partner on a nearby motorbike.It had the hallmarks of an organised crime hit – incidents that arerelatively rare in the capital.As mayor of Mexico City, Brugada holds one of the most powerful political posts in the country after PresidentClaudia Sheinbaum, and they are allies in the Morena party.Sheinbaum condemned the killings and said during her morning press conference that there would not be impunity. Neither Guzmán nor Muñoz had a security detail, but Sheinbaum said she was not aware of any threats against them.Guzmán had worked with Brugada for years and was reportedly one of the peopleclosest to her in government.At a press conference shortly after the attack, Brugada, dressed in black, paid tribute to the two victims in a strained voice.“[Guzmán] was a wonderful, tireless, good woman. I’ve known [Muñoz] almost since … He’s one of the most intelligent people I’ve ever met, and extremely responsible,” she said. “I want to embrace their families, friends, loved ones and comrades in struggle. We in the city’s cabinet are shocked and mourn the loss of two dear comrades.”Authorities were investigating the motive and checking surveillance camera footage to identify the attackers, said Brugada in a statement.Two hours after the attack, the bodies had been removed by the police and all that was left was broken glass and a pool of blood drying in the morning sun.Just down the road, a shoeshiner said he was there when it happened.“I was right here working when they shot them and I didn’t even realise,” he said, before explaining: “I’m a little deaf.”“But there was no panic,” he added. “Everyone just started looking that way and then my friend here told me there were two dead people by a car.”“I actually didn’t hear the shots either,” said the friend, a stall owner called José Antonio. “I think it must have been with a silencer.”He added: “The killers didn’t try to hide it – they did it at rush hour.”The murders are the highest-profile attacks on government officials in Mexico City since the assassination attempt on the city’s then police chief Omar García Harfuch five years ago.In that attack, gunmen linked to the Jalisco New Generation cartel ambushed García Harfuch as he left his home, riddling his car with hundreds of bullets and killing three people, but not García Harfuch himself, who survived to become security minister of today’s federal government.“We won’t let this cowardly act go unpunished,” wroteGarcía Harfuch on X, as he promised the federal government’s assistance in the investigation.At the scene of the crime, José Antonio, the stall owner, said he had never seen anything like it in more than half a century living in La Moderna.“It’s a calm neighbourhood,” he said. “They were targeted. I guess for professional killers it doesn’t matter whether there are people around or not. They do it and they get out of there.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The movement director Coral Messam is describing her experience of a stroke. “It’s a horror movie. It’s a betrayal. From the time I was conceived, I was meant to move. This is far,farfrom who I was. It is soul destroying to the maximum.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When it happened in 2023, the Wolverhampton-born choreographer had just created the explosive dance in Steve McQueen’s film Blitz, and was preparing Stranger Things: The First Shadow, the spectacular stage prequel to the Netflix hit.These productions enhance a gleaming CV that ranges from Small Island at the National Theatre to movement and intimacy direction across both stage and screen. Michaela Coel adored Messam’s pieceRun It Back for Talawa Theatre Companyand brought her on board for the rivetingly embodied I May Destroy You. “I create work from the heart,” says Messam. “It’s my superpower. I seem to bring out the magic in a cast – I’m all about you being yourself, and just having a really good time.”We’re sitting in a bar tucked behind the stalls at London’s Phoenix theatre, where Stranger Things opened in 2023. Messam only recently returned to the theatre, but says: “I feel like I’m home.” Protecting her affected left arm, she navigates twisty stairs and dark spaces without help, but warns me that there will be tears – the emotional volatility resulting from the stroke is only enhanced by revisiting the professional highs and the “cruel” reverses of the past months.View image in fullscreenEverybody dance … Steve McQueen’s Lovers Rock, part of his Small Axe series.Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/BBC/McQueen LimitedBlitz followed her collaboration with McQueen on the exuberantLovers Rockin his Small Axe series. “I will do anything for him,” she says, “we have the same instincts.” For Blitz, set in London in the darkest days of the second world war, she choreographed sequences for the swanky Café de Paris and the underground club where Saoirse Ronan and CJ Beckford hurl themselves into ecstatic swing. “A lot of the bands in these clubs were African American and African Caribbean, the elite of the elite,” she says. “There was a conglomerate of races and cultures – same-sex and mixed-race couples, it was all happening.”Her work for Stranger Things began with an enigmatic video call with “two charismatic gentleman” who turned out to be directors Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin. She was recommended by the National Theatre’s Rufus Norris, who said: “You’re looking for a fucking good movement director called Coral.”Messam immersed herself in research, figuring out how to make this eerie world move, and landed on the lindy hop. The athletic mid-century dance craze born in African American culture ignites the play’s small-town setting. Messam told the cast: “You can’t look like you’re from this century. The key is in the music – it will give you a different rhythm. It’s 1959 – rock and roll is opening the cracks, the youth are being rebellious, Elvis is doing sexy things, whoa!”Each teen character embraces lindy differently: “It’s freedom for them all.” Except for troubled Henry Creel who will grow into Vecna, antagonist of the TV show. “The dance freaks him out,” Messam explains. “Everything’s sweating, he doesn’t like the uncontrollability.”Henry’s troubles go beyond reluctant booty-shaking. The show exposes the bodily flux of adolescence. “Initially, we don’t quite see Henry’s eyes. He’s closed off, a teenager going through multiple transitions.” Under stress, he morphs into a monster capable of terrifying violence. “I tried to think like a doctor,” Messam says. “I looked at anatomy and physiology, how the spine and pelvis change. How does bone shift? What does it do to muscle and organs?” On stage, Henry’s entire body appears to reset itself.View image in fullscreen‘His body is no longer his’ … Henry Creel in Stranger Things: The First Shadow.Photograph: Manuel HarlanAs the workshops progressed, Messam was getting headaches (“I thought: it’s the menopause”), but just before rehearsals began, in July 2023, she had a stroke, alone at home. She lists what she describes as a succession of traumas: the sudden stroke itself, eight weeks in hospital, a difficult spell in rehab, plus the end of a six-year relationship. “I couldn’t walk, I could hardly talk. From being on top of the world, loving life, being free in my body, it was a massive change. Literally like being in hell.”Her left side was the most affected. Uncannily, Henry’s transformation also begins with his left hand, which had become a focus of her movement research. Messam looks down at the left arm she holds against her, the parallel unavoidable. “His body is no longer his. It has this other thing that controls him.” The tears fall.Sitting with us is neurophysiotherapist Carly Christensen, who has worked with Messam since they met on a retreat in November. “A stroke has huge impact,” Christensen says, “but when I met Coral, I knew she was still in there.” The pair share a daunting work ethic: “Coral is disciplined, she’s an athlete. She knows what it takes.”“On the retreat,” Christensen says, “Coral was like, I can’t go back to work until things are normal.” Shortly after which, “Coral taught the entire therapy team how to lindy hop in 10 minutes!”Messam is edging back into work. She has met the current Stranger Things cast and talked about the dance. “That was quite a big thing for me – I didn’t want to be scared of it.” Her energy is returning and she is taking on a “very little project” with an associate. Despite all the loss and grief, she says, “I want to be stronger than I was before. I’m a lover of life, and I’m not done yet.”Stranger Things: The First Shadow is at the Phoenix theatre, LondonExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreDanceStranger ThingsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

And the Iranian authorities, tensely and hypocritically aware of world scrutiny and indeed the soft-power prestige still to be accrued from Panahi’s eminence, appear (almost) to tolerate it.Now Panahi has come to Cannes with what might be his most emotionally explicit film yet: a film about state violence and revenge, about the pain of tyranny that co-exists with ostensible everyday normality. There are macabre stabs of satire, black comedy and horror-farce, and the movie almost looks like an Iranian dissident tribute to Weekend at Bernie’s or even Hitchcock’s The Trouble With Harry.A man (Ebrahim Azizi) is driving at night with his heavily pregnant wife and young daughter in the car and suffers the time-honoured suspense thriller shock-premise of hitting something in the darkness: a dog. This simple accident causes his car to break down after just five minutes back on the road, and he finds himself pulling over at random at a garage belonging to Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri), nicknamed “Jughead” because of his habit of holding his painful kidneys with one hand, his arm like a jug handle.The driver has a disability too, a limp, and Vahid is stunned, scared and angry to realise that he knows this man; and it sets in train a bizarre series of events that reunites a disparate cohort of Vahid’s acquaintances who have all suffered at the hands of the state. These include bookseller Salar, wedding photographer Shiva (Mariam Afshari), the couple whose wedding photos she is taking, bride Goli (Hadis Pakbaten) and groom Ali (Majid Panahi), and local hothead Hamid (Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr).A grotesque, almost dreamlike sequence of scenes takes us to various locations, including a remote desert with a tree that Hamid says looks a stage-set for Waiting for Godot. The plot twists and turns are startling, almost unreal; can it be true that normal people like this can countenance violence? But if that seems implausible, perhaps that is because we don’t grasp the violence through which they have already lived. The narrative jolts and shunts us around like Vahid and his contemporaries in the back of his van; so do the shifts in tone from tragedy to comedy and back. But these storytelling chicanes never quite get us to the shark-jumping point of facetiousness or absurdity that they might in another, Anglo-Hollywood type of movie.There is some acid satire on Iranian officialdom’s addiction to bribes. A hospital nurse asks Vahid if he knows how to give a “present” or just make a scandal – and she wants a box of pastries to go with the money. A couple of shifty, dodgy security guards ask for a “present” in exchange for not making a fuss about the suspicious behaviour in the van, and not having cash doesn’t let Vahid off; these uniformed guys grinningly produce a debit card reader. They take bribes in the form of contactless payments.Perhaps Joe Orton might have enjoyed this tough, cynical movie, especially the group scenes in which Goli has to participate in the mayhem wearing her wedding dress. It’s another very impressive serio-comic film from one of the most distinctive and courageous figures in world cinema.A Simple Accident screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalDrama filmsIranJafar PanahiFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its bland, TV-movie tone of sentimentality fails to accommodate the existential nightmare of the main plot strand, or indeed the subordinate question of when and whether to put your elderly parent in a care home.Squibb plays Eleanor Morgenstein, a widowed Jewish lady with a waspish way of speaking her mind to condescending youngsters, including the blandly unhelpful teen working in a supermarket who presumes to tell Eleanor that all pickles taste pretty much the same – although it is difficult to tell exactly how mean twinkly-eyed lovable Eleanor is supposed to be for humiliating the admittedly dopey kid. She lives in Florida, sharing an apartment with her adored best friend Bessie Stern (Rita Zohar). Bessie is also widowed and Jewish, but unlike the US-born Eleanor, Bessie is aHolocaustsurvivor who is tormented by the horrifying experience, by the memory of her beloved brother who did not survive, and also by the fact that she has never experienced even the partial catharsis of telling her story publicly, having only told Eleanor.When Bessie dies, Eleanor moves back in with her harassed, divorced daughter Lisa (Jessica Hecht) and grandson (Will Price) in their small New York apartment and, from the first, feels sad and lonely. So she joins a Jewish seniors social group in the city, but is mortified to discover, too late, that it is specifically for Holocaust survivors. And so, poignantly keen to fit in and find companionship, Eleanor pretends to be a survivor, recycling Bessie’s memories and telling herself she’s honouring Bessie’s memory.View image in fullscreenBest friends … Squibb with Rita Zohar as BessieWhat could possibly go wrong? Well, the group is attended by NYU journalism student Nina (Erin Kellyman) who becomes best pals with the feisty Eleanor. Nina’s late mum (whose death was agonisingly recent) was Jewish, and Nina is moved by Eleanor’s amazing story and by her intention to get a late-life bat mitzvah; her resulting article interests Nina’s TV news commentator dad, Roger Davis (Chiwetel Ejiofor).The scene would appear to be set for the most sulphurous black horror non-comedy, surely: an unthinkable humiliation. But when the inevitable happens, nothing much happens at all, as if the film itself wishes to protect sweet old Eleanor from the amazingly stupid and dangerous thing she did. We segue quickly to the tedious non-issue of Roger needing to own his grief, as if that were comparably important or interesting. Everyone accepts Eleanor’s defence about honouring Bessie’s memory and the story isn’t picked up by anyone else. But all grownups know that Holocaust survivor imposture is a serious issue, because such cases can be seized on by neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers. And it is very fatuous for the “journalists” in this movie not to mention this at all.Then there is the care home issue. Lisa keeps hinting Eleanor would be better off in one. Eleanor is furious and adamant that she doesn’t want that, and the audience might well agree. She is, after all, razor-sharp mentally and in excellent physical shape. But finally, she seems to blandly accept going into a home. Why?Johansson has movingly spoken about her own Jewish heritage and about her family forebears who weremurdered during the Holocaust in the Warsaw ghetto. But sadly her Eleanor is far from great.Eleanor the Great screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCannes film festivalScarlett JohanssonHolocaustFestivalsSecond world warreviewsShareReuse this content"

No, not the already-infamous box office bombSnow White; the animated basis for that movie is a monumental achievement in the medium, but it’s ultimately a famous version of a timeless fairy tale that seems fair game for reinterpretation. Lilo & Stitch, however, is the rare sui generis piece of Disney animation – one that somehow emerged during a tumultuous time for the animation studio to become a substantial hit back in 2002.The film has endured because it’s a triumph of mixing techniques: old-fashioned ultra-expressive hand-drawn animation and watercolor backgrounds; dashes of newfangled computer animation to assist with some of its sci-fi-heavier scenes; and a story about a stranded alien befriending a misfit little girl that crosses ET with Looney Tunes anarchy.Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning review – world-saving Tom Cruise signs off with wildly entertaining adventureRead moreThe story is still there in the new sorta-live-action reimagining of Lilo & Stitch. The story is almost always still there in Disney’s series of self-remakes, especially when it comes to their more modern classics. (Say what you will about that recent Snow White, but it’s not a subservient recreation.) Plenty of dialogue is retained, too, and the movie does a fine job of transferring Stitch into a 3D live-action environment, not monkeying around with a near-perfect cartoon design. The fuzzy blue creature, his Muppet-with-teeth mouth and his alien-bunny ears intact, still endures. Kids will love him, as ever.The movie around him, however, is ghastly. It’s not just that Lilo (Maia Kealoha), a six-year-old Hawaiian girl living with her older sister Nani (Sydney Elizebeth Agudong), loses the carefully detailed and collaborative “performance” given by animators and her original voiceover in favor of kid-actor mugging and cutesy wisecracks. That’s not little Kealoha’s fault, of course, and possibly unavoidable in making a live-action version at all. But far worse, director Dean Fleischer Camp (Marcel the Shell with Shoes On) doesn’t give either the poor humans or special-effects characters any kind of visible technical support in their impossible task.That’s evident right away, in an opening sequence that serves as a model for how to lose the rhythm of a film even while following its blueprint nearly line-for-line. The scene where alien mad scientist Jumba (Zach Galifianakis) is brought before a galactic council to answer for his creation of Experiment 626, later named Stitch (still voiced by the character’s co-creator, Chris Sanders) biffs the timing on every beat, speed-running through the requisite exposition and Stitch’s subsequent escape in a jumble of barely-coherent cuts and stiffly rendered images of the earlier film’s whimsical designs. None of it really tracks unless you’ve already watched the cartoon.Camp’s seemingly panicked strategy never varies, even as the story slows down to examine the hectic lives of Lilo and Nani, orphaned sisters threatened with social-services separation unless young adult Nani can get (and keep) a better-paying job. The arrival of Stitch, who Lilo mistakes for a dog and adopts, brings chaos into their lives, though less havoc overall than this movie brings to its source material.Disney has allowed, maybe even encouraged, its film-makers to take a work known for its idiosyncratic beauty and humor, and cut it into a hash of coverage, where chintzy reaction shots are prioritized over the scenic beauty of Hawaii or how its residents might move through this world. When Jumba and his nerdier fellow alien Pleakley (Billy Magnussen) take human form to pursue Stitch on Earth (and also to save further on already cut-rate-looking visual effects), the movie can’t even be bothered to frame their funny walks clearly. Even more than some green-screen disasters, the actors feel as if they’re performing into a void.As Stitch grows into his broken family, the movie manages a few affecting and funny moments. But does it deserve credit for recreating them all from the earlier movie, almost always making them a little bit worse in the process? With a running time expanded by more than 20 minutes (as these things so often are), there should at least be room for a substantial round of brand-new Stitch antics. Yet the bits and pieces of new material barely seem to understand Stitch’s initially malevolent personality, recoding him as the untrained party animal he’s pretending to be. Occasional new ideas, like a ray gun that opens up shortcut portals, are squandered with first-idea-best-idea roughness.All told, there’s hardly a single smile in Lilo & Stitch ’25 not generated through the stolen valor of the earlier screenplay, and hardly a poignant moment that’s not more admirably raw in the G-rated version. That original film gave both Lilo and Nani some real anger and pain beneath their strife, with Stitch as a rampaging id not quite large enough to conquer the world. Camp’s remake wants to manage that pain more tidily, and give Nani in particular a more “correct”, entirely uninteresting ending. The 2002 film can stand comfortably alongside superficially similar but tonally distinct children’s stories like ET, The Iron Giant, and My Neighbor Totoro. Now, however, Lilo & Stitch steps forward from that crowd of modern classics – as the only one whose keepers didn’t bother to protect it from a cheap branded knockoff.Lilo & Stitch is out on 21 May in the UK, 22 May in Australia, and 23 May in the US.Explore more on these topicsWalt Disney CompanyFamily filmsAction and adventure filmsComedy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The idea of Fast & Furious as odd local tradition, instead of a bunch of teens raised on the Fast & Furious movies, is the most charming, if far-fetched and unexplained, aspect of Motorheads, which you can easily imagine being pitched as Dom Toretto & Co but make it gen Z kids in a dead-end Rust belt town. Created by John A Norris, Motorheads has the clear imprimatur of the mega-corporation’s streaming wing: a checklist of genre parts cobbled together into an ungainly product that seems both cheap and expensive at once. The pilot contained more Top 40 hits than I’ve ever heard on a TV show, including assumedly pricey tracks by Olivia Rodrigo, Benson Boone, Teddy Swims and more; the characters discuss “winter break” while the trees remains leafy and green.Overcompensating review – an exquisite frat bro orgy of shirt-ripping, chest-thumping … and self-loveRead moreMotorheads is at least self-aware that it’s not reinventing the teen soap wheel, coasting on the expected elements. New kid in town throwing a wrench in the social order? That would be twins Zac (Michael Cimino) and Caitlyn (Melissa Collazo), who have moved back to their mother Sam’s (Nathalie Kelley) hometown from Brooklyn, for reasons unknown, to live with their uncle Logan (Ryan Phillippe), a former Nascar mechanic who has retreated to his small auto-repair business. Unresolved daddy issues? The twins’ father, Christian Maddox, was a legendary driver who disappeared 17 years ago following a post-robbery car chase that became a viral YouTube video played in the series on loop. (Christian is played in flashback by Phillippe’s son Deacon, who looks far too young to be a father of twins, let alone a local legend.) Rich kid villain who is secretly overcompensating for deep insecurities? That would be Harris (Josh Macqueen), the son of a local magnate and reigning car champion, who drives a Porsche and boasts a near permanent sneer.Love triangle? Not one but two: Zac is immediately smitten with Harris’s Sandy-esque girlfriend, Alicia (Mia Healey), Caitlyn with closeted cool girl Kiara (Johnna Dias-Watson) and angsty loner Curtis (Uriah Shelton), who happens to be a motorcycle enthusiast. Ludicrously high and continuously escalating stakes? All of the parents, who apparently all had their kids during senior year, get tangled in another car chase crime operation that invariably ties into Zac and Harris’s ultimate drag race showdown. Also, there’s a diner.“That’s literally every high school,” jokes one parent when a fellow parent/ex-lover remarks how crazy it is that their sons are fighting over the same girl. True, though some make the ingredients pop more than others; The Summer I Turned Pretty, by far Amazon’s most successful entry into the YA market, turns similarly incestuous and ridiculous drama into compulsively watchable television befitting the legacy of such soaps as One Tree Hill and Gossip Girl. Motorheads, by contrast, repeatedly sputters through laughably bad lines (“Tell your lesbo sister to stay away from my girlfriend!”), even clunkier exposition (“I mean, your dad just lost her,” Alicia reminds Harris of his dead mother) and mediocre effects (an obviously CGI-ed bird omen, for one). Car race scenes that should get pulses racing instead drag, failing to pull focus from the inevitable second screen.The extent that the show works is credit to a winsome cast of new faces, particularly Cimino, Collazo, Shelton and Nicolas Cantu as archetypical nerd Marcel. While the elder Phillippe seems to strain for Logan’s world-weary, burned-out father figure, the kids’ chemistry feels natural, the show at its easiest and most enjoyable when it allows the foursome space to tease, bicker, hang out and toss around mechanical jargon while fixing up Christian’s old car.The group provide a sweet heartbeat for the series – faint, but enough for this viewer to power through the 10 overlong episodes that land in unsatisfying territory, anticipating a second season that, given the streaming services’ capriciousness with renewals, I fear will never come. Which is a shame, as Motorheads has potential – there’s some good parts in an ever-reliable engine, but this arrangement stalls.Motorheads is available now on Amazon Prime VideoExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAmazon Prime VideoUS televisionDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

In the final pages of his bestselling book,Gay Bar: Why We Went Out, Lin visits the old Soho boozer in London with his husband, where they encounter a “despondent” scene: spilled beer, backed-up toilets and a wasted drag queen. Even so, they are charmed by an older couple across the bar and wonder if they’ll be lucky enough to end up like them. The site of a homophobic nail-bomb attack in 1999, the Admiral Duncan is another kind of survivor, and Lin admires it in spite of the mess. Such ambivalence is typical of his memoiristic writing, which spirals outward into digressive analyses of social and political events.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted the reader to feel a little exasperated with me’ … Jeremy Atherton Lin with his husband, left.Photograph: Jeremy Atherton LinThis time, the place is quiet and clean, and Lin has come alone – all of which is probably for the best, since we’re here to discuss his latest book, Deep House: The Gayest Love Story Ever Told. At once more personal and more political than anything he has ever written, it follows him and his partner as they navigate a precarious legal landscape for immigrants and LGBTQ+ people in their effort to build a home and life together.The couple met 29 years ago at Popstarz, a club night, when Lin was passing through London on a backpacking trip. (In Gay Bar, Lin refers to his partner in the third person, mostly as Famous Blue Raincoat. In Deep House he remains unnamed, though most of the book is addressed directly to him.)“I depict myself in the book as feeling a little unsure and resistant at first; counterintuitively, this bashful boy is the pursuer,” Lin says. “He’s so lovable that I wanted the reader to feel a little exasperated with me, like, ‘You’re never gonna get any better than this.’” Not long after returning to northern California, Lin seemed to get the message and invited his new British beau to visit. “Famous” came and never left. Overstaying his visa, he became a fugitive for love.It took a while for them to fully understand the implications of that decision. They struggled to find an apartment given that only Lin – on a writer’s income – could be named on the lease. Every loud noise or bright light outside their door sparked fears of an imminent raid. Accidents were a worry because “we were convinced you couldn’t go into hospital without being deported,” Lin writes.View image in fullscreenOld haunt … The Admiral Duncan in Soho, London.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images“We found ourselves laying down roots on a fault line – literally earthquake territory, but also a contentious political framework,” he tells me today. “By 2000, when we rented our first weird, damp apartment, 18 states still had sodomy laws on the books.” They were considered “illegal” in more ways than one.Lin writes extensively about the case law that led to the 2015 US supreme court decision in Obergefell v Hodges which legalised same-sex marriage across the US. Some of these are relatively obscure, such as Baker v Nelson (1971) and Boutilier v Immigration and Naturalization Service (1967), and he sympathetically details the lives of the plaintiffs, aware that most of them weren’t asking for much. Lin and his partner were less interested in pushing a gay rights agenda than safely crawling back into bed together. “We were half innocent and half obscene,” he writes. “We’d been infantilised by our governments – our ‘twink’ years prolonged.”At times, this could be a minor thrill. “I can’t deny there was an exhilaration when we went underground,” he tells me. For a middle-class kid in San Francisco’s Mission District in the early 2000s, being undocumented may have seemed like a punk bona fide. Marriage certainly did not – though at the time it was unavailable to them anyway. “A lot of queers, of course, didn’t want in on the historically proprietary and patriarchal institution in the first place,” Lin writes.Open relationships and polyamory were typical in their urban gay enclave; they duly navigated threesomes and foursomes, including, at one point, with another couple with whom they shared an apartment. The idea of marriage seemed almost too conventional by contrast. Nonetheless, Lin acknowledges that marriage “affords privileges, including mobility across borders. Marriage is, among other things, a passport”. Unable to cross international borders or even state lines without worry, Lin and his partner often felt stuck.As a white British person, Lin’s partner was perhaps in a more privileged position than those subjected to racial profiling. Lin writes about several suits filed by Asian immigrants, many of them in San Francisco, dating back to a string of racist laws passed by the US government in the 19th century, including the Chinese Exclusion Act. He also tells the story of his own parents, who met in the 1960s after his father emigrated to the US from Taiwan. As a biracial couple, they were only able to marry in Florida because anti-miscegenation laws had been struck down by Loving v Virginia a few years earlier.It’s unclear if Lin’s father or partner would have been able to remain in the country had Donald Trump been president at the time. Lin says he finished edits on Deep House before Trump returned to the Oval Office in January, and he never expected the immigration crackdown to be this bad. “There are a lot of moments in the book where we think that whoever comes through the door is going to be [Ice],” he says. “That was very far-fetched then. But our paranoia has become the reality.”View image in fullscreen‘We were convinced you couldn’t go into hospital without being deported’ … Ice agents prepare to carry out a raid.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesIn 2007, Lin and his husband relocated to the UK, where they obtained a civil partnership (backdated as a marriage, once same-sex unions became fully legal in 2014). Their timing was lucky. “When my next letter arrived from the UK Home Office, with a visa that established my leave to remain, it was genuinely welcoming, almost chipper,” he notes. “But less than five years later, then home secretary Theresa May would usher in the ‘hostile environment’ policy, a brutally monikered set of measures intended to drive out undocumented denizens that would send ripples of malice toward foreign nationals and minority groups more generally.”Lin began writing Gay Bar while working a string of retail jobs in London. “I would be writing on the cash register or on the back of the receipts,” he recalls. Eileen Myles was a big influence on his personal, essayistic prose style, as was Michelle Tea (briefly an upstairs neighbour in San Francisco). The 2010s were an exuberant time for London’s gay scene, but also a challenging one for nightlife spaces; by the time the Covid-19 pandemic hit, nearly half of the city’s clubs had already closed. Lin found himself documenting these losses, which eventually became Gay Bar.That book won the National Book Critics Circle award for autobiography and spent weeks atop international bestseller lists. Lin never anticipated the success. “It’s amazing but also terrifying,” he says. “We weren’t prepared for it.” Meanwhile, “London had lost its sense of wonder”. He and his partner relocated to St Leonards-on-Sea, where he says they often walk along the beach twice a day. When the news cycle or writer’s block is stressing him out, he says, “We go down to the beach and pick up a pebble, name it with whatever is bothering us, and throw it into the water. It’s surprisingly effective.”View image in fullscreen‘London had lost its sense of wonder’ … St Leonards-on-Sea.Photograph: Stephen R Johnson/AlamyAs for how Famous Blue Raincoat feels about all the public attention, Lin says his partner is able to read his work with a certain detachment. “I’m working within the idiom of nonfiction, for which the criterion is accuracy, but I’m also writing my remembrance of the past. He’s more forgiving of my confabulations, because he’s an artist. There’s a part of him that’s quite good at loosening up. Although there’s a seven-page sex scene in Deep House that I read out loud a couple years ago, and I think he felt a bit exposed,” Lin admits with a laugh.Does he have any advice for open relationships? “Communication,” Lin says without hesitation. “So much of the communication that we’ve been fortunate to have is based on implicit trust,” he says. “I think maybe it’s so robust because of our experience feeling like it was us against the world.”Some wisdom has also surely come with age. “I had come to identify as someone who crossed borders – but slowly understood that adult life had to involve the creation and maintenance of boundaries, a matter of recognising that the world is not just one’s own,” he writes towards the end of Deep House. Marriage may have been a way of protecting their relationship and immigration status, but it also confirmed that they really did want to settle down. If “we go out to be gay”, as Lin writes in Gay Bar, he realised that remaining home with his husband wouldn’t make him any less of a homosexual. “This book is the domestic antidote [to Gay Bar],” he explains. “It’s ‘why we stayed in’. Which is to say, inside the interior of our home, but also inside each other.”Deep House (Penguin Books Ltd, £25) and Gay Bar (Granta Books, £10.99) by Jeremy Atherton Lin.

Two wooden crucifixes stand in a freshly hacked clearing, lashed to tall, thin stumps. One of them bears the name Bruno Pereira. The other, Dominic Phillips, the author. The image splits the book in two. Before it, the pages are filled with Phillips’s vivid prose. After it, his friends and former colleagues have gathered and attempted to complete his work as best they can.Erected on the bank of the Itaquaí river, in a remote part of the Brazilian Amazon, the crosses mark the spot at which – early on the morning of 5 June 2022 – Pereira and Phillips were murdered. The two men had been travelling downriver in a small motorboat when they were attacked. Pereira, a Brazilian forest protector and Indigenous specialist, was shot first: three times, including in the back. Phillips, a Guardian reporter, was shot once in the chest, at close range. His final word, according to his alleged killers, was “No”.Except that wasn’t to be his final word, not by far. He left a half-finished manuscript and much of the raw material that, filtered and processed by his particular mind, would have made up the rest. He had a plan, and many ring binders full of handwritten notes from river expeditions, road trips, hundreds of interviews and reams of research.Empowered by Alessandra Sampaio, Phillips’s widow, a committee made up of journalists Andrew Fishman, Tom Hennigan, Jonathan Watts and David Davies, as well as Phillips’s agent, Rebecca Carter,assumed the responsibility of making it all mean something. “Nothing good could come from such a heinous murder,” they write in their foreword, “but we could at least prevent the killers from silencing the story that Dom had been trying to tell.” A two-year investigation into the murders concluded in 2024 with federal charges against an alleged illegal fishing and poaching mastermind, who denies any involvement.Phillips’s half of How to Save the Amazon begins in the same place the author’s life ended: on an expedition to the Javari valley with Pereira. Death is there, lurking in the undergrowth, from the start. Phillips muses freely on all the ways he might die. There are the jararaca snakes his Indigenous companions swat like flies, the giant hornets, caiman, anacondas and jaguars, not to mention the risks posed by illegal gold miners and loggers, armed fishing gangs, and narco traffickers. The unintended pathos this creates is soon overcome. The Javari valley – a protected territory home to the world’s highest concentration of voluntarily isolated Indigenous groups – is where Phillips’s passion for the Amazon is born, and that passion leaps from the page. From his first taste of roast monkey – “its deliciously charred, fatty meat, like pancetta” – it’s clear that Phillips’s voice is one worth listening to: he is open to experience, unafraid to take risks, flexible in his thinking.That the Amazon is in need of passionate attention is beyond doubt. Twenty percent of the Brazilian Amazon has been deforested – most of that within the last few decades – bringing it dangerously close to what climate scientists have identified as a “tipping point”, after which the entire thing is likely to die back to semi‑arid savannah, with catastrophic consequences for South America and the world.The complex web of crime and bad law that makes this possible is its own evil ecosystem, an anti-rainforest liquidating the Amazon’s natural riches and converting them into what the Kayapó call “sad leaves” – money. The main scam, as Phillips describes it, works something like this: you select a swathe of the Amazon and illegally log it. Then you set fire to whatever is left, and send in the cows. The cows are important because, under Brazilian property law, productivity and ownership go hand in hand, and cows – by dint of their expansive pasture requirements – are the simplest way to lay claim to vast tracts of land.Could better laws save the Amazon? Even the useful ones – such as the requirement for Amazonian farmers to leave 80% of their land forested – are frequently ignored, and illegal gold miners and loggers often operate in plain sight. “It’s difficult,” Phillips writes, “to think of anywhere else outside of a war zone where it’s so easy to find people blatantly breaking the law.” He is cautiously optimistic about the possibility of using agroforestry – an agricultural system that emulates the forest – to recover cleared land, but the thought is underdeveloped. The fact is, Phillips was just hitting his stride when he and Pereira were felled by the destructive forces he’d taken such care to describe.“No reader should be in any doubt that these pages have been stained by blood,” write his successors. “The killers blasted a gaping wound in this book that is far too great for any infusion of solidarity to heal.” Over the final half-dozen chapters, Phillips’s fellow writers – Jon Lee Anderson, Eliane Brum, Stuart Grudgings, Beto Marubo, Helena Palmquist, and Tom Phillips, as well as those previously mentioned – struggle with Phillips’s impossible handwriting, retrace his footsteps and reveal tantalising flashes of what could have been. The result is a book both brilliant and broken, one that is ultimately as inspiring and devastating as the Amazon itself.How to Save the Amazon: A Journalist’s Deadly Quest for Answers by Dom Phillips and contributors is published by Ithaka (£22).

And no one is especially sad. Certainly not his immediate family, who, convening at the ancestral home, agree that, as well as being a “visionary” and a “legend” for his part in staging the Teddy Bears’ Picnic, a sort of British Woodstock, Philip was undoubtedly “a shit” – a liar, a bully and a cheat.It is an uncertain legacy. As the central event in Anna Hope’s fifth novel, Albion, his funeral represents a broader cultural laying to rest of all that Philip and his ancestors – and, indeed, the English country house itself – represent: empire, exploitation, entitlement and privilege. Each member of the family, in their own way, wishes to escape the past’s long shadow and begin afresh. Frannie, the eldest, who has inherited the estate, has spent the last 10 years rewilding it and creating a “nature corridor all the way to the sea”. Milo, a recovering alcoholic and sex addict, has grand plans to build a treetop rehabilitation centre for the world’s 1%. Isa, the youngest, wants nothing to do with any of it and has become a teacher at a school in south London; Grace, Philip’s widow, is filled with regret for not having left sooner or protected her children better. And then there is Clara, who may or may not be Philip’s illegitimate daughter. Rather than burying the past, she wishes to bring it into the cold light of day.Albion is an ambitious novel, in scope and implication, and it begins promisingly. The scene is very well set; the house and its grounds – family portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds, gardens by Humphry Repton – are entirely convincing. The estate’s current iteration as the “Albion Project”, given over to “ecosystem restoration”, with yurts and shepherd’s huts for middle-class weekenders (and derided by Isa as “about as wild as a fucking printed tea towel”), is perfectly pitched. So too is the idea of the Teddy Bears’ Picnic, the remnants of which can still be found in the woods, along with the ageing hippy Ned, who lives there in his bus.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Milo in particular offers rich pickings: he turns up in his “sustainably sourced” trainers, puffing on a vape, armed with detailed plans for “The Clearing”, a wonderfully barmy idea to heal the world’s leaders with magic mushrooms. Milo is trailed by the slick fund manager Luca, a childhood friend of the family and Frannie’s erstwhile beau. The reader leans forward, expecting high drama, backstabbing and betrayal – there is talk of money troubles and even of evicting Ned from his home of 50 years – but nothing much comes of any of this.Instead, the main event is the arrival of Clara, who has flown all the way from America to attend the funeral. She ends up being a more unwelcome surprise than anyone was expecting. Without giving too much away, she is a PhD student and has been digging into the family history, in particular the source of the Brookes’ wealth, which was used to build the family home. She delivers a lecture (literally a lecture – she has notes) in the middle of Philip’s commemoration dinner. What she reveals profoundly shocks the gathered family, especially Frannie, who sees herself as a force for positive change and “intergenerational justice”.This is a difficult topic, and it is here unsatisfyingly handled. The engaging – if over-numerous – family dramas and flawed cast of characters are all overshadowed by Clara’s massive revelation, which is itself then swiftly nullified by a round of therapeutic hugging and sharing, with the enactment of propitiatory rituals (not unlike the laughable “healing” exercises satirised earlier). Any residual satire or irony is dispelled as the sun comes out and happy endings blossom. Clara, mission accomplished, flies off, and talk turns to “the next part of the story”. This part is over; let’s move on. As a conclusion it feels bland and seamless, which was surely not the intention.Albion by Anna Hope is published by Fig Tree (£16.99).

Almost everything on the map can be destroyed, and there is immediate fun to be had from causing merry mayhem with your truck, clattering through deckchairs on the beach or driving straight through the middle of a diner and watching it collapse spectacularly behind you. But there is a void at the heart of this game where the core hook should have been.We get a glimpse of its potential during a mission that sees you racing to catch up with a rival’s delivery truck before it can reach its destination. The aim is to manoeuvre alongside, and hold down a button so the crane on the back of your own truck can sneakily lift the package off their vehicle and on to yours. All the while, rival trucks are attempting to ram you off the road, and after you grab the package, you then have to deliver it while fending off the attentions of these other drivers. It leads to some wonderfully comic scenes in which a hotel owner thanks you profusely for a consignment while standing in front of the ruins of his newly destroyed establishment: a casualty of the violent act of delivery.View image in fullscreenKeep on truckin’ … Deliver at All Costs.Photograph: KonamiThis one frantic mission is by far the best part of the game, and if the rest of Deliver at All Costs followed a similar path – a Crazy Taxi-style mad dash against the clock between pickup and delivery, with whole neighbourhoods razed in pursuit of logistical efficiency – then there would no doubt be a few more stars stuck to this review. Instead each mission varies wildly in content and quality. Some are passably enjoyable, including one that involves taking photos of a UFO while avoiding its laser beam. Others are simply dull, such as one in which you deliver balloons tied to the back of your truck, which intermittently cause it to rise into the air: more irritating than entertaining. Zany does not equal fun.If all of that kind of thing had been confined to side missions while the main game was about zipping parcels back and forth as quickly as possible, it might have worked. But these hit and miss escapades are all we get, and by the final third, the concept of delivering things is ditched completely. Instead Deliver at All Costs tells a dim-witted story through relentless dull cut scenes, with writing and acting that veer from passable to downright rotten. Protagonist Winston Green is a man with a murky past who ends up at loggerheads with his boss, Donovan, before the game jumps the shark entirely and veers off into po-faced sci-fi nonsense. It doesn’t help that the permanently angry Winston is one of the most unlikable video game protagonists ever created.As in Grand Theft Auto, you can hop out of your car and explore, but here there’s hardly anything to find, save for a few viewpoints (which are just that) and a tiny handful of side missions. These range from fun (race a parachutist down a mountain) to boring (find a man who looks like the mayor). There is the occasional unique car to discover, but as you have to use your delivery truck for most missions, doing so is largely pointless. The novelty of driving around in, say, a hot dog van wears off in seconds. There are crates full of cash to find too, but there’s little of note worth buying. The shop sells spare parts you can use to assemble gadgets for your truck, but apart from the boost-giving jet engine, they’re mostly superfluous.It’s all so frustrating. Deliver at All Costs offers up a beautiful destructible playground, then barely utilises it, instead focusing on a bizarre, half-baked story that somehow ends in a courtroom drama. It feels like being invited to a glittering champagne reception, then getting collared by a conspiracy theorist who insists on describing the plot of his hokey sci-fi novel for the next eight hours.

Seen at the Edinburgh international festivallast summer, The Fifth Step – his first playsince 2018– gives him a character both volatile and vulnerable in a two-hander bristling with playwright David Ireland’s signature style of knotty provocation and ribald comedy.Lowden resumes the role of Luka, now playing opposite Martin Freeman as James (a part originated in Scotland by Sean Gilder). Luka is new to Alcoholics Anonymous and asks the older James to be his sponsor; the drama unfolds on the verge of theconfessional stagein AA’s 12-step programme, with Luka expected to acknowledge the harm his addiction has done to himself and others.The play is perceptive about what it means to put your trust not just in another person but also in a programme or organised religion – and how to reconcile what you gain from the exchange with any flaws or failings of that body. Ireland pulls off a tone that is sceptical yet earnest, echoing the sincerity and hangdog humour of the opening song, I’m Just an Old Chunk of Coal (But I’m Gonna Be a Diamond Someday), by Johnny Cash, who knew a thing or two about addiction.View image in fullscreenVolatile … Jack Lowden in The Fifth Step.Photograph: Johan PerssonThat song is warped in the first of several scene transitions, coolly lit by Lizzie Powell, that add off-kilter energy to an in-the-round, interval-free production, stretched as tight as a drum by director Finn den Hertog. The humour ricochets as it did in den Hertog’sSquare Go, which tussled with younger masculinity, and there is a brilliantly handled apparition ofWillem Dafoeas Jesus in a gym (almost Christ on a bike) that recalls the vision of Gerry Adams in infant form in Ireland’s unforgettableCyprus Avenue.Designer Milla Clarke dresses Luka in hoodie and trainers, James in smart shirt and suede shoes; the younger man is all restless legs and twitching fingers, his sponsor composed and watchful. As ever, Freeman is a master of the perplexed reaction, especially in James’s multi-levelled incredulity at the suggestion that, as a married man, he has “pussy on tap”. When Luka is advised to abstain from his gargantuan appetite for masturbation, Lowden matches Freeman in comic disbelief – his eyes widen in horror at the proposal.The timing is impeccable throughout but as the tables are turned, and James’s behaviour is scrutinised, both give unsettling performances in a drama that specifically interrogates the role of a sponsor yet applies to multiple positions of authority and influence, including parenthood and priesthood. What appears at first to be a predictable plot twist, foreshadowed by a choice bit of dialogue from Raging Bull, swerves into something more psychologically interesting. The anonymous meeting-room set gives no place to hide as the pair, together on stage throughout, go toe to toe. If the violence that eventually erupts is undercharged, the notes of absurdity are perfectly measured and it ends not with a bang but whimsy.What power do you give another when you put your faith in them? What standards do you hold them to when you seek advice? When does care turn into control? As the questions proliferate and the pair argue over setting boundaries, Ireland continually blurs them in a play that regularly elicits winces. “Those that are crying will later be laughing,” paraphrases James from the Bible. The reverse is perhaps true for this troubling take on feeling lost and the thorny question of redemption.At@sohoplace, London, until 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndJack LowdenMartin FreemanDavid IrelandComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)reviewsShareReuse this content"

We’ve lost all connection to one another’: Astropical, the Latin supergroup healing our broken brainsLuke TaylorAfter his band Rawayana were driven out of Venezuela by their own president, Beto Montenegro joined with Li Saumet of Bomba Estéreo to make music that battles political strife with pure joyTue 20 May 2025 06.46 EDTShareThe coming together of two of Latin America’s most successful and inventive pop acts might seem like a market-savvy partnership dreamed up by their record labels, but for Li Saumet, frontwoman of Colombia’s Bomba Estéreo, it’s a cosmic calling.“One day I received a message from the universe: it’s time to make a song with Rawayana,” she says, sitting next to Beto Montenegro, frontman with that Venezuelan band and now Saumet’s partner in the supergroup Astropical. In a Bogotá hotel ahead of a performance at Estéreo Picnic festival, the duo regularly finish each other’s sentences, and Saumet rests her head on Montenegro’s shoulder with the ease of a sibling. On Astropical’s self-titled debut album, Saumet’s vibrant calls to dance and appreciate natural beauty bounce harmoniously off Montenegro’s softer vocals.But there is a pointed reason for their playful, joyful music. The duo feel people are increasingly disconnected from each other in a world of constant grim headlines – not least in Montenegro’s Venezuela. Accepting a Grammy last year for best Latin rock or alternative album, Montenegro celebrated the resilience of Venezuelans mired in humanitarian crisis. But presidentNicolás Madurohas attacked their song Veneka, claiming it denigrates Venezuelan women.View image in fullscreenRawayana accepting the group’s Grammy award in 2024.Photograph: Rich Polk/Billboard/Getty Images“Why the fuck is the president talking about me because I won a Grammy?” he says, still visibly perplexed from behind his rectangular green sunglasses. He now lives in Puerto Rico: “I don’t feel safe going back [to Venezuela]”. He remembers how during the recording of Astropical’s album Saumet turned to him and said, “‘The world needs this’. And that was the mindset: to make people feel good and remind them the world is not only this crazy place we’re seeing.”Bomba Estéreo came to attention in 2008 with a trippy electro-cumbia sound and have since evolved into pop giants, earning Latin Grammy nominations, collaborations with artists including Bad Bunny, and billions of streams. Rawayana’s reggae-infused music surfed along Venezuela’s musical underground for almost two decades, but they emphatically crossed over with their Grammy-winning album ¿Quién Trae las Cornetas?The pair met last year when Saumet tracked down Montenegro’s number and sent the Rawayana frontman a demo. “We made a song before we’d ever properly met, and then three songs came out in the studio in a couple of days,” Montenegro says. “It was fun, so natural.”They kept recording, building an album where each track is inspired by a zodiac sign, a reflection of Saumet’s interest in all things cosmic. Today, the singer’s matching red-and-white mushroom earrings and handbag seem to evoke mind-altering substances, and her mystical vibe was obvious the moment Montenegro arrived at the studio to find tarot cards, incense and flowers scattered around. “Beto is used to recording with four guys in this macho environment,” Saumet says, mocking him by thrusting her arms like a T-rex and making macho grunts. “I think he was a little bit shocked.”Colombia and Venezuela share food, musical rhythms and languages, with Saumet’s Caribbean accent sometimes mistaken for a Venezuelan accent. The pair have been fiercely debating what comes from which side of the border and consensus is yet to be reached on the provenance of thearepa, the region’s much beloved corn bread. “We are brothers,” Montenegro says of the two countries, laughing. “Brothers that fight, but still brothers.” Charged up by this good-natured friction, the resulting music is an energetic mix that jumps from champeta to Afrobeat and dancehall, occasionally pierced by the iconic sound of the gaita flute.This feelgood music aims to counter growing digital alienation. Saumet cites recently seeing a young girl in an airport at 6am, scrolling rapidly through TikTok videos at full volume as everyone around her was equally lost in their own screen. “Sometimes it feels like we’re all zombies and we’ve lost all connection to one another,” she says. “We used to be at one with nature and together as humans. We woke up together, ate meals together, went to the river or the sea together. Now you go out for dinner and someone interrupts you with their phone. Everyone is thinking about likes. Who cares? The world gives us so many things that don’t help your brain.”Venezuela has spiralled into economic and political collapse since 2010, and triggering one of the largest mass migrations in recent history. Rawayana’s satirical lyrics have poked fun at Venezuela’s political circus, and their song Veneka took a xenophobic slur frequently used to describe the 8 million Venezuelans who’ve fled poverty and violence in the last decade and turned it into a term of pride and identity. That nuance was seemingly lost on Nicolás Maduro, and after the president’s public condemnation of the song – possibly also precipitated by Montenegro and other Venezuelan musiciansaccusing him of electoral fraud– the band cancelled a tour for fear they would be persecuted by a government that regularly throws its critics behind bars.Bomba Estéreo also have a political bent to their music: they have urged protection of the Amazon rainforest, and Saumet has directly criticised Álvaro Uribe, Colombia’s ex-president who has been charged with bribery and witness tampering (which he denies). But Astropical’s album avoids direct political messaging. In fact, Saumet and Montenegro seem exhausted by it.“Those in power in Venezuela have been there for 25 years. I don’t think they should be there – but my music hasn’t changed that and I’m tired of associating my name with theirs,” Montenegro says. “They are not interesting people and I only want to engage with interesting things.”“I think we can make change another way, touching souls, healing the damage caused by this political theatre,” Saumet says.View image in fullscreen‘I think we can make change another way: touching souls’ … Astropical.Photograph: Maria Jose GoveaDespite Venezuela’s economic collapse artists continue to break through, with some such as Danny Ocean, Elena Rose and Yorghaki performing at Bogotá’s Estéreo Picnic. But Montenegro worries the next generation could be dragged into dangerous political debates that could land them or their families in jail. “It’s been very difficult for us to get where we are,” he says. “And these artists won’t change Venezuelan politics. Talking about it will just get them in trouble.” Addressing the media, he says: “Just let them be.”“Rawayana made this fantastic song [Veneka] and all the press wants to ask about is the president,” Saumet adds. “I know how it is: you feel used, it feels bad as an artist.”Jaded by protest music, Astropical are taking a different tack. “Right now it’s about giving love and receiving love,” Saumet says. “The world is actually a beautiful place. It depends on how you decide to see it. So we decided to see the world this way – and share it. The message is: you are not alone. We can be together in the world, to dance, kiss, laugh together!”The album Astropical is out now.

We click on all levels and he adores me, but he has some complicated circumstances, whichmeans we have no sex life. He has anxiety and takes SSRIs, which reduce his libido. He also takes blood thinners for a coronary issue, which I know precludes the use of erectile dysfunction products.

He kisses me to show his interest and attraction but not in a heavy making-out way.I am a very sensual person. My former partner and I had the best sex I’ve ever had in my life – however, he could be very distant at times and had poor emotional intelligence and communication with me (unlike my current partner).I have never had this issue with anyone else, so although I understand his vulnerability, I’m unsure what else to do other than wait.For now, I am willing to be patient. I have never had this issue with anyone else so although I understand his vulnerability, I’m unsure other than my plan to wait.You are smart and empathic, and you are correct about the need to be patient and allow the circumstances and reasons to unfold. Not everyone would be so patient and understanding. At present, you seem to be balancing what your needs are against his, but it will be important to make sure his very specific requirements do not become all-consuming. Think about your caregiving qualities and consider whether they are healthy or not; if there is a compulsive aspect to them you may want to pull back. People who overgive – especially when they do it compulsively – often become burnt out, and end up being undervalued. And the recipients of overgiving can fall into a state of learned helplessness, which is not a healthy situation for either partner.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

This little Baltic island (pronounced Air-rue) in Denmark’s South Funen archipelago is home to some 6,000 fortunate residents who enjoy free bus services, shallow swimming beaches and picture-perfect villages. The 54 sq mile island has a history of building sailing ships and there is an excellent maritime museum, so it seemed appropriate to arrive on a historic wooden sailing boat, Peggy, aBristol pilot cutterbuilt in 1903.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“We’re going to Ærø without a plane,” quipped one crew member as we set the sails on leaving the German Baltic port of Kiel. Our overland journey from the UK had started with a 12-hour train trip from London to Cuxhaven, a German port on the North Sea; a short taxi ride to Cuxhaven marina; an overnight stay on Peggy in the marina; and then a two-day transit of the Kiel canal, the busiest in the world by number of vessels, with some 35,000 ships transiting annually.Aero sailing trip mapSails furled, Peggy puttered along at about six miles an hour with 150 metre-long container ships overtaking and looming toward us. The 61-mile (99km) canal, which saves some 500 miles on the route between Germany’s North Sea and the Baltic ports, was opened in 1895 when it was called the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Kanal. The Germans now know it as the Nord-Ostsee-Kanal but internationally it is called the Kiel canal after the Baltic port where construction began. Kaiser Wilhelm II introduced a tax on sparkling wine to help fund its operation.In the morning, we swam in the river, edged with waterlilies, before continuing to KielThe canal is mostly delightfully rural, edged by reeds. Beyond the banks and canalside cycle paths, a backdrop of trees bordered the waterway on both sides. An overnight stop at a junction with the River Eider navigation, on the Gieselau canal, was even more bucolic. Starlings flew in to roost and perform their evening murmurations, shape-shifting from sailing boat to love heart. The sun set behind trees while we ate dinner on deck. In the morning, we swam in the river, edged with waterlilies, before continuing to Kiel, the canal becoming less rural as we neared its eastern terminus.View image in fullscreenPaul Miles enjoying the sunshine on board Peggy.Photograph: Paul MilesThe next day, we sailed away from our overnight anchorage in Kiel Fjord, with the pale cream sails full of wind, Peggy looking resplendent in the afternoon sun. Only the captains, Peggy’s owners John Potter and Rachel Haynes, really knew what they were doing. The rest of us, their four willing crew, pulled ropes when asked or made cups of tea or gripped the tiller tightly. We kept course by heading for a landmark or following the compass or the route on a digital chart. Peggy may be old but she has modern navigation systems.The waves sloshed and slapped against the hull, the sails and boom creaked, and we sped along at seven knots. Sun lit our way though grumpy clouds loomed in the distance. Sailing is to balance on the knife-edge of the weather, harnessing the wind that, with one wrong push of the tiller, could swing the heavy boom and spell disaster. Skies to which you pay scant attention on land except perhaps to wonder “should we take a brolly?” seem full of weight out at sea. That dark bruise of cloud ahead might be rife with squalls. But the weather gods were kind, the wind a constant south-westerly blowing us on our way. There were plenty of sailing boats out in the fjord leaning into the 25 knots of wind but once we were on our way on the 37-mile crossing, we only saw a few other vessels, one of which was similarly from the history books with russet sails and a mizzen mast.That dark bruise of cloud ahead might be rife with squalls. But the weather gods were kindThree hours later, Ærø island appeared on the horizon, seemingly edged with tall sandy beaches. Closer to, it became clear that these were actually fields ripe for harvest. Six hours after leaving Kiel, the passage into the harbour at Marstal was marked with red and green buoys distinctively topped with supersize bottle brushes. They looked jolly and festive, and already Ærø felt special. We tied up in the harbour next to a seafood restaurant.Our waiter was a young man with a fish tattooed on the inside of his forearm. “It’s a trout,” he said. “It’s a reminder of the day my dad and I went fishing and I caught five but he only caught one.” The friendly staff and meal of lobster bisque, plaice and prawns, along with a rite-of-passage story, seemed a fitting celebration of our arrival by sailing boat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The maritime museum spreads across several historic buildings nearby. There are rooms full of model boats and photographs and paintings of tall ships that were built here. For children there are ship playgrounds, including one where the captain’s bridge appears to heave in a stormy sea. Another room is an art gallery of oil paintings by 19th-century naval artist JEC Rasmussen who was born in Ærø, depicting both the joys and horrors of life at sea: sailors caught in a tempest, taking an axe to their broken mast to stop things getting worse.We boarded the free community bus to the village of Ærøskøbing where, in the pedestrianised centre there are cosy, colourful centuries-old houses. Mullioned windows display wooden boats and porcelain dogs while hollyhocks grow between cobbles outside decoratively carved doors. We visited the whisky distillery and its courtyard cafe before heading for a swim at Vesterstrand beach where a jetty led out over eelgrass to a sand-bottomed, clear sea watched over by two dozen beach cabins of all shapes and colours. People arrived on bicycles for their daily swim.In the maritime museum, a volunteer, Lotte, had told us that many islanders, like her, are retirees. As well as swimming and sailing, “singing in choirs is a popular pastime”, she said.

Fleece-lined wellies offer the best of both worlds. We always go for ones with a removable fleece liner, because by the time it’s warm enough to ditch the fleece, the kids have inevitably gone up a shoe size. No liner means more room. There are loads of colour options too, so they can pick whatever they like. And I couldn’t live without Regatta’s waterproof puddle suits.

The kids love it, their friends think it’s cool, and we, the parents, stay fit by cycling every day instead of driving. We live in central London and originally got the bike for school drop-offs, but it’s been such a hit that we now use it for weekend adventures too, sometimes cycling up to 20 miles. Ours isn’t electric – it has a heavy steel frame and only three gears – but that means it gives us a great workout every time we ride it.KatjaRunner/bike trailerView image in fullscreenCroozer Yuuna trailer£1,295 at Pets Own UsView image in fullscreenHamax Traveller trailer£499 at Decathlon£499 at HalfordsWe swear by our Croozer trailer.

It has been difficult to let go of that, but our Osprey Poco Plus carrier has been a bit of a lifeline. My exercise is largely on my two-year-old son’s terms these days, so anything that allows me to combine a bit of cardio and some quality time together is a winner. With this on my back, a brisk walk turns into a full workout – they call it “rucking” in the military – and he loves soaking up the views. I’m still discovering various useful pockets and pouches every time we use it: the hip pockets, for example, are great for storing an emergency dummy and handkerchief. It even has an integrated sun/rain cover and a mirror so I can make sure he’s not doing a danger nap!PaddyRunning buggyView image in fullscreenThule Urban Glide 3£675 at Blacks£749.99 at John LewisAs the parent of a six-month-old embarking on another marathon block, a running buggy was a must for me. Our Thule Urban Glide 3 was a life-saver. It’s sleek, shock-absorbing and engineered to handle everything from park paths to potholes.

It helps make longer walks feel like a bit more of an adventure, and it warms them up if the weather is cold, too. We bring a big Chilly’s bottle for hot chocolate, but if you pack light, the stove could do that job too. Being able to say, “When we get to the woods/next bench/top of the hill, we’ll stop for lunch/hot chocolate” is an excellent motivator.JennyUniriderView image in fullscreenMountain Buggy Unirider£49.99 at Baby Planet£59.99 at Samuel JohnstonNow our son is two, he doesn’t like to be in the carrier when we’re out on walks; he’d much rather be independent. Our Unirider gives him the flexibility to get on and off at will. And not lugging him around in the carrier has done wonders for our backs! We tried it on the beach at first so he would have a soft landing, as it takes a bit of getting used to. But once he got the hang of it, there was no stopping him. We use it for long walks on all sorts of terrain, and it rolls over rocks and bumps with no bother.LoisChanging matView image in fullscreenOsprey Poco changing pad£45 at OspreyFrom £29.82 at AmazonMost mats are a bit too flimsy for nappy changes in the great outdoors.

(In a similar vein, if your pie or tart involves mushrooms, take your lead fromFeast columnist Georgina Hayden, who uses butter flavoured with thyme and Marmite.)But back to Kellett’s pie. “Wilt the greens, squeeze out any moisture, then fold in crumbled feta, a couple of eggs and season really well.” You could also throw in some caramelised onions. “Put a couple of layers of filo painted with hot honey butter in an ovenproof dish [greased with more honey butter], add a third of the filling, then repeat with more filo and filling.”Finish with more filo, then sprinkle over a crisp, seedy topper (think everything bagel mix, or a mix of nigella, sesame and fennel seeds). “Bake until golden brown, crisp and bubbling up at the edges,” Kellett says, and that’s going to be a lot easier in the making and eating than a quiche: “For a picnic lunch, a filo pie is easily top of the list.” And, for something alongside, try tabbouleh studded with lots of fresh dill, parsley and coriander or, once summer proper hits, a tomato, pickled shallot and herb salad.If you have plenty of herbs to hand, meanwhile, plump for thisgoat’s cheese, artichoke and hazelnut numberby the Guardian’s Rukmini Iyer – one of her “favourite recipes for the column so far”. Blitz 30g flat-leaf parsley (stems and all), 20g mint, 20g basil, 15g chives and 50g chopped hazelnuts until smooth, then pour into a round pie dish lined with filo sheets that you’ve brushed with the oil from a jar of artichokes. Top with the artichokes themselves and teaspoonfuls of soft goat’s cheese dotted around and about, then scatter with more chopped hazelnuts and bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 25 minutes.For other cheesy greens, give peas a go: “Minted garden peas with grated lemon zest, whipped or baked ricotta, lots of herbs and spring onions is a really nice spring combo,” Kellett says, especially if you char the spring onions over an open flame first. “They’ll be silky, soft and sweet, and you can squidge them into the tart.”Chantelle Nicholson, who is behindBaked by Cordia, a microbakery and garden cafe in West Sussex, would also go for peas, paired with ricotta and mint, but she’d crush them, alongside some broad beans, too, “for texture” and throw in some onion seeds. Finally, there’s asparagus, and here Nicholson would be minded to combine the spears with parsley or dill in a bechamel base, and perhaps some caramelised onions, too, because, well, “You can’t ever really go wrong with those”.Got a culinary dilemma?

As soon as I entered, the shopkeeper informed me that parking was not allowed in that area.I immediately returned to my vehicle and left. The total duration of my stop, according to theparking charge notices (PCNs) I received the following week from Euro Parking Services (EPS), was justtwo minutes and 24 seconds.I appealed against the fine that day via email and received an automatic acknowledgment. However, I heard nothing more from the company.Then, at the start of April, I received a reminder stating that the fine had increased to £100. The letter included a paragraph stating my appeal had been rejected, although I had not been informed of the decision.In response, I submitted a second appeal. I am willing to pay the original £60 charge if my appeal is formally rejected, but I strongly object to being charged more when it failed to communicate the result.More fundamentally, I believe no one should be fined for stopping for just overtwo minutes. It feels deeply unjust and contrary to common sense.AA,BirminghamWith parking companies sending out41,000 parking charge notices (PCNs) in Britain every day, we could devote this column to thescourgeof excessive charges. I was intrigued, however, to see someone penalised for a stay of under five minutes.It turns out that the small parking area you used is reserved for the customers of the adjacent clothing store. The landowner hired EPS to manage it due to concerns motorists were using it while visiting other businesses.The signage states that the spaces are for customers of that store only, and your registration must be entered in a kiosk inside it to validate the stay. The site does have a five-minute “consideration period” (the window motorists have to decide whether to park at a location) but once you have parked and left your car, that ends.After I got in touch, EPS offered you another fortnight to settle the charge at £60, as you did not receive the appeal rejection (although a search of its system indicated it was emailed). This is what you wanted, and you have paid up. Had you wished to take it further, there is always the Independent Appeals Service.This is my final column, but I will still be writing about consumer affairs, so get in touch in the usual wayWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Piccolli’s appointment suggests a shift away from this approach at the respected fashion house, which was founded by Cristóbal Balenciaga in 1919.‘They have caused chaos, gone viral and created a sellout buzz’: the rise and fall of fashion house BalenciagaRead moreAt his previous role at Valentino– which he held from 2008 to 2024 – Piciolli was known for soft, feminine and elegant designs.Both Balenciaga and Gucci are owned by one of the world’s largest luxury conglomerates, Kering, which also owns Yves Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Alexander McQueen.In a statement, newly appointed Balenciaga CEO Gianfranco Gianangeli said: “I’m excited to begin this new era at Balenciaga with Pierpaolo. His creative vision will thrive, and he will perfectly interpret the legacy of Cristóbal Balenciaga, building on the House’s bold creativity, rich heritage and strong culture.”Piccioli said the role, “gives me the chance to shape a new version of the Maison, adding another chapter with a new story”. His first collection for Balenciaga will debut in October 2025.The change is one of many across the fashion industry in recent months. At rival conglomerate LVMH, longtimeLoewe designer JW Andersonmoved to a menswear role at Dior in April.In January, Louise Trotter took the helm at Kering-owned Bottega Veneta, after Matthieu Blazy left the position for an artistic director role at Chanel.In the past year, there have also been new appointments at Dries van Noten, Tom Ford, Givenchy and Calvin Klein.The shake-up occurs against a downturn in the luxury goods industry. In 2024, Kering’s revenue fell by 12% while rival LVMH recorded a 1% annual dip.Under Demna,Balenciaga never failed to generate headlines, but not all were positive. In 2023, the brand was forced to issue an apology after a campaign that featuredteddy bears dressed in bondage-style leather harnesses, a controversy from which some analysts believe the brand never fully recovered.Nevertheless, Demna’s move to Gucci – a brand four times the size – was a promotion for the designer.In a statement, Francesca Bellettini, Kering deputy CEO thanked Demna for “the bold, distinctive vision he brought to Balenciaga over the past ten years”.“I am convinced that Pierpaolo and Gianfranco will lead Balenciaga perfectly through this important new chapter of its remarkable history,” she said.This article was amended on 20 May 2025 to correct the spelling of Demna’s name. Also, Balenciaga is a Spanish fashion house, not French as stated in an earlier version.Explore more on these topicsBalenciaganewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not surprising given the cost of getting married today ...Tue 20 May 2025 10.03 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 12.48 EDTShareName:Wedding listsAge:Invented in Chicago 101 years ago.Appearance:Increasingly bleak.You’re right, I also resent being told what to buy people for their wedding.Exactly – especially when what they’re asking for is toilet paper.Pardon?No, honestly, this is a thing now.Tescodoes it.But wedding lists should be to help couples build their first homes together.Oh please, that doesn’t happen any more. Say your best friend announced that they were getting married to someone who they didn’t already live with. How would you react?I’d try to talk them out of it.Exactly. Everyone who gets married these days already shares a home, so the last thing they need is a duvet set or crockery.But they’ll always need toilet paper.Well, and other stuff. The thinking behind the Tesco wedding list is that it’s much more practical to help a newly married couple out with their weekly shop. The supermarket’s research found that two in five newlywed or engaged couples preferred practical gifts, rather than extravagant gifts. And to be fair, there are layers to the service.Layers?Sure. If you’re feeling flush, you could buy the couple Tesco’s “A toast to love” package, which is basically just a load of champagne. The cheapest option costs £39, and contains six packets of biscuits and some tea.And then the toilet paper one?That costs £63, and contains five packets of toilet paper, eight kitchen rolls, two tubes of toothpaste, bin bags, shampoo, conditioner, hand wash and shower gel.I can’t work out how depressed I should be about this.Oh, all the way depressed. As much as Tesco is making out that it’s helpful to be practical, it’s also a result of the wedding industry growing so wildly out of hand that a wedding is all but impossible to afford. In 2022,one survey found that the average newlyweds find themselves with a wedding debt of almost £4,000.Just for one day.Yes, it’s ridiculous. On the other hand, think of all the biscuits.Is this going to be cyclical?What, you’re asking if the practical wedding list is a weird time-sensitive blip, like when wartime couples used to hide their austere little wedding cakes inside great big ornamental cardboard cakes?Yes.God, no. The way things are going, 50 years from now people will be burning with jealousy that newlyweds even got bin bags from their guests.Well, this is cheery.Oh, chin up. A wedding can still be the happiest day of someone’s life. Especially if that person really has a thing for toothpaste.Do say:“Darling, let’s get married.”Don’t say:“Because we’re running low on bog roll.”Explore more on these topicsWeddingsPass notesMarriageShoppingSupermarketsTescofeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the Garden of the Future, designed by Matthew Butler and Josh Parker, features a lavatory that creates a biochar compost perfect for growing vegetables.“It converts the solids into a biochar and then the liquids into a water that is safe to use on the ornamental planting,” Butler said. Brandishing a small pot of the substance, he added: “That’s from the toilet. So it’s like a light friable soil. There’s a little drawer next to the toilet, you pull it out, and the contents can be used on the garden to help improve the crops.”His garden also prominently features a ground-mounted solar panel, which powers an irrigation pump. This year has been very hot and sunny, with areas of the UK experiencing earlystages of drought, making irrigation especially important. In response to weather extremes brought on by climate breakdown, the garden features drought-friendly crops that can be grown in home vegetable patches.View image in fullscreenA visitor poses with a rose garden made by Peter Beales Roses at the Chelsea flower show on Monday.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPA“Our chickpeas have been growing well,” Butler said. “We both grow them at home ourselves too, and sweet potatoes, which are becoming a more common crop in the UK; farmers [are] growing sweet potatoes in lots of parts of the south.”Lucy Hutchings of She Grows Veg , who is exhibiting her perfect vegetables in the Great Pavilion at the show, has also been experimenting with drought-friendly crops.“We are based in East Anglia, and it basically hasn’t rained in a month and a half,” she said. “Leafy greens tend to bolt in these conditions, and some have, so we are experimenting with drought-friendly varieties like amaranth.”The drought isn’t all bad news though; while they can still be irrigated, it will be a brilliant year for tomatoes, Hutchings said.“We’re having to make sure that we water them, obviously, but they’ll ripen quicker,” she said. “It’s going to be a fantastic season for tomatoes, and that little bit of drought actually really intensifies the flavour.”Frisbees and tennis balls are not usually a feature of the genteel event but Monty Don of BBC Gardeners’ World brought both to his dog-friendly garden.View image in fullscreenMonty Don with his dog, Ned.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersNed, the golden retriever, chased his toys around Don’s creation, which features a special “robust lawn” made for canine companions, flowers that are non-toxic to pets, and a pond for dogs to splash around. The BBC Radio 2 presenter Jo Whiley also brought her dog, which played on the lawn with Ned.Gesturing to the lawn, Don said: “You can see it’s looking quite trashed already. What it’ll be like for the end of the week, I don’t know, but it’s a real lawn, and it’s for dogs to play in.”Ned also helped him design the garden by creating pathways through the flower borders, Don revealed: “If you look closely in the border, there are paths where the dog has weaved through.” He said a fox had already enjoyed these crumpled spaces, sleeping among the poppies on Sunday night.Queen Camilla, a dog-lover, was due to visit Don’s garden along with her new terrier, Moley, which was adopted from BatterseaDogs& Cats Home, where the garden will be relocated after the show.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The garden is designed to welcome and support songbirds, which are indrastic decline in the UK.The garden is full of plants that produce berries for birds to eat, including blackcurrant and alpine strawberries, as well as pollinator-friendly flowers that attract insects, which are prey for birds.“We also planted thick yew hedges, which are perfect for them to nest in,” Morgan added.She hasn’t seen any songbirds using the garden yet, but there is evidence they have already been enjoying it. “It’s a bit busy here during the day, but there has been bird poo on the plants – we think they come at night. There’s a blackbird on site we are hoping to attract when it’s a bit quieter,” she added.Celebrities enjoying the gardens on the show’s press day, which takes places the day before it opens to the public, included Cate Blanchett, Carol Vorderman, David Tennant and Judi Dench.The RHSChelsea flower showis on from 20 to 24 May in the Royal Hospital gardens.Explore more on these topicsChelsea flower showGardensDogsPlantsCompostLondonDroughtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, this can also be caused by stress factors, such as temperature fluctuations or inconsistent watering. Some reddening is normal, but excessive redness accompanied by leaf drop indicates the plant is unhappy.​Houseplant clinic: why has my maidenhair fern shrivelled?Read morePrescriptionConsider moving your plant to a spot with indirect bright light. Water weekly; add enough to see the water escape through the pot’s drainage holes and allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Avoid sudden temperature changes and draughts.​PreventionBe aware of seasonal sunlight changes; you might need to move your plant in summer. Maintain a consistent care routine during the growing period so the plant doesn’t dry out. Provide stable temperatures, don’t overwater, and ensure adequate light without prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. Inspect regularly for signs of stress.Got a plant dilemma?

Now, in the face of cyber-attacks, climate breakdown and nuclear threats, the UK government recommends it. Should everyone have a survival kit?Zoe WilliamsTue 20 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 06.10 EDTShareThis is a great time to be a shopkeeper, if that shop is for those worried about the breakdown of civilisation. “It started with Covid, and people weren’t looking for toilet rolls, put it that way,” says Justin Jones, who runs the onlineUK Prepping Shop, whose stock ranges from emergency food and wind-up radios to crossbows and body armour.Business is booming, as is the British prepping scene – 22,700 members of theUK Preppers and SurvivalistsFacebook group, 6,000 in theUK Preppers ClubFacebook group. The scene is not as well-known as its US and Canadian equivalents, but that’s partly by choice. “Preppers are by nature a little bit secretive,” says Bushra Shehzad, who is researching prepping for a PhD in marketing and consumer behaviour at Newcastle University. “They are sceptical of people who aren’t part of it asking questions, which I think is because they’re portrayed in a manner that many of them don’t agree with.”There are other differences from the North American scene, which you’ll pick up immediately when you watch Canadian Prepper’s100 Things to Prepare for What’s Comingvideo on YouTube (“You’re probably a prepper if you do the following things …”). In the UK, private ownership of firearms is uncommon and highly restricted, so that cuts out a huge amount of what a US or Canadian prepper would think of as core activity – owning guns, cleaning them, learning how to use them, burying them in an outdoor cache. Plus, “We don’t really have space to go off-grid in the UK,” says Leon (his name has been changed), who runs another prepping supply website. “So nobody is going to have a bug-out [secondary location or grab/go bag] fully stocked, to rendezvous with their loved ones.”View image in fullscreen‘They’re not cosplaying preparedness.’Photograph: skodonnell/Getty ImagesAnd yet the same geopolitical weather is hitting us all, and there are common themes haunting people and spiking sales of prepper products.During Covid, it was “freeze-dried food, and a lot of people started looking into things a bit deeper,” Jones says. “I’ve had retired GPs buying off me; I’ve got vets buying off me. It’s completely opened up – it’s not the old Rambo nuts.”When Russia invaded Ukraine, Jones continues, “we sold out like mad on gas masks, nuclear protection stuff, potassium tablets. We did a month’s trade in a day and a half. It’s all military-grade – we don’t sell the stuff that’s 30 years old.” They’re not cosplaying preparedness, in other words.Shehzad cautions respect around survivalism – preppers are not hysterical, they’re very informed, she says. Or maybe the second leads to the first. “They have a range of worries – geopolitical, economic, climate. International politics, also. They’re very well-read, much more interested in what’s happening around them than others.”View image in fullscreenNot just a wind-up … time to tune in.Photograph: Pat  Tuson/AlamyWhen the blackouts hit Spain and Portugal, “we have these wind-up dynamo solar-powered radios”, Jones says. “I usually sell about 10 a week; I sold 40 in one day – that was my entire stock.”Freeze-dried food is also flying off the shelves. “I think a lot of people are on edge about cyber-attacks,” Jones continues. “My local Co-op is empty – there’s hardly anything.”Ana, 40, took the fundamentals of preparedness as basic common sense. Originally from eastern Europe, now living with her husband and four-year-old daughter in Wales, she always grew her own food, and knew how to preserve and prepare it. “What made me increase prepping was Covid – I was heavily pregnant, by myself in the hospital, I had an emergency caesarean section, I couldn’t breastfeed my baby. My pantry was always prepared, but people were buying baby formula to put in their tea, until stocks were so low it was going for £300 on eBay.”But if her contingency planning is sharper, it’s still hedging against a pause in supply chains rather than the end of civilisation. “I can’t suddenly run away into the forest like all the macho guys do on YouTube. It’s really funny – they all have families and wives that they’re not talking about.”View image in fullscreenFirst, catch your dinner … a crossbow hunter.Photograph: Daniel Strunz/AlamyTen years ago, this was a very different scene. Lincoln Miles had just opened the UK’s first prepper shop in Bedfordshire, and I went to seewho was buying what. There were young men hunting small game buying wire saws that would “bring down trees, go through bones”, according to the packaging, but pretty small bones – of squirrels, pigeons, rabbits, shot with air rifles with the landowner’s permission. There was a family – two middle-aged parents, two teenage boys – who were pretty sweetly trying to harmonise the parents’ interests (living remotely, getting away from it all, self-sufficiency) with the kids’ (using a catapult, dressing up in camouflage).This is broadly what Jones meant by “Rambo nuts” – people who want nothing more complicated than to feel that they are equal to the elemental tasks of surviving: killing, skinning, cooking, eating, and I guess not getting thirsty. (There was a lot of water purification, even back then. You’re not doing this right, according to Canadian Prepper, unless you have at least two weeks’ worth of water, and at least three ways to filter and purify it.) You could say it had a top note of idealised masculinity, but you couldn’t call it toxic.The macho guys on YouTube running away into the forest ... they all have families that they’re not talking aboutYou could also just call it bushcraft. “A bushcrafter is sat inside and wishes they were outside,” says David, a bushcraft expert. “A prepper is outside and wishes they were inside. It’s an attitude difference.” David isn’t his real name: he has some pretty salty views on preppers, and doesn’t want them on his case. He recalls going to prepper sites during Covid. “You’ve never seen so many disappointed people,” he says. Because an emergency came along, and all they had to do was stay home.”“Long-term, food acquisition is going to be really important,” David says. “Whether that’s foraging or hunting. But it’s a very, very skilled thing: unless you are really experienced, you’re never going to catch anything. You get preppers saying: ‘I’ve got a couple of snares so I’ll be fine.’ Ultimately, bushcraft boils down to a deep knowledge of the natural world. The preppers I’ve come across just aren’t prepared to put the time in – what they’ve focused on is buying stuff.”Prepping has always had political connotations, but going back way further than a decade, I remember when those people were left wing: people such as my mum, jittery about the Cuban missile crisis, hoarding condensed milk, though never burying it, and having a plan for the nuclear holocaust that was slightly more advanced than the government advice, which was to take a door off its hinges and lean it against your dining table. The underlying politics were that all authority was ultimately authoritarian – that is, careless of the human beings within it, who, if they were smart, would at least have the makings of a cheesecake when The Man made his ultimate error.View image in fullscreenBeyond muesli … a pouch of freeze-dried food.Photograph: Ga_Na/AlamyThe thinking outlived the imminent nuclear threat of the 80s. When the Iraq war began in 2003, my mum started to hoard water, and she still had a bunch hoarded from Y2K. She said she’d use just that for washing.Now, unmistakably, if prepping has a politics at all, it’s on the spectrum from individualist-right to fundamentalist-libertarian (though Shehzad, again, counsels against generalisation: “I’m finding it very difficult to categorise them into anything. They come from different socioeconomic backgrounds, different levels of education: I cannot label them”).Readers reply: If you were prepping, what would your top five items be?Read moreThere’s certainly anAyn Randianpassion for self-sufficiency in the language. “You’re as physically fit as you can possibly be. You’ve run flat out for a hundred yards in the past week. You’ve killed organisms and ate them.” Once you let the Canadian Prepper’s voice into your head, he is strangely convincing. But it doesn’t map neatly on to the community, whose preoccupations tilt way more towards the end of civilisation than their own wellness. “There are some frankly Walter Mitty characters out there,” David says. “I was teaching a little bit on firelighting, which is a lot easier from a crouched position. This guy couldn’t get on to his knees. I’m not one to body shame anybody, but if you’re preparing for an apocalypse, you have to be able to kneel.”The UK government launched a prepping campaign last year, prepare.campaign.gov.uk, that wasn’t miles short of what many survivalists talk about on FacebookBut what’s harder to determine, and what makes preppers feel denigrated and non-preppers, indeed, casually denigrate them, is whether they are hugely more sensible than the rest of us, or a lot less. Plainly, they aren’t imagining things. Parliament produceda chilling timeline of Russian nuclear rhetoricbetween February 2022 and November 2024 – a list of every time a Russian senior official had plausibly signalled a desire to nuke something. If we’d all engaged with it properly, the UK would also have run out ofpotassium iodide, as Norway did soon after the Russian invasion. The UK government launched a prepping campaign last year,prepare.campaign.gov.uk, that wasn’t miles short of what many survivalists talk about on Facebook – supplies for a few days, a “grab bag” (AKA bug-out or go-bag), medication for several days. And no one really noticed, except people who were already prepping. That’s before you consider climate disasters, which none of us can say we weren’t warned about.View image in fullscreenFire it up … time for some alfresco cookery.Photograph: David Forster/AlamySo that’s column A: preppers, smarter than you, actually. In column B, a lot of the advice sounds straight out ofThe Walking Dead. “You know the people in your community that are going to be a problem, if and when the rule of law is no longer in force.” (I’m back with the Canadian Prepper.) “You have a backup power generator. You have a map of places you can scavenge after the apocalypse. You frequently find yourself looking at your co-workers thinking: ‘I wonder how long they would survive?’”“It’s not exactly that life imitates art,” says Clare Birchall, professor of contemporary culture at King’s College London, “but that there’s a certain recursive relationship between media and life. Dystopian tropes and aesthetics have long infiltrated reality. Many of those preparing for the apocalypse also believe they are in an existential battle with evil forces. Zombies are only partly metaphorical.”Before Covid, nonfictional depictions of preppers portrayed them as “a curiosity at best, a deranged group of weirdos at worst”, according to Ed González-Tennant, digital archaeologist at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. “After Covid, and amid renewed fears of supply chain interruptions in 2025, prepping continues to become more acceptable, or at least less strange.”One consequence of which is that, in fictional renderings, a new dichotomy has arisen: no longer weirdo v realist, now antisocial v pro-social. “Preppers such as Nick Offerman’s Bill in The Last of Usare initially represented as hostile to the ‘normies’ who didn’t see the end approaching.” If you haven’t seen it, this is one of the most perfect self-contained episodes – an incredibly cultured prepper who prepped as a lone wolf, but only found meaning in his weapons cache through love. “I particularly like that story arc,” González-Tennant says, “because it reminds folks that prepping isn’t supposed to be about out-surviving others, but building a better world. I think a lot of folks, especially preppers, get lost in weird fantasies about ‘protecting’ others that are really about controlling others.”If our destiny is cyber-attacks and empty shelves at the Co-op, here’s what we should do next | Hugh MuirRead more“I don’t like selling on fear,” Leon says. “I’d rather promote an active outdoors life.” And the industry can tolerate that kind of ambiguity. “You can use a rucksack to go camping or for your go-bag in case the zombies come.” Nonetheless, you can see the fear in the shopping lists – “When the Ukraine invasion started, it was wet food, dry food, people were buying crossbows faster than I’d like. Selling pointy things comes with responsibility; we take it really seriously.”Does he have a go-bag? “We definitely had a stash of food during Covid, but that was mostly in case we couldn’t go to the supermarket.” What about Jones? “I have a lot of stuff at home. Freeze-dried food, water, first aid gear, meals that are ready to eat, potassium iodide, gas masks. The usual survival gear, except I don’t have knives.” Canadian Prepper carries at least two knives, a multitool and a torch heavy enough to double as a weapon at all times.“You might meet a prepper who is all about the outdoors, crossbows, animal skinning,” Shezhad says, “and you might meet one who is more than happy having water stored in the pantry.”Once you start thinking about impending disaster, it must be hard to know when to stop.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleNatural disastersRetail industryHomesClimate crisisCybercrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromSally SimpsonandEdward RosenTue 20 May 2025 11.58 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 12.24 EDTShareThank you for Sheila Hale’s long read about her family experience of stroke (My husband and son suffered strokes, 30 years apart. Shockingly little had changed, 15 May). I remember reading her book as a junior doctor and despairing at the differences between the stroke and neurorehabilitation units that I worked on. This drove my career to stroke medicine, particularly rehabilitation.In 2021, without the technology to give thrombolysis beyond four and a half hours after a stroke, Sheila’s son was unfortunately one hour over time and the risks of severe brain bleeding outweighed the benefit.CT perfusion techniquesmean that this time constraint is reducing, and mechanical thrombectomy is becoming more individually based and more available.Sheila is right to highlight that delivering the intensity of rehabilitation required in theNHSis a huge challenge – the inpatient and community teams I work with continually change what they do to use what resources they have, but we are constantly told there is no more money.The attitudes of doctors reflected in Sheila’s article sadden me, as prognostication in early stages is difficult and younger brains show greater capacity for recovery and adaptation. There is, however, that delicate balance of hope, uncertainty and reality. Perhaps this article will spark a campaign for post-discharge neurorehabilitation gyms in every locality. The evidence supports it. A stroke is often not the end, but it is a difficult journey to a new type of life.Dr Jessica BeavanConsultant stroke physician, DerbySheila Hale highlights a tragic and unacceptable truth. For decades, rehabilitation has remained the poor cousin of surgery and medication in the NHS. Physiotherapy services are starved of the staff and equipment to deliver effective rehab. They are told to limit the number of times they can see a patient, and for how long. In effect, they are prevented from doing their jobs. The impact on patients is stark, as seen in this article. The impact is also harsh on physiotherapy staff themselves, who must explain this reality each day and go home every night feeling they have let their patients down.The NHS wouldn’t tell a surgeon to stop an operation halfway through. A pharmacist wouldn’t hand out 40% of a course of antibiotics. So why is it OK for patients to be denied a full course of rehabilitation?Sara HazzardAssistant director, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy; co-chair, the Community Rehabilitation AllianceSheila Hale mentions mechanical thrombectomy, a procedure to remove blood clots from the brain. This is available at 24 hospitals in the country, but can be done 24/7 at only six of them. So in York if you have a stroke that is suitable for this procedure, it is only available at the hospital in Hull Monday to Friday 8am to 4pm. I wrote to our local MP, Luke Charters, about this and he contacted the Department ofHealth, which said there were no plans to bring the service to the York and Scarborough Trust. Maybe when the NHS is sued for negligence in not providing this, things may change.Sally SimpsonYorkIt is true that many stroke patients feel abandoned by the NHS, as Sheila Hale states. But our work with patients at the Pulross Centre in Brixton, a rehabilitation unit that is part of St Thomas’ hospital in London, is reducing that. We deliver a weekly gardening session for patients, and when they are discharged, we gift them a plant to grow at home. If they don’t have a garden, we try to link them to a community garden or gardening group in a local healthcare setting.We introduced this during the pandemic when our gardens were closed and stroke patients were self-isolating; several felt alone and forgotten. We have used the gift of a plant or seeds as an expression of connectedness between all of us and to let our stroke patients know they are not abandoned by the NHS.Edward RosenLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The ASGSF has long been a vital resource for adoptive families, enabling access to specialist therapeutic support for children who have experienced early trauma, loss and disruption. I have worked with many such families under this scheme and seen the positive, often life-changing impact it can have.This year, however, the situation has been chaotic and distressing. The decision on ASGSF funding was left until very late in the financial planning cycle, leaving families and professionals in limbo. When the decision finally came, the funding had been cut by 40% – a severe blow.The result has been the cancellation or delay of therapy for vulnerable children, some of whom are in crisis. Families who have already taken on extraordinary challenges are now left without the support they were relying on. The therapeutic relationships that take time and trust to build are being disrupted or lost entirely.This is not simply a matter of money – it is about the wellbeing and stability of children who have already faced immense adversity. The ASGSF was created to ensure these families did not fall through the cracks. Undermining it sends a troubling message about the government’s priorities when it comes to some of the most vulnerable children in our society.Dr Leslie IronsideDirector,The Centre for Emotional Development, BrightonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

They live in a country where farms are taken, the land is taken, on a racial basis.”Trump has falsely asserted that white farmers in SouthAfricaare undergoing a “genocide” and deserving of special status. By contrast, he suspended the US’s refugee resettlement programme on his first day in office in January, in effect stranding 100,000 people previously approved for resettlement.Kaine asked why Afrikaners were more important than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, who have faced intense persecution in China and Myanmar respectively, and also cited the cases of political dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, as well as Afghans under the Taliban.“The problem we face there is the volume problem,” Rubio said. “If you look at all the persecuted people of the world, it’s millions of people. They can’t all come here.”Kaine called the claims of persecution against Afrikaner farmers “completely specious” and pointed to the existence of an Afrikaner minister in South Africa’s coalition government.He also contrasted the refugee designation of Afrikaners to the absence of such a programme for the country’s Black majority during the apartheid era.“There never has there been a special programme for Africans to come in as refugees to the United States,” Kaine said, pointing out that special designations were allowed for people being persecuted for religions reasons under communist regimes.Episcopal church says it won’t help resettle white South Africans granted refugee statusRead moreReferring to the US statutory standard of recognising a refugee claim as being a “well-justified fear of persecution”, Kaine asked: “Should that be applied in an even-handed way? For example, should we say if you’re persecuted on the grounds of your religion, we’ll let you in if you’re a Christian but not a Muslim?”Rubio replied thatUS foreign policydid not require even-handedness, adding: “The United States has a right to allow into this country and prioritise allowance of who they want to allow to come in. We’re going to prioritise people coming into our country on the basis of what’s in the interests of this country. That’s a small number of people that are coming.”Kaine responded: “So you have a different standard based on the color of somebody’s skin. Would that be acceptable?”Rubio replied: “You’re the one talking about the colour of their skin, not me.”Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen said he regretted confirming Rubio as secretary of state, after recalling that the two had spent more than a decade working together in Congress, and accusing him of “making a mockery” of the US asylum system.Van Hollen echoed Kaine, drawing attention to the decision to reject refugees from war-torn countries in Africa and Asia while granting asylum status to white Afrikaners, which Van Hollen said was turning the US’s refugee process into a system of “global apartheid”.2:15US senator says giving Afrikaners refugee status turns asylum system into global apartheid – video“You try to block the admission of people who have already been approved as refugees, while making bogus claims to justify such status to Afrikaners. You’ve made a mockery of our country’s refugee process turning it into a system of global apartheid,” Van Hollen said.More than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system that enshrined white minority rule, white South Africans typically own 20 times more wealth than their Black compatriots, according to an article in the Review of Black Economy.Unemployment among Black South Africans currently runs at 46.1%, compared to 9.2% for white South Africans.According to the 2022 census, white people account for 7% of South Africa’s population of 63 million, while Black people account for 81%.Faisal Ali contributed additional reportingExplore more on these topicsMarco RubioTim KaineSouth AfricaUS foreign policyAfricaRepublicansTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

She is taking the life-endangering step in protest at the continued detention of her son in Cairo beyond his five-year sentence.She has not eaten any food since 29 September 2024, the date her son’s prison sentence was due to end, and has been surviving only on herbal tea, black coffee and rehydration salts.At the start of March, amid signs that the UK government was doing more behind the scenes to secure her son’s release, she began a less stringent form of hunger strike, taking a daily 300-calorie liquid nutritional supplement, but on Tuesday she said she was stopping having the supplement after discussions with her family.She had started taking the supplement after being encouraged by a call that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, had made on 28 February to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in which he had lobbied for her son’s release.The Egyptian government refuses to recognise Abd el-Fattah’s British citizenship and does not provide the British embassy in Cairo with consular access. There were signs that the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, was speaking with Egyptian intelligence services, seen as closer to the decision-making centre inside the Egyptian government than the Foreign Office.Soueif said: “It seemed to everyone around me that it was only reasonable to allow a few weeks for a process that might lead to Alaa’s release without me incurring permanent damage to my health, or worse.”On the 149th day of her hunger strike in February, Soueif was taken to hospital with dangerously low blood sugar, blood pressure and sodium levels. During her week-long admission at St Thomas’ hospital in London she was given a glucose drip after her blood sugar level dropped to 1.5mmol/L.Soueif, a mathematics professor, has resumed her daily one-hour vigil outside Downing Street to press Starmer to make her son’s release a priority in Britain’s relations with Egypt.Explaining her decision to resume a full hunger strike, Soueif said: “I have never seen [the UK government] act as if the situation was urgent, except when I was hospitalised. For me and for my family the situation is urgent. We have used up more days than we ever thought we had. We need Alaa released now. We need Alaa with us now. We need Alaa reunited with his son Khaled now.”Soueif returned to London on Saturday after a visit to Egypt where she was able to visit her son on three occasions in Wadi el-Natrun prison. He is also on hunger strike, reaching his 81st day on Tuesday without consuming any calories.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ship, at 157ft tall (48m), was unable to fit under the clearance of theBrooklynBridge, at 134.5ft (41m).A member of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was unclear as to how police discerned the ship lost power, but said there were no structural integrity concerns related to the Brooklyn Bridge itself.Onlookers reported seeing crewmembers hanging from the ships masts and beams while awaiting rescue.A full investigation into the ship’s crash is being handled by the NTSB. A preliminary report is expected to be issued in under 30 days, but the full investigation will probably take over a year.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkMexicoBrooklynAmericasWater transportnewsShareReuse this content"

The motive is under investigation, but Brugada promised that her government would “continue its relentless fight against insecurity”.The attack took place at about 7am on a busy road in the Moderna neighbourhood, near an entrance to the Xola metro station.Initial reports indicate that Muñoz was waiting in the street for Guzmán, who came to pick him up.Video from a security camerashow a man in a white top and a motorbike helmet waiting by Guzmán’s car before he suddenly pulls out a pistol and starts firing – first at Muñoz, then Guzmán – before running off screen. He reportedly fled with a partner on a nearby motorbike.It had the hallmarks of an organised crime hit – incidents that arerelatively rare in the capital.As mayor of Mexico City, Brugada holds one of the most powerful political posts in the country after PresidentClaudia Sheinbaum, and they are allies in the Morena party.Sheinbaum condemned the killings and said during her morning press conference that there would not be impunity. Neither Guzmán nor Muñoz had a security detail, but Sheinbaum said she was not aware of any threats against them.Guzmán had worked with Brugada for years and was reportedly one of the peopleclosest to her in government.At a press conference shortly after the attack, Brugada, dressed in black, paid tribute to the two victims in a strained voice.“[Guzmán] was a wonderful, tireless, good woman. I’ve known [Muñoz] almost since … He’s one of the most intelligent people I’ve ever met, and extremely responsible,” she said. “I want to embrace their families, friends, loved ones and comrades in struggle. We in the city’s cabinet are shocked and mourn the loss of two dear comrades.”Authorities were investigating the motive and checking surveillance camera footage to identify the attackers, said Brugada in a statement.Two hours after the attack, the bodies had been removed by the police and all that was left was broken glass and a pool of blood drying in the morning sun.Just down the road, a shoeshiner said he was there when it happened.“I was right here working when they shot them and I didn’t even realise,” he said, before explaining: “I’m a little deaf.”“But there was no panic,” he added. “Everyone just started looking that way and then my friend here told me there were two dead people by a car.”“I actually didn’t hear the shots either,” said the friend, a stall owner called José Antonio. “I think it must have been with a silencer.”He added: “The killers didn’t try to hide it – they did it at rush hour.”The murders are the highest-profile attacks on government officials in Mexico City since the assassination attempt on the city’s then police chief Omar García Harfuch five years ago.In that attack, gunmen linked to the Jalisco New Generation cartel ambushed García Harfuch as he left his home, riddling his car with hundreds of bullets and killing three people, but not García Harfuch himself, who survived to become security minister of today’s federal government.“We won’t let this cowardly act go unpunished,” wroteGarcía Harfuch on X, as he promised the federal government’s assistance in the investigation.At the scene of the crime, José Antonio, the stall owner, said he had never seen anything like it in more than half a century living in La Moderna.“It’s a calm neighbourhood,” he said. “They were targeted. I guess for professional killers it doesn’t matter whether there are people around or not. They do it and they get out of there.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He said Canadians “weren’t impressed” by the gesture “given the circumstance”.Goodale told the UK’s PA news agency that Carney’s words were “direct” and “very accurate”.He said: “The prime minister was asked the clear, direct question: what do Canadians think? He answered it very directly and very accurately as an assessment of what Canadian public opinion was at that time.”The monarch’s arrival at the high commission marked the 100th anniversary of Canada House in London.The king and queen will visit Ottawa from 26 May to 27 May 2025. The visit will be Charles’s first to Canada as sovereign. He will hold audiences with the governor general and Carney before a short ceremony to swear in the queen as a member of the Canadian privy council.He will attend the state opening of parliament accompanied by the queen. During the ceremony, he will deliver the speech from the throne to the Senate Chamber.The occasion will be only the second time that the sovereign has opened a parliament, following Queen Elizabeth II opening the 23rd Canadian parliament in October 1957, and the third time a sovereign has delivered a speech from the throne.Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIICanadaDonald TrumpAmericasMonarchyMark CarneynewsShareReuse this content"

Television is the major source of the ads.Sign up to get Guardian Australia’s weekly media diary as a free newsletterThe Fare CEO, Ayla Chorley, said more needs to be done to protect children and young people from the harms of alcohol advertising.“This really underscores the need for reform to the regulation of alcohol advertising, like the commercial TV code of practice, which allows a sports loophole,” Chorley said.“It defies logic that even though alcohol companies aren’t supposed to market their products to under 18s, they are allowed to advertise during televised sporting events when they know thousands of kids are watching.“This new data highlights how critical it is that the Acma rejects Free TV Australia’s draft code of practice and [demands] an approach that meets community expectations – one that protects our children from harmful alcohol advertising at all times.”Julia Stafford from the Cancer Council of Western Australia said the “insidious creep” of alcohol marketing into every area of children’s lives must be stopped.“We know that when children are exposed to alcohol ads, they are more likely to start drinking earlier in life and at riskier levels,” Stafford said.Acma has already indicated that the proposal may not meet community standards. In a response to the draft revised code in November, it said: “Viewers may have concerns about any extension of time when alcohol advertising is permitted on television.”The proposal to extend M zones is just one of the changes to the self-regulatory Free TV code of practice, which has not been updated for a decade.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWeekly BeastFree weekly newsletterAmanda Meade's weekly diary on the latest in Australian media, free every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first, last November, was cancelled by the court after the first round amid allegations of campaign financing violations and a “massive” Russian interference campaign.The winner of the annulled vote, far-right firebrand Călin Georgescu, was barred from standing again and is under formal investigation on counts including misreporting campaign spending, illegal use of digital technology and promoting fascist groups. He denies any wrongdoing.“Just as Călin Georgescu was removed and the elections were annulled, we will challenge the election of Nicușor Dan for exactly the same reasons,” Simion, an EU-critical, Trump-admiring former soccer ultra,said in a statementto local media.“Why? Because there was vote buying,” said Simion, who formally conceded to Dan on Sunday night after first claiming to have won. “Because dead people voted on 18 May, and no calculation in the world can show us over 11.5 million Romanians voted.”The Guardian view on Romania’s presidential election upset: a vote for stability and the west | EditorialRead moreSimion has repeatedly alleged electoral fraud without providing evidence. His belated decision to contest the election’s outcome, while unlikely to succeed, will prolong the political uncertainty in Romania, which is under a caretaker government.The ultranationalist, whose supporters carried out a parallel count at some polling stations, said votes were “correctly counted” but “international observers” had seen “foreign interference” and “social media and algorithms have been manipulated”.He claimed there was “irrefutable evidence” of meddling by France, Moldova and others in “an orchestrated effort to manipulate institutions, direct media narratives and impose a result that does not reflect the sovereign will of the Romanian people”.Simion referenced a suggestion by the founder of the Telegram messaging app,Pavel Durov, that Parishad asked it to “silence conservative voices” in Romania.

But I think we don’t have a choice. We … either give them the possibility to stabilise the country or we don’t do that,” suggesting that failure to lift the sanctions could push Syria down a path similar to Afghanistan.After the Taliban returned to power in August 2021,Afghanistan’s economy collapsedas the country’s central bank assets remained frozen, leaving ordinary people facing huge price increases for basic goods such as flour, rice and oil.The EU decision came as the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, said Syria could be weeks away from another civil war of “epic proportions”, as he called for support to the transitional leadership.He told a US Senate hearing: “It is our assessment that, frankly, the transitional authority, given the challenges they’re facing, are maybe weeks – not many months – away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions, basically the country splitting up.”The EU dismissed suggestions its decision was a response to US policy.Just weeks after Sharaa’s forces ousted the Assad regime, the EU in February suspended sanctions targeting Syria’s energy and transport industries and eased restrictions on four banks and an airline company in an attempt to get more money flowing through the financial system.Some member states argued those measures were not sufficient to stabilise the Syrian economy. But EU officials have been concerned about an upsurge in violence, with deadly clashes between Syrian security services and fighters loyal to the Assad regime. In March,more than 1,000 people, including 754 civilians, were killedduring two days of clashes between security forces and fighters loyal to the former regime, according to an independent monitoring group.Last month,at least 16 people diedafter an attack on a security checkpoint by unknown gunmen and an attack on a Druze-majority suburb in Damascus. Relations between the Syrian government and the Druze community, an Arab religious minority of about 500,000 people, are already tense over negotiations about a future Syrian state.The EU has called on Syria’s government to ensure a “peaceful and inclusive transition”.Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said in a written statement: “TheEuropean Unionwants to make a fresh start with Syria … but we also expect an inclusive policy within the country that includes all population groups and religious groups.”Explore more on these topicsSyriaEuropean UnionDonald TrumpMarco RubioUS politicsEuropeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A court on the island – the first in Spain to specialise in violence against children and adolescents –saidit had asked police to carry out the raid “in light of the extensive evidence and testimony” of alleged crimes taking place in the centre.At least nine employees were detained for several hours and officials said further arrests had not been ruled out. Few other details were provided as the court said it had ordered the investigation to be carried out in secret.The court said regional authorities had been notified to ensure they could “take the necessary measures to ensure the wellbeing and protection” of the children housed at the centre.In recent years there has been arise in numbersof people turning to the treacherous Canary Islands route, one of the mostdangerous crossingsinto Europe, setting off in unstable vessels that are often unfit to face the fierce currents of the Atlantic.The surge in arrivals has included thousands of unaccompanied children, and officials in the Canary Islands have repeatedly said the region is overwhelmed.In March the region, which at the time boreresponsibility for about 37%of the unaccompanied children who had arrived in Spain, told Spain’s supreme court that more than 1,000 unaccompanied children were living in overcrowded conditions and were without access to adequate resources.A recent investigation by Amnesty International highlightedseveral other issueswith the islands’ network of more than 80 centres for unaccompanied children, including a lack of staff with proper training, with “nightclub bouncers” in some cases hired to staff the centres. It said it had documented allegations of abuse including excessive punishments that had forced children into isolation or deprived them of food.Virginia Álvarez, of Amnesty,said: “These situations are unacceptable. Let’s remember that we’re talking about children who often arrive in very vulnerable situations.”She said many of the children had fled human rights violations or were survivors of violence and trauma, and all of them were now grappling with uncertainty and anxiety about their future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Earlier this year, the Spanish central government announced amandatory programmethat would force regions across the country to help take in these children, setting off tensions with some of the regions led by the conservative People’s party.After releasing its investigation in March, Amnesty said the blame lay with various administrations, from the Canary Islands officials who had carried out28 inspectionsof children’s centres in the span of five years, to the central government and the regions that were refusing to act in solidarity.Esteban Beltrán, the director of Amnesty International Spain,said: “Failures in the protection system in the Canary Islands are a shared responsibility. They continue to pass the buck to one another and, as a result, children remain without adequate protection.”Explore more on these topicsSpainMigrationRefugeesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But Lee feels their latest venture, the kidnap dramaHighest 2 Lowest, will probably be the duo’s swansong.“This is the fifth one we’ve done together,” Lee said after the picture’s premiere at theCannes film festival. “It has been a blessing, this body of work between us, doing films that people love. And I think this is it. He’s been talking about retirement. But five films together: that’s good, they stand up.”Highest 2 Lowest is a pacy New York thriller that stars the 70-year-old Washington as David King, a millionaire music mogul who is forced to take action after his assistant’s son is abducted in a case of mistaken identity. The film is a loose adaptation ofAkira Kurosawa’s 1963 drama High and Low, which was itself adapted from a 1959 novel by Ed McBain.Lee and Washington first collaborated on the 1990 jazz drama Mo’ Better Blues before going on to make Malcolm X, He Got Game and Inside Man. Washington was Oscar-nominated for his performance as Malcolm X but wound up losing the prize to Al Pacino in The Scent of a Woman. It’s a decision by voters that still rankles with Lee. “What he did with that film was amazing,” he said. “No disrespect to my brother Al Pacino – I love him. But Denzel in my opinion should have won.”This is Washington’s first appearance at Cannes, where he was on hand to receive an honorary Palme d’Or. Lee, however, has enjoyed a long history with the festival. He first visited with his 1986 debut feature, She’s Gotta Have It, and served as jury president at the Covid-struck summer festival of 2021. The director credited Cannes with helping to send his career stratospheric by including his controversial race riot dramaDo the Right Thingin the main competition in 1989.“It started in Cannes and then went to America,” he said. “People said Do the Right Thing would cause riots and that black people would go insane. New York magazine was telling people to hope to God that this film doesn’t open in your neighbourhood. It was pure, blatant racism. And all of those people have been proved wrong over the years.”Highest 2 Lowest is unlikely to provoke the same level of outrage. It’s a glossy, high-concept affair, complete with swooping drone shots of the Manhattan skyline and a climactic fight scene on a downtown subway train. Nonetheless, the cast felt that its themes of ambition, greed and selfism implicitly speak to the state of Trump’s America.“That’s the world we are living in now, where everybody is for sale and everything is transactional,” said actor Jeffrey Wright, who plays the role of King’s assistant, Uncle Paul. “I think we can do better. Look back at the films [Lee] has made. Look at what Malcolm X was talking about. We come from a tradition that wasn’t about what you could do for yourself but what you could do for your community. That wasn’t about money, it was more about love.”Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalSpike LeeDenzel WashingtonDo the Right ThingFestivalsFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "14.53 EDTSummary of the day so farHere is a summary of today’s developments:The UK suspended trade negotiations with Israel over its Gaza blockade,the UK foreign secretary,David Lammy,told parliament on Tuesday. He said the Israeli ambassador had been summoned. The UK’s prime minister,Keir Starmer,described the situation in Gaza as “horrific” and “utterly intolerable”. It comes after the UK, France and Canada on Monday issued their strongest condemnation yet of the way Israel is conducting its war on Gaza and repeated calls for a ceasefire.Israel said external pressure will not change its course after the UK paused free trade talks over the war in Gaza and levelled new sanctions on settlers in the occupied West Bank.“External pressure will not divert Israel from its path in defending its existence and security against enemies who seek its destruction,” an Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.The European Union has agreed to review its trade agreement with Israel over alleged human rights abuses in Gaza,the EU’s top diplomat,Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday. The decision comes almost 15 months after Irish and Spanish leaders called on the European Commission’s chief,Ursula von der Leyen,to make such a move. The change comes after a proposal from the Netherlands last week gained widespread support amid growing alarm about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and the West Bank.No humanitarian aid has been distributed yet in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, according to aspokesperson for the United Nations, Stéphane Dujarric. Separately, Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that oversees civil affairs in thePalestinian territories, claimed 93 UN aid trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday.As many as 14,000 babies in Gaza could die in 48 hours if aid does not reach them in time, the UN’s humanitarian chief,Tom Fletcher,warned. “I want to save as many as these 14,000 babies as we can in the next 48 hours,” he told the BBC. Fletcher said five trucks of aid went into Gaza yesterday but described this as a “drop in the ocean”. A UN spokesman later provided more detail, saying: “We are pointing to the imperative of getting supplies in to save an estimated 14,000 babies suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification] has warned about. We need to get the supplies in as soon as possible, ideally within the next 48 hours.”At least 87 Palestinians were killed and more than 290 injured by Israeli attacks in Gaza over the past 24 hours,Gaza’s health ministry said on Tuesday. At least 53,573 Palestinian people have been killed and 121,688 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the ministry said. Gaza City, Deir el-Balah, the Nuseirat refugee camp, the Jabalia refugee camp and the Bureij refugee camp were among the places targeted in deadly Israeli strikes on Tuesday, according to reports.Benjamin Netanyahu ordered part of his country’s delegation negotiating a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Doha to return to Israel,according to Israeli media reports. Separately, Qatar’s prime ministerSheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thanisaid Israel’s continuing assault on Gaza had undermined peace efforts. “This irresponsible, aggressive behaviour undermines any potential chance for peace,” the Qatari leader said.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Washington has not discussed the deportation of Palestinians from Gaza to Libya, but he said Washington had asked other countries in the region if they would be open to accepting Palestinians who want to move voluntarily. Rubio was testifying before the Senate foreign relations committee on Tuesday on Tuesday, when a pro-Palestine protester disrupted the hearing.Australia joined 22 other nations in condemning Israel over its decision to allow limited aid into Gaza while announcing a military expansion to “take control” of the besieged strip.23 countries, including the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, urged Israel not to politicise humanitarian aid for the starving population.The Lebanese health ministry said an Israeli airstrike injured nine people in a drone attack on the coastal Tyre district in the south of the country.Three people are now in “critical condition”, the ministry said, adding that two children were among the injured.ShareUpdated at16.40 EDT"

Seventeen of the 27 states backed the move. The EU is Israel’s biggest trading partner, accounting for 32% of Israel’s total trade in goods in 2024.Lammy, unleashing language he has not used since the latestGazaconflict began, said the further planned major military incursion into Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces was “morally unjustifiable, wholly disproportionate and utterly counterproductive”.As the foreign secretary made his opening remarks in the Commons, backbenchers shouted “genocide”.Sounding genuinely outraged with the government of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Lammy said: “We are now entering a dark new phase in this conflict. Netanyahu’s government is planning to drive Gazans from their homes into a corner of the strip to the south and permit them a fraction of the aid that they need.”2:46'End this blockade now': UK calls out Netanyahu and suspends trade talks with Israel – videoIsrael’s foreign ministry accused the UK of having an anti-Israel obsession.Responding to the suspension of trade talks, the Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein said: “If, due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations, the British government is willing to harm the British economy – that is its own prerogative.”He said the sanctions in relation to the West Bank were “unjustified and regrettable”. And he added: “The British mandate ended exactly 77 years ago.“External pressure will not divert Israel from its path in defending its existence and security against enemies who seek its destruction.”Lammy told MPs: “Yesterday, minister [Bezalel] Smotrich even spoke of Israeli forces ‘cleansing’ Gaza, ‘destroying what’s left’, of resident Palestinians ‘being relocated to third countries’. We must call this what it is. It is extremism. It is dangerous. It is repellent. It is monstrous.”He added that the Israeli ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, was being summoned to hear British demands that the latest assault on Gaza be halted.Lammy said Israel had suffered a “heinous attack” on 7 October 2023 and that the UK government backed Israel’s right to defend itself.But the military escalation in Gaza was “morally unjustifiable, it’s wholly disproportionate, it’s utterly, utterly counterproductive – whatever Israeli ministers claim, this is not the way to bring the hostages safely home”.Israel has held back aid, saying it was being stolen by Hamas and claimed the renewed assault was necessary to wipe out the terrorists and release the remaining hostages.But Lammy said Israel would not secure the release of the hostages by creating a humanitarian catastrophe. He said: “Civilians in Gaza facing starvation, homelessness, trauma, desperate for this war to end, now confront renewed bombardment, new displacement and new suffering. And the remaining hostages kept apart from their loved ones by Hamas for almost 600 days are now at heightened risk from the war around them.“They are going to take control of the strip and will allow just enough to prevent hunger. Fewer than 10 trucks entered Gaza yesterday. The UN and WHO have issued stark warnings of the threat of starvation hanging over the heads of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. This is abominable.”View image in fullscreenUN aid lorries wait to enter the Gaza Strip at the Kerem Shalom crossing, southern Israel on Tuesday.Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPAHe warned that the Israeli government was damaging the country’s global reputation. “They are isolating Israel from its friends and partners around the world. Undermining the interests of the Israeli people. And damaging the image of the state of Israel in the eyes of the world. I find this deeply painful, as a lifelong friend of Israel and a believer in the values expressed in its declaration of independence.”But many Labour backbenchers in the Commons found a gulf between Lammy’s rhetoric and the government’s actions limited to a symbolic suspending of talks on a free trade deal.Backbenchers including many Tories called for a tightening of controls of UK arms exports to Israel, recognition of the state of Palestine at a UN conference next month and a full ban on Israeli trade. Lammy said further concrete action would be considered but in conjunction with allies.The Conservative former minister Kit Malthouse said Lammy’s “anger and the outrage” was “appreciated by us all”, but added: “He knows as well as I do that the Israelis couldn’t give a damn what he says in this chamber.” He added: “Does the frontbench need us to beg for the lives of those Palestinian children before they’ll trigger this concrete action, whatever it might be?”Lammy said it was “wrong” of Malthouse to claim that “Israelis couldn’t give a fig what [was] said from this frontbench”, adding that the government announced further sanctions “because of the position of this Netanyahu government and the language that we see from these ministers”.He also imposed sanctions on a further three Israeli settlers and four entities on the West Bank, including the veteran settler extremist Daniella Weiss, the head of the Nachala movement, who featured in Louis Theroux’s recent documentary,The Settlers. Other individuals targeted were Zohar Sabah, an Israeli who the US imposed sanctions on in November. It was from the Zohar Zabah farm that settlers, some of them minors, set out to attack the principal of a Palestinian school in the grounds of the school.When contacted by phone, Weiss shrugged off the sanctions, which she attacked as “childish” and claimed they would not affect her personally or the broader settler movement.“My husband ordered tickets already for an around the world tour, without including Britain,” she said.“It is not mature, it is not serious. If it were a child doing it I could say that the child doesn’t understand.“Britain knows, the [British] government knows, that we were attacked, and if it were up to the Israeli government we wouldn’t have started any war.“But as we were attacked and as there are intentions to continue attacks, so we fight. And we will have the upper hand.”However, Lammy again held back from imposing sanctions on two Israeli cabinet ministers, the finance minister, Smotrich, and the interior minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, although he said some of their language would be kept under review.Smotrich said this week: “Just as we levelled Rafah, we will level all of Gaza.”Lammy said there was a UN plan ready to deliver aid at scale with more than 9,000 trucks at the border. He called on Netanyahu to immediately end the blockade and allow aid in.Sanctions were also imposed on Libi Construction and Infrastructure Ltd, Harel Libi and Coco’s Farm Outpost, and Neria’s Farm Outpost, including “persons residing in the outpost, for involvement in human rights abuses”. Earlier Keir Starmer said Britain “cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve” and that levels of suffering there were “utterly intolerable”.“The recent announcement that Israel will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza is totally and utterly inadequate,” he told MPs.“So we must coordinate our response, because this war has gone on for far too long. We cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warDavid LammyGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

He was also a keen para-footballer.“Ahmed’s death is really saddening. We don’t want him to be just another number. His whole life, trying to compete, trying to get into sports, was because he didn’t want to be another number, another one who lost his leg. Now we have to continue in his honour,” said Karim Ali, co-founder of theGazaSunbirds.Ali said Dali had suffered more than most since the Israeli airstrike in 2014 in which he lost a leg. He was declared dead after the strike and placed in a morgue before anyone realised he was still alive.He had to juggle his love for sport with the reality of providing a living for his wife and four children. He did not receive disability benefit from the government but earned a meagre living as a bike mechanic before the war. During the Israeli assault on Gaza afterthe attack by Hamas on 7 October 2023he was displaced from his home and had to rely on the help of others.He was killed on Monday in an attack on the city of Khan Younis, which Israel has ordered Palestinians to leave amid an intensified offensive over recent days that killed 85 Palestinians on Tuesday. Palestinian media reported up to 30 airstrikes in Khan Younis on the morning Dali was killed.Israel has vowed to press on with its offensive and take complete control of Gaza, despite criticism this week from allies, with the UK saying it would suspend trade negotiations with Israel.Ali said Dali’s troubles before his death were typical of many in the Gaza Sunbirds community.“Their lives for almost two years now have been an unimaginable hell. The majority of the team cannot find food, they are sick with skin diseases, with rashes, there’s no medicine for them or their family. Their prosthetics are damaged and cannot be serviced.”He added: “Ahmed loved cycling, he always loved cycling, he always had the best intentions but life put pressure on him as a person.”View image in fullscreenAhmed al-Dali, left, with friends and members of the Gaza Sunbirds.Photograph: Gaza SunbirdsFlavia Cappellini, an Italian film-maker who spent time with Dali while making a documentary about the cycling team, described him as “somehow shy and exuberant at the same time”.She said Dali was committed to his family but sometimes struggled with the challenges he faced as a disabled man in Gaza trying to find employment.“How do you work in a place that doesn’t provide chances to people with disabilities? That tormented hm, especially in regards to his sports endeavours. That reality hit him so hard,” she said. “He would cycle with his jeans on as he didn’t have any other clothes but that didn’t prevent him from experiencing freedom while on a bike.“You could feel he was doing his best to come back from his injury trauma when he lost his leg in 2014. He wanted to succeed in sport as in life, but all the odds were against him.”Over the past 16 months, the Sunbirds have distributed $450,000 (£336,000) worth of aid across the Gaza Strip.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaDisability and sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The population faces starvation. Gaza’s people must receive the aid they desperately need,” the countries said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailNetanyahu’s plan for aid distribution in Gaza was yet to be announced, but the Israel-backed and US-led Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) was expected to distribute food through militarised compounds.“Advanced discussions”suggested heads of households would be expected to collect boxes weighing up to 20kg with several days’ worth of food and basic hygiene items like soap for their families.There would be no provision for those too sick or weakened by famine to walk long distances across Gaza’s ruined landscape with heavy loads.The UN hasalready raised concernsabout GHF’s capacity to deliver enough aid to the territory’s population.The 23 countries raised concerns about the GHF proposal, stating existing aid groups already had the “logistical capacity, expertise and operational coverage to deliver assistance across Gaza to those who need it most”.“The UN has raised concerns that the proposed model cannot deliver aid effectively, at the speed and scale required. It places beneficiaries and aid workers at risk, undermines the role and independence of the UN and our trusted partners, and links humanitarian aid to political and military objectives,” the joint statement read.“Humanitarian aid should never be politicised and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change.”Australia joined the joint donor statement overnight but not aseparate statement signedby Canada, the UK and France warning Israel against expanding its military campaign in Gaza, threatening “further action”, including targeted sanctions.“The level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable. Yesterday’s announcement that Israel will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza is wholly inadequate,” the three countries said, marking a change in tone from the UK and Canada in particular, which have broadly backed Israel’s war after the 7 October Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have always supported Israel’s right to defend Israelis against terrorism. But this escalation is wholly disproportionate.“We will not stand by while the Netanyahu government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response.”Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right critic of any negotiated end to the war, defended Netanyahu’s decision to let in “basic” food aid, saying it would allow Israel to keep its military in Gaza for a campaign of destruction and displacement.“Now we conquer, cleanse and stay – until Hamas is destroyed,”he told a news conference. “Along the way, what remains of the strip is also being wiped out.“As part of the war, the IDF is moving the population out of combat zones … The population will reach the south of the strip, and from there, with God’s help, move to third countries underPresident [Donald] Trump’s plan.”An Australian government spokesperson said the “abhorrent comments” by the Netanyahu government were “unacceptable”, adding Australia had consistently opposed the military expansion by Israel in Gaza, “just as we have been clear that forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza would breach international law”.“Abhorrent comments by members of the Netanyahu government and the ongoing denial of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population are unacceptable,” they said.“The statement released by Australia and 22 other countries demands the immediate and full resumption of aid to Gaza.“Australia continues to work with our partners to press for a ceasefire, the return of hostages, and the protection of civilians.”The total toll from the war inside Gaza has reached 53,486, most of them civilians. At least 121,034 Palestinian people have been injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in its latest update.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaAustralian politicsHuman rightsAustralian foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Yet in the aftermath of four days of cross-border drones and missile strikes – themost technologically advancedconflict either side has ever engaged in – the question remains: what now?While both India and Pakistanhave claimed victory, some experts fear that a return to hostilities is almost inevitable.There is a sense among analysts and diplomats that Delhi has not emerged from the conflict as triumphant as it had hoped, leaving little room for further de-escalation or political engagement. In a speech last week, India’s prime minister,Narendra Modi, insistedthat the military offensive against Pakistani terror groups, named Operation Sindhoor, was still continuing and that the ceasefire was simply a pause.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s army, after going through a period of reputational decline, is once again the country’s most revered institution – proving that nothing works better for the fortunes of Pakistan’s generals than an altercation with India.Pakistan’s use of J-10C jets and missiles exposes potency of Chinese weaponryRead more“India has made it clear they are still on a state of alert,” said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for south Asia at the Chatham House thinktank. He was sceptical that India’s missile strikes into Pakistan had done much to deter any future militant attacks, which India’s defence minister said would be taken as an “act of war”.“With the hyper-nationalist rhetoric we are still seeing from both sides, it seems like there’s limited space for any lasting rapprochement,” said Bajpaee.‘The India-Pakistan hyphenation’While India is seen to have achieved some tactical victories – successfully targeting known militant bases in Pakistan, firing targeted missiles into Rawalpindi, the heart of Pakistan’s military and largely rebuffing Pakistani missiles – the strategic wins have been more elusive.Instead, India is now grappling with some more uncomfortable outcomes. As noted by Pratap Bhanu Mehta, an Indian political scientist, in hisIndian Express column, the armed conflict has “no decisive victory and no clear political end simply reinstates the India-Pakistan hyphenation” – a reference to an age-old tendency to lump the two countries together as a singular quarrelling entity on the international stage. In recent years, as India soared ahead of Pakistan and positioned itself as a global economic and geopolitical superpower, there was a feeling in the corridors of New Delhi that they had broken free of the hyphenation burden. However, recent events showed that perceptions, particularly in the US, had not changed much.Among diplomats and observers, the view was that India had been left on the back foot in the critical battle over narrative.The deep-rooted instinct of the Modi government to tightly control the flow of information (Modi has not done an in-person press conference in 10 years) meant that as Operation Sindhoor was launched, their accounts of the operation were limited to a few brief, highly choreographed press conferences led by civil servants.In Pakistan meanwhile, ministers were at the end of the phone and on TV news shows non-stop, briefing the world constantly on the Pakistani version of events, such as claims that Pakistan had downed five Indian military jets. The Modi government has still not publicly responded to the allegation, but instead put pressure on Indian news outlets to avoid any mention of the alleged downed planes.Amid vast information gaps left by the Indian government an unprecedented amount of misinformation and disinformation proliferated. False claims fuelled an insatiable appetite for war among the Indian public.As a result, on 10 May, whenDonald Trumpabruptly announced a ceasefire before India or Pakistan had a chance, it was met with a widespread reaction of betrayal and anger in India. Many could not understand why the government would agree to a ceasefire, let alone one that seemed to have been imposed by the US. The fury among the hyper-nationalist far right – Modi’s political base and where much of the disinformation originated – was particularly potent and the clamour for a return to war has still not entirely dissipated.Trump interventions add insult to injuryTrump’s boastful claims of brokering the ceasefire have been a source of frustration to New Delhi. While he joins a long line of US presidents who have been drawn into disputes between the neighbours, it is historically done far more discreetly and largely on terms favourable to India.This time, India was so infuriated at Trump’s version of events, including that coercion over trade led both sides to lay down arms, that it openly repudiated several of the president’s statements.Trump’s involvement has also resulted in another strategic upset for India: the re-internationalisation of the Kashmir issue. India’s immovable position is that its dispute with Pakistan over the region, whichdates back to 1947, is a purely internal issue that should have no outside interference or third-party negotiation. But in flagrant disregard for this, Trump offered, post-ceasefire, to mediate between the two countries to find a “solution”. Pakistan leapt at the offer; in India it was met with stony silence.The Indian political strategist Brahma Chellaney accused Trump of “playing right into the hands of Pakistan which has long weaponised theKashmirissue to justify its export of terror”.Much remains up in the air between the two sides. The land border between the countries is still closed and both sides are still denying visas. Perhaps most critically, the Indus River treaty, which ensures Pakistan gets a vital supply of river water from India, remainssuspended by New Delhi.But while among the political class in Islamabad there is optimistic chatter of post-ceasefire talks in the Gulf or London – where even Kashmir could be on the table – New Delhi has avoided the subject. “The dilemma is that this war does not compel negotiations. Nor is it likely to build even a modicum of trust that can allow a political negotiation,” wrote Mehta.On a deeper, existential level, analysts say there remains little incentive on either side to de-escalate. In India, anti-Pakistan fervour has only driven up support for Modi and helped his strongman Hindu nationalist government win elections. In Pakistan, the ever-present threat of India has long been used to justify the dominating role of the military in running the country.Bajpaee is among those who has a pessimistic view of any suggestion of post-conflict political dialogue between the two countries, calling that a “dead end” as both sides are “essentially talking past each other”.“It seems very unlikely that we’re going to see any sort of credible peace process,” he said. “Frankly, at this point I would say it’s not a question of if, but when we will see a resumption of some sort of military hostilities between both countries.”Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaPakistanSouth and central AsiaDonald TrumpTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

Once a brain tumour is found, a sample is taken during surgery and cells are immediately studied under a microscope by pathologists, who can often identify the type of tumour. However, genetic testing helps to make or confirm the diagnosis.“Almost all of the samples will go for further testing anyway. But for some of them it will be absolutely crucial, because you won’t know what you’re looking at,” said Prof Matthew Loose, a co-author of the research from the University of Nottingham.Loose noted that in the UK there could be a lag of eight weeks or longer between surgery and the full results of genetic tests, delaying the confirmation of a diagnosis and hence treatment such as chemotherapy.Writing in the journalNeuro-Oncology, Loose and colleagues report how they harnessed what is known as nanopore technology to cut this timeframe.The approach is based on devices that contain membranes featuring hundreds to thousands of tiny pores, each of which has an electric current passing through it. When DNA approaches a pore it is “unzipped” into single strands; as a strand passes through the pore it disrupts the electric current.Crucially, the different building blocks of DNA – and modifications to them – disrupt the current in characteristic ways, allowing the DNA to be “read”, or sequenced. These sequences are then compared against those relating to different types of brain tumours, using a software program built by the team.Loose said the process costs about £400 per sample – on a par with current genetic testing.GraphicThe researchers first trialled the approach on 30 samples that had previously been extracted from patients, before using it on 50 samples at the time they were removed.They said 24 (80%) and 45 (90%) of these samples respectively were fully and correctly classified by the new approach after 24 hours, a success rate on a par with traditional genetic testing methods.However, 38 (76%) of the 50 samples that were prospectively collected were confidently classified within one hour, meaning the time from sample removal to surgeons having the results could be as little as two hours.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2014 the government set a time limit of 26 weeks but it has never been met.In areport published on Wednesday, the NAO says the proportion of children waiting more than a year for a public law case to be resolved increased from 0.7% in January 2017 to 12% in December last year. The figures equate to approximately 70 and 1,200 children respectively.The watchdog is urging the government to do more to tackle delays that can mean children waiting longer for permanent care and living or contact arrangements, increasing risk of harm, anxiety, instability and disrupted friendships or education.Including private law cases, which involve parental disputes such as living or contact arrangements for their child, there were more than 4,000 children in England andWalesin family court proceedings lasting two years in December 2024.Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the chair of the House of Commons public accounts committee, said: “Too many children are suffering as a result of delays to family court proceedings, which are currently still far too long. The longer a case remains unresolved, the more likely it is that there are further delays, increasing the risk of harm to children and driving up public costs.“Responsibilities for family justice are fragmented, with no single body responsible for overall performance. Government has neither the right data to fully understand the causes or impacts of delays, nor does it have an assessment of the capacity required to manage the system efficiently.”In December, nearly two-thirds of the 4,000 cases that had been open for 100 weeks or longer were in London and the south-east. London had an average duration of 53 weeks for cases brought by local authorities and 70 weeks for cases brought by parents.Wales performed best, averaging 24 weeks and 18 weeks respectively. Where there were longer delays, this reflected issues such as lower judicial capacity in those areas, the NAO said.There is no government time limit for private law cases, which took 41 weeks on average last year.The watchdog said the impact of delays on costs was significant, as evidence and assessments needed to be updated. Average spending on legal aid for a case brought by a local authority doubled between 2018 and 2022 from approximately £6,000 to about £12,000 – an annual increase of £314m in legal aid spending.Family courts have recovered much better thancrown courtsafter the Covid-19 pandemic, with 47,662 family court cases outstanding (37,541 of them private law cases), down by more than a quarter since August 2021.But Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “Many cases still take too long to complete and further action is needed to remove the barriers to a more efficient system, including poor-quality data and fragmented decision-making.”A government spokesperson said it had inherited a justice system in crisis, adding: “We are working hard to improve their experience in the family courts further by expanding the successful pathfinder pilot, which has already reduced case times by 11 weeks, and investing £500m in early intervention. Cases are now moving faster.”Explore more on these topicsFamily lawChild protectionLegal aidEnglandWalesSocial carenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s why decisive action is often too late or doesn’t happen at all.“This review points out the cracks but ignores the broken system underneath. We don’t need more reports that dodge the real issue.“We need change. We need a legal duty of care in higher education before more young lives are lost.”Robert Abrahart and wife Maggie are among the founders ofForThe100, a group of bereaved parents campaigning for universities to have a statutory duty of care towards students.The review of serious incident reports, including 79 suspected suicide deaths and 25 incidents of non-fatal self-harm in the 2023-24 academic year, found that mental ill-health was identified in nearly half of the cases, while more than a third mentioned academic problems or pressures. About one in four of the students were in their first year of undergraduate studies.Dr Cathryn Rodway of the University of Manchester, one of the review’s lead authors, said: “We suggest mental health awareness and suicide prevention training should be available for all staff in student-facing roles, and include recognising and responding to risk and neurodiversity.”Debbie Laycock, head of policy at Samaritans, said: “Students face a range of pressures during their time at university, and it’s vital that their mental health and wellbeing are prioritised alongside their academic studies.“Universities must take meaningful steps to create a culture of care and ensure the right support is in place.“A crucial first step is making sure staff who work directly with students are trained in suicide prevention, so they’re equipped to recognise warning signs and potentially save a life.”Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “For too long, families have been left with unanswered questions and denied the transparency they deserve. This must change.“We are committed to working with universities, experts and students to turn the findings of this review into real, lasting improvements.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

It should be 80% lower by 2040 and 94% by 2045, with the remaining emissions absorbed by trees, peatland and technologies that strip CO2from the air.Gillian Martin, Scotland’s acting net zero secretary, said the CCC’s advice would be central to a new climate plan currently being drafted. Opposition parties and climate policy groups said its report bolstered their complaints that ministers were failing to match their rhetoric with action.The Institute for Public Policy Research, a thinktank, said Scottish ministers should draw up new climate “missions” to set overarching policies for sectors with the biggest climate impacts such as heat in buildings, transport and land use, which would mandate action.“It is time to break out of the obsession with price incentives and behavioural nudges,” said Dave Hawkey, an IPPR research fellow.Sarah Boyack, Scottish Labour’s net zero spokesperson, said: “The SNP has already torn up one set of targets – we urgently need a real plan to meet the Scottish government’s remaining targets.”The CCC singled out the rapid rollout of heat pumps and district heating for homes, mass insulation of homes, low-carbon transport, wholesale planning reform to speed up renewables, and far better funding for low-carbon farming for urgent action.The Scottish Green party’s co-leader Patrick Harvie, whose power-sharing deal with the SNP was ripped up by the previous first minister, Humza Yousaf, said: “The Scottish government already knows, as we all do, that without serious effort we will fail to protect our world from catastrophic damage.”The CCC said it believed Scotland’s 2045 net zero target was achievable, but the Scottish government’s internal advice was very gloomy about its prospects.Its current projections suggest it will miss that by 20m tonnes of CO2, unless there is a dramatic increase in policy interventions.The CCC did not endorse Scottish Labour’s calls for new nuclear power stations in Scotland but also warned Scottish ministers they should not allow a new gas-fired power station to be built at Peterhead without carbon capture technology – something the UK government has not yet funded.Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsScotlandGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisScottish politicsRegulatorsClimate Change CommitteenewsShareReuse this content"

If they breach those conditions, they could go to prison.According to Ministry of Justice statistics, 59% of adults released, having spent 12 months or less in prison, reoffend within a year. That figure rises to 62% for those with custodial sentences of six months or less.In contrast, the reoffending rate for offenders who received a suspended sentence with requirements is only 25%.Deferred sentences, when criminals are told they will be sentenced after a period in which they can begin rehabilitation, have also shown promising results in reducing reoffending in Northern Ireland, officials said.Shabana Mahmood: lord chancellor with political nous unafraid to shake up systemRead moreExtending the deferral period to 12 months – similar to models in several Australian states – would give offenders more time to engage with services, stabilise their lives and avoid custody altogether.Pregnant women could use the deferral period to access healthcare, housing and support, the review is expected to say. It would also enable them to avoid the trauma of giving birth in prison and to receive a lesser sentence, which could mitigate the impact of the conviction on mother and baby.If an offender does not comply with the conditions of their deferred sentence, they can be brought back to court.Other recommendations are expected to include allowing prisoners to earn their freedom after serving a third of their sentences under new minimum and maximum sentence plans.Offenders will be able to earn early release if they complete work, training or education assignments and demonstrate good behaviour.The government’s plans are expected to require thousands of offenders to be tagged in the community, and will increase the burden upon probation officers.Reports this week claimed that the government has ordered tens of thousands of extra tags which will be used to monitor offenders in the community.Keir Starmer’s government has demonstrated an appetite for a liberal overhaul of the sentencing system. In July, the prime minister appointed James Timpson, the former chair of the Prisons Reform Trust,as his prisons minister.In 2019, while he was justice secretary, Gaukemade a speech questioning the effectiveness of short prison sentences, arguing that there was a strong case for those of six months or less to be scrapped altogether.Tania Bassett, a national officer at the the probation officers’ union Napo, welcomed proposals to increase the use of deferred sentences but cautioned against the overuse of suspended sentences.“Deferred sentencing allows probation officers to intervene with low level offenders such as first-time drug addicts and [female] offenders before they receive a sentence. It allows people to be signposted towards services and gives them a chance to reform,” she said.“I am more concerned about the use of SSOs [suspended sentence orders] because they are seen as a last chance saloon,” she said.“What I wouldn’t like to see is people being given them unnecessarily when a community order would be more appropriate.”Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justiceSentencingDavid GaukenewsShareReuse this content"

He added that Republicans had agreed to allocate $25bn in initial funding and Canada had expressed an interest in taking part.“Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world, and even if they are launched from space,” Trump said, “forever ending the missile threat to the American homeland.”US army parade could cost up to $45m and involve 6,600 soldiersRead moreWhat exactly the Golden Dome will look like remains unclear. Trump has not yet decided which of three options proposed by the defense department he wants to pursue. Pentagon officials recently drafted three proposals – small, medium and large – for Trump to consider.The proposals all broadly combine ground-based missile interceptors currently used by theUS militarywith more ambitious and hi-tech systems to build a space-based defense program.The option that Trump chooses will determine its timeline and cost. The $25bn coming from Republicans’ budget bill is only set to cover initial development costs. The final price tag could exceed $540bn over the next two decades, according to the congressional budget office.Trump said on Tuesday evening that he had settled on “architecture” for the project and suggested the total cost of putting it into service would reach $175bn, but gave no specifics. Gen Michael Guetlein of the USSpaceForce will oversee implementation of the project, Trump said.View image in fullscreenGen Michael A Guetlein testifies before a Senate committee in Washington in March.Photograph: Aaron Schwartz/Newscom/AlamyThe selection of Guetlein, the vice-chief of space operations, means the elevation of a four-star general widely seen at the Pentagon to be competent and deeply experienced in missile defense systems and procurement.The project is expected to end up largely as a partnership with major defense contractors, including Elon Musk’sSpaceX, given it has the capacity to manufacture rockets to launch military payloads into orbit and satellites that can deliver next-generation surveillance and targeting tools.It will also rely on companies that manufacture ordnance currently used by theUS military. The project’s baseline capabilities are set to depend on existing systems including the Thaad and Aegis Ashore systems made by Lockheed Martin and Patriot surface-to-air missiles made by Raytheon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, the Defense Intelligence Agency released an assessment that said China has about 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles, Russia has 350 and North Korea has a handful.Initially, the White House had named the options for a space-based missile defense system “Moonshot Plus” and “Moonshot Plus Plus”.

They estimate that more than 100 million Americans will still qualify for the annual shots under the new terms.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists manyconditionsthat make a person higher risk for getting very sick from Covid, including obesity, diabetes, asthma or chronic lung disease as well as a compromised immune system, pregnancy and disability.Makary, appointed by Donald Trump, and Prasad are both vocal critics of pandemic-era policies and of the government’s response to Covid-19. The agency is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, which is now run byRobert F Kennedy Jr, a long-time vaccine skeptic who has been slashing the department as part of the White House’s effort to downsize the federal government.“Although the rapid development of multiple Covid-19 vaccines in 2020 represents a major scientific, medical, and regulatory accomplishment, the benefit of repeat dosing – particularly among low-risk persons who may have previously received multiple doses of Covid-19 vaccines, had multiple Covid-19 infections, or both – is uncertain,” Makary and Prasad wrote.“The American people, along with many health care providers, remain unconvinced.”The American universal access policy, they contend, was based on the assumption that “the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations” – a view they say the agency now explicitly rejects.Since becoming the country’s top health official in February, Kennedy has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government’s handling of Covid shots, including Makary and Prasad. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday’s policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.Health experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly Covid vaccination or whether they should be recommended only for people at increased risk.Prior to this announcement, the FDA had hinted that changes were coming. Last week, the agency granted approval of Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine but with restrictions that reflect its new guidelines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionMakary and Prasad said they expect the FDA will approve the boosters for adults over the age of 65 years “on the basis of immunogenicity” – whether the vaccine produces a robust antibody response. But for lower-risk groups, the FDA will now require what the authors describe as “robust, gold-standard data” from drugmakers before approval is granted.Critics say the new guidelines will limit access for people who want the booster, including parents and their children. And some experts have raised questions about how the new framework will be applied.“Is the pharmacist going to determine if you’re in a high-risk group?” asked Dr Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphiatoldthe Associated Press. “The only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.”In June, an influential panel of advisers to the CDC is scheduled to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.The FDA’s announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel’s job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that more than 47,000 Americans died from Covid-related causes last year. The virus was the underlying cause of two-thirds of those deaths and was a contributing factor for the rest. Among the dead were 231 children whose deaths were deemed Covid-related, 134 of them where the virus was the direct cause – numbers similar to yearly pediatric deaths from the flu.Explore more on these topicsUS newsCoronavirusVaccines and immunisationInfectious diseasesHealthTrump administrationRobert F Kennedy JrnewsShareReuse this content"

Of the 4,500 companies across nine countries, including the US, UK and China, surveyed by Allianz only 22% said they can absorb the increased costs.The unpredictability of US trade policy has also dented exporters’ confidence. The survey found 42% of exporting companies now anticipate turnover to decline between -2% and -10% over the next 12 months, compared to fewer than 5% before 2 April “liberation day” – when Trump unveiled his tariff policy.US treasury secretary says Walmart will ‘eat some of the tariffs’ after Trump demandRead moreThough Trump haspulled backon many of the levies he initially proposed, key tariffs remain in place, including a 10% universal tariff on all US imports, a 30% tariff on Chinese imports and extra tariffs on specific industries like metal and auto parts.Trump has insisted that tariffs will make America “very wealthy again”, though it appears that American companies and consumers are simply expecting to pay higher prices as the tariffs settle into place. In April, consumerexpectationsof inflation reached their highest point since 1981, according to the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research.Instead of immediately raising prices, which could deter customers, many companies have spent months trying to get ahead of Trump’s tariffs by stockpiling goods to temporarily circumvent them.Nearly eight out of 10 American companies said that they frontloaded shipments to China before Trump announced his tariffs, with 25% saying they had started to front-load before the November 2024 election.Inflation data from April showed that US price increases remained roughly level for the month. Economists say that it will take a while for tariff-related price increases to show up in data and companies have started to say they will pass some of the cost of tariffs onto consumers.“Given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure,” Doug McMillon, Walmart’s CEO,saidin an earnings call last week. “The higher tariffs will result in higher prices.”Toymaker Mattel also said that it would have to raise prices and that it would continue to manufacture its products outside of the US, “where [it] can be more efficient and more productive”, the company’s CEO, Ynon Kreiz,toldCNBC earlier this month.Which Trump tariffs are active, which are paused and what’s next?Read moreThe majority of companies (60%) in the report said they expect the tariffs to have a negative impact on their business, with less than half saying they expect positive export growth this year, down from 80% who had said the same at the beginning of the year.While many companies are holding out on price increases, relying on stockpiled inventory and hoping trade deals will be reached soon, companies will have to raise prices in the summer if a trade war continues.“Monthly business surveys … do indicate that companies will eventually pass on most of the tariff increases by the summer,” said Maxime Darmet, a senior economist at Allianz Trade.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsWalmartTrump administrationDonald TrumpTariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Since the transparency law took effect in July 2023, operators have fracked 1,114 sites across the state, but as of 1 May chemical disclosures have not been filed for 675 of them – more than 60% of the total, the analysis says.Chevron, the world’sthird-biggest fossil-fuel companyby market cap, is by far the most serious offender, operating about 375, or more than half, of the non-compliant wells.“We thought that the Colorado law was going to break through the culture of secrecy that surrounds the use of potentially toxic chemicals in oil and gas production,” said Dusty Horwitt, an attorney and researcher who was lead author on the analysis, which is based on public disclosures. “But the lack of compliance has left the secrecy in place, putting people’s health at risk.”The report, released Tuesday by the environmental groups Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), Physicians for Social Responsibility Colorado, FracTracker Alliance, and the Colorado Sierra Club, was shared exclusively with the Guardian.Oil industry funded Girl Scouts and British Museum to boost image, evidence suggestsRead moreIn a statement to the Guardian, Chevron spokesperson Paula Beasley said that Chevron is already disclosing all of its fracking fluid ingredients that are not trade secrets, and argued that the responsibility to disclose trade secret chemicals ultimately lies with ingredient suppliers, not with the companies who use them.In order to drill wells and extract minerals, fossil fuel operators pump huge volumes of pressurized liquid into the earth to fracture – or “frack” – bedrock, stimulating the release of trapped oil and gas. These fluids are mostly water and sand by volume, but they also contain industrial chemicals, including biocides, surfactants, and lubricants.Numerous studies show that these fluids can contain toxic chemicals like formaldehyde, as well as carcinogens such as PFAS – a broad class of chemicals that persist in the environment indefinitely – and benzene. This pollution can thenend up in aquifers, public waterways, and residents’ drinking water, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.John Spear, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Colorado School of Mines, compared fracking to emptying a syringe filled with mayonnaise into your thigh: it puts a whole bunch of material into a space that’s not equipped to handle it.“We’re putting things down there that are probably not meant to be digested by the subsurface,” said Spear, who testified about the need for fracking chemical transparency during the 2022 legislative session. “That becomes a potential problem, because if it doesn’t know how to handle it, it’s just going to move it around.”View image in fullscreenAn oilfield worker walks past an open door at a drill pad in Windsor, Colorado.Photograph: RJ Sangosti/Denver Post via Getty ImagesThe problem is especially acute for people who live near an oil or gas well, a scenario with well-established links toleukemia,birth abnormalitiesand other serious health outcomes. Secretive chemicals can make it difficult to provide adequate care for those individuals, said Elizabeth Gillespie, a hospitalist at Denver Health Medical Center and professor of medicine at University of Colorado Anschutz, who was recently elected to chair PSR Colorado’s board.“Not seeing that full list of chemicals and understanding the full extent of that exposure really makes us unable to take a complete medical history,” she said.Most major oil and gas producing states require operators to post information about their fracking chemicals toFracFocus, a nationwide disclosure database maintained by state-level environmental officials. But for years, fossil fuel companies have used trade secret claims to shield the full picture of their chemical use from scrutiny. In 2021, for instance, 88% of FracFocus disclosures used confidentiality to shield at least one proprietary ingredient from scrutiny – the so-called “Halliburton loophole”. Between 2014 and 2021, over 7bn lbs of these secret chemicals were pumped nationwide,accordingto a study in Environmental Pollution.Under the law passed in 2022, Colorado operators and their suppliers must now disclose all downhole chemical ingredients to the Energy and Carbon Management Commission (ECMC), the state oil and gas regulator, within 150 days. ECMC must then post the chemicals used on its website, though the exact proportion of ingredients in a given formulation can still remain secret. That year, in a separate bill, lawmakersbanned any use of PFAS at oil and gas sites.A 2022 report from Physicians for Social Responsibility found thatPFAS had been used for frackingin close to 300 wells in Colorado, though trade secret designations made a more complete analysis impossible.Revealed: Forecasts of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels soar in Trump’s first 100 daysRead moreThe new analysis shows that operators and their suppliers have broadly failed to comply with the new disclosure rules since they went into effect in July 2023. Between then and 1 May, 31 operators have fracked in Colorado, but ECMC has only posted information about trade secret chemicals for eleven of them. The other 20 operators and their suppliers have not complied at all, now nearly two years later.In comments to the Guardian, Chevron’s Beasley said: “Manufacturers and suppliers of [trade secret] chemicals are ultimately responsible for whether their formulations are disclosed – not operators.”Implementation does depend upon manufacturers sharing the ingredients in their formulations with their oil and gas customers, or with ECMC. However the agency’s industry guidance makes clear it sees both operators and chemical manufacturers as disclosers, whileassertingthat “the statute now requires disclosure of all chemical products used in downhole operations, regardless of if a discloser believes that a chemical constituent is a trade secret or proprietary information”.TheColorado code of regulationsalso requires chemical information to be provided to the commission “at least 30 days before the discloser begins selling, distributing, or using the chemical product”.Meanwhile, the disclosures that do exist appear to be incomplete, said report co-author Gary Allison, a FracTracker consulting data scientist who helped launch Open-FF, a website that provides additional insight into FracFocus data. When Horwitt and Allison compared the chemicals marked “trade secret” in FracFocus with the list of chemicals on ECMC’s website, they found numerous discrepancies. Among the eleven companies whose wells nominally complied with the rules, all of them had claimed secret chemicals to FracFocus that were not subsequently disclosed by the regulator.All this makes it impossible to say exactly what is being pumped underground. Environmentalists are concerned they don’t know if PFAS is still being used despite its ban on sites.In comments to the Guardian, ECMC said it was still working with industry to ensure compliance, citing operational changes at the agency and the difficulty of rolling out new rule changes.“We’ve implemented 17 mission-changing rule-makings in the past five years, which is an unprecedented degree of change in our agency’s 74-year history,” said ECMC spokesperson Kristin Kemp, in an emailed statement. “Nonetheless there’s more work to be done regarding the implementation and continuous assessment of the implementation. The paradigm shift in the state’s energy regulations can’t happen overnight.”But Carol Hawkins, a resident turned activist in Weld county, the epicenter of Colorado’s fracking industry, says the commission isn’t moving fast enough to protect public health.“We rush by these well pads on our way to work or to go up to the mountains or whatever it is we’re doing. And we don’t even realize the toxins pouring off those sites, because it’s invisible to the naked eye,” said Hawkins, who says her home in Ault is surrounded on three sides by nearby fracking sites. “It’s oil and gas in cahoots with our state government. We feel powerless.”Blown wellAn April incident underscores the importance of public transparency. On 6 April, a well at Chevron subsidiary Noble’s Bishop pad experienced a blowout during the course of normal operations. Over the next four days, it emitted a massive amount of oil, condensate, and wellbore fluid into the environment.According to informationpostedon Chevron’s website, 380 people coordinated on the response, including a contractor who was hospitalized as a result. The spill, which was roughly a mile from downtown Galeton, Colorado, caused an elementary school to be shut down for much of the month. Ultimately, Chevron recovered nearly 90,000 barrels of E & P waste – waste generated from drilling, fracking or production – that had sprayed out from the site, according to ECMC’swebpagedevoted to the incident.At that well, according to the Guardian’s analysis of FracFocus data, Chevron had pumped roughly 15,000 gallons of a trade secret chemical into the ground.View image in fullscreenWillow Creek following the blowout in April.Photograph: EPAWhile the eruption was ongoing, graduate students from Colorado State University’s Department of Atmospheric Science drove out to the area near Galeton to collect air pollution samples. On 8 April, two of them, Lena Low and Jared Stickney, roved out in the department’s research vehicle, a Chevy Tahoe outfitted with field sampling equipment.“You could see, even from a couple miles away, this giant plume of white gas spilling out up into the air,” Stickney said. When Low and Stickney were about a mile away from the geyser, they said the Tahoe’s real-time methane reading shot up – a sign they were in the chemical plume downwind from the exploding well. The smell grew so strong as they were trying to take an air sample that it became hard to breathe, they said.“The smell just quickly got worse,” said Low. “Just … your body telling you: ‘OK, stop breathing. This isn’t good for you.’”“When I breathed it in, my eyes started watering, I started coughing,” Stickney said.Even at the edge of the plume, a mile from the blowout site, subsequent analysis of the sample showed the carcinogen benzene at about 35 parts per billion, said Emily Fischer, a professor of atmospheric science at CSU.Anyone breathing that amount of benzene for an hour – say the plume settled over their house – would be exposed between four and 10 times beyond what common safety thresholds allow, Fischer said.The results also came back with elevated levels of hexane, toluene, and xylene. But because trade secret chemicals weren’t disclosed for the Bishop well pad, the students – and other nearby residents – can’t know exactly what else was in the toxic plume.“This just kind of proves that you need to be transparent about what you’re putting in those wells,” Stickley said. “Because when incidents like this happen, people don’t know what they’re breathing, they don’t know what’s going into the air. That’s a problem for the workers. That’s a problem for the local residents. It’s a problem for everybody.”Chevron said its own air quality testing had a different result.“Air monitoring continues in and around the area surrounding the site and the community, and all measurements that we have received from the laboratories have been below levels of concern,” said Beasley, Chevron’s spokesperson, in her statement. “Chevron cannot speculate on data that we have not received or reviewed.”The continued non-disclosure of secret chemicals in Colorado’s wells has become an even more urgent issue in the aftermath of the disaster blow out, said Barbara Donachy, an artist and environmental activist on the board of PSR Colorado.“A public health alert would have been different had they known all the chemicals that were in that well,” she said.But Donachy said ECMC hadn’t even created a publicly available website devoted to the disclosures until December 2024, after she filed a public records request.View image in fullscreenAn anti-fracking protester holds up a sign in Denver.Photograph: David Zalubowski/APAt the same time, Allison said it’s likely the topline figure in their analysis – at least 30m lbs of secret chemicals pumped since July 2023 – is just a partial picture of the total. Though the FracFocus database only features data on extraction fluid chemicals, Colorado law additionally mandates disclosure of chemicals used in drilling fluid – whichroutinely includes Pfas compoundsas a lubricant. As of this writing, ECMC has not posted any chemical disclosures related to drilling. ECMC did not answer the Guardian’s question about whether it believes that drilling fluids are also covered under the disclosure rules.Colorado operators have drilled at over 1,200 sites since December 2023, Allison said. The report calls this “woefully inadequate” compliance, and argues that ECMC must hold companies and their suppliers accountable. Under the 2022 law, ECMC can issue fines of between $200 and $15,000 a day for not complying with the chemical disclosure rules. At a conservative $200 per day, the non-compliant companies would have already racked up over $37m in fees, the analysis found – enough to pay the annual salaries of more than 500 Colorado teachers.Revealed: European ‘green’ investments hold billions in fossil fuel majorsRead moreIn its response to the Guardian, ECMC’s Kemp said “our staff first attempts to work cooperatively with operators”, though operators that remain non-compliant will face penalties.Colorado state representative Meg Froelich, who co-sponsored the 2022 legislation, expressed frustration at the slow pace of enforcement.“You put in the elbow grease, and you deploy community and advocates against a pretty powerful lobby,” she said. “It doesn’t feel good when they’re so easily able to just do whatever they want anyway.”Hawkins, who lives just a few miles from where the Bishop pad geyser erupted in Galeton, said she hoped that the incident would finally force ECMC to be more proactive. “If Galeton doesn’t get this state to do something,” she said, “what will?”Explore more on these topicsFrackingFossil fuelsEnergyOil and gas companiesOilGasnewsShareReuse this content"

The company made unilateral changes to the terms and conditions of employment “without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain” by using AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work, Sag-Aftra said. EpicGamesdid not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sag-Aftra called for a strike against major game companies in July after more than a year of negotiations around the union’s interactive media agreement broke down over concerns around the use of unregulated artificial intelligence. The strike is ongoing.In a statement, Sag-Aftra said the union supports the rights of members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas.“However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader’s iconic rhythm and tone in video games,” the union said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those people love karaoke so much that they want it in their family car.This was not something the European mind could comprehend a few years ago, according to Volkswagen’s chief financial officer, Arno Antlitz. Yet the technology, included in electric cars sold by China’s BYD and Xpeng, is just one example of the lessons that Volkswagen and its European counterparts have had to learn as they scramble to keep up with Chinese rivals on track to dominate the global electric car market.“Nobody in Wolfsburg thinks you need karaoke in the car,” said Antlitz last week at a conference run by the Financial Times. “But you do need it.”View image in fullscreenAn Xpeng G6 family SUV on a test in London.Photograph: Jasper Jolly/The GuardianA decade ago, such humility from the world’s second-largest carmaker would have been surprising. Few people in Europe had driven Chinese brands, which were associated with shoddy workmanship. The global industry was dominated by longer-standing car-making countries led by Germany, France and the UK in Europe, and Japan and South Korea in Asia. Yet the advent of batteries offered a clear run for Chinese manufacturers – with huge state subsidies – to try todominate the nascent electric vehicle industry.They have seized the opportunity. Chinese brands achieved more than 10% share of European battery EV sales in some months of 2024, according to data from Matthias Schmidt, an electric car analyst – although that fell back to 7.7% in February. But the scale of China’s home market is unrivalled, with 12.8m battery and hybrid cars sold in China in 2024 – more than the entirety of the European car market.China’s rapid progress took rivals by surprise, particularly after technological leaps during the years of coronavirus pandemic isolation.Bentley boss Frank-Steffen Wallisertold the FT conference that the technology presented to the world at the Shanghai motor show in 2023 “was kind of a shock coming back after the cold pause”.Chinese carmakers are increasingly racing towards a future in which the car is completely integrated with the rest of users’ digital lives and does most of the driving itself. Of the western carmakers, Tesla is still the leader on this front, but it ceded its technology lead to China’s BYD while its chief executive, Elon Musk, focused on getting Donald Trump elected as US president. Despite Musk’s support, Trump’s policies areexpected to leave America’s carmakers far behind.Chris McNally, an analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, wrote last week, in a note to clients, after visiting the latest Shanghai show, that “investors have yet to grasp just how far ahead China may be” when it comes to the future of the car. He cited the experience of sitting in massage seats in the Aito M8 luxury SUV, watching a film on a retractable projector screen while Huawei computer chips handled the driving. That was all available for half the price of a western luxury competitor.The global market share of the big three carmakers in each of Detroit, Germany and Japan has dropped from 74% to 60% in five years, McNally said. “If you are a US/EU manufacturer and do not have a plan to come to market with an affordable/scaled EV in next five years, you may be out of business in the 2030s.”He added: “Is the game lost for western manufacturers? We can only say they appear down big at an auto evolutionary half-time.”View image in fullscreenThe Shanghai motor show in April.Photograph: Go Nakamura/ReutersBYD’s Seagullhas ruffled featherswith a price of about £6,000 in China – far below any rival but with autonomous technology, dubbed “God’s Eye”, which matches that available on much more expensive cars. It has achieved that price by using heavier sodium ion batteries that sacrifice range for affordability, but it is still a stark illustration of what European manufacturers are up against.Chinese carmakers are on average able to develop cars at 27% of the cost of European rivals, according to analysis by Bain & Company, a consultancy.It is not just at the cut-price end. Chinese manufacturers were out in force at a test day last week run by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a UK lobby group. BYD’s new £33,300 Seal U DM-i, a plug-in hybrid family SUV, is going up against Volkswagen, whose plug-in hybrid Tiguan can be £10,000 more expensive.State-owned Chery (under the Omoda and Jaecoo brands) was accompanied by Leapmotor, Geely (owner of the Volvo, Polestar and Smart brands), and Xpeng – whose electric G6 was the first from the brand to make it to the UK. On a week’s test, the Guardian found a wealth of driver assistance features and a smart, spacious interior that rival the Tesla Model Y – even if some reviewers found the ride a little too bouncy.All of them offer keenly priced cars with little to separate them from European rivals, with relatively smooth rides and often impressive voice assistants that allow a driver to open the sunroof without taking their eyes off the road. One of the most popular vehicles for test was the ferociously quick MG Cyberster electric sports car, made by state-owned SAIC.There has been some sign of a fightback from Europe. The Renault 5, starting at £23,000, has already achieved huge popularity as one of the first affordable European-made electric cars. Renault has taken pains to cut the production cost of the vehicle as much as possible, and it has been rewarded with huge popularity – although it is unclear how profitable the model will be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe French carmaker has also sought to squeeze the time it takes to get new models to market, from 3.5 years for the Renault 5, down to three years for the next car, the Renault 4, and two years for the upcoming Twingo, with help from an unnamed Chinese partner.If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em appears to be a popular European strategy. Volkswagen has invested in Xpeng (or more properly, Xiaopeng), Stellantis is selling Leapmotor cars in Europe, and is expected to use its technology, while purportedly Scandinavian brands Volvo and Polestar will rely more and more on technology from their owner, China’s Geely.Britain’s JLR is working with Chery to make cheaper vehicles under the previously retired Land Rover Freelander brand. Those cars, due to launch late in 2026, “have the potential to go global”, according to JLR boss Adrian Mardell. Nissan boss Iván Espinosa suggested the Japanese carmaker couldbuild Chinese cars in Sunderland, north-east England, to use spare capacity.Even if they wanted to, avoiding Chinese tech is next to impossible for many companies: batteries are mostly made in China, with some competitors in Japan and South Korea. Europe’s battery champion, Northvolt, collapsed. Meanwhile, BYD revealed in March that its new batteries could add 250 miles of range in five minutes of charging, only forChinese rival CATLto say it could do more than 300 miles in the same amount of time. Shares in CATL jumped by 16% on their stock market debut in Hong Kong on Tuesday.Europe has some defensive strengths. There are huge networks of dealerships – still the preferred model of purchases – and garages who can carry out maintenance. That will slow down the advance of Chinese brands.“The European buyer is actually a very conservative buyer, very loyal to their car brands,” said Eric Zayer, who leads on automotive in Europe at Bain & Company. “It is very hard for the Chinese to enter Europe and replicate the success.”He added that buyers will need to be persuaded that Chinese brands are not going to disappear –as happened to US electric brand Fisker– causing chaos for owners of vehicles built with regular software updates in mind.European bosses insist that the game is not lost, even if it is clear that China is at the very least going to win a significant chunk of the global automotive market.Bentley’s Walliser said the “Chinese are better at risk taking, quicker, working harder” and embracing new technologies. “It’s not magic,” he said. “It could also be done here.”Luca de Meo, Renault’s chief executive, said: “We have to not underestimate the resilience of our automotive companies.”Explore more on these topicsChinaChinese economyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoringSelf-driving carsAutomotive industryAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bernardo Silva and Nico González, De Bruyne’s replacement after Mateo Kovacic was sent off, finished the job to move City up to third but the day was all about De Bruyne as he waved goodbye to the City home support, who will get a statue by which to remember him. He means a lot to fans and his impact on the club was shown by Pep Guardiola crying during the post‑match commemorations.De Bruyne started in his 421st appearance for the club with the captain’s armband, and was accompanied by his three children when he walked out of the tunnel to be greeted by a 60ft tifo depicting his image. This was his day but there was business to be done.It never seemed likely that the post-match lap of honour from De Bruyne would be anticlimatic. After failing to score in their past two matches, City’s duck was broken with a De Bruyne-esque rocket into the top corner. The firepower, however, was not provided by the Belgian but instead Marmoush, who used a pocket of space to his advantage, getting the ball out of his feet and smashing a shot that dipped and swerved, bringing gasps before igniting the atmosphere.View image in fullscreenOmar Marmoush opens the scoring with a wonderful strike worthy of his departing City teammate.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Neal Simpson/Apl/SportsphotoThe moment everyone had been waiting for came in the 25th minute when Marmoush burst down the left and slid a pass along the six‑yard line to De Bruyne to tap into an empty net. In his previous 141Premier Leaguehome games for City, he would have completed the task with eyes closed. On this occasion, his focus went for a split second and he somehow pinged the ball against the bar.De Bruyne walked away head in hands, knowing he would never receive a better chance for the perfect finish. “It was terrible, terrible,” De Bruyne said of the miss. “There are no excuses. My son is going to be very hard on me today.”Silva made up for the rare slip of the foot from De Bruyne to double the lead and City were in control from then on. The only time it was questioned came when Kovacic was dismissed for pulling back Evanilson but the one-man deficit lasted minutes because Lewis Cook saw red for a reckless challenge on González, who went on to score a fine solo goal.View image in fullscreenDe Bruyne is thrown in the air by his City teammates.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersThere was a notable return for Rodri off the bench – his first appearance since sustaining ligament damage in September – on a night of positives for City, not tainted by Daniel Jebbison’s late consolation.De Bruyne’s child and wife joined him for a guard of honour from colleagues and chants of: “There’s only oneKevin De Bruyne.” He was asked to say a few words in the centre circle but struggled to hold back his emotion as Guardiola shed a tear watching on.A video of former teammates, family and friends was shown to the crowd to moisten eyes. Like on the pitch throughout his time at City, De Bruyne was able to find his composure when it mattered. “It is time to say goodbye. We love you and I will see you soon,” he said.“Manchester is home. Manchester is where these little kids were born. I came here with my wife, Michele, to stay here for a long time. I didn’t expect to be here 10 years to do what we have as a club, supporters, my teammates. We won everything. We made the city, the club bigger.”View image in fullscreenRodri returns to the pitch eight months after injuring his ACL.Photograph: Neal Simpson/Getty Images/AllstarThe decade is coming to an end, De Bruyne leaves with six Premier League titles, one Champions League winner’s medal and supporters with a lifetime of memories. “It is a sad day, he will be missed, there is no doubt about that,” Guardiola said.The final act will come on Sunday at Fulham where he can give the next generation the best platform to repeat his feats. “It’s been unbelievable, to have the 10 years that I had. It’s been an unbelievable ride,” De Bruyne said. “I wanted to have fun and we had a lot of fun these 10 years.”No one inside the Etihad Stadium was arguing with him.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueKevin De BruyneManchester CityBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It’s his thumbs that let him down in the end. He could play through the thumb injuries – but allegedly not the urgeto send lewd text messagesto a staff member at the New York Jets, or the digital impulses that wouldtie him to allegationsover a $94m welfare scandal in his home state of Mississippi.“Are people in these positions above the law?” Rebecca Gitlitz wonders. “Have they been told so many times that whatever they do they can get away with it? Stuff like that, where history repeats itself, I wanted to see how that happens.”Gitlitz is the director ofThe Fall of Favre, the latest in Netflix’s series of sports documentaries, Untold. The episode retraces the good-time gunslinger’s arc from humble Mississippi beginnings to his NFL peak to the texting scandal that tarnished his reputation. Suffice to say: this is not one of those NFL Films-grade hagiographies that covers Favre in glory, or paints him as a God-fearingdaddy’s boywith the Dixie drawl who was firmly at his wife’s side forher much-publicized cancer fight. Nor does it linger on hisretirement ficklenessor hisdebatable influence on former understudy Aaron Rodgers, the NFL’s current drama king gunslinger.Absent are the typically effusive witnesses to the Favre mythos such as Mike Holmgren, the coach who won a Super Bowl with Favre in Green Bay. Instead, there’s Ron Wolf, the Packers GM who landed Favre in a landmark trade with Atlanta in 1992. (The Falcons buried Favre on the depth chart after drafting him in the second round in 1991.) Tellingly, Wolf characterizes Favre as his greatest scouting find, but is so solemn while reflecting on that career achievement that you can’t help wondering if some part of him regrets his role in creating what Favre would become.Peter King, the retired Sports Illustrated football writer who wasachingly closeto Favre in his heyday, also appears in the film and seems genuinely disappointed by the quarterback’s legacy. The Green Bay area journalists who saw the more unsavory sides of Favre on a regular basis, however, are more cynical. “There’s no [Packers] team owner, no one to answer to,” Gitlitz says of Favre’s entitlement in Green Bay. “There’s small town media. What the Packers experience did for him as a person is a seminal piece of this storytelling.”A striking appearance in the documentary is made by anotherNFLstar quarterback, Michael Vick. Both men are flawed – Vick, who is Black, went to prison for his part in a dogfighting ring – but the difference in the way America reacted to their respective rise and falls says a lot about who is forgiven in the United States.But the star interview is Jenn Sterger, the Jets presenter who claims the team terminated her after Favre – a splashy free-agent acquisition approaching the end of his career – allegedly sent her a flurry of unsolicited text messages, including a few that purported to show his penis. (Favre wasfound not to be in violation of the NFL’s personal conduct policy,but fined $50,000 anywayfor not cooperating with the league’s investigation.) Shockingly, Sterger reveals in the doc that she has never met Favre. “If that single statement was alarming to me, I felt like there’s got to be an awful lot here,” Gitlitz says. “So we went digging, and it was plentiful.”Brett Favre: how a scandal in Mississippi tarnished an NFL heroRead moreThe director is at pains to cast Sterger as collateral damage in the Favre legend. Though she first rose to fame for wearing skimpy clothes to college games, Sterger, who bears a striking resemblance to Favre’s wife, describes herself as an awkward theater nerd who had aspired to a career as a sideline reporter. (Hauntingly, her role model was Erin Andrews, the veteran sportscaster whowas covertly videotaped in her hotel room.)Sterger says her connection to Favre likely would have never come to light if she hadn’t made offhandedly mentioned the text allegations to former Deadspin editor AJ Daulerio years later. Daulerio, a dubious figurein his own right, swiftly betrayed her confidence for what turned out to bethe scoop of the year. Sterger believes someone in the Jets front office passed Favre her number, and is convinced that’s a crime. But because this all went down in the early-2010s, well before #MeToo, Sterger was pilloried in the tabloids and traditional media as a jezebel who sought to bring down the NFL’s golden boy. She was effectively blackballed from the profession. In the doc, she says Favre “destroyed my life”.Two Jets massage therapistssuing Favre for sexual harassmentafter the allegations of inappropriate messages to Sterger emerged didn’t much move the public. Tim Andre, the Jets intern supervisor inexplicably tapped to serve as Sterger’s bodyguard, spends much of the doc lamenting his inability to protect her. “I just felt like Jen deserved for her story to be told in an honest way,” Gitlitz says. “That was our goal for the film, to tell the honest story and let people decide for themselves how they want to feel about any one thing.”View image in fullscreenBrett Favre during his playing days with the Packers.Photograph: Morry Gash/APSterger might never have reemerged to address her chapter with Favre if it hadn’t been for a 2022 Mississippi welfare audit that alleged the quarterback had diverted $8m in funds to himself or to causes he championed – most notably the construction of a volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi, where his daughter was playing at the time. (Favre also played college football there.)In one text messagethat was published by Mississippi Today, he asked former governor Phil Bryant “if you were to pay me is there anyway [sic] the media can find out where it came from and how much?” It’s worth highlighting that Mississippi is the poorest state in the US.Although the welfare scandal wound up costing Favre lucrative endorsements, broadcast work and general credibility, he has never been charged with any wrongdoing over the allegations. What’s more, he has denied any wrongdoing throughout, suing anyone who would evensuggesthe had broken the law –not least the auditorwho conducted the welfare investigation for the state of Mississippi. (Meanwhile, Bryant pressured Mississippi Today to reveal its sources in a defamation lawsuit that was ultimately dismissed.)For Sterger though, the welfare scandal is a vindicating moment years in the making. “She said, ‘I told you all, and nobody listened to me,’” Gitlitz says. “She spent a lot of time talking to me about the people ofMississippithat had really suffered at the hands of the scandal. She felt like there were an awful lot of people who weren’t getting their stories told, and she felt solidarity with that.”Favre declined an invitation to participate in the documentary and even wrote back himself to say no – a development that is both surprising and not given his feeble resistance to keyboards. “He said, ‘Why are you making this? If I wanted to make a documentary myself, I could have,’” Gitlitz says. But even Favre would have to concede her documentary isn’t an all-out character assassination. Notably, it skips the chapters on the quarterback’s substance addictions and close associations withMark Chmura,Darren Sharperand other controversial characters. But those omissions don’t prevent the film from making the essential point: the Favre name still means something, whatever his troubles off the field.Gitlitz’s film closes with a scene from Favre’s appearance at a congressional committee hearing on welfare reform – where he unexpectedly revealed that he had beendiagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, dramatically shifting the focus from the fraud in Mississippi. One of the lawmakers on the dais nods at Favre’s gridiron greatness, and autograph seekers approach him afterward. It’s a perfect illustration of Favre’s inherent complexity, and why he endures as a classic protagonist. “It’s really fascinating how people mythologize their sports heroes,” Gitlitz says. “People tie these great memories to their sports heroes, and it’s so hard to disentangle the two.”The Fall of Favre is available to stream now on NetflixExplore more on these topicsNFLGreen Bay PackersNew York JetsUS sportsNetflixMississippiUS televisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The ball hit about two-thirds of the way up the 37ft wall, and Soto was only able to manage a single.Bronx backlash for Juan Soto as Mets’ $765m star booed on Yankee Stadium returnRead more“He thought he had it,” Mendoza told reporters after his team’s 3-1 loss. “But with the wind and all that, and in this ballpark – anywhere, but in particular in this one, with that wall right there – you’ve got to get out of the box. So, yeah, we’ll discuss that.”Soto stole second on the first pitch to the next batter, but the star ended up stranded on third. He denied lollygagging on the basepaths.“I think I’ve been hustling pretty hard,” he said. “If you see it today, you can tell.”Soto also attracted the ire of sections of the Mets fanbaseover a similar playduring their 8-2 loss to their cross-city rivals, the Yankees, on Sunday. In that game, Soto hit a ground ball up the middle and was slow out of the box before he was easily thrown out at first base by DJ LeMahieu in what may have been a close play if the slugger had moved at full speed.It’s not uncommon for balls hit off the Green Monster to result in singles: In the first inning, Pete Alonso was thrown out trying for second base on a ball off the left-field wall. But Soto had also failed to run hard out of the box on a groundout Sunday night at Yankee Stadium.“We’ll talk to him about it,” Mendoza said.Soto has got off to a mixed start since signing an MLB record contract 15-year, $765m contract with the Mets.He is slashing .246/.376/.439, below his career average of .283/.419/.528. However, his OPS of .815 is still second-best among qualified Mets and 47th overall in MLB.

They were in the Pret a Manger, they were in the Pizza Express, they were in the Wagamama, but mostly they were standing gawping at the destination board, which featured a baffling number of Vueling flights to Bilbao, a squeezing of the schedule that led to inevitable delays and confusion.The queue for the three open booths at passport control in Bilbao was a vast python of white shirts, speckled with the occasional tree green or purple. The bus into town was almost entirely Spurs, with a handful of businessmen and a bewildered older couple returning from their holidays, who admitted they had no idea their city was hosting a major European final.Postecoglou adamant work at Spurs is not done but sounds resigned to his fateRead moreIn fairness, it has not felt much like a major European final. This is 16th against 17th in the Premier League, a battle of two sides who have each won one of their past 10 league games. As such, it has been regarded as an indictment of the inequitable distribution of resources in the modern world and something from a Victorian freak show, simultaneously an English boot grinding its studs forever into the face of Europe and a bout between a blind bear and a pair of three-legged badgers. None of which is entirely unfair, and yet it is a major European final, as the mass migration of excited fans attests.That a final could comprise two such struggling teams is undeniably funny, but the game matters. For Tottenham, this could be a first trophy since 2008 and a first European trophy since 1984; for United, it could, inexplicably, be a third piece of silverware in successive seasons, and a seventh European trophy.Neither side will need reminding that their ostensibly more successful local rivals have won nothing this season.Almost more importantly in the remorselessly capitalistic environment of the modern game, victory on Wednesday would secure passage to next season’s Champions League, with all the financial benefits that will bring. It could rival the Championship playoff final as the most valuable game in English football. The way potential qualification for the Champions League has been touted as a means of salvaging dismal seasons is itself indicative of the way football has been financialised.View image in fullscreenSupporters, who have arrived en masse from Britain, gather at the fan park in Bilbao.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAA trophy may havemeant the world for Crystal Palaceon Saturday, but for at least some at United and Spurs (although not Ange Postecoglou, as he was determined to point out), the Europa League feels like a means to a more lucrative ends; winning silverware in order to generate the revenue that will allow them to generate more revenue. The game, as Danny Blanchflower nearly said, is about glory, it is about doing things in style and with a flourish, about going out and creating sustainable revenue streams for the future.When Postecoglou arrived at Tottenham, heseemed a natural fit. His attitude to the game had been shaped by Ferenc Puskas, who coached him at South Melbourne, and there was a stylistic congruence between Arthur Rowe’s Tottenham of the early 1950s, which established the push‑and-run style, and the ethos of Hungarian football in the same period.For all Postecoglou’s cussed insistence that the way he plays is the way he plays, Spurs’ best performances this season have been in away games when they have played in a style that would not be described as Angeball. When they beatManchester City 4-0 at the Etihad Stadium, it was by playing on the counter and controlling the game in the second half. The Europa League winsat Eintracht FrankfurtandBodø/ Glimtwere almost like tactical plans devised by José Mourinho, stifling their opponents and assuming superior quality or physicality would tell in the end.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tottenham have beaten United three times this season: twice with classic Angeball and once in a grim scrap when neither side played remotely well. Does he go with what workedat Old Trafford in the leagueandat home in the Carabao Cupor does he go with what has worked in Europe and opt for something more cautious?He may not have much option. Spurs do not have the natural advantage they had over Frankfurt and Bodø/Glimt, but neither are they likely to have their three most creative midfielders with James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski out and Lucas Bergvall a major doubt. That probably means Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur sitting with Pape Matar Sarr driving forward.It had looked as though Postecoglou’s team without a midfield would be facing Ruben Amorim’s team without a defence, although with Leny Yoro and Diogo Dalot back in training the injury situation at United is not as acute as it had appeared. If there is an explanation for the disparity in United’s European and domestic form this season, it is probably that the lower pace of theEuropa Leagueallows players such as Casemiro and Harry Maguire to play under less immediate physical pressure. The dilemma for Postecoglou, then, is how to press them without losing the defensive structure that saw Spurs through the past two rounds.Despite all the noise around it, the talk of finals of the undeserving and the economic rewards on offer, this is, almost despite itself, a major final. Somebody will win a trophy and whatever else that means it will be celebrated on the night and go down in posterity.

With one game left, United are in 16th on 39 points with a goal difference of -12, while Spurs are in 17th on 38 with a goal difference of 2.The Australian’s position at Tottenham is under scrutiny, with there being a strong sense that he will lose his role even if his side emerge victorious on Wednesday. Postecoglou fielded questions about this on Tuesday. Amorim was then asked why he is not under the same pressure.Postecoglou adamant work at Spurs is not done but sounds resigned to his fateRead more“I don’t know,” he said. “I know that in this kind of club, also Tottenham but especially Manchester United, it’s strange because you have some coaches here that lose games and are sacked. It’s hard to explain. People see what we are trying to do and see I’m thinking more about the club than myself.“People, especially the board, understand that we have a lot of issues that in the context are really hard. I don’t know how to explain [why] the fans like me at this moment. It’s hard to explain. I will try to prove myself to the fans, to the board, but I don’t have an explanation for you.”Amorim said he is not concerned about his job. “It’s a good thing for me – I never worry about that. That is a part of being a coach. And the most important thing, I know what I’m doing. I explained everything before we start, I explain about the storm [that would come].“I explain all the problems that we have to the board. I explained that I will not change my idea. So they cannot say one thing that I said to get the job and then I change my mind. It was the opposite. The board can understand that, the fans can understand that.”Asked how long it will take to turn United around, Amorim said: “It’s hard to speak about that because we need to be excited [about the final] and confident but we already know the problems. Tomorrow will be important for us and for our fans because winning can help us to have that strength to do every job we have to do. Tomorrow will be massive for us and our fans.”Amorim was asked if his 3-4-3 shape would allow him to drop Rasmus Højlund and field Bruno Fernandes as a false 9. Erik ten Hag, Amorim’s predecessor, did this when he guided United to their2-1 FA Cup final triumphover Manchester City last year.“Our system is the normal system that can change the characteristics. It’s not about playing as a striker or without a striker. It’s a system like any other where you can change the characteristics but it doesn’t matter what happened in the last final because it was a different team, different competition, different context, so everything was different.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What was also striking was Postecoglou’s suggestion that he was not ready to leave, believing his work at the club was far from finished.“I’ve said to the lads from day one that nothing is guaranteed in life, nothing is guaranteed in sport,” Postecoglou said.“You just need to try and make sure you take every opportunity before you. That’s what I have done my whole career. I’ve been in this position before where the big game was the last game I managed. It’s not unusual territory for me.“I have always navigated it pretty well because, for me, nothing is more important than my responsibility for this football club and its fans. Me, the players … our mind is only on one thing and that is to create something special.“I qualified for a World Cup [with Australia] and left. Iwon the treblewith Celticand left. I won at Brisbane and left. It’s more common than you think.”Postecoglou reacted spikily to the suggestion that his future would be decided by the Spurs hierarchy. “My future is assured,” he said. “I wouldn’t be the first person who changes job. We all change jobs. I am sure you’ve had more than one job.“I have got a beautiful family, I’ve got a great life. I’ll keep on winning trophies until I finish – wherever that is. Don’t worry about my future. My future is not intertwined with anything. My future is assured provided, God willing, my health remains, my beautiful family is beside me, my friends … there is nothing wrong with my future, mate. Don’t stress. Sleep easy tonight. I’ll be OK.”It has been possible to wonder whether Postecoglou might ride off into the sunset if he were to beat United, content he had achieved his ends at Spurs. He gave it short shrift. “No. Because I don’t think my job is done here. I really feel like we are building something and what a trophy does is hopefully accelerate that.“It is quite obvious with the challenges we’ve had this year, which are well chronicled, but there is some reasoning in the context of that. But also there has been some growth and I would like to see [that] through. Whether that happens or not is not that important right now, but I don’t think this job is finished, far from it. “I certainly feel there is some growth there, that we can take this club to where it needs to be.”Postecoglou said he had not felt the need to address the subject of what happens next in terms of himself with the players.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If this is Premier League season that has, in the view of its critics, featured far too little jeopardy, then this result mattered little but the evening will be remembered as the nightCrystal Palacebrought the FA Cup home.For the record, Palace were victors via two goals from Eddie Nketiah, a deflected free-kick and another Eberechi Eze strike. In truth, the main event did not arrive until after full time and the end of Selhurst Park’s 101-year wait toshow off a major trophy.David Squires on … moving scenes and mind games as Crystal Palace win the FA CupRead moreEagles supporters can now dream of next season’s European tour, the club’s first, with the hope and expectation the precise but emotionally charged leadership of Oliver Glasner will lead them into that promised land. As fans waited for a glimpse of the Cup, the Europa League anthem played over the PA system.Joel Ward, Palace’s longest-serving player of 13 years, had led the team out at kick-off, his 364th appearance. Here, at last, was the night denied to Palace fans in 1990 and 2016. Alan Pardew, player and manager in those losing finalist teams, was sat in the stands between former teammate Mark Bright and club chairman Steve Parish. Ward, emerging from the dressing room, eventually ran out to present the trophy to the Holmesdale Road Stand, before being given a farewell led by an emotional Parish.“I feel honoured and incredibly blessed,” Ward said. “There’s a belief in that changing room and I’m sure these lads will take this club forwards.”Of Wembley’s heroes, Dean Henderson played in goal, and Daniel Muñoz continued his raids down the right flank. Two January additions to “Oliver’s Army” in Ben Chilwell and Romain Esse, were handed firstPremier Leaguestarts. Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton, missing through concussion protocols, were hailed from the stands when joining the post-match festivities.“You always supported us, and that’s why we could write history,” Glasner told Eagles fans. They had implored him all evening to give them a wave.View image in fullscreenPalace fans hold up a cutout of Oliver Glasner as the FA Cup celebrations continued at the Wolves match.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It was a fantastic atmosphere,” he said, clearly unused to the traditions of English football support. “Everybody shouted my name and I didn’t know what they wanted and someone said I should wave. We always want everyone to have a great time at Selhurst Park and that they are happy.” Palace had also reached their highest Premier League points total.Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta, so important in beating Manchester City at Wembley, were among those given deserved rests until later. So too Daichi Kamada, faithful, trusted Glasner lieutenant.With Wolves safe for some weeks, their coach Vitor Pereira also played an experimental team, handing a first Premier League start for the defender, Nasser Djiga. Next season at Wolves is awaited with optimism even if their coach’s CV suggests he usually stays for a good time rather than a long time. “We offered gifts to them,” he said, unimpressed by his team’s performance.His defensive partner, Emmanuel Agbadou, scored Wolves’ 25th-minute opener, his neck muscles doing enough to power the ball inches over the line.That did nothing to quieten Palace fans. Within three minutes, Nketiah’s sharp finish drew the scores level. The south Londoner has been a slow burner but grasped his chance to shine with Muñoz and Ismaïla Sarr combining for his second. “Everyone was firing and we got the win,” said Nketiah, on reaching 50 career goals. “The unity between the fans and the players is amazing. It will be amazing to have European nights here.”View image in fullscreenEddie Nketiah scores his and Palace’s second goal against Wolves.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/ShutterstockWithin five minutes of the second half, Chilwell had scored his first Palace goal, his free-kick deflecting off Agbadou. Those in the Holmesdale Road Stand, shirts off now, paying little attention to the football, maintained their drum rhythm when Jørgen Strand Larsen scored a looping header. That proved the Norwegian’s last action; Matheus Cunha was thrown on. When a tearful Ward was substituted in the 71st minute, Selhurst Park stood as one. Parish could be seen wiping his eyes.As the players departed for their post-match lap of appreciation, Glasner and Ward, walking, talking together, got the loudest roar, Eze not far behind in appreciation. He had just shown that Wembley was no fluke – as if anyone could think that of one of English football’s best players.As Wolves threatened an equaliser, on came Eze. Soon enough, he was gliding through defenders with the grace that makes him both killer and stadium filler, giving the Wolves goalkeeper Dan Bentley no chance with a lovely, disguised finish. After that, Selhurst’s celebrations could truly begin.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian revealedlast weekthat the club were considering dropping out of the second tier and that the players had been left anxious, angry and feeling as if they were in a state of limbo awaiting a formal decision.The sad demise of Fortuna Sittard Women: ‘I hope the players find new clubs’Read moreIt is understood that WSL Football, the governing body of the WSL and WSL 2, is working with the Professional Footballers’ Association and Sporting Chance to support players and staff.In a statement posted on the club’s website, Rovers said the decision had come after a “comprehensive review of the evolving demands placed on second-tier clubs, which have become unsustainable under our current model”.The intention is still for the WSL 2 to operate with 12 teams next season, although any club joining the league will be required to meet the minimum standards. They are viewed as vital to the further professionalisation of the game as they protect the welfare of all participants and maintain competition integrity.Nikki Doucet, the WSL Football chief executive, said: “This is a sad day for women’s football and our hearts go out to the players, staff and fans at Blackburn Rovers FC Women affected by this decision to withdraw from the Women’s Super League 2. We have been working with the club all season to prevent this outcome and we are disappointed it has come to this.”Operating on what was understood to be a comparatively low playing budget, Rovers finished 10th last season, second from bottom, in the women’s second tier this term, five points clear of danger.The minimum requirements to take part in the renamed division (it was called the Championship in 2024-25) are being increased this summer in a bid to raise minimum standards for the players involved, with WSL 2 sides expected to essentially operate full‑time, professional teams.The list of criteria is believed to include requirements for clubs to commit to appointing a head of women’s football, marketing manager, head coach, assistant coach, physiotherapist or sports therapist, doctor, a strength and conditioning coach, a goalkeeping coach and several people in specific safeguarding and player-welfare roles within one month of the new season kicking off.WSL Football said in a statement: “In line with recommendations for the long-term future of women’s football, every club is asked to comply with the minimum standards as part of their membership of the leagues and a compliance and development review is carried out as standard ahead of each season and monitored throughout.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An FA spokesperson said: “We are in ongoing discussions with Blackburn regarding what level of the women’s football pyramid they can enter for next season, and a decision will be confirmed in due course.”Explore more on these topicsBlackburn Rovers LadiesWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Compensation with Lens for his staff remains to be agreed. Among others on Southampton’s list has been the Sheffield Wednesday manager and former Saints assistant, Danny Röhl, whom Spors knows from their time at RB Leipzig, though the pair did not work together directly.Saints looked into appointing Röhlafter sacking Russell Martinlast December.

We are working closely with Merseyside police and the Premier League to ensure the individuals responsible are identified and held accountable for their actions.

The Mali international had voiced frustration at the lack of an offer from Everton in recent weeks and is believed to have several options on the table, including from the Saudi Pro League. Leeds have also been linked with the former Watford midfielder.Doucouré moved to Everton from Vicarage Road for £20m almost five years ago and has made 165 appearances for the club, scoring 21 goals.

It may be that Feyi-Waboso’s return comes against a France XV on 21 June before the tour of Argentina.“He trained on the field with the team for elements of the session and did some modified training,” said Borthwick, who has convened a 33-man squad featuring 14 uncapped players with those selected by the Lions or potentially in action for Northampton and Bath this weekend omitted.“He was in team training and doing individual training. He looks really good. I was delighted to see him back on the grass. The medical teams are really pleased with his recovery. You get a sense from the player of how he’s feeling and there was a really positive energy off Manny.“The number of times I had to step in and pull him back because he wanted to do more … I had to go and stand on his wing and remind him. That’s a positive sign of where Manny is at. He’s a world-class player.”With Maro Itoje leading a Lions squad featuring 12 other England players, Borthwick must select a new captain for the two-Test tour of Argentina with a one-off match against the USA to follow. Jamie George – who wasstripped of the captaincyin January – and George Ford offer experienced options while Ben Curry and Fraser Dingwall are younger candidates who fulfil the role for their clubs.Borthwick identified second row as an area where he would like to add depth with Arthur Clark among the uncapped contingent while the props Afo Fasogbon and Asher Opoku-Fordjour – who has one cap to his name – are members of last summer’s World Cup winning under-20s side who have been promoted. Eight years ago, Eddie Jones handed debuts to Tom Curry and Sam Underhill on the tour of Argentina with 16 players named in Warren Gatland’s Lions squad and Borthwick is hoping to unearth his own gems for the 2027 World Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m looking forward to that.”Meanwhile, the former England full-back Mike Brown has announced he will retire at the end of the season with a parting shot at rugby’s authorities. Brown, who won 72 caps, will bring the curtain down on a 20-year career at the end of Leicester’s season.“Club owners, league executives, national and international governing body senior leadership – my hope is that you come together, think beyond the short term and make the bold, unselfish decisions needed to allow rugby to thrive once again,” he said. “We have a responsibility to protect and grow this incredible game so future generations can experience everything it has to offer – just as I have.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamBritish & Irish LionsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The hooker Curtis Langdon, the lock Alex Coles and the full-back James Ramm are all battling to overcome injuries, while management are also waiting to discover if the club captain, George Furbank, can feature in the matchday 23.Saints, who are already without Ollie Sleightholme, George Hendy, Juarno Augustus and Burger Odendaal, will be particularly stretched at hooker and in the back three should Langdon, Ramm and Furbank all be ruled out. Langdon has a shoulder problem, Ramm damaged a shinagainst Saracens last Saturdaywhile the similarly influential Coles has a knee injury. None of that trio could train on Tuesday.The Breakdown | Rare English double in Europe would be a dream result for PremiershipRead moreFurbank has barely played since breaking an arm against the Bulls in December and aggravated the injuryagainst Castres in their quarter-finallast month. The England full-back had a metal plate inserted in his forearm but has been experiencing discomfort since taking a heavy blow to the same arm when scoring a try in the Castres game.Northampton’s director of rugby, Phil Dowson, revealed Furbank had played a “limited” part in training but said a decision on his participation would be delayed until later in the week. “We’ve been down this road before with Furbs so I’m reticent to say ‘he’s great’ but he’s feeling good and we’ll make a decision after he’s trained on Thursday,” Dowson said.In the absence of Sleightholme and Hendy, there will be an obvious temptation to rush Furbank back on to the bench if possible, with Tommy Freeman potentially to start at full‑back if Ramm does not recover in time. If the combative Langdon is also ruled out, Saints may have to name the erstwhile Ealing reserve hooker Henry Walker among their replacements as they seek to lift the club game’s most prestigious trophy for the first time since 2000.Bordeaux, by contrast, are confident that winger Damian Penaud will be fit for the final. The 28-year-old, who has scored 12 tries in the tournament this season, was a doubt after limping off in the semi‑final win against Toulouse, but his ankle injury has responded well to treatment, according to his head coach, Yannick Bru.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Claudia Dickey, goalkeeper for Seattle Reign, has also received her first call-up to the national team.“First of all I think she’s deserving of the call-up. It’s the right moment to do it,” Hayes said of LaBonta said on Tuesday, adding that she thought Abello has been one of the most consistent performers for one of the NWSL’s best teams and that Dickey has been “the best performing goalkeeper in the NWSL this season.”‘July BBQ written all over it’: Do US Soccer’s new kits hit the mark?Read moreThere are also some notable absences from the squad.

On Sunday, theircomplaints to the refereeonly made their situation worse.That sentence was fairly easy for me to type, at least in part because it is rooted in the clearly visible.Inter Miamihavebeen terrible. Their complaints to the referee on Sundaydidmake their situation worse. These dynamics are not just surprising given Miami’s star-studded roster and record-setting performance last season, they are interesting. They are worth talking about and reacting to. They’re the sorts of things that get people thinking about the player, the team, the league, the sport. The more business-oriented among us may say they “drive engagement.”Yet in the immediate aftermath of Sunday’s game, one gets the impression that Major League Soccer wishes those dynamics didn’t exist at all.Inter Miami have lost five of their last seven with just one win in that span, and are disjointed in attack and completely adrift in defense; they have conceded an astonishing 20 goals in those seven games. Messi and Co have never been shy about letting referees have it, but they have taken their complaints to new levels these past two games as frustrations have mounted. Midweek against San Jose, Messinarrowly avoided a postmatch red cardafter confronting referee Joe Dickerson about his handling of proceedings. On Sunday, Messi’s mid-game complaints may have led directly to a goal at the other end.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

Gallese took a touch and, under pressure from Messi, picked up the ball. This drew protests from Messi, who believed Gallese had intentionally picked up a backpass – which should have yielded Miami a free-kick. The referee did nothing and play went on. Amid Messi’s protests, Gallese launched a sublime ball downfield to Luis Muriel, who took advantage of Miami’s chronically poor defending to make things 1-0 going into the break.Orlando were the better team in just about every respect and fully deserved their 3-0 win. But that first goal was important and frustrating enough for Inter Miami that the usually reticent Messi chose to speak to Apple TV’s Michele Giannone after the game, and decried the state of refereeing inMLSand that no-call specifically. Messi claimed referee Guido Gonzales Jr told him he was not aware of the backpass rule.“From there came their long pass and the goal,” Messi said. “Sometimes there are errors in critical moments. It happened in the last game, too. Those aren’t excuses, but there are always issues with referees and I think MLS has to look at some of the officiating.”This is tantalizing stuff from the most famous player in MLS history. It has driven headlines (including from this publication) that are as predictable as they are needed for a still-developing league like MLS. Remember, this is a competition that’s now in Year 3 of self-imposed exile from the major sports networks in favor of an (ever-softening) paywall on Apple TV. Getting attention for the league in the world’s most competitive sports market has never been easy, and in many respects it’s now harder than ever. Messi’s backpass complaint is dumb, but it seemingly came from frustration rather than malice, and it gets people talking. These kinds of stories – very famous athletes complaining about fairly trivial things – are part of what has transformed the NBA and NFL into multibillion dollar leagues. What’s not to like for MLS?A lot, apparently. MLS Wrap Up, the league-produced review show, mentioned the call in passing but never showed the incident on-screen. Host Kevin Egan said that Messi’s full interview would be available on league social channels, and indeed it was initially posted in full on the league’s Spanish-language X account. However, it was then deleted and reposted without Messi’s comments about refereeing included. That edit can be explained by the league’s policy against public criticism, for which several coaches and players have been fined in past referee-related rants.Less explainable is the fact that the officially distributed highlight of the goalhilariously startswith Muriel already bearing down on goal, finishing off the move a single second into the video. The replays afterward do not show the “backpass”, even as the commentators mention it repeatedly, and even as Messi, Jordi Alba, and Luis Suárez are shown remonstrating to the referee over the issue.Unlike the supposed backpass to Gallese, the intent in these actions is clear. And it doesn’t help anybody.Burying the play and Messi’s criticism does no service to fans, who ultimately just want a fuller understanding of the story regardless of whether they’re diehards or casuals. “Great team does badly” and “star player calls out controversial call” are two of the most reliable conversation-starters in fans’ group chats and online forums and even the occasional stateside sports bar. MLS is leaving all that on the table, for questionable benefit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s hard to do that when the primary source material is missing. With all due respect to Guardian contributor Joseph Lowery, I shouldn’t have to rely on his social media feed for footage of a prominent storyline involving one of the most famous people on the planet.How Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami struggles mirror his time with PSGRead moreMLS isn’t doing its own referee any favors either. To refuse to promote Messi’s criticism on their platforms is one thing, but to bury the call itself is to create the impression that the call is worth being buried. It isn’t. Reasonable people can disagree but, from what I can see, the vast majority of reactions by those who have seen the call agree with Gonzales’ assessment.There are understandable reasons why MLS wouldn’t want to lead the charge around debating a referee’s call. They need to appear to be a true neutral arbiter of the league’s rules and regulations, and to avoid encouraging the dismal abuse officials receive online and in person. This will always create moments of tension so long as the league continues to produce all of its game broadcasts and related analysis shows. That said, the league does produce a series called Instant Replay, in which it runs through various controversial calls from the previous matchday and analyzes whether they were correct or not. The series only appears on YouTube, but to its credit, this week’s editionleads offwith the Messi controversy.But in the moment, it seemed that MLS is trying to create the impression of sober proceduralism, of good clean games where winners win, losers lose, everyone has fun and nobody gets too mad. In fact, it is the chaos of the league that is its easiest and most enticing entry point, with referee controversy working just as well to drum up attention here as it does everywhere else in the world.Given time, new fans will eventually come to care about the league’s history, its players, and the glimpses of the sublime it can offer. But those fans need to get in the door in the first place. If it takes a frustrated superstar, a flailing superteam, and a mildly controversial call to get them to that point, then so be it.This piece was amended to include mention of the relevant episode of Instant Replay, which was published after this article was submitted.Explore more on these topicsInter MiamiLionel MessiMLSUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Few people in Europe had driven Chinese brands, which were associated with shoddy workmanship. The global industry was dominated by longer-standing car-making countries led by Germany, France and the UK in Europe, and Japan and South Korea in Asia. Yet the advent of batteries offered a clear run for Chinese manufacturers – with huge state subsidies – to try todominate the nascent electric vehicle industry.They have seized the opportunity. Chinese brands achieved more than 10% share of European battery EV sales in some months of 2024, according to data from Matthias Schmidt, an electric car analyst – although that fell back to 7.7% in February. But the scale of China’s home market is unrivalled, with 12.8m battery and hybrid cars sold in China in 2024 – more than the entirety of the European car market.China’s rapid progress took rivals by surprise, particularly after technological leaps during the years of coronavirus pandemic isolation.Bentley boss Frank-Steffen Wallisertold the FT conference that the technology presented to the world at the Shanghai motor show in 2023 “was kind of a shock coming back after the cold pause”.Chinese carmakers are increasingly racing towards a future in which the car is completely integrated with the rest of users’ digital lives and does most of the driving itself. Of the western carmakers, Tesla is still the leader on this front, but it ceded its technology lead to China’s BYD while its chief executive, Elon Musk, focused on getting Donald Trump elected as US president. Despite Musk’s support, Trump’s policies areexpected to leave America’s carmakers far behind.Chris McNally, an analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, wrote last week, in a note to clients, after visiting the latest Shanghai show, that “investors have yet to grasp just how far ahead China may be” when it comes to the future of the car. He cited the experience of sitting in massage seats in the Aito M8 luxury SUV, watching a film on a retractable projector screen while Huawei computer chips handled the driving. That was all available for half the price of a western luxury competitor.The global market share of the big three carmakers in each of Detroit, Germany and Japan has dropped from 74% to 60% in five years, McNally said. “If you are a US/EU manufacturer and do not have a plan to come to market with an affordable/scaled EV in next five years, you may be out of business in the 2030s.”He added: “Is the game lost for western manufacturers? We can only say they appear down big at an auto evolutionary half-time.”View image in fullscreenThe Shanghai motor show in April.Photograph: Go Nakamura/ReutersBYD’s Seagullhas ruffled featherswith a price of about £6,000 in China – far below any rival but with autonomous technology, dubbed “God’s Eye”, which matches that available on much more expensive cars. It has achieved that price by using heavier sodium ion batteries that sacrifice range for affordability, but it is still a stark illustration of what European manufacturers are up against.Chinese carmakers are on average able to develop cars at 27% of the cost of European rivals, according to analysis by Bain & Company, a consultancy.It is not just at the cut-price end. Chinese manufacturers were out in force at a test day last week run by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a UK lobby group. BYD’s new £33,300 Seal U DM-i, a plug-in hybrid family SUV, is going up against Volkswagen, whose plug-in hybrid Tiguan can be £10,000 more expensive.State-owned Chery (under the Omoda and Jaecoo brands) was accompanied by Leapmotor, Geely (owner of the Volvo, Polestar and Smart brands), and Xpeng – whose electric G6 was the first from the brand to make it to the UK. On a week’s test, the Guardian found a wealth of driver assistance features and a smart, spacious interior that rival the Tesla Model Y – even if some reviewers found the ride a little too bouncy.All of them offer keenly priced cars with little to separate them from European rivals, with relatively smooth rides and often impressive voice assistants that allow a driver to open the sunroof without taking their eyes off the road. One of the most popular vehicles for test was the ferociously quick MG Cyberster electric sports car, made by state-owned SAIC.There has been some sign of a fightback from Europe. The Renault 5, starting at £23,000, has already achieved huge popularity as one of the first affordable European-made electric cars. Renault has taken pains to cut the production cost of the vehicle as much as possible, and it has been rewarded with huge popularity – although it is unclear how profitable the model will be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Volkswagen has invested in Xpeng (or more properly, Xiaopeng), Stellantis is selling Leapmotor cars in Europe, and is expected to use its technology, while purportedly Scandinavian brands Volvo and Polestar will rely more and more on technology from their owner, China’s Geely.Britain’s JLR is working with Chery to make cheaper vehicles under the previously retired Land Rover Freelander brand. Those cars, due to launch late in 2026, “have the potential to go global”, according to JLR boss Adrian Mardell. Nissan boss Iván Espinosa suggested the Japanese carmaker couldbuild Chinese cars in Sunderland, north-east England, to use spare capacity.Even if they wanted to, avoiding Chinese tech is next to impossible for many companies: batteries are mostly made in China, with some competitors in Japan and South Korea. Europe’s battery champion, Northvolt, collapsed. Meanwhile, BYD revealed in March that its new batteries could add 250 miles of range in five minutes of charging, only forChinese rival CATLto say it could do more than 300 miles in the same amount of time. Shares in CATL jumped by 16% on their stock market debut in Hong Kong on Tuesday.Europe has some defensive strengths. There are huge networks of dealerships – still the preferred model of purchases – and garages who can carry out maintenance. That will slow down the advance of Chinese brands.“The European buyer is actually a very conservative buyer, very loyal to their car brands,” said Eric Zayer, who leads on automotive in Europe at Bain & Company. “It is very hard for the Chinese to enter Europe and replicate the success.”He added that buyers will need to be persuaded that Chinese brands are not going to disappear –as happened to US electric brand Fisker– causing chaos for owners of vehicles built with regular software updates in mind.European bosses insist that the game is not lost, even if it is clear that China is at the very least going to win a significant chunk of the global automotive market.Bentley’s Walliser said the “Chinese are better at risk taking, quicker, working harder” and embracing new technologies. “It’s not magic,” he said. “It could also be done here.”Luca de Meo, Renault’s chief executive, said: “We have to not underestimate the resilience of our automotive companies.”Explore more on these topicsChinaChinese economyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoringSelf-driving carsAutomotive industryAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Almost everything on the map can be destroyed, and there is immediate fun to be had from causing merry mayhem with your truck, clattering through deckchairs on the beach or driving straight through the middle of a diner and watching it collapse spectacularly behind you. But there is a void at the heart of this game where the core hook should have been.We get a glimpse of its potential during a mission that sees you racing to catch up with a rival’s delivery truck before it can reach its destination. The aim is to manoeuvre alongside, and hold down a button so the crane on the back of your own truck can sneakily lift the package off their vehicle and on to yours. All the while, rival trucks are attempting to ram you off the road, and after you grab the package, you then have to deliver it while fending off the attentions of these other drivers. It leads to some wonderfully comic scenes in which a hotel owner thanks you profusely for a consignment while standing in front of the ruins of his newly destroyed establishment: a casualty of the violent act of delivery.View image in fullscreenKeep on truckin’ … Deliver at All Costs.Photograph: KonamiThis one frantic mission is by far the best part of the game, and if the rest of Deliver at All Costs followed a similar path – a Crazy Taxi-style mad dash against the clock between pickup and delivery, with whole neighbourhoods razed in pursuit of logistical efficiency – then there would no doubt be a few more stars stuck to this review. Instead each mission varies wildly in content and quality. Some are passably enjoyable, including one that involves taking photos of a UFO while avoiding its laser beam. Others are simply dull, such as one in which you deliver balloons tied to the back of your truck, which intermittently cause it to rise into the air: more irritating than entertaining. Zany does not equal fun.If all of that kind of thing had been confined to side missions while the main game was about zipping parcels back and forth as quickly as possible, it might have worked. But these hit and miss escapades are all we get, and by the final third, the concept of delivering things is ditched completely. Instead Deliver at All Costs tells a dim-witted story through relentless dull cut scenes, with writing and acting that veer from passable to downright rotten. Protagonist Winston Green is a man with a murky past who ends up at loggerheads with his boss, Donovan, before the game jumps the shark entirely and veers off into po-faced sci-fi nonsense. It doesn’t help that the permanently angry Winston is one of the most unlikable video game protagonists ever created.As in Grand Theft Auto, you can hop out of your car and explore, but here there’s hardly anything to find, save for a few viewpoints (which are just that) and a tiny handful of side missions. These range from fun (race a parachutist down a mountain) to boring (find a man who looks like the mayor). There is the occasional unique car to discover, but as you have to use your delivery truck for most missions, doing so is largely pointless. The novelty of driving around in, say, a hot dog van wears off in seconds. There are crates full of cash to find too, but there’s little of note worth buying. The shop sells spare parts you can use to assemble gadgets for your truck, but apart from the boost-giving jet engine, they’re mostly superfluous.It’s all so frustrating. Deliver at All Costs offers up a beautiful destructible playground, then barely utilises it, instead focusing on a bizarre, half-baked story that somehow ends in a courtroom drama. It feels like being invited to a glittering champagne reception, then getting collared by a conspiracy theorist who insists on describing the plot of his hokey sci-fi novel for the next eight hours. What a criminal waste.Deliver at All Costs is out on 22 May, £24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

The court agreed with the ABA’sclaimthat the administration was retaliating against it for taking public stances against Donald Trump.But how had the US president retaliated? Which grants had he clawed back? Those supporting programs that train lawyers to defend victims of domestic and sexual violence.It was just one of Trump’s many acts of aggression against perceived enemies that just happen to – or quite deliberately – target women.During the 2016 presidential campaign, after the release of the “grab ’em by the pussy” tape,Vox’s Libby Nelson noted that there was something fundamentally different about Trump’s sexism from the sexism of his predecessors. “Usually, the critique of Republican candidates has been based on policy – healthcare access and abortion rights – or on attitudes heavily influenced by religion,” she wrote. But “Trump’s anti-feminism owes more to the gleeful vulgarity and implicit threats of violence of 4chan than the traditional debate over what a woman’s role should be in the public square.”Republicans are attacking childcare funding. Their goal? To push women out of the workforce | Moira DoneganRead moreTrump II is both a personal and a political misogynist – a chimera with the soul of a snake and the brains of a policy wonk, transplanted from the authors of the Heritage Foundation’sProject 2025.The widest target of Trump’s aggression is the universe of people capable of having babies. Four days after the inauguration, his administrationdirectedthe justice department’s civil rights division to cease enforcing the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (Face) Act, which prohibits harassment or blockage of patients entering abortion clinics. His administration dismissed three ongoing cases,pardoned23 convicted violators of the law, and limited future prosecutions to “cases presenting significant aggravating factors, such as death, serious bodily harm, or serious property damage”.In March, he beganwithholding tens of millionsof dollars from Title X, the only federal program supporting reproductive healthcare. The move was not explicitly anti-abortion – the Hyde Amendment banned federal funding for abortion 50 years ago – but it was surely aimed at pleasing religious fundamentalists who oppose all interference with “natural” baby-making. Lots of providers, including some Planned Parenthood affiliates, immediately collapsed, leaving millions of people with no family planning, cancer screening or prenatal services. Now, having failed repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood through legislation, Republicans are trying tohide the dirty deed in the budget. And like much of the “waste, fraud, and abuse” targeted by the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), these cuts would cost taxpayers far more than they would save: according to theCongressional Budget Office, the cost will be $300m over the next 10 years in unwanted births and shifts of reproductive services to other providers.Trump isn’t sparing mothers who want to be mothers, either. A week ago, funding to study maternal mortality was rescinded and most of the workers who monitor and improve maternal and child health at the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionwere placed on leave. The cuts came just after researchers at the National Institutes of Health published apaperdocumenting a huge rise in mothers’ deaths in childbirth or within a year afterward, most notably among Native American and Black women; the authors urged the government to make combatting these deaths “an urgent public health priority”.Where women’s bodies are now subject to harm by intentional neglect, they will also be more vulnerable to harm by violence. Before his inauguration, Trump called for the execution ofrapists. A few months later, the justice departmentsuspended grant applicationsfrom non-profits providing emergency shelter, legal assistance, and crisis services to victims of domestic and sexual violence under the Violence Against Women Act. The agencies were caught promoting “woke” agendas – evident from the word “gender”, as in “gender-based violence”, in their mission statements. Thegrant program appears to be back upon the justice department website, but no one knows for how long.In late April, the administrationzeroed out all fundingfor training, auditing, data collection and victim support under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (Prea), which Congress passed unanimously in 2003. Prea does not protect migrants in detention, but the Department of Homeland Security was nevertheless subject to oversight, and that included investigating sexual abuse by Ice employees. Not any more. In spite ofthousands of complaintsof sexual violence against detained women and children, the Trump administrationclosed the department’s three watchdog agencies, including the offices through which detainees could lodge complaints.Why is Maga-land so obsessed with Kai Trump turning 18? Do you really need to ask? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreAs part of its elimination of anything suggestive of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), the administrationhaltedthe military’s sexual assault prevention training. The defense department reported in 2023 that nearly a quarter of active-duty women were subject to sexual harassment – and they are just the ones who risked coming forward.The policies that smash the legal bulwarks against sexual violence and those that put pregnant people’s lives at risk make for the most compelling subject lines on fundraising emails from advocates for women, people of color and other legally protected classes hardest.But the disproportionate harm these folks are suffering from the decimation of the federal workforce by Doge is possibly most consequential, because it may not be reversible.Women and Black peopleare more likely to work in government jobs than in the private sector; a recent McKinseyanalysisfound that women, particularly women of color, are promoted at higher rates in public institutions than in private corporations. But government jobs also provide union representation, job security, pensions and other benefits that lift people of color into the middle class and allow them to accumulate the property and wealth denied them since slavery – benefits that do not accrue to home health aides, chambermaids and workers in the other low-paid, precarious occupations where women and people of color predominate.“For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,”vowedcandidate Trump at the Conservative Political Action Conference early in 2023. But it is Trump himself who feels most wronged and betrayed, with women – the pussy-hatted protesters who overran Washington on the second day of his first administration, the sex worker Stormy Daniels, who publicly poked fun at his self-celebrated endowment, the magazine writer E Jean Carroll, awardedtens of millionsof dollars in damages for his sexual assault and defamation – perhaps the greatest wrongdoers and traitors.Even Melaniais no longer pretending to like him.Like his woman-hating followers, this man, who has used his wealth and his body to impose his will on women, feels sorely victimized by them. Now he has more power than any other man in the world to exact his revenge.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn journalist and essayist, a contributing writer to the Intercept and the author of five books.

Just a few days after Fox aired its “isn’t Trump wild” guessing game,What Did I Miss, it was revealed that the TV producer Rob Worsoff has pitched the United States Department of Homeland Security on aseries premise he calls The American, which would give immigrants a chance to compete in a series of challenges for the prize of US citizenship. The actual process of winning citizenship is obviously too boring to film. Filling out an N-400 form? Snore. A written exam? I’d rather watch a dog eat grass. Skip all that and give us an obstacle course instead.People have stupid ideas all the time. My child thought it would be fun to squeeze lemon juice in his hot chocolate. He took one sip, almost barfed on the table, then begged me to order him another, lemon-less beverage. Stupid ideas are great, because most of them are harmless. “Oh, I ate a large bug off the ground. Whoops.” The only stupid ideas that are a problem are the ones where theactual government considerscosigning them. The DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin was asked by Time magazine what the status of Worsoff’s pitch was andresponded via emailthat it “has not received approval or rejection by staff”.Gotta really think this one through, I guess. Something like this must be thoroughly vetted by serious people.How cruel is this one, exactly? How desirable is the bloodthirsty demo for advertisers these days? Can we sell a presenting sponsorship? And is this for streaming or broadcast? Can we getChris Hardwickto host?These are all vital questions to consider before making a decision in show business.Trump’s border intimidation is coming for US citizens too – ask streamer Hasan Piker | Owen JonesRead moreSuch an idea would be eye-rollingly low-class in normal times, but as theTrump administrationattempts to ramp up deportations and to do away with the constitutional right of citizenship by birth (andfederal courts bravely fight back),this dumb concepttravels at warp speed to the dimension of the truly depraved. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services website takes great pains to describe the process of becoming an American as solemn and full of responsibility. Step 10 of the site’s “10 Steps to Naturalization” is “Understanding U.S. Citizenship”. It states: “Citizenship is the common thread that connects all Americans. Check out this list of some of the most important rights and responsibilities that all citizens – both Americans by birth and by choice – should exercise, honor, and respect.”Yes, but what if you had to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar first?To make his pitch even more appealing to the bigwigs in Washington, Worsoff suggested a few choice ideas for challenges that correspond to the most stereotypical aspects of life in America’s 50 states. A pizza-making contest for New York, a rocket-launching challenge for Florida, and a “gold rush challenge” for California. Nothing says “vital skills for living in 2025” like panning for gold in a pair of tattered Levi’s 501s. Perhaps Levi’s will sponsor the segment. Gosh, this thing pays for itself.But why stop there? Maybe a Breaking Bad-themed meth-making challenge for New Mexico. Polygamy challenge for Utah? How efficiently can you operate a turn-of-the-20th-century steel mill in Pennsylvania? Can you safely land a plane at Newark airport? For Washington state, you just have to answertrivia questions about Seattle inaccuracies in the sitcom Frasier. The possibilities for inanity are significant.In order to advance to the next round of this bottomless pit of human misery, contestants would be subjected to a vote, which Worsoff described as “like a presidential election”. Oh, how fun. Can you contest the results of that vote, too? Worsoff said in an CNN interview that his idea is “not like the Hunger Games”. Mostly because the costume budget isn’t as high.The Democratic opposition in Congress has, naturally, lined up to publicly condemn such a grotesque notion. The New York congressman Jerry Nadler said on X (formerly known as a useful platform for conversation) that “human lives are not game show props.”A nice sentiment, but I must be the bearer of bad news. Human lives have been game show props since the invention of the form. In 2005, Fox (why is it always Fox?) aired a reality show calledWho’s Your Daddy, where a woman had to guess which of eight men was her real father. If she guessed correctly, she’d win both an awkward conversation and $100,000. Presumably the cash prize would go directly to her therapy bills. Bravo’s Real Housewives franchise, while not a game show (the real winners are the viewers, I suppose) is a reality universe where womenfrequently abuse alcoholto the detriment of their own lives and the lives of others around them. If human lives are not props in these shows, are they even entertaining to the masses?An idea like The American, then, is the natural extension of the genre, taking someone’s desperation, fear, and overwhelming desire and squeezing all the drama possible out of it. Worsoff told CNN that he had pitched this idea to previous Democratic administrations, but weirdly, we never heard about it back then. It’s only now that such a concept feels enough in line with the zeitgeist of immigration paranoia that Worsoff felt emboldened to speak freely about it.He said: “I’m putting a face to immigration. This is a great celebration of America.” Yes, it is a celebration of America. Specifically our worst impulses: the desire to make everything a game and revel in the bread-and-circuses spectacle of life and death, but to cloak it in nobility and charity. Worsoff continued: “I’m very fortunate and lucky and honored to be an American. And I want everybody to understand the process.”At no point did I think that a pizza-making contest was part of the process.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS televisionUS television industryGame showsReality TVUS politicsUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

This has been heralded as the next step in the death of art and artists, joining the impending death – orzombification– of the writer, as AI-generated novels are slated toflood the market. But a peculiar feeling, or rather lack thereof, arises when trying to engage with AI art objects.It is not simply that AI lacks originality; after all, so too does most human art. The problem runs far deeper: the essence of art is lost in the process of its machinic invention and, with it, the very possibility of a democratic society is put under threat.Art is a defining human endeavor, not just for those formally called “artists” but for everyone. It is not merely about arranging colors, forms, sounds or words into pleasing products. The essence of art inheres in its making: the belief that, in the act of creating art, one imbues an object with something ineffable from within one’s own being. This belief, in turn, allows for another person to project their own sense of themselves onto the work and, in doing so, to commune with the artist at a level words cannot access.Art is not merely about arranging colors, forms, sounds or words into pleasing products. The essence of art inheres in its makingWhat grants art its infinite value is not the art object itself but rather what it allows by representing human experience and a singular being behind it: the way it is imagined to carry traces of an artist’s interiority, their unique feeling of being in the world. The process of making art is an act of transmission. It offers some unspeakable truth of oneself to another. In turn, the viewer finds in the artwork a reflection of their own inner sense, their inarticulable fears and desires. Art is a means of probing the gap between and within human beings through a shared but indirect language.But art also connects audiences with each other. When two strangers are struck by a work of art and each invests it with a sense of their innermost being – perhaps involving trauma, memory or impossible desires – they relate to one another at a level of intimacy and vulnerability that is otherwise inaccessible. The artist and the artwork function as a mediator, allowing for connection with others not as simply consumers but as fellow beings who, like each of us, feel themselves to be more than they can ever express. It’s why we watch films with lovers, paint murals with neighbors or read novels alone on rainy weekends.View image in fullscreenThe Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City over the Christmas holiday.Photograph: David Grossman/AlamyThe loss of this connectedness has profound consequences not only for our relationships but also for the broader social and political fabric. A democratic ethos depends on these ties: the recognition that, precisely because of our differences rather than in spite of them, we share fundamental aspects of being. Without shared experience that affirms and protects difference, the ties that hold democratic life together begin to fray. In their place emergehomogenizing substitutes– tribalism, homo- and transphobia, authoritarianism, fascist fantasies – that promise belonging through exclusion, hatred and violence.AI-generated images, music and prose disrupt the aesthetic dynamic upon which democracy depends. The machine does not desire, does not live in a body that imposes discomforts and misrecognitions, does not press against the limits of its own interiority. The work produced by machines is, in an important sense, uninhabited. There is no self – or rather, no being struggling andperpetually failingto be the ideal “self” it believes it should be – within the machine, and so there can be no transference or community with the other at the level of being.What remains is a kind of spectral mimicry, a simulacrum that may deceive the eye but not the soul. Or perhaps the problem is that, under the alienating conditions of contemporary capitalism, itdoesdeceive our increasingly fragile souls, causing them to wither by taking on the lifelessness of the machine as if interchangeable with our deepest truth.Machines are things that make other things. Under their expanding influence, we too risk becoming nothing more than another thing – a process of thingification by which we forget what it feels like to be human and to connect not just as employees, workers, consumers or citizens but as beings capable of feeling and being felt in return.The Guardian view on AI in art: a challenge that must be met | EditorialRead moreWalter Benjamin, in his 1935 essay The Work of Art in the Age of Technological Reproducibility, warned that fascism aestheticizes politics, offering the masses the illusion of expression while stripping them of material power. AI art functions in a parallel way: it offers the appearance of freedom and abundance while further consolidating control in the hands of those who own the means of production – not only of goods, but increasingly also of culture, imagination and language. AI is not democratizing art and knowledge; it is privatizing and automating it under the control of billionaires who, like the personality cults enforced by the führers of Benjamin’s era, demand that we view them as geniuses to whom we owe deference – and even, in the age ofChatGPTand social media, our very words and identities.Elon Musk, whose apparent public flirtations with Nazi ideology have become increasingly overt, exemplifies this dynamic. His AI ventures, like those of other tech billionaires, aim not at expanding human creativity but enclosing it within profit-driven, automated systems designed to concentrate power. For instance, since the Musk-backed xAI released its Grok chatbot and paired it with a deluge of AI-generated content across X, the effect has not been to foster creativity but to drown out dissent, amplify mimicry and disseminateMusk’s preferred political content. And, as we’ve seen at othermajor AI companiessuch asl Stability AI, Midjourney, and Deviant Art, users andartistsreport thattheir personal contentand work are being scraped without their consent to train all these AI models. The result is that artificial abundance suffocates human expression and connection rather than expanding or freeing it. Just as fascism turns the masses into spectators of their own subjugation, AI art transforms us from creative participants into passive consumers of algorithmic spectacle – all while falsely persuading us we’ve been empowered.In an era plagued by loneliness, alienation, and a thinning sense of the real, we should be wary of anything that further erodes our capacity for human connectionThe implications of this process for humanity and our political future could not be greater. The philosopher Immanuel Kant described the encounter with beauty – whether in art or nature – asa vital force that animateshuman perception, desire and community. Beauty, Kant argues, cannot be captured by words or concepts; it cannot be explained, only felt. What we feel in the encounter with beauty, then, is a breakdown of our capacities for understanding and representation, and the emergence in their place of a “feeling of life” itself that defines our very being. This feeling pushes us to seek out others with whom we can share this sense of ourselves as absolutely unique individuals who, like beauty, cannot be reduced to any possible representation or identity. By doing so, beauty provides an experience by which we connect with one another in and through our differences rather than in spite of them. Kant called this shared experience of beauty thesensus communis. It is what makes art a fundamentally social and political force. It is also what makes art essential for resisting our own thingification today – and why AI art constitutes, as Miyazaki has put it, “an insult to life itself”.Art both creates and relies upon a community of feeling, an unspoken understanding between people who may otherwise be separated by time, geography or circumstance. This led the famed political theorist of authoritarianismHannah Arendt, andElaine Scarryafter her, to identify Kant’ssensus communisand the cultivation of an openness to beauty as foundational to the possibility of democratic political life, and also fundamental to effective opposition to fascism. AI art cannot participate in this tradition; in fact, it militates against it.As AI art becomes ubiquitous, we are at a crossroads. Soul-diminishing substitutes for art, which reduce it to mere objects while erasing us as human subjects, threaten to destroy the social relations that real art sustains. Alternatively, they could spur us to reclaim art and aesthetic sensibility from their erosion under capitalism and to refuse the billionaire-controlled production of artificial culture.To do so, we must reject the temptation to turn to machines for art and language, and also – as people such as Mark Zuckerberghave been tryingto entice us to do – for friendship, psychotherapy, wisdom or critical thought. We must refuse to entwine our deepest sense of ourselves with illusory objects that exploit rather than enrich us.Should artists be terrified of AI replacing them?Read moreWhile AI art poisons the soul, real art-making is a form of caring for the soul, both our own and others’. Art has always been a way of revealing ourselves to one another – of ceaselessly generating new meaning in response to the impossibility of capturing feeling – and of honoring the distance and differences between each of us without erasing them. In an era plagued by loneliness, alienation and a thinning sense of the real, we should be wary of anything that further erodes our capacity for human connection.AI can generate images, manufacture compositions and feign a stylistic fingerprint. But it cannot reach toward the other and their otherness in order to affirm and nurture our own. And without that, there is no art – only the sterile echo of an absent maker serving vampiric billionaires consumed by a need for power in place of connection.Eric Reinhartis a political anthropologist, social psychiatrist and psychoanalytic clinician.

This pretty-sounding package of tax breaks and spending cuts is just the latest exampleTue 20 May 2025 07.52 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 11.15 EDTShareWhat’s big, beautiful and kept a lot of Republicans up late on Sunday night? There might be various responses to that question, but the answer I’m looking for isthe One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Coming in at 1,116 pages, the bill isn’t quite War and Peace but it’s definitely big. Whether the mega-package of tax breaks and spending cuts is beautiful, however, is up for debate.And there has certainly been a lot of debate. The bill has been in limbo for a while because a few Republicans who consider themselves “fiscally conservative” are happy with the package’s extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and increased spending for the military and immigration enforcement, but don’t think enough social and climate-related programmes have been slashed to pay for it all. In particular, they want deeper cuts to food stamps andMedicaid, which is a government programme providing health care to low-income people. Late on Sunday, however, in an unusual weekend vote, the hardliners relented a little and the House Budget Committeerevived the bill. It still faces some challenges, but it is now closer to becoming law.If you are in a masochistic mood you can read all 1,116 pages of the bill. But the TLDR is that a more accurate name for the package would be the Screw Poor People and Make the Rich Richer Act. Or the Kick Millions Off Medicaid So a Billionaire Can Buy Another Yacht Act. This isn’t to say that every single element of the package is bad. There is one part, for example, where children under eight are given $1,000 for “Money Accounts for Growth and Investment”, AKA“Maga” savings accounts. In general, though, it’s pretty on-brand for Republicans.The deceitful name is on-brand too. The right is very cunning when it comes to legislative framing: it loves hiding nasty intentions behind noble-sounding names that are difficult to argue with. Emotive words such as “protect” tend to come up a lot. If a bill has “protect” and “women” in its name, you can be sure it’s not about protecting women, but about bullying transgender people. The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025 (which wasblockedby Democrats in the Senate in March), for example, focused on banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. As the National Education Associationsaid at the time, however, it “does nothing to promote equity in resources, funding, or opportunity, or to tackle the sexual abuses of athletes and subsequent cover-ups that have occurred in women’s sports”.Another thing Republicans love to do is to pass entirely unnecessary bills with highly emotive names, in order to amplify misleading information. Take, for example, the rightwing lie (repeatedly amplified by Trump) that Democrats want to execute newborn babies. This is obviously nonsense – infanticide is very much illegal in the US – and is a willful misinterpretation of the fact that doctors may sometimes give palliative care to dying babies. This didn’t stop cynical lawmakers from coming up with theBorn-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act(a bill that has gone through a number ofiterationsbut was passed by House Republicans earlier this year) requiring doctors to provide care for children born alive during an attempted abortion. Again, there are already laws in place that cover this. The bill was completely unnecessary but it gave Republicans a great opportunity to conflate abortion and infanticide. “Tragically, House Democrats opposed the bill, voted for infanticide, and opted to deny medical care to crying newborns on operating tables struggling to live,”Republican House Speaker Mike Johnsonsaid after most Democrats voted against the legislation.Republicans have always understood how to use language to manipulate people far better than the Democrats. You may have forgotten the name Newt Gingrich but the former Republican House Speaker has been anintegral partin the rise of Trumpism and the current culture wars. Back in 1990 his political action committee distributed a pamphlet called “Language: A Key Mechanism of Control” that instructed Republican candidates to learn to “speak like Newt”. Gingrich was very keen on exploiting emotive language andsaying outlandish thingsthat would make headlines and get the media inadvertently amplifying a preferred narrative. The Republican party may now be full of toadies – but you can’t deny they’re all fluent in Newt.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So why is the league editing it out?Alexander AbnosThe world’s most famous player had some complaints about MLS referees, and the league helps nobody by burying themTue 20 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 10.03 EDTShareInter Miami, led by Lionel Messi,have been terrible lately. On Sunday, theircomplaints to the refereeonly made their situation worse.That sentence was fairly easy for me to type, at least in part because it is rooted in the clearly visible.Inter Miamihavebeen terrible. Their complaints to the referee on Sundaydidmake their situation worse. These dynamics are not just surprising given Miami’s star-studded roster and record-setting performance last season, they are interesting. They are worth talking about and reacting to. They’re the sorts of things that get people thinking about the player, the team, the league, the sport. The more business-oriented among us may say they “drive engagement.”Yet in the immediate aftermath of Sunday’s game, one gets the impression that Major League Soccer wishes those dynamics didn’t exist at all.Inter Miami have lost five of their last seven with just one win in that span, and are disjointed in attack and completely adrift in defense; they have conceded an astonishing 20 goals in those seven games. Messi and Co have never been shy about letting referees have it, but they have taken their complaints to new levels these past two games as frustrations have mounted. Midweek against San Jose, Messinarrowly avoided a postmatch red cardafter confronting referee Joe Dickerson about his handling of proceedings. On Sunday, Messi’s mid-game complaints may have led directly to a goal at the other end.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

Gallese took a touch and, under pressure from Messi, picked up the ball. This drew protests from Messi, who believed Gallese had intentionally picked up a backpass – which should have yielded Miami a free-kick. The referee did nothing and play went on. Amid Messi’s protests, Gallese launched a sublime ball downfield to Luis Muriel, who took advantage of Miami’s chronically poor defending to make things 1-0 going into the break.Orlando were the better team in just about every respect and fully deserved their 3-0 win. But that first goal was important and frustrating enough for Inter Miami that the usually reticent Messi chose to speak to Apple TV’s Michele Giannone after the game, and decried the state of refereeing inMLSand that no-call specifically. Messi claimed referee Guido Gonzales Jr told him he was not aware of the backpass rule.“From there came their long pass and the goal,” Messi said. “Sometimes there are errors in critical moments. It happened in the last game, too. Those aren’t excuses, but there are always issues with referees and I think MLS has to look at some of the officiating.”This is tantalizing stuff from the most famous player in MLS history. It has driven headlines (including from this publication) that are as predictable as they are needed for a still-developing league like MLS. Remember, this is a competition that’s now in Year 3 of self-imposed exile from the major sports networks in favor of an (ever-softening) paywall on Apple TV. Getting attention for the league in the world’s most competitive sports market has never been easy, and in many respects it’s now harder than ever. Messi’s backpass complaint is dumb, but it seemingly came from frustration rather than malice, and it gets people talking. These kinds of stories – very famous athletes complaining about fairly trivial things – are part of what has transformed the NBA and NFL into multibillion dollar leagues. What’s not to like for MLS?A lot, apparently. MLS Wrap Up, the league-produced review show, mentioned the call in passing but never showed the incident on-screen. Host Kevin Egan said that Messi’s full interview would be available on league social channels, and indeed it was initially posted in full on the league’s Spanish-language X account. However, it was then deleted and reposted without Messi’s comments about refereeing included. That edit can be explained by the league’s policy against public criticism, for which several coaches and players have been fined in past referee-related rants.Less explainable is the fact that the officially distributed highlight of the goalhilariously startswith Muriel already bearing down on goal, finishing off the move a single second into the video. The replays afterward do not show the “backpass”, even as the commentators mention it repeatedly, and even as Messi, Jordi Alba, and Luis Suárez are shown remonstrating to the referee over the issue.Unlike the supposed backpass to Gallese, the intent in these actions is clear. And it doesn’t help anybody.Burying the play and Messi’s criticism does no service to fans, who ultimately just want a fuller understanding of the story regardless of whether they’re diehards or casuals. “Great team does badly” and “star player calls out controversial call” are two of the most reliable conversation-starters in fans’ group chats and online forums and even the occasional stateside sports bar. MLS is leaving all that on the table, for questionable benefit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s hard to do that when the primary source material is missing. With all due respect to Guardian contributor Joseph Lowery, I shouldn’t have to rely on his social media feed for footage of a prominent storyline involving one of the most famous people on the planet.How Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami struggles mirror his time with PSGRead moreMLS isn’t doing its own referee any favors either. To refuse to promote Messi’s criticism on their platforms is one thing, but to bury the call itself is to create the impression that the call is worth being buried. It isn’t. Reasonable people can disagree but, from what I can see, the vast majority of reactions by those who have seen the call agree with Gonzales’ assessment.There are understandable reasons why MLS wouldn’t want to lead the charge around debating a referee’s call. They need to appear to be a true neutral arbiter of the league’s rules and regulations, and to avoid encouraging the dismal abuse officials receive online and in person. This will always create moments of tension so long as the league continues to produce all of its game broadcasts and related analysis shows. That said, the league does produce a series called Instant Replay, in which it runs through various controversial calls from the previous matchday and analyzes whether they were correct or not. The series only appears on YouTube, but to its credit, this week’s editionleads offwith the Messi controversy.But in the moment, it seemed that MLS is trying to create the impression of sober proceduralism, of good clean games where winners win, losers lose, everyone has fun and nobody gets too mad. In fact, it is the chaos of the league that is its easiest and most enticing entry point, with referee controversy working just as well to drum up attention here as it does everywhere else in the world.Given time, new fans will eventually come to care about the league’s history, its players, and the glimpses of the sublime it can offer. But those fans need to get in the door in the first place. If it takes a frustrated superstar, a flailing superteam, and a mildly controversial call to get them to that point, then so be it.This piece was amended to include mention of the relevant episode of Instant Replay, which was published after this article was submitted.Explore more on these topicsInter MiamiLionel MessiMLSUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

He canclamp migrants in foreign gulags, coerce white-shoe law firms into becoming hispro bono serfsand try to simplyerase the National Endowment for the Humanities, but he can’t rescind his harm to the economy. Trump canslash the National Weather Service, but he can’t stop the storm he’s whipped up. He’s shouting into the wind at his twister.No matter how much he might lower his draconian tariffs after his 90-day breathing spell, the velocity of damage is just building. It’s not a mistake that can be rectified. There’s no do-over. It’s not a golf game at one of his clubs where he gets endless mulligans and is declared the champion. Nor does Trump really want to draw back completely from his tariffs as if he never had proudly displayed his “Liberation Day” idiot board.When the Walmart CEO inevitably announced that prices would have to be raised as a result of Trump’s tariffs, Trump warned: “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!”Trump has falsely insisted that tariffs are levied on foreign importers. But Walmart demonstrated the indisputable fact that tariffs are price increases passed on to consumers. They are a tax. Trump is furious at the early indication of the renewed inflation and price rises that are coming. His natural response, of course, is an attempt at intimidation.The tariffs are a shakedown by which Trump could exercise his control over corporations that must scrape and bow before him, asking for targeted relief in exchange for, perhaps, payments to his personal political action committee, or, perhaps, throwing money into the kitty of his various financial endeavors, his crypto firm and meme-coin scheme. According to his wishful thinking, businesses should “eat the tariffs” to cover up his falsehood and maintain his popularity. For his sake, shut up and “eat” it. Trump is at war with the corporations’ bottom line.He can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but he can’t fool the bond market any of the time. When Moody’s Ratingsdowngraded the US credit rating, the Trump White House put out a statement attacking Moody’s “credibility” while blaming “Biden’s mess”. Moody’s reasons were an oblique criticism of Trump’s pending “big, beautiful bill” for massive regressive tax cuts in addition to his tariffs, which have led to the suspension of any further cuts in interest rates from the Federal Reserve.Blaming Biden, in any case, hasn’t been cutting it with public opinion. Only 21% of Americans attributed the state of the economy to Biden’s policies in apollin early April conducted by CBS News/YouGov. In Trump’s first hundred days alone, he denigrated Biden at least 580 times, according toNBC News. Trump sought to make him the scapegoat for his own policies. But the public is certain that Trump and nobody else owns the economy as he desperately tries to restore it to where Biden bequeathed it to him, with inflation and interest rates falling. And, now, very ill, Biden can no longer serve as a convenient target.Even if, after Trump’s 90-day pause on tariffs, he cuts them in half, the result will be devastating to small businesses, family farms and many large corporations. Nearly90%of American small businesses rely on imported goods. More than 20% of the US agricultural sector depends upon exporting its products, according to theUS Department of Agriculture. US manufacturers rely on imports for more than 20% of machinery, products and components. More than 41m American jobs are linked to imports and exports, one in five, according to theBusiness Roundtable. That does not include the multiplier effect of millions, if not tens of millions, of additional jobs created as a result.The supply chain has been severely distorted. For 12 hours on 9 May,zero cargo ships– none, not one – departed from China to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the two major US ports for Asian imported goods. The more than $906bn trucking industry, which had finally regained stability after the Covid disruption, faces another shock. “Trump trade war is wrecking hope for 2025 US trucking rebound,” reads the headline on a Reutersstory.The uncertainty factor that Trump has introduced has frozen all planning. The auto companies, among others, have given up issuing any guidance to investors. Their earnings are plunging, their suppliers in chaos. Nobody can predictably produce, order or hire, and so businesses are in a state of suspension. The prospect of a slowdown has already depressed oil prices to the point where it will soon not be profitable to drill at all. In April, Trump called critics of his tariffs “scoundrels and frauds”, but retailers do not know how to price goods, how much to raise them to sustain often razor-thin profit margins. They face a Hobson’s choice of pricing themselves out of their markets or absorbing the costs and going bust.The head of Trump’s council of economic advisers, Kevin Hassett, cheerfully announced on 12 April that he expected the gross domestic product to grow by 2% to 2.5% in the first quarter of this year. On 30 April, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that GDP had fallen by 0.3% in the quarter.Even after Trump agreed to drop his 145% tariff on China to 30%,Paul Krugman points outthat “we’re still looking at a shock to the economy seven or eight times as big as Smoot-Hawley, the previous poster child for destructive tariff policy”. Krugman states that on the optimistic lower end, “we’d expect Trump’s tariffsafterlast weekend’s retreat on China to cut overall US trade by roughly 50%. Trade with China, which would have been virtually eliminated with a 145% tariff rate, would fall by ‘only’ around 65% with a 30% tariff.”The result will be devastating, with rising inflation, higher unemployment, shortages, and lower growth and investment. In short, the economy will plunge into stagflation for the first time since the 1970s. Then, the phenomenon was the outcome of the Opec oil shock. This is the Trump shock, not the consequence of an external factor, but entirely self-induced through a delusion. Does he care? “Well,” Trump said, “maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”All of what’s coming was foreseeable. This is not a case in which unintended consequences suddenly emerged without advance warning, like in the 1970s. Here the red lights flashed; Trump raced through them.The uncertainty he’s injected is not a byproduct of happenstance. Uncertainty is the aspiring dictator’s pre-eminent prerogative. Trump resents any limitation on his ability to act however he wishes. The ultimate privilege of a dictator is to be at liberty to be impulsive. The more unpredictable he is, the more he is regarded as omnipotent.Trump has no real policies. There is no actual analysis, no expertise, no peer review. He brandishes atavistic symbols as primitive representations of his unrestrained power. Lowering or raising the tariffs are functionally equivalent if they are perceived as enhancing the perception of his potency. The merits are of no interest. Policies, such as they are, are measured by how well they gild his lily. The more unpredictable he is, the more he thinks of himself and thinks others think of him as almighty.For Trump, experience is meaningless. He never learns. Even his existential moments are forgotten, like his near-death from Covid. He deduces no lessons. It doesn’t inform his health policies, for example, which he’s turned over to oddballs and snake-oil salesmen led by the chief crank withroadkill in his freezerand a worm in his brain, Robert F Kennedy Jr.Trump’s learning curve is a hamster’s wheel. He goes ’round and ’round, repeating belligerent ignorance unaltered over decades. He’s the hamster who thinks he’s making progress if he receives attention. His solipsism is epistemological. Jared Kushner grasped its essence when hesurfed on Amazonto find the one discredited economist, Peter Navarro, to provide sham formulas to justify Trump’s preconceived tariff obsession.Trump’s psychological equilibrium requires the constant rejection of his responsibility for the abrasive reality he churns up. Confronting reality exacts fortitude, both politically and intellectually. He considers that a mug’s game he must resist. His inner fragility is shielded by projecting images of muscular strength, now AI generated videos and pictures of himself produced by the White House communications team as aJedi, aguitar hero(after Bruce Springsteen called him “treasonous”) and thePope(the new Pope Leo XIV does not much care for the social Darwinism of JD Vance).Meanwhile, there must be a conspiracy theory to deliver up a scapegoat. That opens the door of the Oval Office for malicious fabulists to whom Trump is particularly susceptible and finds useful as his instruments to terrorize even his own staff. Enter loony Laura Loomer as his virtual national security personnel director with a portfolio in hand identifyingsix officials on the national security councilto be purged, soon to be followed by the defenestration of the national security adviser Michael Waltz, who, rather than the thoroughly incompetent secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, served as the scapegoat for the Signal chat group that invited in Jeffrey Goldberg, editor of the Atlantic.A 9/11 truther, Loomer claimed the terrorist attack was “an inside job.” During the 2024 campaign, Trump brought her to the 9/11 memorial service. Loomer said that if Kamala Harris won the White House it “will smell of curry”. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right member of the House from Georgia, assailed Loomer as an “appalling and extremist racist”. “You don’t want to be Loomered,” Trump said. “If you’re Loomered, you’re in deep trouble. That’s the end of your career in a sense. Thanks, Laura.”Trump famously can’t accept the slightest criticism. He is armored against learning in any case. He is incapable of engaging in any self-examination for both emotional and cognitive reasons. It would betoo upsettingeven to contemplate. His whole being would become paralyzed if he were ever to suffer a bout of introspection. His system couldn’t tolerate it. His brittle peace of mind requires his fabricated self-image to be constantly apple-polished and worshipped.The split between Trump’s anxious need for his cosseted appearance and the terrible reality he’s making is his ultimate credibility gap. He must sustain a completely self-contained inner world or the walls start to close in.Information must therefore be suppressed. When the intelligence community assesses that the Tren de Aragua gang is not being manipulated by the Maduro regime of Venezuela, which is the invented excuse for Trump’s migrant round-up emergency, thenfire the intelligence analystsortell them to redo their report.When the Democrats in the House attempted to bring up a bill to remove Trump’s claim of a national security emergency for his tariffs – another mythical emergency –Republicans moved to block itin the rules committee. No vote, no debate. It’s a disappearing act.If the lying doesn’t work, try intimidation. That is the rhyme or reason behind Trump’s success in imposing his malignancy. But now he’s created a reality he can’t disguise or bully. The planets are hurdling into collision. He’s done it to himself by himself.The passage of his “Big Beautiful Bill”, with its extravaganttax cuts for the wealthyand deepcuts to Medicaid, wounding his white rural base, of which, depending on the county, are 25% to 40% dependent on the federal healthcare program, will spike the inflationary effect of his tariffs as well as the deficit. Republicans no longer uphold the pretense that their tax cut redistribution of wealth upward will actually lower the deficit by reducing revenue. Ronald Reagan’s supply-side economics claims, originally dubbed voodoo economics by George HW Bush, in fact proved Bush prescient. Reagan’s budget director, David Stockman, confessed that the supply side charade was a “Trojan horse” for lowering the upper rate and was just a “horse-and-sparrow” theory of “trickle down.” Thus, Trump’s potential legislative success will only deepen his crisis.Donald turns his lonely eyes to the Federal Reserve to bail him out, like his father, Fred Trump, who always arrived in the nick of time to rescue him from his messes. Trump lies in capital letters: “THE CONSENSUS OF ALMOST EVERYBODY IS THAT, ‘THE FED SHOULD CUT RATES SOONER, RATHER THAN LATER.” There is no such consensus. The consensus is to the contrary.Trump’s begging shifts to threats. If Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, doesn’t do what Trump says he will be turned into the scapegoat: “Too Late Powell, a man legendary for being Too Late, will probably blow it again – But who knows???”But Powell is imperturbable. “Higher real rates may also reflect the possibility that inflation could be more volatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s,” he said in his most measured tone on 15 May. “We may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks – a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks.”It’s not Powell who is “too late.” It’s Trump. As Evelyn Waugh wrote in his novel Decline and Fall: “Too late, old boy, too late. The saddest words in the English language.”Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of EarthThis article was amended on 20 May 2025 to refer to the pope as Leo XIV, not Leo IX.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationUS domestic policyUS foreign policyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Last week, a stunning parliamentary intervention was delivered by the Tory backbencher Kit Malthouse. In a question to Hamish Falconer, Labour’s Middle East minister, he noted that “it’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with theslaughter in Gaza”, adding that “crimes come daily”. Given Britain was signatory to various conventions imposing a “positive obligation to act to prevent genocide” and other crimes, Malthouse asked what advice the government had taken as to the liability of the prime minister, the foreign secretary, Falconer himself and previous ministers “when the reckoning comes”.The idea of a “reckoning” is clearly playing on the minds of western politicians. Perhaps it is even keeping them up at night. This week, Britain joined France and Canada indenouncing the sufferingin Gaza as “intolerable”, threatening an unspecified “concrete” response if Israel’s current onslaught into the Gaza Strip continues. Speaking in the Commons today, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, announced the UK wassuspending trade talkswith Israel, summoning its ambassador to the UK and imposing sanctions on a few extremist settlers. “The world is judging. History will judge them,” he said, in reference to Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.Lammy is right. But the problem for him is that this “judgment” will extend far beyond the direct perpetrators. It will also include Israel’s enablers.The foreign secretary might have announced his measures with great pomp and gravity, but they amounted to tokenistic nonsense. Even David Cameron tried to go further a year ago when he was foreign secretary, beforeabandoning plansto directly sanction two senior Israeli government ministers, the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, and the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. With the international criminal court havingissued arrest warrantsagainst the Israeli leadership six months ago, panic is clearly breaking out in government. And yet it is still not doing all it can to stop Israel. Just last week, the UK was in court defending Britain’scontinued exportof F-35 fighter jet parts that end up in Israel.This is about much more than just a failure to act now. It is about what led us to this moment. Keir Starmer, you see, once agreed that it was appropriate for Israel to impose a siege on Gaza cutting off power and water. (“I think that Israel does have that right. It is an ongoing situation.” He added: “Obviously, everything should be done within international law.”) He later claimed to have said no such thing, despite having said it. He thenpresided over an exodusof disgusted predominantly Muslim councillors – an adviser briefed that this was Labour “shaking off the fleas” – and took disciplinary action against pro-Palestine MPs. His government has suspended just 8% of arms deals to Israel under immense legal pressure, andapprovedmore military equipment in the three months that followed than had been approved by the Tories in the three years between 2020 and 2023. Nothing the government now does can scrub these facts from the coming reckoning.Another Tory MP, Edward Leigh, stood up last week, declaring himself a member of Conservative Friends of Israel “for over 40 years, longer than anyone here”. His question was direct: “When is genocide not genocide?” He has been joined by his Tory colleague Mark Pritchard, who noted he had backed Israel for 20 years “pretty much at all costs, quite frankly”. Withdrawing that support, he too alluded to the coming reckoning: “I’m really concerned that this is a moment in history when people look back, where we’ve got it wrong as a country.”The scale of that reckoning must be proportionate to the scale of the crime. A month into Israel’s onslaught – after which at least 5,139 civilians had been killed, according to conservative baseline figures by theNGO Airwars– the Economist publishedan editorialheadlined “Why Israel must fight on”. Amore recent offering, long after the territory has been essentially wiped from the Earth, is titled “The war in Gaza must end”. Or look at Rupert Murdoch’s Times. Usually a reliable supporter of Israel, it now runs opinionpiecesaskingwhy we are “closing our eyes to Gaza’s horror”.Is Britain breaking international law over Israel to avoid offending Trump? We may find out in court this week | Yasmine AhmedRead moreA truth is dawning: that this will be remembered as one of history’s great crimes. Right now, the UN warns that14,000 babiescould perish in the next 48 hours without aid. The Israeli opposition leader and former general Yair Golan – who earlier this yeardeclared, “We’d all like to wake up one spring morning and find that 7 million Palestinians who live between the sea and the river have simply disappeared” – now declares his country is “killing babiesas a hobby”.Still, Israel acts with impunity. Having imposed a total siege since the beginning of March, Netanyahu yesterday declared “minimal humanitarian aid” would be allowed in. Why? Not to alleviate Palestinian suffering, but because even zealous pro-Israel politicians “have warned that they cannot support us if images of mass starvation emerge”. A pinprick, in other words, for cosmetic purposes. Meanwhile,Smotrich declares: “We are disassembling Gaza, and leaving it as piles of rubble, with total destruction [which has] no precedent globally. And the world isn’t stopping us.” Zvi Sukkot, a parliamentarian in Smotrich’s party, boasts: “Everyone got used to the idea that you can kill 100 Gazans in one night … And nobody in the world cares.”On 24 October 2023, Iwrote a columnon these pages with the headline “Israel is clear about its intentions in Gaza – world leaders cannot plead ignorance of what is coming”. Why? Because Israel’s leaders and officials made devastatingly clear what they would do from day one.“As the calamity of Israel’s onslaught against Gaza becomes apparent, those who cheered it on will panic about reputational damage and plead their earlier ignorance,” I wrote. “Do not let them get away with it this time.” As the people of Gaza now prepare for the worst, being right has never felt so bitter. But it took no special insight or powers of prophecy, for here was a catastrophe foretold from the start.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Westminster is playing catch-upTue 20 May 2025 12.31 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 12.33 EDTShareLike a Hollywood studio churning out the umpteenth sequel in a stale franchise, Westminster has manufactured another episode in the interminable Brexit Wars saga. The Resetis based on the true story of a prime ministernegotiating improved terms of tradewith the EU, against a backdrop of global insecurity and rising economic uncertainty. Many familiar elements of the Brexit cinematic universe are represented: talks that go to the wire; French obstinacy; cries of betrayal from militant Eurosceptics; fish.We have been in this movie before, although each iteration is slightly different. The big plot twist this time is a Labour government that is prepared to say aloud that Brexit inflicted harm on the UK economy, and that closer relations with European neighbours are in the national interest.Keir Starmer hasn’t exactly torn up the old script. His Brussels deal quest has innovative features – defence and security partnership, energy market integration – but it doesn’t stray far from conventional Brexit lore. The substance is still confined to that narrow terrain where economic reality overlaps with domestic political acceptability.The action of The Reset takes place in that valley of magical thinking where frictionless commerce with the European single market is understood to be desirable, but talk of rejoining it is taboo.To his credit, the prime minister has nudged the dial a few notches. He accepts the logic that favourable terms of trade with a huge continental bloc require regulatory alignment, and that streamlining the process – restoring more automatic recognition of common standards – is not a dissolution of national sovereignty tantamount to treason.This is a battle Starmer is prepared to fight. He thinks most British people can tell the difference between eliminating costly paperwork on sausage exports and colonial submission. No one who isn’t already signed up to a Eurosceptic battle re-enactment society will be persuaded to join by the sound of their blood-curdling howls over the past 48 hours.Keir Starmer says ‘hat-trick of deals’ shows Britain is back on world stageRead moreKemi Badenoch was calling Monday’s gathering of EU leaders in London a “surrender summit” before there was even an agreement to denounce. Maybe she thought it sounded like the kind of thing Boris Johnson would say. She couldn’t have anticipated how far off the hinges Johnson hangs these days. He called Starmer “the orange ball-chewing manacled gimp of Brussels”.There is no sequel that could satisfy the hardcore Brexit Warscosplayers. They won and haven’t stopped pining for the struggle ever since. They are victors with no spoils. They cannot say the deal Johnson signed in 2020 is good, but since it gave them everything they wanted, they struggle to say how it might be improved if not by reversal.They accuse Starmer of selling out British fishing fleets when the terms he has agreed are just the existing ones on a longer lease. So the continuity leave argument seems to be that even more of Johnson’s Brexit is a reversal of Brexit. These arenot serious people.The same conclusion has to be drawn from the allergic reaction to talk of a youth mobility scheme. The proposal for a dedicated 18-30s work permit would look much like the model already available to young Australians, Canadians, New Zealanders and South Koreans. But in the paranoid Brexit mind,anymovement of European citizens to the UK – even if controlled with visas and limited by quotas – smells too much like the oldfreemovement.Failure (or, more likely, wilful refusal) to understand what is really being discussed here is dismal enough. The more dispiriting element is an inability to conceive of a world in which young British people might be grateful for an expanded right to travel and work on the continent.When European officials first raised the prospect of youth mobility withLabourministers, they pitched it as a mutual benefit – an obvious win-win. It was received instead as a demand, as if the privilege of living and working in Britain is a precious and exclusive mineral resource that Brussels wants to extract, and for which a price must be paid in concessions elsewhere.Even a Labour government, ostensibly committed to restoring closer ties, struggles to find a vocabulary of reciprocal advantage through continental integration.This is a conceptual barrier to wholehearted participation in the European project that dates back to well before the referendum. It is the plot ofBrexit Wars: Origin Stories–the sting of humiliation through post-imperial decline that made accession to the European Economic Community a necessity in 1973; the edifice of rebate and opt-outs that preserved a culture of transactional separateness; the evolution of conspiracist Europhobic mythologies in the press over many years and the cowardice of successive prime ministers in refusing to confront them.For decades, the facts to support an argument that Britain was stronger in the EU weresubmergedin a swamp of national neurosis – the inferiority complex manifest as self-aggrandising exceptionalism. They never rose to the surface when membership was on the ballot paper in 2016.Selling our sole? Brixham fishers divided on UK’s new EU dealRead moreInstead, leave and remain became proxies for other cultural and economic divisions that could never be settled by Brexit. Nine years later, they are still visible in election results and opinion polls, like a watermark in the post-referendum currency of party political allegiance.The Tories are in desperate trouble because Badenoch can’t compete with Reform UK to consolidate a Brexit-coded electoral coalition, and she won’t reach out to more liberal, centrist voters who feel more at home with the Liberal Democrats.Starmer’s position is stronger in terms of seats currently held but brittle in similar ways. Labour is struggling to reconcile its modern reliance on a remain-dominated voter base with a foundational and nostalgic idea of itself as the natural party of the former industrial working-class heartlands that voted leave.Those electoral faultlines track deep cultural scars, but they don’t have to disfigure politics for ever. Britain is on a more European trajectory as a matter of strategic necessity in a dangerous world. Donald Trump is anunreliable allyand Vladimir Putin is a determined foe. People can see that change in the geopolitical climate, even if the tone of Westminster debate, stuck on the old script, fails to respond with suitable urgency.Solidarity with our continental neighbours is a national mission that transcends the tedious, juvenile idiom of Brexit Wars fandom and the sniffing of treason in renewable fish quotas. Or we have to hope it is. This is the test of The Reset.It won’t be the last episode in a genre shaped by fantasy, but it could be the start of a new storyline where reality fights back.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July join Pippa Crerar, Raf Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government and plans for the next three yearsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What was less expected, perhaps, was its very dovish language in the accompanying statements, which represented a significant shift in tone since the board’s last meeting.Seven weeks ago, the RBA board sanctioned a grudging 25 basis point cut in interest rates and warned markets not to get ahead of themselves in anticipating more cuts this year. Inflation was coming down, but not enough, and it was still considered a flight risk. A great deal has changed since then on the international and domestic fronts.2:38House prices and Trump tariffs: what does the RBA's rate cut mean for you? – videoMost obviously, is the disruption caused by US president Donald Trump’s rollercoaster tariff ride and, in particular, “liberation day”, when the US hit every one of its trading partners – and even some uninhabited islands – with much higher than expected tariffs. Tariff retaliation from some countries followed, and a full-on trade war with China ensued. This series of events led to significantgrowth downgradesacross the world, including for Australia. Central banks also nervously watched selloffs in financial markets for signs of fragility.Only a week after liberation day, Trump announced a 90-day “pause” in tariffs for most countries, taking the rate back to 10%, with the exception of China. A few weeks later, tariffs on China were “paused” for 90 days, taking them from 145% to 30%. In other words, the ground is constantly shifting, and even a best-case scenario will result in higher tariff levels around the world than were the case in 2024.Cash rate cut to 3.85% amid lowering inflation but RBA boss warns global economy is ‘complete rollercoaster’Read moreRemarkably, financial markets seem to have interpreted this pause in the most optimistic way possible and have largely recovered from their April slump. But while traders may be thinking the worst is behind us, business and consumers are showing less of these animal spirits. Likewise, the RBA.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIn a statement accompanying the board’s decision, the RBA used the word “uncertainty” eight times, and in the updated statement on monetary policy, it appears 132 times. Uncertainty was also part of the conversation in February, as it has been since the start of the pandemic, but the May statement represents a big shift from the 71 appearances in February in size and, importantly, cause.In February, the uncertainty was centred on domestic factors – such as the labour market and wages – and risks to inflation. That uncertainty was playing out more in the minds of the RBA than it was in the population. Now, its source is an unpredictable US president and how his decisions may play out for the global economy over the coming year and beyond. As businesses review their hiring and investment plans, and as consumers consider their spending decisions, caution will be the dominant factor. And that has flowed into more cautious RBA forecasts on investment, growth and even employment at the margin.The RBA has also highlighted its concern about the uncertainty by modelling several possible trade scenarios, including one in which Australia faces a small recession. This is not the central case assumption, but the governor made clear in her post-decision press conference that the Reserve Bank is very alert to such possibilities.The change in the RBA view over the past seven weeks, from hawkish to dovish, even saw the board consider whether cutting by 50 basis points today could be justified.Amid discussion about the Trump trade chaos, it would have been easy to lose sight of the equally important and significant change in language around the outlook for inflation. The bank now believes we have put the inflation genie back in its bottle, and it has even nudged down its forecasts for the next two years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

RBA modelling suggests another three cuts (of 25 basis points each) would still be consistent with inflation remaining on target.But people looking for big rate cuts this year should be careful what they wish for.Careful management of monetary (and fiscal) policy may have lowered inflation without sacrificing employment, but Australia now faces “a new set of challenges” for which “there is no playbook”, according to the governor.It must seem to younger Australians that we are almost permanently in some sort of economic crisis these days. The global financial crisis, the pandemic-induced downturn and our inflation crisis, and now a breakdown in international rules on trade (and much more) are putting the global economy at risk once more.It is certainly the case that these shocks have very different causes than the typical ups and downs of past business cycles, and they are more difficult to manage.

Catching public transport would involve a train, a bus and a walk she can’t manage.So, having driven 90 minutes on a jam-packed freeway and conscious of the fuel cost, she had been circling the area for free parking.When it comes to the vulnerabilities of age, patients deserve sympathetic oversight, not turning a blind eye | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreAs usual, such parking was elusive and, by the time she found it, she was a 15-minute walk from the hospital entrance, from which it took a further 10 minutes to reach my clinic.Thus, her free parking had come at the cost of my time but, given the frequency of her visits, how could I blame her?Feeling chastised, I stopped by the parking payment machine later to check out the rates.The first 15 minutes are free, and the first hour thereafter is $11. But no one would bank on concluding any hospital visit within an hour from the time of parking, nudging the effective minimum fee to $21 for 2 hours. The daily and weekly “repeat” fees (allowing unlimited entry) are $32 and $72, respectively.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIt’s hardly consoling knowing that other hospitals charge as much as $60 a day and $110 for a weekly pass.Then, I came upon a doctor reasoning with security that if there was an automatic parking deduction from his salary, he should have access to staff parking. Instead, on some days, he was forced to use the visitors’ parking at visitors’ rates.It was expensive, the doctor said. The security guard was unmoved. “I don’t make the rules, mate.”Which got me thinking, who makes the rules, and why is hospital parking so expensive?Leave it to a couple of health economists toask the question that is on the mind of every hospital visitor.It turns out that, in the absence of a centralised policy, each hospital outsources parking or sets its own fees, claiming that the funds are funnelled back into patient services. Exhortations from the government to be fair to vulnerable patients have resulted in concessions that are variably applied and advertised.At many hospitals, concessions are available for concession card holders, which is means-tested. This excludes many patients and is costly for those who require frequent visits.For instance, a cancer patient might need to see a surgeon, oncologist, physiotherapist and nurse practitioner in one week. (These appointments could be consolidated but for the lack of administrative staff.)If the patient attends the chemotherapy unit most weeks, there are inevitable visits to emergency. Inpatient admissions are rarely brief, necessitating visits from relatives. Add to this various family meetings and it’s easy to see how quickly the parking bill rises.Discounts exist for patients receiving palliative care, dialysis or chemotherapy but it is often up to harried families to find out more. Admittedly, I can’t remember initiating a discussion about parking fees with any of my patients, who must be stung the hardest.But amid pressures on the cost of living it’s no wonder I am often writing (largely unsuccessful) letters to forgive the council fines of those who have overstayed street parking.Meanwhile, hospital parking is a multimillion-dollar business. New South Wales collectedmore than $51mfrom parking fees in 2024, andVictoria is not far behind. Hospitals don’t say how the funds are reinvested to benefit patients.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2017 half of all patients (10.9 million people)incurred an out-of-pocket costfor non-hospital Medicare services. Individuals pay for 15% of all healthcare expenditures, a greater proportion than in comparable systems including France, New Zealand and the UK.Easing the cost of parking would be a practical way of helping patients.I agree with the health economists’ suggestion of applying concessions based on need rather than income. That need could be informed by patient-centred thinking.For an agitated dementia patient, the cost to the hospital of providing free parking to a relative (and while we are at it, a comfortable armchair) would be significantly less, not to mention kinder than stationing an anonymous guard at the door and still relying on registered nurses to soothe patients and shepherd them back to their room when they resist.Relatives of dying patients shouldn’t have to base their decision on whether to stay or leave based on the parking fee. The same goes for the parents of sick children.The links between alcohol and cancer are clear, but most Australians are unaware of the risks | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreClose relatives of the chronically ill have enough to worry about without also needing to stress about parking fees, not to mention the eye-watering cost of the hospital’s ordinary food – a topic for another day.Recently, as I was leaving the hospital, a weary young man asked if he needed to validate a parking ticket. I enquired if the elderly relative by his side had a concession card.“Why does that matter?” he asked sceptically.“Because if you got your ticket stamped, it would reduce your parking cost to a flat $11,” I replied.He nodded gratefully.But the clock had struck 8pm and, while visitors were still leaving, the reception was shut.So I watched him count $29 and felt bad for giving him useful information the system made it impossible for him to use.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

The evidence shows we need different solutionsTue 20 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 12.24 EDTShareIt’s Saturday afternoon and my friend’s five-year-old daughter is lying next to me on her living room floor. She explains to me that she does this at school. She lies on her back with the rest of the class and they do something called the body scanner, where they all pay attention to various body parts in turn. I know she is describing a mindfulness exercise, because I’m a psychologist who researches mental-health lessons. I listen as she explains it all to me, but in my head I’m thinking something else: she shouldn’t be learning mindfulness at school.On the face of it, mental-health lessons in schools seemed like an excellent idea. Young people’s mental healthis worse nowthan it was in the past, and one-to-one treatment is hard to access. If you teach young people about mental health at school – which often includes teaching techniques based on therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or mindfulness – it’s more accessible. If you teach these concepts to everyone in a class – so-called universal interventions – you avoid missing the under-the-radar kids who aren’t seeking help, and avoid the potential stigma of singling anyone out. If you teach the information when pupils are young enough, even better: you might prevent mental-health problems from starting in the first place.At least, that was the idea. The reality is more sobering. Researchers have now run many studies testing the impact of universal school mental-health interventions and have found that they don’t really improve mental health. When improvements are found, they’resmall– a tiny average shift on a symptom questionnaire – and thequalityof the research is often poor, meaning it’s hard to trust the findings. The best-designed studiesshowthat interventionsdon’tworkat all:no improvementin mental health symptoms, either immediately after the course of lessons or later down the line.In fact, some studies have found that universal mental-health lessons actually make things worse. There are now high-quality studies showing that school lessons based onCBT,mindfulness,dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT)andgeneral mental-health awarenesslead to a small increase in symptoms of mental-health difficulties. There is evidence of other bad outcomes too, such asdecreased prosocial behaviourordecreased relationship qualitywith parents.It is not every study, but it isenoughthat we should take this seriously – not least because all schools in England are nowrequired to teachsomething about mental health. And these are the ones that have been tested: there are many, many interventions being sold to and taught in schools that haven’t been evaluated at all.I have nowreached the conclusionthat we should stop these all-class mental-health lessons. My view is that the only information we should teach en masse is where a young person should get help, both inside and outside school, if they’re struggling. That’s it. Then we should focus the time, energy and money on supporting the smaller group of young people who are actually unwell.I have not come to this conclusion lightly. Like so many others, I was once enthusiastic about the potential of the universal approach. It is a logical, intuitive idea that mental-health lessons in schools are a good idea, an obvious solution to an obvious need. But once you can accept the evidence, something surprising happens. It starts to become clear why all-class mental-health lessons don’t improve young people’s mental health, and why they were never going to.In any one classroom, young people vary enormously. For starters, the majority of them do not have mental-health problems. This means some pupils are being asked to engage in effortful practices at home – mindfulness meditation, CBT-based thinking exercises – when they are not struggling in the first place. When you ask them in qualitative studies, where they can convey openly what they think, some young people say such lessons areirrelevant to them, and they are right. Proponents of these lessons would say that the exercises are still worth learning, that positive effects may appear later down the line – but this is not supported by the evidence.At the other extreme, in every class there will be students who already have significant mental-health problems, and thus will need morethan what is on offer in universal lessons. They will need focused one-to-one support: therapy tailored to their specific challenges, built on a meaningful, trusting relationship with a qualified adult. Others will need changes in their external circumstances, not guidance about how to cope better in their own minds. For these students, mental-health lessons will be far too light touch, like being given plasters and paracetamol when they have a broken leg.Other students say that these lessons make them focus onnegative feelingsand memories, which thenupsets them. Others simply do not understand what they are being taught, and find the exercises confusing and stressful. We have very little understanding about how specific groups – such as neurodivergent children or those with language difficulties – experience these all-class lessons and whether they are able to correctly implement what they are being told to do.I won’t be taking exam leave to support my teens – just hovering, worrying and driving them mad | Zoe WilliamsRead moreAnother problem is that the classroom may not be the rightsettingto learn about mental health. Some young people feel socially secure at school and have good friends, but others are lonely or bullied. Many young people do not feel safe at school. In one study, several studentssaidthey didn’t want to do mindfulness meditation at school because they didn’t trust what their peers would do to them if they shut their eyes. Hearing this, it suddenly seemed obvious: without resolving these social challenges, the classroom is just not the right environment for a young person to do vulnerable work on their mental health.Importantly, this doesn’t mean there should be no mental-health support in schools. School is a logical, equitable place to provide help, and there isevidencethat one-to-one and small-group support in schools, given to those who need or want it, can work well, at least in the short term. But when it comes to all-class lessons, we should listen to the evidence, and to young people themselves. We came up with a good idea, we spent a lot of time and money testing it, and we have our answer. Given the evidence, we should now stop doing those lessons.The people running this research, and those making decisions to teach these lessons in schools, really want a solution to this crisis. We all want to figure out what to tell young people about mental health, and how to best help them when they are struggling. Against a backdrop of ever rising mental-health problems, and lack of affordable alternatives, I completely understand why it feels wrong – unethical even – to call a halt to these lessons.Yet it is also unethical to ignore evidence, and to continue delivering something that doesn’t work. At best, the universal lessons we have are a waste of time; at worst, they are harmful. The numbers tell us these lessons don’t improve mental health. The qualitative data tells us that many young people don’t like or want them. We need to listen.Dr Lucy Foulkes is an academic psychologist at the University of Oxford, where her group researches mental health and social development in adolescence.

Formez vos bataillons!Tue 20 May 2025 08.23 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 11.53 EDTShareTo Cannes, in the country of France, where last night Jeff Bezos’s fiancee, Lauren Sánchez, got what she deserves: a philanthropy award. Lauren was honoured at something called the Global Gift Gala, where she received the women empowerment award for her commitment to climate justice, social justice and coming off at absolutely all times as a woman who refers to her breasts as “my girls”. Regular readers will know I have ahugeamount of time for her. She accepted her gong wearing a necklace with a diamond pendant slightly larger than an Amazon warehouse, once again redrawing the blueprint that other humanitarians will simply need to watch and learn from.Meanwhile, if there were awards for hen nights – or bachelorette parties, in the American style – then Lauren would surely have taken one for her full-scale invasion of Paris last weekend, after French forces withdrew and declared the city open. Hand on heart, I initially assumed Lauren was the new US ambassador to France, but then remembered that state department randos were probably seated in some windy overspill gazebo for Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, while Lauren had pride of place ahead of the actual cabinet as part of Oligarchs’ Row. Plus, having just Googled, I discover the Senate yesterdayconfirmedTrump’s pick for the ambassador to France – his own son-in-law’s former jailbird dad.So this was very much a private visit to Paris for premarital pleasure on Lauren’s behalf, a mood later reflected in her official Instagram communique to attendees and her 930,000 followers. “To my girls … thank you for surprising me, lifting me up, and reminding me how much I needed this moment.” Remember, Lauren dresses everything in this same flattened palette of solipsism: a spa day,a space trip, a humanitarian award, new swimwear.Anyway, attendees for the hen weekend included fellow astronaut Katy Perry, the two most prestigious Kardashians – Kim and materfamilias Kris Jenner – as well as Eva Longoria, who travelled onward to Cannes to present Lauren with last night’s humanitarian award. If you’re wondering which of the party goes back furthest with Lauren, I wouldn’t waste your time. Typically, celebrities do not have old friends. They regard it as a moral failing and a sign that you don’t really want the big time enough.View image in fullscreenLauren Sánchez with her fiance, Jeff Bezos, in Santa Monica, California in April 2025.Photograph: CraSH/imageSPACE/REX/ShutterstockAs for what was worn during the Paris festivities, the dress code wasn’t specifically themed as Marie Antoinette – necklines did plunge deep, in the late 18th-century style, but hemlines had been guillotined somewhere near the Kármán line. One pharmaceutical billionaire’s wife sported a vintage bronze-effect Issey Miyake breastplate recently purchased at auction for $54,000 (the girl brunch equivalent ofthat timeNicolas Cage outbid everyone for a stolen T-rex skull).Activities over the weekend included posting diligently toInstagram, the platform owned by fellow Oligarchs’ Row occupant Mark Zuckerberg, all while making sure to tag in their travelling makeup artists, hairstylists and lesser support-retinue members. There was also an ostentatiously open-top boat ride down the Seine, where I think the ladies went to view the floating corpse of a trend once known as “quiet luxury”.In truth, it must be said, those curated and filtered Insta photos of the attendees looked startlingly different to the candid ones snapped by Parisian street photographers as they left the various venues. Had you shown some of the faces in the latter snaps to the average person 40 years ago, they would have assumed something awful must have happened to the women. Luckily, our eyes have grown accustomed after decades of Botox, fillers and extreme “work” going mainstream, so we don’t notice the weirdness and read it instead as maximum hotness. Thank you, progress!All in all, the entire special Parisian operation has served to heighten interest in the forthcoming Bezos and Sánchez nuptials, which are due to take place inVeniceat the end of next month, after extensive lobbying by local Italian politicians for it to be chosen as the host city/organism. Venice’s mayor informed the Times that “we were in competition with other places but we won out”. As one Venetian official put it: “It’s going to be on par with a G7.” Truly, the fairytale. And if you happen to be visiting Venice as a tourist over the same dates, you should probably know that Lauren and Jeff already “booked every water taxi in the city”.In terms of securing other things, Lauren has become quite the expert in acquiring trophies – and I’m not talking about Jeff. This women empowerment award is far from Lauren’s only humanitarian award in the past year or so. She and Jeff also picked up Conservation International’s global visionary award, while madam alone somehow beat out the competition to win a humanity award from a charity called This Is About Humanity. Look, I don’t pretend to understand the precise economics of throwing hugely glitzy charity galas to give climate awards to individuals who right at this moment are staying in Cannes aboard their megayacht, a vessel that emitsmore than 7,000 tonnes of CO2 a yearand is so large it requires its ownsupport yachtto trail around after it, carrying simple amenities such as the helicopter pad and some kind of personal submarine. I don’t think normies CAN understand these things. Our role is to simply admire them.Even so, perhaps I’m not alone in feeling that it is becoming harder and harder work. In fact, the choice of Italy as host for the Bezos-Sánchez nuptials feels almost too on the nose. A few centuries ago, the super-rich of that country kicked off the Renaissance, commissioning a vast array of jewels of the visual arts. Our modern-day power players simply give us Instagram or red-carpet pictures.

Get ready for a new kind of actionTue 20 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 10.22 EDTShareOn 21 April 2019, I was on Waterloo Bridge in London with my younger siblings. Around us were planters full of flowers where there were once cars, and people singing. This was the spring iteration ofExtinction Rebellion, when four bridges in London were held by protesters. My siblings, then 14, had been going out on school strike inspired by Greta Thunberg, and wanted to see her speak.We were there for less than a day, but the occupations of bridges and other blockades lasted for 11 days. Tens of thousands of people mobilised in the UK that spring.An estimated 500,000 peoplewere affected by the shutdowns the movement imposed on central London’s road networks, and more than 1,000 protesters were arrested in what was then an official part of XR’s strategy.The movement won some impressive victories. Its first demand, “tell the truth”, was essentially honoured when theUK became the first country in the world to officially declare a climate emergency, days after the April rebellion ended. The movement also galvanised a sense of urgency among the public.Polling data foundthat after the April actions 24% of people ranked climate crisis among their top issues, which placed it roughly on par with immigration and the economy, up significantly from three months before the protests.In 2025, however, the sense of urgency has receded. The public’s main concerns when polled are the economy, immigration and health. And mass mobilisations around climate breakdown appear to have stopped. At the same time, it’s not as though climate breakdown has been solved. So where has all the energy gone?According to Douglas Rogers, who was an organiser with XR between 2018 and 2021, the beginning of the pandemic was an inflection point. He says things “were slowing down already” as the movement struggled for funds. Rogers and others were hoping to invest time back in local groups which could each experiment with new strategies, before erupting back to the surface once more.But there were tensions. One major point of disagreement was over the Canning Town action in London – where protesters attempted to disrupt public transport – and the degree to which aggressive disruption was useful. But soon none of this would matter. The virus and lockdown forced a total demobilisation of society, which was devastating for a movement based on mass mobilisation.Some of XR’s leadership formed new outfits taking an approach that could be achieved with smaller numbers of committed activists. Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil did riskier direct action, that sometimes danced along the edge of legality. These actions made them world famous; the New York Times ran multiple articles on the group, the long-running sitcomIt’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia parodied their tactics.View image in fullscreenAn Extinction Rebellion protest in front of the Bank of England calling on the insurance industry to stop insuring fossil fuel, 28 October 2024.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesThis success was not without its downsides for the climate movement. The British state began toadapt its legislation to contain dissentfrom climate protesters – such as making it a criminal offence to have gear that could allow you to “lock on” to a piece of infrastructure. It is now a world leader in the repression of climate activists, and has used the new anti-protest laws on other groups, like those that contest Britain’s involvement in the genocide in Palestine.In addition to the new legislation, the new approach of theJust Stop Oilhardcore proved too much for less committed activists. Graeme Hayes, a reader in political sociology at Aston University, tells me that these movements are “running out of activists who think three years in prison is a reasonable outcome”. Hayes adds that the increased use of conspiracy charging allows the Crown Prosecution Service and the police to target not just those who carry out a particular direct action, but those who help plan them too.Although XR no longer embraces tacticslike smashing windowsand prioritises “attendance over arrests”, it has moved towards targeted non-violent actions by small groups against specific targets such as insurance firms that underwrite the fossil-fuel industry. The mass protest era is unlikely to return, as public energy is absorbed by Palestine protests, and the coalition of groups and people that helped make the original actions so big no longer agree on strategy.New reports tell us cattle and sheep farming can be sustainable – don’t believe them, it’s all bull | George MonbiotRead moreXR’s relative shrinking over the years has led to a fragmentation in the wider climate movement as various alumni move on to new projects. During our chat, Rogers repeatedly uses the adjective “post-XR” to describe various local initiatives. In Scotland, where Rogers is based, the energy is in Climate Camp, which organises periodic protest camps at sites of fossil-fuel infrastructure. The mass movement of low-engagement protesters has given way to subgroups of committed activists. In the conversations I had with activists for this piece, the sense I got was that this was partly so as not to derail momentum from mass Palestine protests while they were regularly occurring, and partly because there is not yet a strategy for how a new mass climate movement would try to achieve its goals.Others such as XR co-founder Gail Bradbrook are trying to apply the principles ofDeep Adaptationandcollapsology– in short, forms of collective apocalypse prepping. Projects such as Cooperation Hull, Just Collapse and Lifehouse are trying to build the networks, local democratic cultures and social infrastructure that would enable communities to navigate societal collapse without descending into barbarism. These efforts either rest on the assumption that radical climate action won’t happen or are an exercise in bet-hedging in case it doesn’t. There is also, at the most radical fringes of climate action, an embrace of sabotage in the fight against climate crisis, though this appears confined to very small groups.Hayes and Rogers both talked about the end of a “protest cycle”. The end of this cycle has many causes, from the exhaustion of activists to the growing repression of protest by the UK government and the growth of other movements organising against the cost-of-living crisis and the genocide in Gaza. But XR succeeded in bringing hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions internationally, into climate activism and the myriad of smaller – sometimes more radical – groups that emerged in its wake owe much to its mass mobilisations. Climate breakdown continues to worsen and evidence of itsimpact on the cost of livingandconnection to imperial violenceis becoming more obvious. XR began with a small campaign and exploded into what it became. Someone, somewhere is probably laying the ground for the future of climate politics – the question then is what form will the next surge take?Oliver Haynes is a journalist and co-host of the Flep24 podcastDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Until he is forced to face reality, there is no hope of ending the bloodshedTue 20 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 11.47 EDTShareAfter more than three years of stalled diplomacy, the past few days have brought a flurry of activity in the Russia-Ukraine peace process – sadly none of it with any meaningful progress.The much-anticipated Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul – billed as the first serious negotiations since 2022 – came and went with little more than symbolic fanfare. The subsequenttwo-hour phone callbetween Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on Monday concluded with Trump appearing to withdraw from mediating the peace talks altogether. Once again, the Russian president got what he wanted without even showing up to a meeting thathe himself requested.Trump’s statement that“the conditions for [the peace] will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be”sounded like the opposite of hisboast last yearthat only he could end this war, and in a single day at that. Even more jarring was Trump’s emphasis on the economic opportunities that Russia offers – tone-deaf, given the scale of Russian atrocities, and a slap in the face to the US’s European allies.If Trump is indeed stepping back from his self-appointed role as mediator, as his press release suggested, that would be a welcome shift from his earlier efforts toforce Ukraine into a deal on Russia’s terms. Any move away from that is a move in Ukraine’s favour. Ukraine can and should holds its own in negotiations with Russia.At the same time, anybody hoping for successful direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations should temper their expectations. Putin has no interest in genuine negotiations, and likely never will. He has repeatedly refused to meet Zelenskyy – not because there’s no agenda, but because acknowledging Ukraine’s leader would mean recognising Ukraine’s sovereignty. In Putin’s imperial worldview,Ukraineisn’t a country and therefore cannot have a legitimate government. This from a man whose own political legitimacy is propped up by ballot stuffing and electoral spectacle rivalling the Bolshoi theatre.Scholars of international conflict often describe war and negotiation astwo sides of the same coin. War is, in essence, a costly information-gathering process. It reveals and establishes the ground truth – each side’s capabilities – which helps to identify the range of peace deals that both sides might prefer to continued fighting. The key to getting an upper hand in peace negotiations, therefore, is to use the battlefield to demonstrate your capacity to win, thereby compelling the other side to cut their losses and make concessions at the negotiating table.But after three years of war, it is Russia – not Ukraine – that has been confronted by the limits of its power. The so-called “second most powerful army in the world” has failed to achieve its strategic objectives.Since January,Russia’s territorial advances have amounted a handful of fields and abandoned villages, totalling under 1,000 sq km.Andits economy is crumblingunder the weight of sanctions and mobilisation. After the failure of his original plan of “take Kyiv in three days”, Putin’s plan B appears to amount to speaking with confidence and hoping for luck.Ukraine, by contrast, has proved to be stronger and more resilient than many expected. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has forged an impressive international coalition. Ukraine successfully withstood Russia’s initial assault, recovered key territory and stabilised much of the frontline. Its performance on the battlefield has shifted perceptions of its strength and bolstered its negotiating position.Yet Russia continues to cling to its maximalist demands of demilitarisation, sweeping territorial concessions and regime change. Putin refuses to revise his war aims in light of battlefield evidence. He continues to demand territories he is unable to take by force, as if he can make them his by simply claiming they are his. So, what is he doing?To understand the Russian leader’s logic, we need to first understand the domestic political context in which he operates. Unlike a democratically elected leader, Putin facesno real checksfrom domestic institutions or the public. His only political constraint is the inner circle of elites who keep him in power –military and conservative figureswith an imperialist worldview. To them, Ukraine is not just any territory to be divided in proportion to battlefield success. Rather, it is a coveted prize, central to restoring Russia’s lost greatness. Civilian casualties and economic pain are secondary concerns. Concessions, in this worldview, are not just unnecessary – they are unthinkable. As Russia’s chief negotiator in Istanbul, Vladimir Medinsky,told the Ukrainian delegation: “[Russia] fought with Sweden for 21 years.” The message is that Putin is prepared to wait.But he’s hoping he won’t have to wait 21 years. The hope is to get lucky. Putin’s grievances have found fertile ground in Donald Trump and his inner circle. The Russian president is only too happy to lead them along, and they fall for the same trick again and again.The media often portrays Putin as a master strategist, but that is not exactly right. His war strategy hasn’t evolved since the failed blitz on Kyiv. He demands the moon, then lashes out when it is not delivered. What he is, however, is a master manipulator. He believes that if he cannot take Ukrainian territory by force, he can secure it through narrative – by convincing sympathetic voices in the west that Russia deserves it anyway.From Crimea to the Minsk agreements, from Syria to Chechnya, Putin has built his legacy on making up facts on the ground and daring the world to challenge them. Why would he stop now?He won’t – not until he can no longer afford the lead to make the bullets. But Ukraine has demonstrated that it can hold its own. If the goal is to stop the bloodshed, the only way forward is to force Russia to face reality rather than manufacturing its own.Olga Chyzh researches political violence and repressive regimes.

If it’s good enough our fellow Europeans, why not Britons?Tue 20 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 12.47 EDTShareOne Sunday last September, I sat at a table outside one of Lyon’s famous traditional “bouchon” restaurants, eating a sumptuous prix-fixe lunch, as the heavens opened and a small monsoon pounded the cobbles around me and the parasol above my head. The waiter asked if I wanted to move inside. I demurred; as long as my andouillette and I were still largely dry, I was enjoying the people-watching and the view of the pretty, sand-coloured buildings too much to worry about a few stray drops. If a bit of rain didn’t put me and my fellow diners off, why should many parts of the infamously cloudy UK be so opposed to the notion? In fact,Londonhas less annual rainfall than Rome, Paris or Vienna.Foremost among the stories we tell about ourselves as a nation is that we do things differently to those carefree continentals. There is a reason we have had to take – and mistranslate – the term “alfresco” from the Italians and “flâneur” from the French (dawdler), and are still ignoring the Spanish “sobremesa” (after-dinner socialising around the table) and “paseo” (an early-evening stroll) – because we have often been a private, lonely bunch compared with our neighbours across the Channel. You will be familiar with the trope: an Englishman’s home is his castle and, given that the moat is maintained by Britain’s private water companies, it is probably safest if we shelter indoors until the worst has passed.But the weather that gave us the sunniest April on record has continued into May and pushed a lot of Britons out of their homes, blinking into the light. In a canny attempt to make hay while the sun shines, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has announced theSummer Streets fund, a new plan to support outdoor dining and drinking, and extend opening hours in the capital. The £300,000 provided will support London’s 32 councils (and the distinct City of London) to create new outdoor eating and drinking areas, while restaurants, venues and bars have been promised that their red-tape burden and fees will be waived or reduced. It’s not a lot of money – the mayor doesn’t have access to a lot of money – but the principle, and the signal of intent about what our cities should look like, is important.The ostensible motive is to throw a bone to adesperate hospitality industry. Food and drink businesses have faced the impact of Brexit, then Covid and soaring costs, staff shortages and supply-chain disruption – not to mention turbo-charged rents in our major cities. During the pandemic, spurred by the need for social distancing and fresh air, hospitality across the country created dedicated outdoor seating areas aided by temporary road closures.Just ignore all the myths about low traffic neighbourhoods: they’re popular, effective and here to stay | Izzy RomillyRead moreHowever, not all of these changes stuck. Soho’s high-profile scheme was wound up by Westminster council in September 2021, after a concerted campaign by local residents – and no fewer than16,000 new outdoor seatswere folded up and brought inside. Specificpavement licenceswere introduced in 2020 and are required by law, and carry fees, paperwork and a consultation period – councils take into account pedestrian traffic flow, accessibility, insurance, impact on nearby residents and so on.Now, with this scheme, some of the joy and conviviality that helped so many people through those dark moments can be revived. There is a socio-cultural miserablism to British self-identity that says “we can’t have nice things like this”, as though it’s “not our way”. I don’t think there is any truth to that: social habits are quickly learned and unlearned, and they largely respond to what is permitted. Build a street-dining culture and people will take the seats on offer.It could also help offset the tendency of London’s developers to build people-phobic public spaces. Privately owned public spaces, orPops, such as Canary Wharf (part-owned by Qatar) or More London near Tower Bridge (owned by Kuwait), are just mirages where real public space should be – they are patrolled by private security guards and carry a series of hidden prohibitions, rules and regulations. Then there is “hostile architecture”, which in practice means awkward benches that aren’t comfortable to sit on for longer than two minutes. The “hostility” in the name is primarily directed at homeless people and young people pursuing harmless activities such as skateboarding – but really, the hostility is towards the public in general. The British capital too often feels like an antisocial city full of sociable people. It’s time to let them out to play.Dan Hancox is a freelance writer, focusing on music, politics, cities and cultureExplore more on these topicsRestaurantsOpinionHospitality industryLondonFoodcommentShareReuse this content"

He has been playing his opponents off against each other, staying afloat while they are left powerless and irrelevant.Netanyahu has survived multiplecorruption cases, an ongoingcriminal trialand recurring elections. Even after Hamas invaded Israel by surprise, on 7 October, 2023, leading to the longest, deadliest andmost ruinous warin the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the opposition failed to pose a political threat to Netanyahu. This week, Israel continues its expanded offensive across Gaza alongside a deadly bombing campaign.Rather than bearing the responsibility for the unparalleled tragedy and being kicked out of office in disgrace, the prime minister has only grown more powerful, expanding his governing coalition, shrugging off any responsibility for the disaster and firing the military and intelligence leaders.Israel’s political opposition suffers from an inherent contradiction. While Netanyahu’s power base has been united around a common ideology that privileges the rights of Jews and the establishment of a GreaterIsrael, the other side of the aisle is divided among different and even rival aspirations. There are rightwing opponents, who support Netanyahu’s nationalist policies but hate his leadership. There are centrist and Zionist leftwingers who dream of a liberal, secular and westernised country. And there are the representatives of Israel’s Arab minority, calling for equal citizenship.During the 2021 election, Netanyahu’s opponents from the Zionist right, centre and left joined forces and added an Arab party to the mix, and were able to put together a “change coalition” government under the leadership of Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid. Alas, their achievement was short-lived. To mask their ideological differences, the change government partners agreed to avoid dealing with the country’s deepest divides: the Palestinian issue and the role of religion in public life. But glossing over the toughest national problems was a temporary fix and the governmentcollapsed, leading to an early election the following year.View image in fullscreenYair Golan in Jerusalem taking part in a protest demanding the release of all hostages from Gaza, 20 March 2025.Photograph: Oren Ben Hakoon/ReutersInstead of closing ranks during this campaign, Netanyahu’s opponents pulled further apart, while he worked hard to milk every possible vote on the right. The inevitable result was a landslide victoryfor the Netanyahu bloc, composed of his Likud party and its far-right and ultra-Orthodox partners.Back at the helm, Netanyahu wasted no time launching his coup, pushing through changes to weaken the judiciary and state organs in order to gain more power. When the war erupted Netanyahu was initially shocked, but he never lost his political nerve. He divided his main political opposition party through ministerial and cabinet appointments for rivals, and expanded his coalition’s majority.His war policy has beenextremely popularamong Israel’s Jewish majority. Calls for starvation, annihilation and expulsion of the Palestinians in Gaza havemoved into the mainstream. There has been dissent over the plight of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas, whom Netanyahu is refusing to trade in return for halting the war and withdrawing the IDF from Gaza. The hostages’ families and freed hostages have taken the centre stage, rather than the formal opposition leader. The Arab population supported an immediate ceasefire, but were silenced bya crackdownon their freedom of expression. More recently, as Netanyahu has proposedletting aid into Gaza, his rightwing minister for national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has said this would be a “grave mistake” by Netanyahu. There are also growing voices against expanding the war and total occupation of Gaza, but Netanyahu is more attentive to criticism within his base.The devastated opposition and its supporters are clinging to two rays of hope: a coalition collapse and alternative leadership. The coalition is split over the ultra-Orthodox community’sexemption from the draft. The military needs conscripts to fill its ranks in a never-ending war, and the Zionist religious – a dominant demographic in the fighting force – hate the obvious injustice. Netanyahu has been able to convince both religious sides that if the coalition implodes under the strain of this argument, they would lose power.The other hope is new leadership. The rising opposition star is former prime ministerBennett, a rightwinger who appeals to disappointed Netanyahu voters. Sensing the public shift to the right, and trying to overcome his previous weak point, he announced that his future coalition would not include an Arab party. From the other end,Yair Golan, leader of the Democrats party, former IDF general and 7 October hero, has united the Zionist left. He has been calling to stop the war, announcing his support for a two-state solution (albeit “not now”) and his willingness to partner with an Arab party.1:38Israel targets Nasser hospital as Netanyahu vows to take control of all of Gaza – videoTheir growing popularity notwithstanding, both Bennett and Golan must gain the acceptance and support of other opposition parties and leaders. And even more crucially, they should put forward a convincing postwar vision for Israel. A vision of healing the societal rifts, rebuilding the devastated border communities, strengthening civil rights and state institutions, and reigniting a peace process.A hopeful political platform like this would have been until recently a nonstarter in war-stricken Israel, where the media keeps replaying the 7 October horrors. But in recent days, “anti-Bibi” Israelis have discovered a new and surprising friend: Donald Trump. The American president suddenly appeared as a regional peacemaker and deal-broker, whoignored the Israeli prime ministerin his sweeping diplomatic campaign, in which American envoys are negotiating directly with Israel’s chief enemies in Iran, Yemen and Hamas.Netanyahu’s supposed ideological and personal affinity to Trump was a strong card domestically, as most Israelis value American support above all else. But now, bound by his far-right partners to escalate the war, Netanyahu’s policy is an obstacle to Pax Trumpiana in the Middle East.Will the president’s cold shoulder to his erstwhile proxy give Israel’s “anti-Bibists” a new lease on life?Aluf Benn is the editor-in-chief of HaaretzExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

But more is required to restore aid and bring a ceasefireTue 20 May 2025 13.54 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 19.28 EDTShareThe UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcherfears that thousands of babies are at imminent risk of deathin Gaza unless aid reaches them. Benjamin Netanyahu fears that foreign politicians could see too many pictures of Palestinian children like these.Two months after all supplies were cut off, the Israeli government denies the obvious truth: that Gaza is on the brink of famine. But on Monday night the prime minister announced that “minimal” aid deliveries would restart,sayinghis country’s “greatest friends in the world” had told him that they could not “accept images of … mass hunger”. His entirely cynical response saw a handful of trucks permitted to cross; reportedly, 100 a day will now be allowed – grotesquely inadequate given the vast scale of need. Reaching the most vulnerable will be perilous and difficult anyway amid Israel’s intensified offensive. Mr Netanyahu vowed that Israel would “take control” of all of Gaza.His words show both that western allies can shift Israeli behaviour, and that they are insufficiently willing to do so. The trickle of supplies is meant toensure the continuationof a war that enables his political survival, but has killed more than 53,500 Palestinians. That death toll may be a grave underestimate, say researchers.Foreign leaders are finally stirring as Palestinians starve and the enormity of Israel’s plan sinks in. Britain, France and Canada havedescribedconditions in Gaza as intolerable and threatened further “concrete” actions if Israel’s “egregious” campaign continues and aid restrictions are not lifted. An unrepentant Mr Netanyahu accused them of “offering a huge prize” for the murderous Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, which triggered Israel’s assault. In a separate statement, 23 countries including Australia and New Zealand condemned the aid blockade and military offensive. On Tuesday, the European Commissionlaunched a review of trade ties. Relatives of Israeli hostages haveagain pressedfor a ceasefire and release deal. Outrage has broken through in mainstream domestic politics, with Yair Golan, leader of the Democrats,sayingthat Israel was “on the path to becoming a pariah state”.The growing condemnation is spurred not only by the grotesque suffering in Gaza and ministers’ explicit calls for ethnic cleansing but also by a new distance between Mr Netanyahu and the Trump administration. Donald Trump didn’t bother stopping in Israel and repeatedly overrode its interests – on Syria, on the Houthis and on Iran – on his Middle East tour. He has emboldened the Israeli government’s annihilationist approach and would be happy to see a Gaza without Palestinians, but may betiring of the conflict. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, reportedlycalled Mr Netanyahu three timesin 24 hours over the aid blockade. The limited return on his efforts shows that the shift in approach should not be overstated. Strikingsupport for Israel enduresin Washington even as other governments – and American voters – think again.Others must match rhetoric with action. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, condemned the “repellent” words of the extremist minister Bezalel Smotrich. But suspending trade talks is barely a start. The same goes for the sanctioning of settler activists: David Cameron has said that as foreign secretary hewanted to impose sanctionson Mr Smotrich and his colleague Itamar Ben-Gvir last year. The UK should follow the example of France, which has said it is “determined” to recognise a Palestinian state. Most of all, it should ensure that no arms,including parts for F-35 jet fighters, continue to reach Israel. Until it does so, it will be complicit in these crimes.The US has the ability to stop the slaughter and achieve a desperately needed ceasefire. But pressure from other allies can make a difference. If they care about saving lives – and not just their own optics – it is time for decisive action.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Hosting the tens of thousands of delegates who make the trip is a big undertaking for any city. But the decision to host Cop30 inBelém, at the mouth of the Amazon river, has multiplied the complications.After three consecutive Cops in autocratic nations, the stated aim of Cop30’s chair, André Aranha Corrêa do Lago, is to make this year’s event a showcase for civil society, including the Indigenous groups andforest defenderswho play such a vital role in conservation. But the lack of affordable accommodation and other infrastructure, as well as the distance that must be travelled to reach the Amazon port, mean this commendable ideal will be hard to realise.Dom Phillips’ posthumously published book,How To Save the Amazon: A Journalist’s Deadly Quest for Answers, is a compelling reminder of what is at stake. It is nearly three years sincehe was killedalong with Bruno Pereira, a Brazilian government employee whose job was monitoring isolated Indigenous groups. The pair were on the way back from a trip to the remote Javari valley. The search and investigation were initially botched. Two men will go on trial for murder later this year.Phillips and Pereira understood the risks they ran, in struggling to document the destruction that was then taking place. Between 2019 and 2023, under the far-right presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, progress on rainforest conservation went into sharp reverse anddeforested areas grew rapidly. Illegal loggers, miners and ranchers effectively had carte blanche, as the agencies tasked with upholding environmental regulations were weakened and disbanded. Over the same period, and encouraged by the government’s laissez-faire approach,competition between drug traffickersover lucrative smuggling routes intensified. Owing to its remoteness, the Javari reserve, near the border with Peru, became a key battleground.Under President Lula the situation has stabilised. His environment minister, Marina Silva, is the right person to oversee the government’spolicy of zero net deforestationby 2030. But plans toexpand the country’s fossil fuel productionare impossible to square with these environmental goals.The risk that global heating and deforestation could cause a mass diebackof the rainforest, triggering the release of vast stores of carbon, continues to trouble scientists. At the same time,doubts are growingabout whether this year’s deadline for certification of the beef supply chain as deforestation-free will be met. Under strong international pressure, JBS, the world’s largest meat company, is putting new systems in place. But the huge number of farmers (Brazil has a cattle herd of 240m), the terrain, gaps in land registration, and systems set up tobypass checks, mean the prospects for success are not high.Having the global spotlight on the forest should at least focus minds. The Amazon’s biodiversity, and role in climate regulation, make it too important to lose. Indigenous defenders, some of whom worked with Pereira and Phillips, continue the vital work of championing the landscape that is their home. The journalist’s book, completed by his friends, shows the urgency of supporting their courageous efforts.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Friends and supporters had gathered to greet him, but the moment of release felt bittersweet and he struggled to adjust back to civilian life afterwards. In the weeks that followed he developed a habit. He’d drive his car back and forth on the road that paralleled the high prison walls, pining for those who were still inside. “These people had become my people,” he says. “I thought, ‘How could I go and leave them behind?’”Panahi makes humane, heartfelt pictures about life inIran. He refers to these as “social films”, although this definition cuts no ice with the Iranian government, which has ruled them to be “propaganda against the system” and therefore hazardous, offensive material. He has to date been imprisoned twice, undergone a hunger strike and sold his house to make bail. Panahi is officially banned from making movies, although he continues to make them all the same. This is his first press interview in more than 15 years. Technically, he’s not allowed to do this either.They would take me out blindfolded and question me – sometimes for eight hoursHis new social film is a prison story of sorts, born out of his experience and playing in the main competition at Cannes. A Simple Accident is a morality play dressed up as a tense revenge thriller, nuanced and gripping as it steers a van through Tehran. Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri) is a former political prisoner who abducts his state interrogator. But Vahid needs to be sure that he’s got the right man and enlists the help and advice of various dissident friends. The captive in the van swears that he’s innocent, except that in modern Iran almost everyone lies. Both sides of the wall have learned it’s the only way to survive.View image in fullscreenKidnapped interrogator? … A Simple Accident, which is showing at Cannes.Photograph: Jafah Panahi Productions Les Films PelleasThe director beams in from his base in Iran. He wears sunglasses indoors and smokes with grim determination, but he speaks with the authoritative air of a practised orator. Prison, one senses, has not broken his spirit. It might even have emboldened him.There were two main factors behind the film, he explains. “The first time I was in prison I was in solitary confinement. I was on my own in a tiny cell and they would take me out blindfolded to a place where I would sit in front of a wall and hear this voice at my back. It was the voice of the man who would question me – sometimes for two hours, sometimes for eight hours. And I would just hang on his voice all that time, fantasising about who this person was from his voice. And I had an intuition that someday this voice would be an aspect of something I’d write or shoot and give a creative life to.”He draws on his cigarette. “My second time in prison was different. This time I was in a large space with other political prisoners. Some of them had been there for 10 or 15 years. Their experience – their stories, their take on what captivity meant to them – was inspiring. It was like the world opened up to me. Gradually, I had an idea for a film that gathered these pieces together.”Assuming that Vahid’s instinct is correct, the captive in the van is guilty of torture and rape. One of Vahid’s friends suggests showing mercy. Another, Hamid (Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr), demands immediate retribution. What would Panahi do if he met his interrogator on the street and recognised him by his voice? “I don’t know,” he says softly. “I really don’t know. I wish to say that my reaction would be the one I’ve chosen as a director, the [even-handed] response of my films. But I’m not sure. I’m a human being, so maybe I’d have a reasonable, sensible reaction but maybe I’d react in a way that I can’t foresee.”View image in fullscreenShot in his own car … 2015’s Taxi Tehran.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyPanahi is now 64 years old and has fashioned a career out of poking the bear, testing the patience of the Islamic Republic. For the past 15 years he has made his films illegally, deploying ingenious methods to avoid being caught. He shot 2013’s Closed Curtain at home with the windows draped, while 2015’s Taxi Tehran repurposed his car as a mobile film studio. His 2011 iPhone documentary This is Not a Film was famously smuggled out of the country on a USB stick. Every production becomes its own high-stakes thriller. But then pretty much every day in Iran is the same.“The fear of being arrested is constant,” he says. “Any moment the authorities can come and stop everything that’s happening in your life. That said, once you learn to work in secret, you become more clever than they are. Some of my colleagues have had problems. They tried to make clandestine films and had all their material confiscated. But by reducing the cast and crew – and by taking various precautions that of course I can’t share with you – we were able to complete almost all of the film.”Two days before the end of shooting, the crew were waylaid by a team of 15 plain-clothed officers (“police in plain clothes is never a good sign,” he points out). They told Panahi that he had to stop shooting and give up all his footage. When the director refused, they made do with whatever they could seize. “A laptop. Some discs. Perfume. Cigarettes.”What protected him, he thinks, was that his shoot coincided with the second round of Iran’s presidential elections. The authorities may have reasoned that arresting the director – arguably the country’s most high-profile dissident – would generate too much unwanted publicity. Panahi, in effect, had become too big to stamp out.View image in fullscreenSolidarity … Juliette Binoche at Cannes in 2010.Photograph: François Guillot/AFP/Getty ImagesPossibly the threat against him has eased. His longtime travel ban is now in abeyance. He was able to edit his film in France and is now due in town for the Cannes premiere – although the consequence of this visit remains anyone’s guess. “Nothing in Iran is predictable,” he says. “I hope we can come back home afterwards.”In 2021 the director’s son, Panah, made an excellent film of his own. Hit the Road depicted a family jaunt to the Turkish border and was loosely inspired by his sister Solmaz’s decision to start a new life in Ireland.Discussing the film in a Guardian interview, Panahi Jr admitted that his father’s political stance has put undue strain on the family: “From our family’s perspective, you sometimes think that, well, maybe it wasn’t worth it.”It is Panahi’s fate to have spent his career as a touchstone for Iran’s pro-democracy movement: forever looking over his shoulder; constantly running the risk of arrest. But it’s a decision which, he feels, has been forced upon him.I have become a film-maker in spite of restrictions“When you live in an ideological dictatorship – a closed system – you have no choice,” he explains. “Even when you walk on the street [the authorities] can ask you why you’re walking, where you’re going and why you are dressed in the way that you are. They create restrictions for every citizen, not just film-makers. There is no escape. Your life is conditioned by the system. So you learn how to adjust in order to keep living, working, eating, speaking in spite of this system. I have become a film-maker in spite of restrictions.” He pauses. “As to what Panah said, I don’t know what he meant, but I would ask myself this question – was it worth it? – only if I felt ashamed by one of the films I have made. And that’s not the case. I’ve put my heart into every one of them. I’ve made a positive choice by making them. I’m happy with the choice I’ve made.”It’s nice to picture Panahi walking the red carpet at Cannes. It will be his first time at the festival since 2003. For 14 years he wasn’t allowed to travel at all. The prospect, however, leaves him altogether unmoved. Iran is his home; he feels no desire to leave. He jokes that this might even count as a character flaw. “Why do I put up with my life in Iran?”As for being in Cannes, who knows? “Maybe I’ll feel as I did when I was released from prison. I knew that my friends and family were waiting for me outside. But when I stepped out I had very mixed feelings. I stood in the road and looked back at the wall. Maybe in Cannes I’ll feel the same way. I’ll look back and think about the people left behind in my country.”Explore more on these topicsJafar PanahiIranCannes film festivalFestivalsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

From the time I was conceived, I was meant to move. This is far,farfrom who I was. It is soul destroying to the maximum.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When it happened in 2023, the Wolverhampton-born choreographer had just created the explosive dance in Steve McQueen’s film Blitz, and was preparing Stranger Things: The First Shadow, the spectacular stage prequel to the Netflix hit.These productions enhance a gleaming CV that ranges from Small Island at the National Theatre to movement and intimacy direction across both stage and screen. Michaela Coel adored Messam’s pieceRun It Back for Talawa Theatre Companyand brought her on board for the rivetingly embodied I May Destroy You. “I create work from the heart,” says Messam. “It’s my superpower. I seem to bring out the magic in a cast – I’m all about you being yourself, and just having a really good time.”We’re sitting in a bar tucked behind the stalls at London’s Phoenix theatre, where Stranger Things opened in 2023. Messam only recently returned to the theatre, but says: “I feel like I’m home.” Protecting her affected left arm, she navigates twisty stairs and dark spaces without help, but warns me that there will be tears – the emotional volatility resulting from the stroke is only enhanced by revisiting the professional highs and the “cruel” reverses of the past months.View image in fullscreenEverybody dance … Steve McQueen’s Lovers Rock, part of his Small Axe series.Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/BBC/McQueen LimitedBlitz followed her collaboration with McQueen on the exuberantLovers Rockin his Small Axe series. “I will do anything for him,” she says, “we have the same instincts.” For Blitz, set in London in the darkest days of the second world war, she choreographed sequences for the swanky Café de Paris and the underground club where Saoirse Ronan and CJ Beckford hurl themselves into ecstatic swing. “A lot of the bands in these clubs were African American and African Caribbean, the elite of the elite,” she says. “There was a conglomerate of races and cultures – same-sex and mixed-race couples, it was all happening.”Her work for Stranger Things began with an enigmatic video call with “two charismatic gentleman” who turned out to be directors Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin. She was recommended by the National Theatre’s Rufus Norris, who said: “You’re looking for a fucking good movement director called Coral.”Messam immersed herself in research, figuring out how to make this eerie world move, and landed on the lindy hop. The athletic mid-century dance craze born in African American culture ignites the play’s small-town setting. Messam told the cast: “You can’t look like you’re from this century. The key is in the music – it will give you a different rhythm. It’s 1959 – rock and roll is opening the cracks, the youth are being rebellious, Elvis is doing sexy things, whoa!”Each teen character embraces lindy differently: “It’s freedom for them all.” Except for troubled Henry Creel who will grow into Vecna, antagonist of the TV show. “The dance freaks him out,” Messam explains. “Everything’s sweating, he doesn’t like the uncontrollability.”Henry’s troubles go beyond reluctant booty-shaking. The show exposes the bodily flux of adolescence. “Initially, we don’t quite see Henry’s eyes. He’s closed off, a teenager going through multiple transitions.” Under stress, he morphs into a monster capable of terrifying violence. “I tried to think like a doctor,” Messam says. “I looked at anatomy and physiology, how the spine and pelvis change. How does bone shift? What does it do to muscle and organs?” On stage, Henry’s entire body appears to reset itself.View image in fullscreen‘His body is no longer his’ … Henry Creel in Stranger Things: The First Shadow.Photograph: Manuel HarlanAs the workshops progressed, Messam was getting headaches (“I thought: it’s the menopause”), but just before rehearsals began, in July 2023, she had a stroke, alone at home. She lists what she describes as a succession of traumas: the sudden stroke itself, eight weeks in hospital, a difficult spell in rehab, plus the end of a six-year relationship. “I couldn’t walk, I could hardly talk. From being on top of the world, loving life, being free in my body, it was a massive change. Literally like being in hell.”Her left side was the most affected. Uncannily, Henry’s transformation also begins with his left hand, which had become a focus of her movement research. Messam looks down at the left arm she holds against her, the parallel unavoidable. “His body is no longer his. It has this other thing that controls him.” The tears fall.Sitting with us is neurophysiotherapist Carly Christensen, who has worked with Messam since they met on a retreat in November. “A stroke has huge impact,” Christensen says, “but when I met Coral, I knew she was still in there.” The pair share a daunting work ethic: “Coral is disciplined, she’s an athlete. She knows what it takes.”“On the retreat,” Christensen says, “Coral was like, I can’t go back to work until things are normal.” Shortly after which, “Coral taught the entire therapy team how to lindy hop in 10 minutes!”Messam is edging back into work. She has met the current Stranger Things cast and talked about the dance. “That was quite a big thing for me – I didn’t want to be scared of it.” Her energy is returning and she is taking on a “very little project” with an associate. Despite all the loss and grief, she says, “I want to be stronger than I was before. I’m a lover of life, and I’m not done yet.”Stranger Things: The First Shadow is at the Phoenix theatre, LondonExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreDanceStranger ThingsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Not many people seem to careThe actor received a lifetime achievement award from the Better World Fund at an event with little fanfare and few recognisable guestsXan Brooksin CannesTue 20 May 2025 17.10 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareKevin Spacey’s Cannes comeback is a discreet, low-key affair. The promenade is home to a gaggle of evening sunbathers while the steps to the beach club contain neither fans nor protesters. It is what is known in the trade as a soft relaunch.Spacey is guest of honour at the Better World Fund’s gala dinner, where he is receiving a lifetime achievement award for “excellence in film and television”. It marks a return to the limelight for the two-time Oscar-winner, whose career stalled after allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by more than 30 men. This is the actor’s first visit to Cannes since 2016, one year before the #MeToo movement began.Inside the hotel beach club, the photographers jockey for position and complain of the party’s lack of celebrity wattage. The more enterprising guests hold up their phones with their names displayed. The others risk going entirely unrecognised. “There’s no guest list,” one photographer grumbles to his friend. “Who even are these people?”Spacey’s gala dinner is a breakaway event, not officially sanctioned by theCannes film festival, although it takes place at the nearby Carlton hotel, the centrepiece berth for the event’s A-list guests. The Better World Fund is a charitable foundation set up by the American entrepreneur Ted Turner, with a focus on the arts and a mission to “build a more secure, prosperous world”.One of its longstanding supporters is the Indian-American film-maker Mira Nair, the director of Salaam Bombay! and Monsoon Wedding. On arriving, Nair says that she only learned of Spacey’s invitation the day before. Asked if she is happy that the actor has been invited to the party, she says: “I can say that I’m happy that I’ve been invited to the party. I’m happy that people are here, being honoured.”When Spacey belatedly appears on the red carpet, the photographers surge forward and knock over the cordon. Tables are upset and champagne glasses smashed. “Thank you for coming,” he says, maintaining a stiff rictus smile, before pausing for a brief word with a TV crew. The actor ignores all further questions and is quickly steered past the gathered reporters. His gaze is fixed like a limpet on the dinner tables inside.Out on the prom, one lone demonstrator has now set up camp. Ramiro Magalhães is a Brazilian climate change activist who is in Cannes to protest against the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. He has a push-cart made up as a hospital stretcher, with the charred bough of a tree playing the role of the patient. Magalhães says he has never heard of Spacey. “I don’t know any actors,” he says. “Is he a good actor?”Spacey, 65, is in Cannes for business as well as pleasure. He is starring in a low-budget independent thriller, The Awakening, that is being sold to foreign buyers inside the festival’s Marché du Film. The Awakening’s writer, producer and star, Matt Hookings, this week told reporters the actor’s attendance at the gala dinner was part of a “guerrilla marketing” campaign to promote the film. “If anyone speaks to him, he could say he’s in Cannes and receiving an award,” Hookings said. “But he’s also here with The Awakening, so the film gets plugged.”Inside the beach club, the guests take their seats for the dinner. Spacey will be hoping that the gala signals a new dawn. But out on the beach the sun was going down.Explore more on these topicsKevin SpaceyCannes film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A TV reboot that is a genuinely great ideaThis hugely fun version of the 00s life-swapping show works even better than the original. First up: a posh Surrey estate agent tries running a market stall in BoltonRebecca NicholsonTue 20 May 2025 17.15 EDTShareIhave long held a soft spot for Faking It, the 00s proto-reality series that was conceived as a modern-day Pygmalion. Twenty years ago, it saw people exchanging one job for another, though its idea of what constituted a polar opposite seems almost quaint now. There was a decorator trying their hand at fine art, a posh student who became a bouncer, a ballet dancer who turned into a wrestler. It was about learning new skills, but really, it was about participants experiencing a life that was unfamiliar, among people who were not necessarily like the people they already knew. It was a wholesome culture clash, with a little class war mixed in.As with any long-retired television series that people remember with affection, here comes the reboot. TV revivals are often lazy, and tend to rely on nostalgia rather than quality to attract an audience. That may well be the reason people tune in, to begin with, but Faking It is such a solid idea that it still has plenty of the old charm left to spare. In fact, it may work even better now, in the fractious 2020s, than it did in the optimistic glow of the early 00s.The first episode sees Rex, a plummy public schoolboy who sells luxury property in London for a living, attempting to pass himself off as a Bolton market trader. The semi-puns about Rex going from penthouse to pork ribs are the most painful part of the episode. They ham up the class differences – Rex is being shipped to a generic north, because to be honest he isn’t sure where Bolton is; he has a drink with a friend he last saw at the polo – but despite these exaggerated Made in Chelsea moments, Rex is up for the challenge and seems well aware of his “privileged and fortunate” life situation.In Bolton, Rex learns to sell meat from a market stall under the guidance of Tony and Elliott, who note Rex’s floppy-fringed resemblance to Hugh Grant. Despite some gentle mockery, they all seem to get on nicely, and their enthusiasm for the task at hand is contagious. By the end of his intensive training, Rex will set up his own butcher’s stall and attempt to fool three market inspectors into believing that calling out the low prices of steak and chicken wings is the job he’s done for his entire adult life.View image in fullscreenSwapping polo for pork ribs … Elliot Schofield, Rex Adams and Tony Frame in Faking It.Photograph: Channel 5/DSPThe only real problem is that not only does Rex have to pass himself off as a market trader, he has to pretend to be from Bolton, too. He’s a hard worker who throws himself into learning, so I suspect the added pressure of the accent is to inject some necessary drama and tension. If you’ve ever wanted to see a posh southerner dying a death while compering a pub quiz in Bolton, in an accent that lands somewhere between Newcastle and the Caribbean, here it is. Even if it’s not essential, it is funny, and a little informative: if you’re curious and not from Bolton, apparently the best way into the accent is to say “ya big bad bastard”.Modern reality TV thrives on conflict and high drama, so the Faking It model – setting someone a tricky task that involves getting along with people, while giving them everything they need to succeed and ensuring viewers are right there in their corner – is as much of a 00s relic as low-rise jeans and velour tracksuits. It shouldn’t work in the 2020s. We’ve gotMarried at First Sight, we’ve gotThe Traitors, we’ve gotLove Is Blind. We’ve got squabbling and cliffhangers and emotional high stakes and on-camera meltdowns.But Faking It does still work, and perhaps it is more valid now than it was when it began. Class barriers are more pronounced. We’re living in the tumultuous age of the echo chamber. Our beliefs are self-reinforcing, and we are becoming less likely to socialise with people who are not like us. (If Keir Starmer wants to locate the real causes of his“island of strangers”, he could start by looking at the tech companies he is so avidly courting.)Without putting too much weight on the shoulders of light entertainment, it’s notable that people from different places and different backgrounds can be thrown together, get along just fine and still make for entertaining TV. The original Faking It had an occasional special episode, updating us on how the show had changed people’s lives. I hope they continue the tradition. I’d love to see how Rex gets on when he’s next at the polo.Faking It is on Channel 5 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its bland, TV-movie tone of sentimentality fails to accommodate the existential nightmare of the main plot strand, or indeed the subordinate question of when and whether to put your elderly parent in a care home.Squibb plays Eleanor Morgenstein, a widowed Jewish lady with a waspish way of speaking her mind to condescending youngsters, including the blandly unhelpful teen working in a supermarket who presumes to tell Eleanor that all pickles taste pretty much the same – although it is difficult to tell exactly how mean twinkly-eyed lovable Eleanor is supposed to be for humiliating the admittedly dopey kid. She lives in Florida, sharing an apartment with her adored best friend Bessie Stern (Rita Zohar). Bessie is also widowed and Jewish, but unlike the US-born Eleanor, Bessie is aHolocaustsurvivor who is tormented by the horrifying experience, by the memory of her beloved brother who did not survive, and also by the fact that she has never experienced even the partial catharsis of telling her story publicly, having only told Eleanor.When Bessie dies, Eleanor moves back in with her harassed, divorced daughter Lisa (Jessica Hecht) and grandson (Will Price) in their small New York apartment and, from the first, feels sad and lonely. So she joins a Jewish seniors social group in the city, but is mortified to discover, too late, that it is specifically for Holocaust survivors. And so, poignantly keen to fit in and find companionship, Eleanor pretends to be a survivor, recycling Bessie’s memories and telling herself she’s honouring Bessie’s memory.View image in fullscreenBest friends … Squibb with Rita Zohar as BessieWhat could possibly go wrong? Well, the group is attended by NYU journalism student Nina (Erin Kellyman) who becomes best pals with the feisty Eleanor. Nina’s late mum (whose death was agonisingly recent) was Jewish, and Nina is moved by Eleanor’s amazing story and by her intention to get a late-life bat mitzvah; her resulting article interests Nina’s TV news commentator dad, Roger Davis (Chiwetel Ejiofor).The scene would appear to be set for the most sulphurous black horror non-comedy, surely: an unthinkable humiliation. But when the inevitable happens, nothing much happens at all, as if the film itself wishes to protect sweet old Eleanor from the amazingly stupid and dangerous thing she did. We segue quickly to the tedious non-issue of Roger needing to own his grief, as if that were comparably important or interesting. Everyone accepts Eleanor’s defence about honouring Bessie’s memory and the story isn’t picked up by anyone else. But all grownups know that Holocaust survivor imposture is a serious issue, because such cases can be seized on by neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers. And it is very fatuous for the “journalists” in this movie not to mention this at all.Then there is the care home issue. Lisa keeps hinting Eleanor would be better off in one. Eleanor is furious and adamant that she doesn’t want that, and the audience might well agree. She is, after all, razor-sharp mentally and in excellent physical shape. But finally, she seems to blandly accept going into a home. Why?Johansson has movingly spoken about her own Jewish heritage and about her family forebears who weremurdered during the Holocaust in the Warsaw ghetto. But sadly her Eleanor is far from great.Eleanor the Great screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCannes film festivalScarlett JohanssonHolocaustFestivalsSecond world warreviewsShareReuse this content"

Three hours later, it had become Judi Dench’s head, 50% larger than usual, twinkle-eyed even in terracotta.At Claridge’s hotel in London on Monday evening, Frances Segelman hosted her latest ticking-clock sculpt: paying guests watch as she kneads a celebrity bust on stage, the subject sitting quietly beside her. In the past, Segelman has done Simon Rattle, Joan Collins, Joanna Lumley, Boris Johnson, Mr Motivator and major-league royals, almost always for charity.This was a fundraiser for lymphoedema research. Ticket sales raised over £20,000 and it’s hoped that, when it’s cast in bronze, the finished piece will fetch double that (St George’s hospital Charityin Tooting, London, has begun accepting bids).The pair began a little before the audience arrived, sitting on a platform in the hotel’s mirrored, slightly chilly art deco ballroom. Segelman, 76, glamorous in black lace gown despite mucky hands; Dench, 90, immaculate in cream coat with grey shawl and sausage-shaped water bottle. Another throw appeared courtesy of her daughter, Finty Williams. “Oooh hello!” said Dench. “I’m swathed in blankets, that’s wonderful, thank you.” Beside her were a cappuccino, bouquet and numbered helium balloons in honour of last December’s landmark birthday - in fact, she’ll soon be nearer 91.View image in fullscreen‘She was so sweet and kind and she never moved’ … Frances Segelman and Judi Dench.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAThe lump became flesh. Nostrils were poked out, Covid swab-style. Segelman measured Dench’s skull using wooden tongs and metal callipers – half tailor, half surgeon. “It’s weird,” said Williams. “At first, it didn’t look like her. Then after 10 minutes I was like: ‘Oh yes, that is Ma.’” It wasn’t unnerving? “I’m quite used to seeing her bigger than she normally is.”Then the binbags of sludge were removed and guests entered: around 200 supporters of the lymphoedema charity, which has been working with Dench’s friend, photographer Gemma Levine. They first met in 1989, when Levine was dispatched to snap Dench at the NationalTheatre, who was playing Gertrude opposite Daniel Day-Lewis’s Hamlet. “We kept in touch,” says Levine. “And once I had lymphoedema I kept asking Judi to do events and she never said no.”View image in fullscreen‘When she got hold of that clay, she was loving it’ … Segelman measures Dench.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PALevine studied under Henry Moore. His “hard” art would have been a bad fit for her friend, she thinks. “Judi’s a great subject. She’s a true professional and someone with great depth and sensibility and humour. I don’t know anyone else like that – and I know a lot of film and theatre people.”An address about lymphoedema began the evening proper: its causes, symptoms, incidence and cost to the NHS of late diagnosis. It is, said Dr Peter Mortimer of St George’s, a “hidden epidemic” with “little recognition”. He talked the audience through elephantiasis and how “a big arm, following lymph gland removal after breast cancer surgery” can be fatal should the swelling spread to the central organs. Waiters offered fizz and nibbles.Segelman then spoke, asking the audience to mingle while she worked. (“Talk makes me quicker.”) They duly milled, and debated in spitting distance of the artist how she was doing. “It’s like focus,” said one accountant. “It goes in and out. It’s out at the moment, but it’ll go back in.”View image in fullscreen‘Watching Judi turn into a monument’ … Simon Callow addresses the audience at Claridge’s.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAHis favourite Dench role was M in Skyfall; informal canvassing of the crowd for her key performances saw a big win for the James Bond films, but also strong results for the sitcoms As Time Goes By and A Fine Romance, as well as the Iris Murdoch biopic (there were a lot of doctors in the room). One GP reported he’d seen almost all her Shakespeare productions and been in love with her for four decades, while the composer Karl Jenkins – whose music soundtracked some of the evening – remembered seeing Dench in Twelfth Night when he was a schoolboy.There was quiet as Simon Callow recited Christina Rossetti’s A Birthday. Were Maggie Smith present, he said, “she’d say how wonderful it’s been today to watch Judi turn into a monument”. Williams read a self-penned poem to her mother, To the Moon and Back, which brought both women – and a few others – to tears. A soprano sang Happy Birthday. Cake came.As the evening wore on, Dench swapped her coffee for champagne. She did not speak publicly but, during a brief break, told the Guardian she was enjoying the experience, despite her macular degeneration now being so advanced she would be unable to assess the results.“I can’t see a thing,” she said. “I can’t really see your face and you’re right in front of me.” She gestured round. “I’m just in the play. I sit on the stage. It’s very nice and Frances is brilliant, as is the charity. I just hear this sea of friendly people.”View image in fullscreen‘I think a lot of people want her to take up more space than she does’ … Finty Williams, who read a poem to her mother.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAHer sense of her own features hasn’t changed with age. “I don’t have a relationship with my face,” she said. “Never have!” If she couldn’t appreciate the finished bust visually, would she have a feel? An impish grin. “If they let me.”And as Segelman fiddled with the chin and entered the final furlong, Dench did toy with a spare ball of terracotta. “When she got hold of that clay,” said Segelman later, “she was loving it. She could do something with it.”It’s not just a passing interest, reports Williams. Her mother attends a weekly art class that includes pottery. Like Segelman, Dench prefers figurative work – just last week, says Williams, she shaped a little Bottom from A Midsummer Night’s Dream.View image in fullscreen‘Frances is brilliant’ … the finished bust.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAFinally the head was complete. Segelman would make some small tweaks in her studio the next day, she said, as an assistant spritzed it. “But I’m not worried. It went well. I didn’t meet Judi before I sculpted her. That’s hard. But she was so sweet and kind and she never moved.” Segelman was surprised by her youthfulness. “She has a cuteness. Pixie-like.”Williams concurred. “I think Ma’s got like quite an elvish little face and I think a lot of people want her to take up more space than she does. To give her a bigger, cookie cutter outline.” Her verdict was complimentary, especially the jawline.And what does she think her mother would make of it? “She’s a Quaker so she’s not a big fan of looking at herself. And she wouldn’t really be able to see it any more. But I think she’ll love touching it.”As everyone headed out of the ballroom, two footmen edged gently by, bearing a huge metal box containing Dench’s still-wet supersized head. Guests gulped and shrank back. The possibility of a slip was a sobering thought on the way to the exit.Explore more on these topicsFilmJudi DenchSculptureCharitable givingTheatreArtnewsShareReuse this content"

He talks about their fear of deportation – and the secret to a happy open relationshipTue 20 May 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 20 May 2025 11.14 EDTShareThe Admiral Duncan is empty when Jeremy Atherton Lin arrives to meet me, save for a few meandering flies. In the final pages of his bestselling book,Gay Bar: Why We Went Out, Lin visits the old Soho boozer in London with his husband, where they encounter a “despondent” scene: spilled beer, backed-up toilets and a wasted drag queen. Even so, they are charmed by an older couple across the bar and wonder if they’ll be lucky enough to end up like them. The site of a homophobic nail-bomb attack in 1999, the Admiral Duncan is another kind of survivor, and Lin admires it in spite of the mess. Such ambivalence is typical of his memoiristic writing, which spirals outward into digressive analyses of social and political events.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted the reader to feel a little exasperated with me’ … Jeremy Atherton Lin with his husband, left.Photograph: Jeremy Atherton LinThis time, the place is quiet and clean, and Lin has come alone – all of which is probably for the best, since we’re here to discuss his latest book, Deep House: The Gayest Love Story Ever Told. At once more personal and more political than anything he has ever written, it follows him and his partner as they navigate a precarious legal landscape for immigrants and LGBTQ+ people in their effort to build a home and life together.The couple met 29 years ago at Popstarz, a club night, when Lin was passing through London on a backpacking trip. (In Gay Bar, Lin refers to his partner in the third person, mostly as Famous Blue Raincoat. In Deep House he remains unnamed, though most of the book is addressed directly to him.)“I depict myself in the book as feeling a little unsure and resistant at first; counterintuitively, this bashful boy is the pursuer,” Lin says. “He’s so lovable that I wanted the reader to feel a little exasperated with me, like, ‘You’re never gonna get any better than this.’” Not long after returning to northern California, Lin seemed to get the message and invited his new British beau to visit. “Famous” came and never left. Overstaying his visa, he became a fugitive for love.It took a while for them to fully understand the implications of that decision. They struggled to find an apartment given that only Lin – on a writer’s income – could be named on the lease. Every loud noise or bright light outside their door sparked fears of an imminent raid. Accidents were a worry because “we were convinced you couldn’t go into hospital without being deported,” Lin writes.View image in fullscreenOld haunt … The Admiral Duncan in Soho, London.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images“We found ourselves laying down roots on a fault line – literally earthquake territory, but also a contentious political framework,” he tells me today. “By 2000, when we rented our first weird, damp apartment, 18 states still had sodomy laws on the books.” They were considered “illegal” in more ways than one.Lin writes extensively about the case law that led to the 2015 US supreme court decision in Obergefell v Hodges which legalised same-sex marriage across the US. Some of these are relatively obscure, such as Baker v Nelson (1971) and Boutilier v Immigration and Naturalization Service (1967), and he sympathetically details the lives of the plaintiffs, aware that most of them weren’t asking for much. Lin and his partner were less interested in pushing a gay rights agenda than safely crawling back into bed together. “We were half innocent and half obscene,” he writes. “We’d been infantilised by our governments – our ‘twink’ years prolonged.”At times, this could be a minor thrill. “I can’t deny there was an exhilaration when we went underground,” he tells me. For a middle-class kid in San Francisco’s Mission District in the early 2000s, being undocumented may have seemed like a punk bona fide. Marriage certainly did not – though at the time it was unavailable to them anyway. “A lot of queers, of course, didn’t want in on the historically proprietary and patriarchal institution in the first place,” Lin writes.Open relationships and polyamory were typical in their urban gay enclave; they duly navigated threesomes and foursomes, including, at one point, with another couple with whom they shared an apartment. The idea of marriage seemed almost too conventional by contrast. Nonetheless, Lin acknowledges that marriage “affords privileges, including mobility across borders. Marriage is, among other things, a passport”. Unable to cross international borders or even state lines without worry, Lin and his partner often felt stuck.As a white British person, Lin’s partner was perhaps in a more privileged position than those subjected to racial profiling. Lin writes about several suits filed by Asian immigrants, many of them in San Francisco, dating back to a string of racist laws passed by the US government in the 19th century, including the Chinese Exclusion Act. He also tells the story of his own parents, who met in the 1960s after his father emigrated to the US from Taiwan. As a biracial couple, they were only able to marry in Florida because anti-miscegenation laws had been struck down by Loving v Virginia a few years earlier.It’s unclear if Lin’s father or partner would have been able to remain in the country had Donald Trump been president at the time. Lin says he finished edits on Deep House before Trump returned to the Oval Office in January, and he never expected the immigration crackdown to be this bad. “There are a lot of moments in the book where we think that whoever comes through the door is going to be [Ice],” he says. “That was very far-fetched then. But our paranoia has become the reality.”View image in fullscreen‘We were convinced you couldn’t go into hospital without being deported’ … Ice agents prepare to carry out a raid.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesIn 2007, Lin and his husband relocated to the UK, where they obtained a civil partnership (backdated as a marriage, once same-sex unions became fully legal in 2014). Their timing was lucky. “When my next letter arrived from the UK Home Office, with a visa that established my leave to remain, it was genuinely welcoming, almost chipper,” he notes. “But less than five years later, then home secretary Theresa May would usher in the ‘hostile environment’ policy, a brutally monikered set of measures intended to drive out undocumented denizens that would send ripples of malice toward foreign nationals and minority groups more generally.”Lin began writing Gay Bar while working a string of retail jobs in London. “I would be writing on the cash register or on the back of the receipts,” he recalls. Eileen Myles was a big influence on his personal, essayistic prose style, as was Michelle Tea (briefly an upstairs neighbour in San Francisco). The 2010s were an exuberant time for London’s gay scene, but also a challenging one for nightlife spaces; by the time the Covid-19 pandemic hit, nearly half of the city’s clubs had already closed. Lin found himself documenting these losses, which eventually became Gay Bar.That book won the National Book Critics Circle award for autobiography and spent weeks atop international bestseller lists. Lin never anticipated the success. “It’s amazing but also terrifying,” he says. “We weren’t prepared for it.” Meanwhile, “London had lost its sense of wonder”. He and his partner relocated to St Leonards-on-Sea, where he says they often walk along the beach twice a day. When the news cycle or writer’s block is stressing him out, he says, “We go down to the beach and pick up a pebble, name it with whatever is bothering us, and throw it into the water. It’s surprisingly effective.”View image in fullscreen‘London had lost its sense of wonder’ … St Leonards-on-Sea.Photograph: Stephen R Johnson/AlamyAs for how Famous Blue Raincoat feels about all the public attention, Lin says his partner is able to read his work with a certain detachment. “I’m working within the idiom of nonfiction, for which the criterion is accuracy, but I’m also writing my remembrance of the past. He’s more forgiving of my confabulations, because he’s an artist. There’s a part of him that’s quite good at loosening up. Although there’s a seven-page sex scene in Deep House that I read out loud a couple years ago, and I think he felt a bit exposed,” Lin admits with a laugh.Does he have any advice for open relationships? “Communication,” Lin says without hesitation. “So much of the communication that we’ve been fortunate to have is based on implicit trust,” he says. “I think maybe it’s so robust because of our experience feeling like it was us against the world.”Some wisdom has also surely come with age. “I had come to identify as someone who crossed borders – but slowly understood that adult life had to involve the creation and maintenance of boundaries, a matter of recognising that the world is not just one’s own,” he writes towards the end of Deep House. Marriage may have been a way of protecting their relationship and immigration status, but it also confirmed that they really did want to settle down. If “we go out to be gay”, as Lin writes in Gay Bar, he realised that remaining home with his husband wouldn’t make him any less of a homosexual. “This book is the domestic antidote [to Gay Bar],” he explains. “It’s ‘why we stayed in’. Which is to say, inside the interior of our home, but also inside each other.”Deep House (Penguin Books Ltd, £25) and Gay Bar (Granta Books, £10.99) by Jeremy Atherton Lin.

The stories were originally written in Kannada, the official language of the state of Karnataka in southern India.Described by the author and chair of judges Max Porter as “something genuinely new for English readers: a radical translation” of “beautiful, busy, life-affirming stories”, Heart Lamp’s 12 tales chronicle the lives of women in patriarchal communities in southernIndia. They were selected as well as translated by Bhasthi, the first Indian translator to win the award. She chose them from around 50 stories in six collections written by Mushtaq over a 30-year-period.The £50,000 prize – shared equally between writer and translator – was presented at the Tate Modern in London on Tuesday evening, where a video of actorAmbika Modreading from the winning title was also shown.Ambika Mod reads from Heart Lamp by Banu Mushtaq, translated by Deepa Bhasthi.Writing about the shortlist in the Guardian, John Self said Mushtaq and Bhasthi’s “wonderful collection” would be a “worthy winner”. The tone of the book “varies from quiet to comic, but the vision is consistent”, he wrote.Porter said he and his fellow judges – poet Caleb Femi, writer and Guardian critic Sana Goyal, author and translator Anton Hur and musician Beth Orton – spent six hours deliberating, during which they “argued a lot” before “unanimously” deciding the winner.Though Porter said they were looking for the “best book” above all else, he called Heart Lamp a “really special book in terms of its politics”. The stories “contain the feminism for which [Mushtaq] is known. And they contain extraordinary accounts of patriarchal systems and resistance,” he added. “But they aren’t activist stories. First and foremost they’re beautiful accounts of everyday life and particularly the lives of women.”Porter also praised Bhasthi’s translation, which he said “celebrates the movement from one language to another. It contains a multiplicity of Englishes. It is a translation with a texture.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Combs, 55, is facing charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. He wasarrested in September 2024and has pleaded not guilty.On Tuesday morning, Combs’s former personal assistant David James, who worked for Combs from 2007 and 2009, continued his testimonyafter first taking the stand on Mondayafternoon. His testimony was followed by that of Regina Ventura and exotic dancer Sharay Hayes, whose nickname is “The Punisher”.A timeline of allegations and charges against Sean ‘Diddy’ CombsRead moreRegina Ventura testified that in December 2011, her daughter emailed her and Combs’s assistant while flying home for Christmas. She told them that Combs was threatening to release explicit videos of Ventura after learning she was dating rapper Kid Cudi. Ventura also said in the email that Combs had told her that he would “be having someone hurt” her and Cudi.Regina Ventura said that Combs demanded $20,000 to reclaim what he said he had spent on Cassie. She and her husband took out a home-equity loan to get the money for Combs because she was “scared about my daughter’s safety”. Regina Ventura allegedly received instructions from Combs’s bookkeeper about how to wire the money and sent it to him. However, the money was returned several days later.When Cassie Ventura returned home for Christmas, her mother said, she then learned of Combs’s alleged violence. The elder Ventura took photographs of the bruises on her daughter’s body to document them.Earlier in the day, during James’s testimony, he detailed his duties, which had included setting up hotel rooms for Combs, laying out Combs’s clothes and toiletries, and procuring “personal items” such as baby oil, lubricant, condoms and snacks. He also described Combs’s medicine bag, which allegedly contained dozens of pill bottles that contained ecstasy and Percocet.In one part of his testimony, James spoke of a New Year’s Eve party where he took an ecstasy pill. After the event, James said, Combs had a video of him dancing at the party and allegedly told him: “I want to keep this footage in case I ever need it.”James also recounted an incident from 2008 when he, along with a member of Combs’s security detail, saw rival record executive Suge Knight at a diner in Los Angeles. He said Combs ordered them to return with him to the diner, noting that en route he saw three guns on Combs’s person but that when they arrived, Knight was gone. James told the jury he was “shook up” by the incident.“This was the first time as his assistant that I realized my life was in danger,” James said, adding that after the incident, he gave his six-month notice.On cross-examination, Combs’s defense attorneys pointed out inconsistencies in James’s account of the Knight incident, referencing prior statements James had made to the government.They questioned James about a physical altercation with Combs’s chef, which he admitted to, saying that he “squeezed her wrists” and told her to “stay in her lane”. James testified that after the incident, Combs told him: “You can’t be putting your hands on a woman.”After Regina Ventura concluded her testimony, the prosecution called on exotic dancer Hayes.Hayes said that he had been hired by Ventura and Combs between eight and a dozen times to take part in Combs’s “freak-offs”, with the last session being in 2016. He testified that Combs had never appeared intoxicated and gave directions during the sexual encounters.Asked whether Ventura seemed to enjoy herself during the “freak-offs”, Hayes said that his understanding had been that “we were creating a scene, a sexy scene, that was enjoyable to her partner”. He noted that sometimes he observed her “wince” and “sigh” at the frequency of Combs’s instructions.Under cross-examination, Hayes said he had not perceived any discomfort from Ventura “with what was going on” and never saw any violence.After Hayes, Gerard Gannon, the Homeland Security Investigations special agent who led the March 2024 search of Combs’s Miami Beach home, took the stand.Gannon testified that AR-15 rifle parts had been found in closets in the main bedroom. Jurors were also shown photos of other items found in the room, including high heels, sex toys, baby oil, lubricants and lingerie.Gannon’s testimony will resume on Wednesday morning.Earlier this week, the jury heard fromsinger Dawn Richardand Kerry Morgan, a former close friend of Ventura’s during her relationship with Combs. Both womentestified that they had witnessed Combs assaulting Ventura.Morgan also recounted a separate incident from 2018 when she said she was personally attacked by Combs, telling the court that Combs struck her on the head with a wooden hanger and choked her while Ventura was in the bathroom.Morgan claimed that after the attack, Combs sent her money and she signed a non-disclosure agreement. She also testified that during Ventura’s relationship with Combs, Ventura would tell her that she couldn’t leave him because he “controlled everything” in her life.The trial is expected to last seven more weeks. If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.In the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

The family has requested privacy during this time.”He died peacefully in his sleep at home.Wendt starred in Cheers from 1982 to 1993, appearing in all 275 episodes of the hit sitcom. He earned six Emmy nominations for his work on the show.“The Norm you see in Cheers has been years in the making,” Wendtonce saidof his character. “I have some characteristics in common with him besides our fondness for beer. But I think I’m a lot happier than Norm.” He also added: “I was a beer drinker long before Cheers. When I put a couple of six packs on top of my grocery shopping cart, people are pleased. I tell ‘em I’m taking them home to rehearse.”He went on to play the character of Norm in a number of other shows including Frasier, Wings, The Simpsons, Family Guy and The Tortellis.On Tuesday, his Cheers co-stars paid tribute, including Ted Danson, who played the barman Sam. “I am devastated to hear that Georgie is no longer with us,” he said in a statement. “I am sending all my love to Bernadette and the children. It is going to take me a long time to get used to this. I love you, Georgie.”Rhea Perlman, who played waitress Carla Tortelli, remembered him as “the sweetest, kindest man I ever met.”“It was impossible not to like him,” she added. “As Carla, I was often standing next to him, as Norm always took the same seat at the end of the bar, which made it easy to grab him and beat the crap out of him at least once a week. I loved doing it and he loved pretending it didn’t hurt. What a guy! I’ll miss him more than words can say.”John Ratzenberger, who played fellow Cheers regular Cliff Clavin, said he was “heartbroken”.“For 11 years on Cheers, we shared a stage, a lot of laughs and a front-row seat to one of television’s most beloved friendships. George brought Norm to life with a subtle brilliance — the kind that made it look easy. That was his gift,” he said in a statement.Kelsey Grammer, who appeared in Cheers and Frasier with Wendt,told the Hollywood Reporter:“I believe mourning is a private matter. But I liked George a lot. He was beloved by millions.”After Cheers, Wendt also led short-lived sitcom The George Wendt Show in 1995 which was cancelled after six episodes. His other television credits included Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Colombo, Portlandia and The Goldbergs.His film credits included Guilty by Suspicion with Robert De Niro, Fletch with Chevy Chase, Space Truckers with Dennis Hopper and Forever Young with Mel Gibson. He also played Macaulay Culkin’s father in Michael Jackson’s Black or White video.On stage, Wendt also starred in Hairspray on Broadway, playing Edna Turnblad. “It was one of my two favorite roles, apart from Norm,”he said. “Absolute utter joy and entirely different from anything in my world.”Most recently, he appeared in a season of The Masked Singer and 2022’s festive comedy Christmas with the Campbells. He also reunited with members of the Cheers cast at the 2024 Emmys.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionTV comedyComedyTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

He is survived by his wife, the actor Zoë Wanamaker, and by his children, Charlie and Eliza, from his previous marriage to the actor Janet Key.A prolific performer with the National Theatre for several decades, he was Macduff opposite Anthony Hopkins’ Macbeth and appeared alongside Laurence Olivier in Saturday, Sunday, Monday and The Party when the company was based at the Old Vic in the early 1970s. His National productions included The Front Page, The Plough and the Stars, The Misanthrope and The Marriage of Figaro (in the title role) and he remained a familiar presence there through to recent plays such as Saint George and the Dragon. He was also a regular on TV, appearing in staples including Doctor Who, in which he played the engineer and “father of the railways” George Stephenson in the two-part episodeThe Mark of the Raniin 1985.Born in Glasgow, Grainger was brought up in London. He was cast at the age of 12 as the Boy Prince (a non-speaking role) in Ivor Novello’s musical King’s Rhapsody, after blagging his way into Novello’s dressing room and impressing him. Active in drama and broadcasting while at school, he then went to Italia Conti drama school and appeared at Frinton Summer Theatre, Dundee Rep and Ipswich’s Arts theatre (where he appeared alongside Ian McKellen).View image in fullscreenGawn Grainger (Jimmy) and Tanya Franks (Gina) in Sing Yer Heart Out for the Lads at Cottesloe, National Theatre, in 2004.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAt Bristol Old Vic he played major roles including Romeo (opposite Jane Asher as Juliet), Laertes in Hamlet and Claudio in Measure for Measure, with all three productions touring to the US. Before arriving at the NationalTheatrehe had a hit on Broadway with There’s a Girl in My Soup in the late 1960s, when he also appeared on the US panel show in What’s My Line?

The case is due to begin at a court in Rome on 17 June.Depardieu, 76, is accused of punching Barillari, known inItalyas “the king of paparazzi” for his tenacity in capturing up-close shots of celebrities, outside Harry’s Bar on Via Veneto in May last year.Barillari, 80, went to the bar, a famous stomping ground for the glitterati and the photographers who trailed them during the 1960sdolce vitaperiod, after receiving a tipoff that Depardieu was dining there.In an interview after the alleged incident, Barillari said Depardieu, who was eating outside Harry’s Bar with a friend, Magda Vavrusova, became frustrated after he saw the paparazzo taking pictures of them.Barillari claimed that Vavrusova came towards him, followed by Depardieu, who allegedly punched the photographer three times, causing him to fall to the ground. Barillari was taken to hospital and treated for a wound close to his left eye.Barillari also alleged that Depardieu showed him the middle finger, threw an ice cube towards him and shouted an insult about Italians.Depardieu denied the claims, later telling La Repubblica that Barillari had pushed him. At the time, Delphine Meillet, a lawyer for Vavrusova, said her client had been “violently pushed” by Barillari and that Depardieu “fell and slid” on to the paparazzo after intervening.Valerio Aulino, a Rome-based lawyer representing Depardieu in the case, said on Tuesday he was unable to provide additional comment.In a career spanning more than six decades, Barillari has masqueraded as priests, gardeners and bricklayers in his quest to capture photos of the rich and famous, including Princess Margaret, Jackie Kennedy, the Beatles and Frank Sinatra. But he is also well-known for getting into altercations with his targets.“I can forgive his punches, but not the insult against Italians,” Barillari told the Italian news agency Adnkronos on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsGérard DepardieuItalyFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Local authorities said a man in his 30s was injured.According to Variety, a statement from the film’s production companies, Siglo Co Ltd and LesPros Entertainment Co Ltd, said the injured man was “a LesPros Entertainment production producer escorting the cast” and that he “was immediately transported to a local hospital by emergency services”. It added: “Medical examination confirmed fractures to the nose and parts of the body. Fortunately, the producer remained conscious and is currently in stable condition.”Still a police presence with tape around the scene where a palm tree fell on a Cannes Film Festival attendee who is now reportedly hospitalized.#Cannespic.twitter.com/9EeyMely1j— Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner)May 17, 2025A festival attendee, Marthy Fink, said the tree was blown over by the wind. “There was a terrible gust of wind and I heard a cry. It knocked a man to the ground, badly injuring him.”The producers said: “Given that the Cannes film festival remains ongoing, and the incident took place in a highly frequented area, we sincerely hope for a swift investigation into the cause and the implementation of preventative measures to ensure such accidents do not happen again in the future.”Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalFranceEuropeFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

No, not the already-infamous box office bombSnow White; the animated basis for that movie is a monumental achievement in the medium, but it’s ultimately a famous version of a timeless fairy tale that seems fair game for reinterpretation. Lilo & Stitch, however, is the rare sui generis piece of Disney animation – one that somehow emerged during a tumultuous time for the animation studio to become a substantial hit back in 2002.The film has endured because it’s a triumph of mixing techniques: old-fashioned ultra-expressive hand-drawn animation and watercolor backgrounds; dashes of newfangled computer animation to assist with some of its sci-fi-heavier scenes; and a story about a stranded alien befriending a misfit little girl that crosses ET with Looney Tunes anarchy.Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning review – world-saving Tom Cruise signs off with wildly entertaining adventureRead moreThe story is still there in the new sorta-live-action reimagining of Lilo & Stitch. The story is almost always still there in Disney’s series of self-remakes, especially when it comes to their more modern classics. (Say what you will about that recent Snow White, but it’s not a subservient recreation.) Plenty of dialogue is retained, too, and the movie does a fine job of transferring Stitch into a 3D live-action environment, not monkeying around with a near-perfect cartoon design. The fuzzy blue creature, his Muppet-with-teeth mouth and his alien-bunny ears intact, still endures. Kids will love him, as ever.The movie around him, however, is ghastly. It’s not just that Lilo (Maia Kealoha), a six-year-old Hawaiian girl living with her older sister Nani (Sydney Elizebeth Agudong), loses the carefully detailed and collaborative “performance” given by animators and her original voiceover in favor of kid-actor mugging and cutesy wisecracks. That’s not little Kealoha’s fault, of course, and possibly unavoidable in making a live-action version at all. But far worse, director Dean Fleischer Camp (Marcel the Shell with Shoes On) doesn’t give either the poor humans or special-effects characters any kind of visible technical support in their impossible task.That’s evident right away, in an opening sequence that serves as a model for how to lose the rhythm of a film even while following its blueprint nearly line-for-line. The scene where alien mad scientist Jumba (Zach Galifianakis) is brought before a galactic council to answer for his creation of Experiment 626, later named Stitch (still voiced by the character’s co-creator, Chris Sanders) biffs the timing on every beat, speed-running through the requisite exposition and Stitch’s subsequent escape in a jumble of barely-coherent cuts and stiffly rendered images of the earlier film’s whimsical designs. None of it really tracks unless you’ve already watched the cartoon.Camp’s seemingly panicked strategy never varies, even as the story slows down to examine the hectic lives of Lilo and Nani, orphaned sisters threatened with social-services separation unless young adult Nani can get (and keep) a better-paying job. The arrival of Stitch, who Lilo mistakes for a dog and adopts, brings chaos into their lives, though less havoc overall than this movie brings to its source material.Disney has allowed, maybe even encouraged, its film-makers to take a work known for its idiosyncratic beauty and humor, and cut it into a hash of coverage, where chintzy reaction shots are prioritized over the scenic beauty of Hawaii or how its residents might move through this world. When Jumba and his nerdier fellow alien Pleakley (Billy Magnussen) take human form to pursue Stitch on Earth (and also to save further on already cut-rate-looking visual effects), the movie can’t even be bothered to frame their funny walks clearly. Even more than some green-screen disasters, the actors feel as if they’re performing into a void.As Stitch grows into his broken family, the movie manages a few affecting and funny moments. But does it deserve credit for recreating them all from the earlier movie, almost always making them a little bit worse in the process? With a running time expanded by more than 20 minutes (as these things so often are), there should at least be room for a substantial round of brand-new Stitch antics. Yet the bits and pieces of new material barely seem to understand Stitch’s initially malevolent personality, recoding him as the untrained party animal he’s pretending to be. Occasional new ideas, like a ray gun that opens up shortcut portals, are squandered with first-idea-best-idea roughness.All told, there’s hardly a single smile in Lilo & Stitch ’25 not generated through the stolen valor of the earlier screenplay, and hardly a poignant moment that’s not more admirably raw in the G-rated version. That original film gave both Lilo and Nani some real anger and pain beneath their strife, with Stitch as a rampaging id not quite large enough to conquer the world. Camp’s remake wants to manage that pain more tidily, and give Nani in particular a more “correct”, entirely uninteresting ending. The 2002 film can stand comfortably alongside superficially similar but tonally distinct children’s stories like ET, The Iron Giant, and My Neighbor Totoro. Now, however, Lilo & Stitch steps forward from that crowd of modern classics – as the only one whose keepers didn’t bother to protect it from a cheap branded knockoff.Lilo & Stitch is out on 21 May in the UK, 22 May in Australia, and 23 May in the US.Explore more on these topicsWalt Disney CompanyFamily filmsAction and adventure filmsComedy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Seen at the Edinburgh international festivallast summer, The Fifth Step – his first playsince 2018– gives him a character both volatile and vulnerable in a two-hander bristling with playwright David Ireland’s signature style of knotty provocation and ribald comedy.Lowden resumes the role of Luka, now playing opposite Martin Freeman as James (a part originated in Scotland by Sean Gilder). Luka is new to Alcoholics Anonymous and asks the older James to be his sponsor; the drama unfolds on the verge of theconfessional stagein AA’s 12-step programme, with Luka expected to acknowledge the harm his addiction has done to himself and others.The play is perceptive about what it means to put your trust not just in another person but also in a programme or organised religion – and how to reconcile what you gain from the exchange with any flaws or failings of that body. Ireland pulls off a tone that is sceptical yet earnest, echoing the sincerity and hangdog humour of the opening song, I’m Just an Old Chunk of Coal (But I’m Gonna Be a Diamond Someday), by Johnny Cash, who knew a thing or two about addiction.View image in fullscreenVolatile … Jack Lowden in The Fifth Step.Photograph: Johan PerssonThat song is warped in the first of several scene transitions, coolly lit by Lizzie Powell, that add off-kilter energy to an in-the-round, interval-free production, stretched as tight as a drum by director Finn den Hertog. The humour ricochets as it did in den Hertog’sSquare Go, which tussled with younger masculinity, and there is a brilliantly handled apparition ofWillem Dafoeas Jesus in a gym (almost Christ on a bike) that recalls the vision of Gerry Adams in infant form in Ireland’s unforgettableCyprus Avenue.Designer Milla Clarke dresses Luka in hoodie and trainers, James in smart shirt and suede shoes; the younger man is all restless legs and twitching fingers, his sponsor composed and watchful. As ever, Freeman is a master of the perplexed reaction, especially in James’s multi-levelled incredulity at the suggestion that, as a married man, he has “pussy on tap”. When Luka is advised to abstain from his gargantuan appetite for masturbation, Lowden matches Freeman in comic disbelief – his eyes widen in horror at the proposal.The timing is impeccable throughout but as the tables are turned, and James’s behaviour is scrutinised, both give unsettling performances in a drama that specifically interrogates the role of a sponsor yet applies to multiple positions of authority and influence, including parenthood and priesthood. What appears at first to be a predictable plot twist, foreshadowed by a choice bit of dialogue from Raging Bull, swerves into something more psychologically interesting. The anonymous meeting-room set gives no place to hide as the pair, together on stage throughout, go toe to toe. If the violence that eventually erupts is undercharged, the notes of absurdity are perfectly measured and it ends not with a bang but whimsy.What power do you give another when you put your faith in them? What standards do you hold them to when you seek advice? When does care turn into control? As the questions proliferate and the pair argue over setting boundaries, Ireland continually blurs them in a play that regularly elicits winces. “Those that are crying will later be laughing,” paraphrases James from the Bible. The reverse is perhaps true for this troubling take on feeling lost and the thorny question of redemption.At@sohoplace, London, until 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndJack LowdenMartin FreemanDavid IrelandComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)reviewsShareReuse this content"

It wages an aggressive lovebombing campaign led by very likable lead Barbie Ferreira who shines as put-upon but good-hearted Lily, a home-help assistant first met bawling her eyes out when a misaddressed text reveals that the guy she’s been dating has cheated on her. Instead of following her (natural) first instinct to chew him out, she just chokes down her anger and texts “no problem!” in response to his feeble apology. Soon, it becomes clear that this is poor Lily’s usual modus operandi, especially when it comes to her louse of a father, Bob Trevino (French Stewart), who drags her along on his dates in order to make himself look more parental and nurturing than he actually is.When one such date goes badly, Bob shuns Lily, going so far as to effectively ban her from visiting the trailer park where he lives. (The story unfolds around the Kentucky-Indiana border, and precisely evokes the midwestern vibe without either patronising or pandering to the region.) While trying to reach him through Facebook, Lily ends up befriending an entirely different Bob Trevino (John Leguizamo), a construction industry manager who at first is just being polite but who comes to enjoy chatting with lonely Lily via the app messaging platform; this Bob Trevino “likes” some of her corny memes and posts, hence the title. The two develop a genuine but strictly platonic friendship that moves eventually to the real world, somewhat to the baffled bemusement of Bob’s wife Jeanie (Rachel Bay Jones).Writer-director Tracie Laymon lays on the message thickly about the value of chosen family members as opposed to allegiance to the cruddy ones you get stuck with at birth. Therefore it’s no surprise this has gone around the festival circuit pleasing crowds and winning audience awards. With quirky plot details, a patina of authenticity evoked by its handheld cinematography, and likable peripheral characters like Lily’s feisty wheelchair-using employer Daphne (Lauren “Lolo” Spencer), it is pure catnip for festival audiences. To knock its sentimental failings would be like kicking a puppy – and there are actual puppies in the film just to ensure it snags the heartstrings. Resistance is futile.Bob Trevino Likes It is on digital platforms from 23 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Almost everything on the map can be destroyed, and there is immediate fun to be had from causing merry mayhem with your truck, clattering through deckchairs on the beach or driving straight through the middle of a diner and watching it collapse spectacularly behind you. But there is a void at the heart of this game where the core hook should have been.We get a glimpse of its potential during a mission that sees you racing to catch up with a rival’s delivery truck before it can reach its destination. The aim is to manoeuvre alongside, and hold down a button so the crane on the back of your own truck can sneakily lift the package off their vehicle and on to yours. All the while, rival trucks are attempting to ram you off the road, and after you grab the package, you then have to deliver it while fending off the attentions of these other drivers. It leads to some wonderfully comic scenes in which a hotel owner thanks you profusely for a consignment while standing in front of the ruins of his newly destroyed establishment: a casualty of the violent act of delivery.View image in fullscreenKeep on truckin’ … Deliver at All Costs.Photograph: KonamiThis one frantic mission is by far the best part of the game, and if the rest of Deliver at All Costs followed a similar path – a Crazy Taxi-style mad dash against the clock between pickup and delivery, with whole neighbourhoods razed in pursuit of logistical efficiency – then there would no doubt be a few more stars stuck to this review. Instead each mission varies wildly in content and quality. Some are passably enjoyable, including one that involves taking photos of a UFO while avoiding its laser beam. Others are simply dull, such as one in which you deliver balloons tied to the back of your truck, which intermittently cause it to rise into the air: more irritating than entertaining. Zany does not equal fun.If all of that kind of thing had been confined to side missions while the main game was about zipping parcels back and forth as quickly as possible, it might have worked. But these hit and miss escapades are all we get, and by the final third, the concept of delivering things is ditched completely. Instead Deliver at All Costs tells a dim-witted story through relentless dull cut scenes, with writing and acting that veer from passable to downright rotten. Protagonist Winston Green is a man with a murky past who ends up at loggerheads with his boss, Donovan, before the game jumps the shark entirely and veers off into po-faced sci-fi nonsense. It doesn’t help that the permanently angry Winston is one of the most unlikable video game protagonists ever created.As in Grand Theft Auto, you can hop out of your car and explore, but here there’s hardly anything to find, save for a few viewpoints (which are just that) and a tiny handful of side missions. These range from fun (race a parachutist down a mountain) to boring (find a man who looks like the mayor). There is the occasional unique car to discover, but as you have to use your delivery truck for most missions, doing so is largely pointless. The novelty of driving around in, say, a hot dog van wears off in seconds. There are crates full of cash to find too, but there’s little of note worth buying. The shop sells spare parts you can use to assemble gadgets for your truck, but apart from the boost-giving jet engine, they’re mostly superfluous.It’s all so frustrating. Deliver at All Costs offers up a beautiful destructible playground, then barely utilises it, instead focusing on a bizarre, half-baked story that somehow ends in a courtroom drama. It feels like being invited to a glittering champagne reception, then getting collared by a conspiracy theorist who insists on describing the plot of his hokey sci-fi novel for the next eight hours.

There’s less emphasis on that aspect in this revival, but it’s fun anyway. We begin with Rex, a luxury estate agent from Surrey who is going to Bolton (“It’s a town up north somewhere” apparently) to become a market trader. Given his floppy hair, dainty shoes and adoption of the least convincing northern accent since Daphne in Frasier, he has his work cut out.Phil HarrisonWho Do You Think You Are?9pm, BBC OneA heavily pregnant Aisling Bea digs into her roots before bringing a new branch into the world. Tracing her lineage through County Laois to the remote Blasket Islands, she discovers strong women and Irish rebels: from a formidable, widowed farmer expanding her land to a great-grandfather who defied British rule.Ali CatterallThe British Blood Scandal: Poisoned at SchoolView image in fullscreenFour survivors of the infected blood scandal.Photograph: ITV9pm, ITV1A deep dive into the infected blood scandal centred on the Lord Mayor Treloar School and Hospital in Hampshire. Through the 1970s and 80s, hundreds of young haemophiliacs were given Factor VIII, a drug intended to cure their condition but that was, in fact, an effective death sentence.

In this passionate film, she visits Brontë country to discover why their stories were so disruptive.Hollie RichardsonMatlock9pm, Sky WitnessGive this reboot marks for ingenuity: undercover lawyer Kathy Bates only uses the name “Matlock” because her wily character is a fan of the old TV show.

This little Baltic island (pronounced Air-rue) in Denmark’s South Funen archipelago is home to some 6,000 fortunate residents who enjoy free bus services, shallow swimming beaches and picture-perfect villages. The 54 sq mile island has a history of building sailing ships and there is an excellent maritime museum, so it seemed appropriate to arrive on a historic wooden sailing boat, Peggy, aBristol pilot cutterbuilt in 1903.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“We’re going to Ærø without a plane,” quipped one crew member as we set the sails on leaving the German Baltic port of Kiel. Our overland journey from the UK had started with a 12-hour train trip from London to Cuxhaven, a German port on the North Sea; a short taxi ride to Cuxhaven marina; an overnight stay on Peggy in the marina; and then a two-day transit of the Kiel canal, the busiest in the world by number of vessels, with some 35,000 ships transiting annually.Aero sailing trip mapSails furled, Peggy puttered along at about six miles an hour with 150 metre-long container ships overtaking and looming toward us. The 61-mile (99km) canal, which saves some 500 miles on the route between Germany’s North Sea and the Baltic ports, was opened in 1895 when it was called the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Kanal. The Germans now know it as the Nord-Ostsee-Kanal but internationally it is called the Kiel canal after the Baltic port where construction began. Kaiser Wilhelm II introduced a tax on sparkling wine to help fund its operation.In the morning, we swam in the river, edged with waterlilies, before continuing to KielThe canal is mostly delightfully rural, edged by reeds. Beyond the banks and canalside cycle paths, a backdrop of trees bordered the waterway on both sides. An overnight stop at a junction with the River Eider navigation, on the Gieselau canal, was even more bucolic. Starlings flew in to roost and perform their evening murmurations, shape-shifting from sailing boat to love heart. The sun set behind trees while we ate dinner on deck. In the morning, we swam in the river, edged with waterlilies, before continuing to Kiel, the canal becoming less rural as we neared its eastern terminus.View image in fullscreenPaul Miles enjoying the sunshine on board Peggy.Photograph: Paul MilesThe next day, we sailed away from our overnight anchorage in Kiel Fjord, with the pale cream sails full of wind, Peggy looking resplendent in the afternoon sun. Only the captains, Peggy’s owners John Potter and Rachel Haynes, really knew what they were doing. The rest of us, their four willing crew, pulled ropes when asked or made cups of tea or gripped the tiller tightly. We kept course by heading for a landmark or following the compass or the route on a digital chart. Peggy may be old but she has modern navigation systems.The waves sloshed and slapped against the hull, the sails and boom creaked, and we sped along at seven knots. Sun lit our way though grumpy clouds loomed in the distance. Sailing is to balance on the knife-edge of the weather, harnessing the wind that, with one wrong push of the tiller, could swing the heavy boom and spell disaster. Skies to which you pay scant attention on land except perhaps to wonder “should we take a brolly?” seem full of weight out at sea. That dark bruise of cloud ahead might be rife with squalls. But the weather gods were kind, the wind a constant south-westerly blowing us on our way. There were plenty of sailing boats out in the fjord leaning into the 25 knots of wind but once we were on our way on the 37-mile crossing, we only saw a few other vessels, one of which was similarly from the history books with russet sails and a mizzen mast.That dark bruise of cloud ahead might be rife with squalls. But the weather gods were kindThree hours later, Ærø island appeared on the horizon, seemingly edged with tall sandy beaches. Closer to, it became clear that these were actually fields ripe for harvest. Six hours after leaving Kiel, the passage into the harbour at Marstal was marked with red and green buoys distinctively topped with supersize bottle brushes. They looked jolly and festive, and already Ærø felt special. We tied up in the harbour next to a seafood restaurant.Our waiter was a young man with a fish tattooed on the inside of his forearm. “It’s a trout,” he said. “It’s a reminder of the day my dad and I went fishing and I caught five but he only caught one.” The friendly staff and meal of lobster bisque, plaice and prawns, along with a rite-of-passage story, seemed a fitting celebration of our arrival by sailing boat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The maritime museum spreads across several historic buildings nearby. There are rooms full of model boats and photographs and paintings of tall ships that were built here. For children there are ship playgrounds, including one where the captain’s bridge appears to heave in a stormy sea. Another room is an art gallery of oil paintings by 19th-century naval artist JEC Rasmussen who was born in Ærø, depicting both the joys and horrors of life at sea: sailors caught in a tempest, taking an axe to their broken mast to stop things getting worse.We boarded the free community bus to the village of Ærøskøbing where, in the pedestrianised centre there are cosy, colourful centuries-old houses. Mullioned windows display wooden boats and porcelain dogs while hollyhocks grow between cobbles outside decoratively carved doors. We visited the whisky distillery and its courtyard cafe before heading for a swim at Vesterstrand beach where a jetty led out over eelgrass to a sand-bottomed, clear sea watched over by two dozen beach cabins of all shapes and colours. People arrived on bicycles for their daily swim.In the maritime museum, a volunteer, Lotte, had told us that many islanders, like her, are retirees. As well as swimming and sailing, “singing in choirs is a popular pastime”, she said. Ærø seemed heavenly and even more so without a plane.Paul Miles was a guest of Rachel Haynes and John Potter,owners of Peggy. For more information about Bristol pilot cutters, visitbcpcoa.com.

(In a similar vein, if your pie or tart involves mushrooms, take your lead fromFeast columnist Georgina Hayden, who uses butter flavoured with thyme and Marmite.)But back to Kellett’s pie. “Wilt the greens, squeeze out any moisture, then fold in crumbled feta, a couple of eggs and season really well.” You could also throw in some caramelised onions. “Put a couple of layers of filo painted with hot honey butter in an ovenproof dish [greased with more honey butter], add a third of the filling, then repeat with more filo and filling.”Finish with more filo, then sprinkle over a crisp, seedy topper (think everything bagel mix, or a mix of nigella, sesame and fennel seeds). “Bake until golden brown, crisp and bubbling up at the edges,” Kellett says, and that’s going to be a lot easier in the making and eating than a quiche: “For a picnic lunch, a filo pie is easily top of the list.” And, for something alongside, try tabbouleh studded with lots of fresh dill, parsley and coriander or, once summer proper hits, a tomato, pickled shallot and herb salad.If you have plenty of herbs to hand, meanwhile, plump for thisgoat’s cheese, artichoke and hazelnut numberby the Guardian’s Rukmini Iyer – one of her “favourite recipes for the column so far”. Blitz 30g flat-leaf parsley (stems and all), 20g mint, 20g basil, 15g chives and 50g chopped hazelnuts until smooth, then pour into a round pie dish lined with filo sheets that you’ve brushed with the oil from a jar of artichokes. Top with the artichokes themselves and teaspoonfuls of soft goat’s cheese dotted around and about, then scatter with more chopped hazelnuts and bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 25 minutes.For other cheesy greens, give peas a go: “Minted garden peas with grated lemon zest, whipped or baked ricotta, lots of herbs and spring onions is a really nice spring combo,” Kellett says, especially if you char the spring onions over an open flame first. “They’ll be silky, soft and sweet, and you can squidge them into the tart.”Chantelle Nicholson, who is behindBaked by Cordia, a microbakery and garden cafe in West Sussex, would also go for peas, paired with ricotta and mint, but she’d crush them, alongside some broad beans, too, “for texture” and throw in some onion seeds. Finally, there’s asparagus, and here Nicholson would be minded to combine the spears with parsley or dill in a bechamel base, and perhaps some caramelised onions, too, because, well, “You can’t ever really go wrong with those”.Got a culinary dilemma?
