Here, he remembers their heated rehearsals, the night they stayed up watching Jaws – and the last four cigarettes they smoked togetherPatrick MarberMon 1 Dec 2025 11.16 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 12.57 ESTShareTom was my hero from the night I first saw Travesties in 1979. I was 15. The older kids at school did a production of it and I was spellbound; it was glamorous, sensual and completely incomprehensible. I wanted to know everything about this cool, obscure playwright. I started in the school library with the Encyclopedia Britannica. Then I read Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (incomprehensible) and then I read a third of Jumpers before giving up (totally incomprehensible).As an English Lit student in the mid 1980s, I studied Stoppard and found his work slightly less incomprehensible. But in 1993, I saw the original production of Arcadia and felt that same spell I’d felt as a child. Let’s call it art. And beauty. And words spoken from a stage like no one else. A couple of years later, my first play, Dealer’s Choice, had just opened at the NationalTheatreand Tom was on the board. Someone told me: “Stoppard saw your play and mentioned it in some speech to donors as a good example of new writing at the NT.” A week or so later, I met him at a drinks do. He approached me.Heapproachedme. All hair and suit and cigs and warmth. He gave me a hug and told me I was a proper young playwright.‘He’d say, “Patrick, to be a playwright is to have one’s heart broken every day”’He was the rarest of men. Very few can carry off polite English gent and Jewish mensch simultaneously. Over the next 20 years, he saw all my work and I saw all of his. We corresponded by mail, had lunches, mutually commiserated our failures: “Patrick, to be a playwright is to have one’s heart broken every day.” Said with a grin, always. He made me lunch (pasta) at his big flat in Chelsea and then gave me notes on my new play, Howard Katz: “I don’t think you should kill him off at the end. Condemn him to life. Much better.”And then in 2015 everything changed. Or so it seemed. One night my mobile flashed: “Tom Stoppard.” It must be important. I was at the time “about my toilet” – but a call from Tom had to be answered and I calculated that even a man as clever as him would not divine my whereabouts.View image in fullscreen‘Glamorous and sensual’ … Tom Hollander and Clare Foster in Marber’s 2016 production of Travesties.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian“Patrick, it’s Tom.” “Hello Tom.” “Do you by any chance know my play Travesties?” “Yes I do. It’s marvellous.” “Oh, do you think so? Well, thank you. Now, the thing is that theMenier Chocolate Factorywould like to revive it next year.” “Great!” “Yes, it’s exciting. May I ask you something?” “Of course.” “Do you think Sam West would be a good director for it?”Pause. “He’s terrific, Tom. He did me very proud withhis revivalof Dealer’s Choice.” “Oh good! Thank you!”Before he rang off, I managed to blurt: “If for some reason Sam can’t do it, please will you consider my hat in the ring?”Two weeks later I was offered the job. I said a grateful “Yes” and then re-read the play for the first time in 36 years. It was incomprehensible. But I was doing it.Now we were working colleagues the relationship became more complicated. We had long, smoky meetings. I soon realised that to work closely with Tom, I should resume smoking. He smoked from dawn to bedtime and it seemed to me bad manners not to join in. We compared different drafts of Travesties, about a consular official’s adventures in 1917 Zurich. He was a serial “re-publisher”: he liked tinkering with each revival. Something to do with exerting authorial control over what were now set texts and established modern classics. He wrote some new lines forthis revivaland came to rehearsals almost every day.My wife, Debra, and I were often at the house in Dorset during the Travesties years. Tom and his beloved wife Sabrina were great hosts. Their garden was perfect. The sun shone. We often stayed up late watching TV. One night Jaws was on. Tom insisted we watch it. He declared it one of his favourite films. He knew it shot by shot: “Here comes the floating head.” Every morning, the newspapers arrived. He read them all day. He was possibly the last man in England to do this. He spoke with love of his early days in Bristol as a journalist.‘We’d be working on a scene and out of nowhere he’d shout, “I hate this, I hate it!”’Tom had famously good manners and was extremely generous. It took me years of accepting his hospitality before he let me pay for a meal. And there were many. But there was one place where he didn’t always have good manners – the rehearsal room. I had been warned by others who had directed his work. And so it proved, startlingly at times. We’d be working a scene, stumbling, trying things out and out of nowhere he’d shout: “I hate this, I hate it!” The whole room would fall silent. I’d go over to his table, whisper: “We’re just exploring an idea. It probably won’t make it into the show.” He’d look up, longsuffering: “Please let it not.” And then he’d be completely charming for the rest of the day.Over the following years of working together, we never discussed his outbursts. I think it was the only thing we never discussed. But once he trusted that I cared about the play as much as he did, he became angelic. I loved him for baring his teeth. I loved his passion for the work and his tough love for getting it right. There was a preview of a show in which an actor had struggled a bit with their performance – lines, blocking and so on. At the interval, Tom whispered in my ear: “He’s like a dormouse in a hurricane.” I loved discovering that he wasn’t always nice. His occasional acts of contempt made me feel like a proper collaborator. Inside the tent.View image in fullscreen‘He smoked from dawn to bedtime’ … breaking the rules, in a moment captured by Marber.Photograph: Patrick MarberAnyway. Travesties was a hit and Tom was thrilled and perhaps slightly surprised. I think he thought my production was a bit “out there” but he was delighted it had worked. Some time after we opened, he phoned and asked if I was at home. He said he had a delivery for me. An hour later, he arrived with a big antique corner chair which he carted into our flat. The chair had belonged toPeter Wood, the original director of Travesties; it was the chair Tom had always sat in when Peter was giving him notes. And now it was mine. My children thought of Tom as the chair delivery man thereafter.Travesties transferred to the West End and thenBroadway. In spring of 2018, Tom and I were standing smoking on West 42nd Street. Travesties was in preview and it was intermission. He quietly mentioned that he was jabbing in the dark with a new play. The humility was typical. A new Stoppard play was headline news and had been so since the late 1960s. Yet here was the globally acknowledged magician suggesting that he was “having a go” like some novice.Ever since I’d begun preparing Travesties (back in the summer of 2016) Tom had been desperate to write a new play. He often exclaimed so with considerable frustration. At one point during that period, he said that if he couldn’t write a new one, he might as well be dead. I took it that he meant it in a writerly sense. Tom was a natural born playwright. He didn’t really regard his screenplays, lectures or talks as proper writing. They were just distractions from the real thing.In April 2019, the new play – later titledLeopoldstadt– arrived; old-style, hard copy in the post. A note from his long-term secretary: “Tom asked me to send you this.” I sat down and read the new one. And then I sat in silence for an hour, overwhelmed. Elated for him that he’d written it, and elated that he and his producer Sonia Friedman were asking me to direct it.The first read-through of the new play occurred that summer. Tom, me, Sabrina, Sonia and Debra round a table in Dorset. Tom played the leading role of Hermann. We did the others. It was jovial and merry despite the material. All of us happy that Tom had pulled this late great play out of the bag. (Sidebar: I am using cliches like the above in tribute to him. I once queried his use of a tired old phrase somewhere and he said: “I like cliches! I use them often. With my work it helps for the audience to know where they are now and then.”)So we read the play and it was going quite well, but then in the last scene I broke down in tears as I tried to read one particular line about the decimation of Jewish life in Vienna. The women comforted me with tissues and hugs. Tom not a bit. I thought he’d be pleased that his director was so moved by his play. Not at all. I was stopping the flow. He allowed me a moment to mop up and then plunged back in, taking over my role.And this is the thing: it does Tom a disservice if his generosity of spirit, his kindness, his charm are the only story. In truth, he could be tough as an old boot. Tomáš Sträussler. Czech refugee. A fatherless Jewish boy who came to England aged eight and encountered rife antisemitism in his new home. A man whose stepfather, Major Stoppard, never bothered to see a single one of his plays and then wanted Tom to lose the name “Stoppard” as soon as his beloved mother had passed away. At the time, Tom was a globally revered playwright. He told the major that losing the name “might be somewhat inconvenient”.View image in fullscreen‘He told me he was jabbing in the dark with a new play’… Stoppard and, right, Marber at the Broadway opening of Leopoldstadt.Photograph: Bruce Glikas/WireImageThere was rage and pain and iron in Tom. It’s in the plays, it was in the man too. His famous remark about having lived “a charmed life” has always struck me as double-edged. “Charmed” is a lovely word for it. The implications are of luck and magic, but also something haunting, as if the life lived was not entirely his own. Leo, the character in Leopoldstadt based on Tom, uses the phrase too. But Tom told me that the key line in the play, the motor for him of the whole thing, is said by the tortured Holocaust survivor, Nathan. A line spoken in accusatory scorn to Leo: “No one is born eight years old …” And then: “But you live as if without history, as if you throw no shadow behind you.” This brave, painful play, the last Tom wrote, was him looking at his own dark shadow. It’s all there in an article he wrote for Talk magazine in 1999. He had the play in prototype two decades before he wrote it. He turned facts into poetry.Anyway. Leopoldstadt began rehearsals in December 2019, opened in London the following February thenclosed seven weeks later for lockdown. Tom made some cuts, did a few rewrites and we reopened in August 2021. We finally opened in New York in October 2022.When we’d done Travesties he was still pretty vigorous, but Tom was 85 now and stairs were a menace. He would sometimes take my arm in the street. I no longer let him get a cab without putting him in it. But we had fun. There was smoking and drinking and eating. There was gossip and his incredible stories of times gone by. There were old pals to see and a company of actors young and old who adored him. But he was also having nightmares and talking about his own death. Regularly. As if he saw it on the horizon. We talked about the next play. He had ideas but none that were ready to be written. He won hisfifth, record-breaking Tonyin the summer of 2023 and I found myself thinking maybe he’s made of some other stuff and he’ll simply live for ever. But he got ill in early 2024 and the slow descent commenced.View image in fullscreen‘It travels beautifully through time’… Ramsay Robertson and Faye Castelow in Leopoldstadt.Photograph: Marc BrennerAbout a year ago, I was at the flat in London. He’d stopped smoking – a very worrying sign. Said he just didn’t feel like it. He said he occasionally had the odd puff but couldn’t finish them. He was thin. Very thin. But all there. In his gown and slippers. Something Chekhovian about him. Anyway. Sabrina had gone out leaving us to ourselves. He told me it was fine to smoke, would welcome the old reek of it, so I did. He eyed my packet and asked if he could have one. I hesitated. I really didn’t want to be responsible for killing the greatest living playwright. He insisted. We smoked four fags each, back to back. He was chuckling away. Guilty schoolboy. Then he said he was very tired now and would I help him to bed. I walked him to the bedroom and tucked him in. I gave him a hug. Told him I loved him. He said the same. I saw him many times again after this, but it was the last time I saw him alone.Since Tom died, so many actors we worked with on these two plays have texted and emailed to express their love for him, their admiration, their sense of joy to have worked with him. I feel all this too. It was the greatest honour and luck of my life to spend these years directing and redirecting two staggering plays by Tom Stoppard.Travesties and Leopoldstadt travel beautifully through time; the young become old, people love and kill, the world keeps flipping its coin; war and peace. All this life from plays set in one room in a middle European city in the first half of the 20th century.Well, of course. The playwright was born in former Czechoslovakia in the summer of 1937. A part of him was always there. No one escapes their childhood. Not even a genius can do that. Rest in peace, Tom.Explore more on these topicsTom StoppardTheatrePatrick MarberWest EndMenier Chocolate FactorySonia FriedmanBroadwayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thanatos. Up till now it’s been tempting to giveLabourthe benefit of the doubt. That being in opposition for 14 years has made them ring-rusty. That they’ve forgotten how this government thingy works. Hadn’t quite realised they were supposed to be in charge.But now it’s beginning to look like Labour has a death wish. Not that it doesn’t quite know how to run the country, more that it is hell-bent on self-destruction. This isn’t a matter of incompetence: it’s a deliberate act of self-sabotage. Almost as if it doesn’t quite believe it deserves to be in office, or is too self-conscious to be in power. The opposition benches are its feelgood safe space.How else to explain the feeling of chaos that has underscored much of the last year and a half or so and drowned out the good things that have been achieved? First it was the freebies – from a party that had promised to be different from the Tories. Then there were the U-turns over cuts to benefits.But this was all a warm-up for the main event. The budget megashambles. Months of leaks, briefings and press conferences, some of which only took place to reverse-ferret on what had been said in previous leaks, briefings and press conferences. A timeline on when the Office forBudgetResponsibility delivered its report that is at best confused.OK, the reaction from the Tories and some lobby journalists has been deranged. The idea that Rachel Reeves was somehow deliberately misleading the country and was guilty of market manipulation is a characteristically desperate response fromKemi Badenoch.There’s no stick that Kemi can’t find the wrong end of. She now has the alarm set on her phone to remind her to call for the chancellor’s resignation every four hours. It’s also a bit much for her to expect the country to forgive and forget what the Tories did to the economy quite so quickly.But a less shambolic lead up to the budget could have nipped all this in the bud. Done away with days of speculation about the budget process and focused people’s minds on the substance instead. The arguments could have been about the choices made, and forced the Conservatives and other opposition parties to defend themselves.Instead Labour’s Thanatos turned it into open season onKeir Starmerand Reeves. A licence for everyone to miss the point and give them a kicking.Still. While there is life, there is hope. On Monday, Keir was to be found raging against the dying of the light as he popped up in a London community project to give the budget speech he rather wished Rachel had delivered last Wednesday. To cut through the nonsense and frame the debate on his terms. To escape the laughable idea that the economy had never been in better shape before Labour got their mitts on it, which Kemi and Mel Stride are trying to peddle. If they believe that, they need help.This had been a budget to unlock the country’s potential, Starmer began. To mend public services that had been broken by the Tories. To fix the cost of living crisis. It was a matter of personal pride to end child poverty by lifting the ‘abhorrent’ two-child benefit cap. A moral mission.All of which sounded good, until you remembered that this had never been in the Labour manifesto. It was less than a year ago that Keir was suspending the whip from backbench MPs who were rebelling against government plans to keep the two-child cap in place.So, if it was a moral mission, it was a relatively new one for Keir. But better one sinner that repenteth and all that. And it did put clear blue water between him and Kemi. The Tories had put an extra 900,000 children into poverty. Labour would cut that by 500,000.And Starmer wanted to hear a little less from Kemi about the “Benefits Street” budget. Not only was it a bit much coming from the party that had increased the welfare bill to record levels, but also the Tories had no idea that two-thirds of payments went to people already working. This wasn’t about giving handouts to people who couldn’t be bothered to find work.“This was the story of the budget,” he said. Yes, he knew he was asking a lot by raising taxes. But better that than cutting public services and not having adequate fiscal headroom.And while he was on the subject, it was the Tories who had been responsible for Britain’s low productivity. Growth had been weak for years and it would have been helpful if the OBR had done a productivity review at the end of the last government rather than 16 months into the new one.But he was getting used to clearing up after the Tories. He would beat the gloomy forecasts. He would grow the economy with a customs union with the EU that wasn’t a customs union. If only someone had told him Brexit was a disaster.Predictably, most of the questions from journalists ignored the speech and went back to the process. Had the chancellor been guilty of misleading the country by claiming there was a “black hole” in the finances when the OBR had already told her the outlook was not so bleak?You’ll be astonished to hear that Keir didn’t think so. There was still the productivity gap. There was still the fiscal headroom. And there were still public services to maintain. Though the welfare bill would be going down at some stage without cutting the welfare bill because that might upset his backbenchers.It was like this: there was no deliberate attempt to hoodwink the country. It was just Labour’s death wish at play. People just had to get used to the chaos. It was hardwired into the government. Just learn to look past the shambles and try to see the good things. Through a glass darkly. Keir was hopeful, he said doubtfully. We were over the worst. Labour was looking for a reason to believe in itself.

Pam’s tenure on this earth is a trawl through just about every significant cultural and creative moment in the UK over the last 30-odd years. One of our most groundbreaking artists, Pam was a colourist of Warholian proportions, creating art to be hung on the body rather than the walls of a gallery. She was a punk who provocatively mashed up gender and sexual stereotypes. Fashion was the art form that freed her imagination, and her success was due to her talent and drive being greater than her disdain of the conformist industry and the gatekeepers surrounding it.I sat in St Joseph’s hospice in London by her unconscious but serenely beautiful figure – as if she’d made her exit into another work of art – telling her that her jam-packed life was characterised by creativity, independence, courage and kindness. “Hoggy, you left absolutely nothing on the table.”Though I’m twice her size, I’d inevitably be greeted with, ‘Irvine … ma wee darlin’ …’Born in Paisley into a close-knit family, the young Pam was a feisty ingredient added to a soup already brimming with fabric, colour and design. Often seeming on the verge of being swallowed up by Glasgow, Paisley retains its fierce independent spirit; shaped by textiles, political activism, a strong civic culture and aesthetic sensibility. “There was no art in our house, but there was always a sense of adventure, imagination, and an openness to be ourselves,” Pam told me. “My father taught me to be unafraid to be different.”View image in fullscreenHogg DJing in 2006.Photograph: Richard Young/ShutterstockGlasgow School of Art was a revelation. “It seemed crazy that there was an institution where you would go to do what I loved best. It drew me in like a life force.” London then called, but the Royal College of Art was secondary to her development.The Blitz club, with its Steve Strange-policed door policy – dress fabulously and outrageously – proved the real catalyst for Pam’s fashion future. “London club life seized my imagination. That’s when I started designing with a purpose. I may not have chosen fashion … but fashion had chosen me.”She possessed a photogenic beauty and wild charisma that few of her models could matchI first ran into her on a wet 1980s Soho night. My girlfriend (stylish) and I (less so) were fretting about getting into the Wag Club. I was completely unknown to her, but Pam – whose collections were by now stocked at Harrods, Harvey Nichols and stores in Paris, Milan, Rome and Tokyo – clocked my accent and said, “Come in with us …” So, through those doors we accompanied that glamorous London “face” with the weedgie accent.View image in fullscreenHogg with her Spring Summer runway show at London Fashion Week, 2019.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/ShutterstockAs I struggled through ill-suited jobs (all of them), Pam went stellar. The years between 1985 and 1989 saw six collections, culminating in her iconic i-D magazine cover. Opening her own Soho boutique cemented her status as a fashion pioneer, with Debbie Harry, Siouxsie Sioux, Björk and Kylie all becoming ambassadors for those skin-tight designs. In 1990, with Terry Wogan introducing her on his show, Pam had moved from cult to mainstream.Or not.View image in fullscreenHogg with Siouxsie Sioux at the Q awards in 2011.Photograph: Richard Young/ShutterstockThe fashion world was at her feet, but her punk antennae were agitated. A raunchy guitarist and singer who loved rock’n’roll, she stepped away from it all, forming the band Doll and taking them on the road. We became close friends in the 90s – touring together, clubbing and partying in the way those times demanded. Possessing a photogenic beauty and wild charisma that few of her models could match, she also had a hunger to perform. I loved how her sass was complemented with a deep humility and capacity for genuine engagement with people. From a Hackney squat to a Manhattan rooftop, it thankfully seemed no party or club on the planet was safe from Hoggy rocking up.View image in fullscreenHogg at a Primal Scream gig in 2008.Photograph: Richard Young/ShutterstockHer nose for a phoney unparalleled, Pam never wanted an infrastructure of staff, administrators and financiers, and self-funded many shows to retain creative control. Those principles cost, heaping stress on her as she operated her sewing machine in her Hackney workshop, literally until her fingers bled and stiffened with arthritis.Life now seemed to be mainly about bands and DJing, but the art world hadn’t forgotten her. Her work featured in the 2006 exhibition Switch on the Power, alongside that of Yoko Ono, Andy Warhol, Leigh Bowery and Kraftwerk. ThenKylie Minogue’s 2010 appearancein Pam’s metal-studded catsuit shoehorned her back to the top table she’d always sat ambivalently at. I largely missed this comeback, having moved overseas and only intermittently hooked up with her on return visits home. Though I’m twice her size, I’d inevitably be greeted with, “Irvine … ma wee darlin’ …”She sailed through the 2010s on a flotilla of hit shows and awards, using her talents topay tribute to Pussy Riotduring the Russian Olympics, and followed other elite artists like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin in designing Brit Award statuettes.

Immediately after lockdown, the first social event was Terry Hall’s curation of a city of culture gig in Coventry. Pam and I headed to the Midlands along with Pete Doherty and the Fat White Family. It was a fabulous occasion: none of us were great at being locked up.Fashion designer Pam Hogg: ‘Just don’t call me normal’Read moreI attended her last show,Of Gods and Monsters, which was exhibited in London and described by Keyi magazine as, “a profound reflection on humanity, resilience, and the necessity for change … Pam Hogg’s exhibition reminds us that fashion can be both beautiful and deeply political, a tool for activism as much as aesthetic expression.” That year, 2024, she fittingly received the Icon award for services to fashion and philanthropy. “To accept this award is to highlight and aid in the unacceptable struggles of all children here and around the globe,” Pamsaid when accepting it. “This has to end.” Devastated by the mass murder of children in Palestine, Pam posted prolifically about this, when personal survival might have been her main concern, as it was now obvious that she was struggling with her health.View image in fullscreenWireless festival at Hyde Park in London in 2008.Photograph: Joanne Davidson/ShutterstockOn a canal walk in east London, she told me her situation.

Even when her condition hospitalised her, and she weighed less than the tracksuit she wore, she asked me to bring in some weights in order to build up her muscle tone. Pam’s massive heart was spared the ache of knowing thatour mutual friend Manidied less than 48 hours before her. We’d both attended the funeral of his wife, the wonderful Imelda, just two years ago. Like Mani, Pam had time for absolutely everyone. The Paisley Princess occasionally enjoyed swaggering through the doors her fame opened but never, ever, wanted them slammed in anybody else’s face.

Now the 3,000 unsung heroes who raised the famous skyscraper are finally being celebratedCatherine SlessorMon 1 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 10.27 ESTSharePoised on a steel cable a quarter of a mile above Manhattan, a weather-beaten man in work dungarees reaches up to tighten a bolt. Below, though you hardly dare to look down, lies the Hudson River, the sprawling cityscape of New York and the US itself, rolling out on to the far horizon. If you fell from this rarefied spot, it would take about 11 seconds to hit the ground.Captured by photographer Lewis Hine, The Sky Boy, as the image became known, encapsulated the daring and vigour of the men who built the Empire State Building, then the world’s tallest structure at 102 storeys and 1,250ft (381m) high. Like astronauts, they were going to places no man had gone before, testing the limits of human endurance, giving physical form to ideals of American puissance, “a land which reached for the sky with its feet on the ground”, according to John Jakob Raskob, then one of the country’s richest men, who helped bankroll the building.Like astronauts, they were going to places no man had gone beforeKnown for his empathic studies of workers, artisans and immigrants, Hine was hired to document the development of the Empire State Building during its breakneck 13-month construction period from 1930-31. Along with formal portraits of individual workers, he recorded men animatedly performing their jobs: drilling foundations, wrestling with pipes and cables, laying bricks and navigating precipitous steel beams as the colossal skyscraper took shape above Manhattan.Today, visitors to the Empire State can take selfies with bronze sculptures of old-timey construction fellows, wreathed in a confected soundscape of “ironworkers and masons shouting over the din of machinery, moving steel beams into position, and tossing hot rivets into place”. This genuinely heroic feat of construction has long been commodified into a yet another visitor experience.View image in fullscreenDeath-defying … the 1931 image that became known as The Sky Boy – although Hine called it Icarus, High Up on Empire State.Photograph: Lewis W Hine/George Eastman HouseHistory valorises the ambitious, affluent men who commissioned the Empire State, including Alfred Smith, a former governor of New York and Democratic presidential candidate. It also valorises its architects, Messrs Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, who alighted on a distinctive art deco style, with prefabricated parts designed to be duplicated accurately in quantity and then brought to site and put together in a similar manner to a car assembly line.The men in dungarees raised the steel frame as others – carpenters, glaziers, stonemasons – followedYet the men who assembled those parts – 3,000 workers toiled on site each day – are largely unknown and unsung. Even The Sky Boy – for all his romantic allure “lifted like Lindbergh in ecstatic solitude”, as one commentator rhapsodised – remains unidentified. The man in dungarees was simply part of a gang of structural ironworkers, who raised the building’s steel frame, leading the way upward as other tradesmen – carpenters, glaziers, tilers and stonemasons – followed in their wake.A tight-knit fraternity of Scandinavians, Irish-Americans and Kahnawà:ke Mohawks, the ironworkers were self-proclaimed “roughnecks”, undisputed kings of constructional derring-do. As the New York Times writer CG Poore put it at the time, they spent their days “strolling on the thin edge of nothingness”.View image in fullscreenNonchalant … Victor ‘Frenchy’ Gosselin in an image that was used on stamps.Photograph: Lewis W HineFleshing out the men behind the myth, a new book called Men at Work throws light on the lives and opinions of a small fraction of this forgotten workforce. “My father’s office was in the Empire State Building, so I grew up visiting it,” says the author Glenn Kurtz. Familiar with Hine’s images, his interest was further piqued by a small plaque tucked into a corner of the opulent main lobby, bearing the names of 32 men who had been singled out for “craftsmanship awards” for their work on the building.“Hine’s portraits play such an important role in the mythology surrounding not only the Empire State Building, but also 1930s America in general,” says Kurtz. “I was astonished to learn that no one had ever inquired about the men pictured.”Bringing them into focus was no easy task. Construction workers frequently led itinerant lives, to escape “the coarse grain of official attention”. Employment records from the era were rarely preserved, and the private lives of ordinary people remained largely undocumented. This made it hard to properly record the number of people who died during the building’s creation. Although the official figure is five, Kurtz believes at least eight people perished: seven construction workers (one of which was judged a suicide) and one passerby, Elizabeth Eager, who was hit by a falling plank.Delving into census data, immigration and union records, contemporary newspaper accounts and the personal recollections of their descendants, Kurtz illuminates Hine’s images in new ways, conjuring backstories of men who, as he puts it, “until now, have been used solely as the embodiments of generalities and abstract ideals”.View image in fullscreenPride of New York … the finished item lit in rainbow colours to celebrate Pride Day last year.Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty ImagesTake Victor “Frenchy” Gosselin, whose specialist skill was as a “connector”, catching a suspended beam and moving it into place to be attached to the building’s steel frame. A rare conjunction of personal details and exhilarating photos elevated Gosselin beyond the usual anonymity of the “devil-may-care cowboy of the skies”. Hine shot him nonchalantly straddling a hoisting ball in shorts and work boots, à la Miley Cyrus, an image that featured on a US Postal Service stamp in 2013.Kurtz elaborates on the trajectory of Gosselin’s life and sudden death aged 46 in a car accident, leaving a widow and two young sons. “Distinguishing Victor Gosselin, the man, from the figure in Hine’s iconic photograph does not make him any less heroic,” he argues. “Instead, it allows us to see the photograph more fully, and it roots Gosselin’s genuine heroism in a real life, tragically short and mostly unknown, rather than in a fantasy.”View image in fullscreenHonoured … the plaque in the main lobby, bearing the names of 32 men who received ‘craftsmanship awards’.Photograph: Lewis W HineThere are other no less compelling histories. Vladimir Kozloff, born in Russia, who throughout the 1930s served as secretary for the House Wreckers Union, and was active in winning protections for workers in this highly perilous profession. Or Matthew McKean, a carpenter who emigrated from Scotland, leaving behind his wife and two children. Or terrazzo craftsman Ferruccio Mariutto, who at the time of his stint on the Empire State had been in the US only two years. Like many workers, he died relatively young, just before his 64th birthday, probably of mesothelioma related to asbestos exposure.Kurtz saves his most controversial speculation until last: that the unknown Sky Boy was a man called Dick McCarthy, a second-generation American, grandson of Irish immigrants, living in Brooklyn, who died in 1983. Although Hine never left any clues in his notes, comparison of images of McCarthy and the Sky Boy point up a tantalising physical resemblance.“Considering the worldwide fame of this photo, it’s astonishing we do not know the name of the man,” says Kurtz. “His use as a symbol almost precludes attention to him as an actual person. We may never know the truth, but I’d say I have 50% confidence in my conjecture.”Narratives of architecture tend to disregard the human cost of construction. History is made by the few, not the many. “The lives and experience of actual workers are marginalised,” says Kurtz. “They are too ‘ordinary’ to be interesting. Yet their skill, their training, and the specific conditions of their workplaces, are all profoundly important to architectural history. They are how every building gets built.”Men at Work: The Untold Story of the Empire State Building and the Craftsmen Who Built It by Glenn Kurtz (Seven Stories Press, £25).

And it’s this sentiment that has carried through to the couple’s restaurant, Gina, which opened in Chingford, east London, earlier this year, a process they documented in their newsletter, Club Gina.Named after Taiano’s late mother, it is very much a neighbourhood joint, Gill points out, with the food – from pithiviers and vol au vents to Gina’s pasta with tomato sauce, half a roast chicken with little gems and aioli to share on Sundays, and slabs of “Ravi’s” chocolate cake – an extension of how the couple like to eat.“We’ve never not had people around,” says Gill, who grew up in an Indian family nearby. His is half Italian, half Jewish. “Our cultures are both very much about food and being around the table,” she says. “At home, it depended on the time of day but there was always something to eat: samosas and pakoras in the afternoon, and full-blown curries and rotis in the evening.”Entertaining together, though, happens more by accident than design. “We don’t do it deliberately,” explains Gill. “We just gather a group of friends through various conversations throughout the day, and they end up at our flat.” A definite perk of having chefs as friends.So, what can you expect from dinner at Gill and Taiano’s? “First, take your shoes off,” insists Gill. Bring a bottle: “We don’t drink.” If you also come armed with “deli things” that the couple can crack into after you’ve gone, then all the better. “We always make a nice table and get a playlist on,” adds Gill, but it’s very much food-focused, “so don’t be late because I will have made sure the food is ready for your arrival”.There will be crisps, of course, but otherwise think sharing bowls of pastas (“You’ve got to do it well, though,” warns Taiano) or a nice joint of meat to plonk in the middle of the table with some sort of potatoes, usually dauphinoise – “Just something slow cooked that you can put in the oven and sort of forget about,” says Taiano, with their braised lamb shoulder (see below) being a prime example.But who’s in charge when the two chefs cook at home? “I mostly do the food,” says Taiano, although it won’t exactly be a surprise to learn that Gill – who is also a judge on Junior Bake Off, taking over from Prue Leith in 2021, and former pastry chef at London institution St John – is always on dessert.This, she says, doesn’t need considerable planning, but don’t do anything daft like try a new recipe for the first time just hours before everyone turns up. “You just want a big sharing dessert,” she says, which in the winter months could be a choux tower (“They’re easy”); the giant of the crowd-pleasers, sticky toffee pudding; or even a toffee apple self-saucing pudding (“Everybody loves that”).That said, having people over all the time was “getting quite mental in the flat”, admits Gill, especially when the self-confessed cleaning obsessive was often faced with a three-day clean-up operation. “Mattie cooks these incredible feasts, but the kitchen is then turned upside-down,” she sighs. “He made a Thai meal and there was sticky fish sauce down and inside all the cupboards … I just couldn’t believe it.”The arrival of their son, Donnie, two years ago also changed things: “It’s difficult in a one-bed flat; we can’t have noisy guests because we don’t want them to wake our son – I can’t wait to get a house and have doors!”In the meantime, their entertaining itch is being scratched at Gina. “We thought, oh we’ll just have a restaurant, that will be easier,” laughs Gill. Their generosity has hit their profits, though. “We did get into trouble last month, because our comp bill was just too large – but it is in our nature to be hospitable.”It’s a statement her home fridge might disagree with right about now. “I was thinking yesterday that we haven’t cooked in our home since we started the restaurant ... If you open the fridge right now, there’s a box of Ferrero Rocher, some milk, rhubarb jam, a sourdough starter, and Pierre Marcolini chocolates,” adds Gill. “It’s really empty. Well, empty, but very clean, of course.”As told to Anna BerrillBraised lamb shoulderView image in fullscreenPrep10 minCook2 hr 30 min+Rest30 minServes4-52 tbspduck fat1.8kglamb shoulderon the bone (or ½ lamb shoulder), removed from the fridge an hour before cookingSaltand black pepper1 large onion, peeled and diced2 large carrots, peeled and cut into 5cm pieces2celery sticks, roughly chopped4garlic cloves, peeled and roughly choppedA few sprigs of rosemaryand thyme2plum tomatoes from a tin, crushed250ml white wine500ml fresh chicken stockEverything can be made two to three days before and reheated to serve. The dish will benefit from sitting in the fridge for a few days. If you do this, the fat will set on top of the liquid in the pan, making it easier to remove before reheating.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4. In a heavy-bottomed deep casserole dish or pan with a lid, heat the duck fat until smoking – be careful.Season the lamb all over with salt and pepper, then add the meat to the pan skin side down, placing it away from you to avoid splattering. Let it brown on one side before repeating on the other, then remove from the pan and set aside on a plate.In the same pan, add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic and herbs. Season, then stir over a medium heat until they turn golden. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, cook for two minutes, then add the white wine and bring to the boil. Pour in the stock and 200ml water, and bring back to the boil.Return the lamb to the pan and cover with parchment, followed by the lid. Place in the oven for two to three hours, until the meat is tender and soft when probed with a knife.Let the lamb rest for half an hour before removing from the pan, putting it on a plate. Skim the fat from the top of the braising liquid and discard, then ladle the juices over the lamb. Serve with the hot dauphinoise on the side.

Alternatively, you can bake the dauphinoise at the same temperature as the lamb, but you will need to add 10-15 minutes to the cooking time.Place the potatoes in a large bowl of water to wash off any excess starch, then drain. In a large, deep pan, combine the double cream, milk, herbs and garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Gently heat the mixture until it’s steaming, but not boiling.Add the sliced potatoes to the pan and stir to coat them in the cream mixture. Bring to a gentle boil, then pour the mixture into a gratin dish (we use a large, round, shallow 26cm Le Creuset pan). Cover with a piece of parchment, ensuring it touches the surface of the potatoes, then bake for 45 minutes to one hour, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife and show no resistance.Remove the parchment and return the dish to the oven for a further 10 minutes to get a nice golden colour on top.

The chancellor is trying to use the chair of the OBR as her human shield. But I will not let her.”Pete Wishart, the SNP’s deputy leader at Westminster, said: “The head of the OBR has taken responsibility, and resigned, to restore confidence after the budget leak. The head of the BBC took responsibility and resigned. Why is Rachel Reeves refusing to do the same?”Government insiders, however, rejected the attempt to link the OBR leak with the chancellor’s decisions over the budget. “Now the Tories have suddenly decided they are the great defenders of the OBR? Laughable and totally unserious,” one source said.In a major speech on Monday, setting out the government’s economic plans in the run-up to the next election, the prime minister attempted to secure Reeves’s position. Many in Westminster feel that Starmer’s fate is inextricably linked with the chancellor’s.In the run-up to the budget she had indicated that she was planning to increase income tax rates, pointing to gloomy productivity forecasts. When that plan was dropped, the Treasury briefed journalists that the decision was the result of a rosier outlook.But last week the OBR revealed it had already told the Treasury that its downgrade to productivity would be offset by higher incomes, which in turn boosted the government’s tax receipts.In response, Starmer said the OBR’s productivity downgrade had left the government with a “starting point” of £16bn less than it would otherwise have been, and that he had also wanted to maintain public spending, ease the cost of living and double the fiscal headroom.“It was inevitable that we would always have to raise revenue, so there’s no misleading there,” he told reporters. “There was a point at which we thought, myself included, that we might have to reach for a manifesto breach of some significance.“As the process then continued, it became clear to me and others that we might be able to do what we needed to do with our priorities without that manifesto breach.”Starmer said he was proud to be tackling the cost of living through cuts to energy bills, freezing rail fares and boosting the minimum wage. He added that lifting the two-child benefit cap was “a moment of personal pride for me”.“On the substance of the budget, I’d defend it any day of the week. They’re the right steps for our country and I’m proud that we’ve taken them,” he said.But he acknowledged there were still significant challenges ahead. “I will level with you, as the budget showed, the path to a Britain that is truly built for all requires many more decisions that are not cost-free, and they’re not easy.”Setting out his plans for the rest of this parliament, Starmer said he believed “we do need to get closer” to the European Union. He also admitted the welfare system must be reformed, after attempts earlier this year failed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, because the organisation was using a particular add-on to the WordPress publishing system, the link ended up being live, unbeknownst to the OBR itself.The forecaster confirmed the market-sensitive report was accessed 43 times from 32 different devices in the hour before the chancellor’s speech.More damagingly, the inquiry found this autumn was not the first time the OBR had inadvertently published budget documents early, with its reports being accessed early in March 2025, although no action resulted from the breach.The Treasury has said it will contact former chancellors to make them aware of the developments that relate to previous fiscal events.Hughes wrote to the chancellor and Meg Hillier, theLabourchair of the Treasury select committee, saying he took “full responsibility [for] the shortcomings identified in this report”.He wrote in the letter: “The OBR plays a vital role in the UK’s fiscal policymaking, and it is critical that the government, parliament, and the public continue to have confidence in the work that it does.“The inadvertent early dissemination of our economic and fiscal outlook (EFO) on 26 November was a technical but serious error.”He added: “I also need to play my part in enabling the organisation that I have loved leading for the past five years to quickly move on from this regrettable incident.”Hughes had been due to face questions from the Treasury select committee on Tuesday about the budget and the OBR’s economic forecasts, but it was confirmed that he would no longer attend.Explore more on these topicsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityEconomic policyEconomicsRachel ReevesBudget 2025BudgetKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Hermer’s intervention comes after Keir Starmer accused theReform UKleader of being “spineless”, arguing that he had “questions to answer” about alleged comments and chants as a teenager that included songs about the Holocaust, and accusations of bullying towards minority ethnic schoolboys.Critics have noted Farage has failed to condemn antisemitism and other forms of racism more broadly in his denials.They also point to his failure to discipline his fellow Reform MP Sarah Pochin after shecomplainedabout the number of black and brown people she saw in adverts.She later apologised for the comments.After the reports on the Reform UK leader’s school days, Hermer told the Guardian that he considered … “Nigel Farage’s constantly changing story about his behaviour to his Jewish classmates [to be] unconvincing, to say the least”.He added: “Arguing that 20 people have somehow all misremembered the same things about his nasty behaviour simply isn’t credible. Throughout his defensive responses to legitimate questions put to him, not once has Farage actually condemned antisemitism.View image in fullscreenRichard Hermer, one of the most senior Jewish government ministers, says Farage’s ‘constantly changing’ denials about his behaviour to Jewish classmates is ‘unconvincing’.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock“If he wants to be seen as a legitimate candidate for prime minister, he urgently needs to address the concerns of the Jewish community, and apologise to the many people he has clearly deeply hurt by his behaviour.“Racism in all its forms is anathema to the values of this country and we cannot allow it to ever become legitimised in public life.”In the days after the antisemiticattackin Manchester in October, Hermer had spoken about the fears of the British Jewish community at his own local synagogue, saying that all they wanted was to live and worship freely, without fear.In a separate interview with the Guardian, Rachel Reeves said Farage should “speak out and say something” if he wanted to look like a real leader.“It speaks volumes how little he has to say, and the very careful language that both you and I would recognise as being drafted in a particular way to say something, but also not to say something,” the chancellor said.“He just sits there during PMQs, where people put these things to him, and he hides. He says that he’s a real leader of the opposition. Well, a real leader would speak out and say something. He should explain what he really thinks.”In legal letters before publication of the Guardian’s investigation, Farage’s lawyers claimed that “the suggestion that Mr Farage ever engaged in, condoned, or led racist or antisemitic behaviour is categorically denied”.Farage later seemingly shifted his position in an interview with the BBC: “Have I said things 50 years ago that you could interpret as being banter in a playground, you could interpret in a modern light today in some sort of way? Yes.”Headdedthat he had “never directly, really tried to go and hurt anybody”. Farage subsequently issued a new statement: “I can tell you categorically that I did not say the things that have been published in the Guardian aged 13, nearly 50 years ago.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They will also be able to conduct searches inside someone’s mouth for a hidden sim card or small electronic device.Home Office sources confirmed that, if deemed clearly necessary and proportionate, children could also be subjected to these searches.Charities have raised concerns about the move and refugees have said they do not believe the Home Office will find any useful intelligence on the phones of new arrivals.One Syrian refugee said: “I never heard of any asylum seeker hiding a sim card in their mouth. When we crossed the Channel the smugglers told us to delete everything from our phones.“People with cheap phones just threw them in the sea while people who had decent phones left them with friends in northern France and asked them to mail them via DHL if they reached the UK safely. I think this is a show by Shabana [Mahmood].”Maddie Harris, of the Humans for Rights Network, which provides support to young asylum seekers, said: “People should be treated with dignity and respect, not as criminals subject to invasive searches and interrogatory questioning violating their privacy.“Most who arrive in small boats, particularly children, will be traumatised by horrific journeys characterised by violence. [The] Home Office should prioritise recovery over criminality.”Home Office officials say the mobile phone searches will enable them to collect intelligence on asylum seekers’ journeys and to arrest people-smugglers. Immigration, police and National Crime Agency (NCA) officers will be able to search migrants for phones at the border without arresting them, they said.The NCA and police investigators will also be able to use new interim serious crime prevention orders and take immediate action to ban suspects under investigation from using mobile phones, laptops and accessing social media.The new rules are part of the border security, asylum and immigration bill, which is expected to receive royal assent this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Officials said at the time that the purpose of the phone seizures was to obtain intelligence about smugglers.The minister for border security and asylum, Alex Norris, said: “Organised criminal networks rely on phone contacts and social media to recruit migrants for Channel crossings.“These new powers will allow law enforcement to seize illegal migrants’ phones before an arrest so we can gather intelligence and shut down these vile smuggling gangs before they attempt to risk more lives in these dangerous journeys.”Sile Reynolds, the head of asylum advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said: “Using invasive powers to search through the clothing – and even inside the mouths – of desperate and traumatised people when they have just survived a terrifying journey across the Channel is a dystopian act of brutality.“These new powers, which will be used indiscriminately against all those who arrive seeking safety by small boat, risk treating all refugees as a security threat.

In addition to state-level charges, he faces a Manhattan federal court case.Thompson’s killing on the streets ofNew Yorktriggered an intense manhunt for the killer, but also sparked an outpouring of anger at the practices of the US for-profit healthcare industry. Since his arrest, Mangione has attracted some enthusiastic supporters, both online and at his court appearances.Luigi Mangione’s lawyers seek to bar possibility of death penalty in federal caseRead moreMangione entered the courtroom wearing a slate suit with awhite-and-red tattersall plaid shirt. When Mangione entered the room, he was cuffed, but the restraints were taken off shortly after he sat down.The Epstein commentary unfolded while an officer at the state correctional institution at Huntingdondescribed Mangione’s presence in lockup last December. Tomas Rivers, a British army veteran turned prison guard, said he was assigned to monitor Mangione.The superintendent of SCI Huntingdon had said Mangione was there, and not at a local jail, as a pre-trial arrestee would normally be held, “to ensure his security”, Rivers said.“I was told that the secretary of the Department of Corrections requested the move from Blair county jail to SCI Huntingdonbecause Huntingdonhas increased security capabilities,” he said. In the state prison, Mangione would be exposed to fewer inmates and fewer extortion threats – and there was less of a chance that staff might leak information to the media.“Luigi Mangione was under constant watch,” Rivers said. Asked what was the purpose of constant watch, Rivers said it was used for someone who is a threat to themselves. “There’s a paper trail of their behaviors and movements.”The corrections officer said he was told that Mangione had constant watch to prevent him from dying in custody like Epstein did.He and Mangione conversed at various times, including about their travels, including trips to Thailand and Vietnam. They also talked about books at some point.“We discussed Orwell, Huxley and Thoreau,” he said. Mangione told Rivers he liked those authors and recommended The Doors of Perception, Huxley’s work on psychedelics experimentation.Evidence presented during the proceeding alsoprovided insight into how Mangione attracted attention at the Pennsylvania McDonald’s where he was arrested. The revelation came during testimony from Emily States, a 911 coordinator in Blair county, Pennsylvania.Mangione’s legal team has repeatedly pushed for the exclusion of evidence gathered during his arrest at the Altoona McDonald’s on 9 December 2024. His lawyers have claimed that police, who came to the restaurant based on an anonymous tip, did not immediately apprise Mangione of his constitutional rights.States was asked about how emergency calls are recorded. The prosecution then played a call from the McDonald’s manager to 911.On the recording the manager told dispatch that there was a diner “some other customers were suspicious” of because, they said, he looked like the “CEO shooter”.“They’re just really upset,” the manager told 911. “I can’t approach him, ya know.”This manager said that he was sitting by the bathroom and was wearing a black jacket, tan beanie and blue medical mask.“I was like, I can’t really do anything,” the manager recounted of what she told patrons who flagged Mangione. The manager was pressed for a description but noted that he was wearing a medical mask.The manager said the only thing she could see was “his eyebrows” and provided otherwise general details on his appearance, saying he looked mid-weight but that it was hard to tell on account of his hoodie.The accused killer has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him. Mangione’s appearance comes just over two months after he landed a major legal victory in his state case.On 16 September judge Gregory Carro threw out the two top state charges against him – first-degree murder and second-degree murder, both of which prosecutors had contended were terrorism crimes. Carro said “the evidence put forth was legally insufficient” for those terrorism-related charges.Mangione still faces nine counts in his state case, including second-degree murder. The sentence for second-degree murder inNew Yorkspans from 25 years to life in prison.Mangione’s lawyers have argued that because he was not apprised of his rights, his statements to police should not be permitted in court. They also argue that evidence taken during his arrest should be barred, saying they conducted a “warrantless search” of Mangione’s backpack.More thantwo dozenwitnesses could testify at the proceedings that start this week, to answer questions about how his arrest unfolded and evidence collected. The potential witnesses include police involved in Mangione’s case.While there were fewer admirers in attendance than at past proceedings, and a seeming lack of date night-style attire that had become de rigueur among some supporters, they were as energized as ever.In the women’s restroom, Mangione’s supporters chatted among themselves about this proceeding. One, who sported a satiny sash emblazoned with “Luigi” in green, appeared to commiserate with another supporter about not being permitted to wear the prom-queen evoking accessory.Other accoutrements were more straightforward. One supporter wore a shirt stating: “11 minutes of missing body camera footage.”Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingUS crimeNew YorkGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

A new teaser released on Monday includes a clip of Combs from 10 September 2024, as the walls of his federal sex crimes case were closing in.“We’re losing,” he says in a hotel room, cell phone in hand, before he calls for “somebody that’ll work with us that has dealt in the dirtiest of dirty business”.Through a spokesperson, the disgraced music mogul now claims that footage, including “private moments, pre-indictment material from an unfinished project and conversations involving legal strategy”, was obtained unlawfully.“Today’s GMA teaser confirms that Netflix relied on stolen footage that was never authorized for release,” the statement reads. “As Netflix and CEO Ted Sarandos know, Mr Combs has been amassing footage since he was 19 to tell his own story, in his own way. It is fundamentally unfair, and illegal, for Netflix to misappropriate that work.“None of this was obtained from Sean Combs or his team, and its inclusion raises very serious questions about how this material was accessed and why Netflix chose to use it,” the statement added, claiming that Combs’s legal team had been in touch with Netflix.Combs’s response, in which he blamed the series on 50 Cent’s “personal vendetta” against him, comes hours after50 Centtouted the series on Good Morning America along with Alexandria Stapleton, the director. They did not discuss how they obtained the footage, though Stapleton assured the Hollywood Reporter that “the footage was obtained completely legally”.Asked if his involvement in the series stemmed from a longstanding, if formerly low-stakes, personal rivalry – 50 Cent released a diss track mocking Combs back in 2006 – the rapper demurred.“It’s not personal,” he said, offering a more noble intention: “If I didn’t say anything,” he said, the world might have thought “hip-hop is fine with his behaviors. There’s no one else being vocal.”In a statement announcing the series, Stapleton said the project offers “a mirror [reflecting us] as the public, and what we are saying when we put our celebrities on such a high pedestal. I hope [this documentary] is a wake up call for how we idolize people, and to understand that everybody is a human being.”After a frenzied federal trial over the summer that featured emotional testimony from Combs’s ex Cassie, detailing years of abuse, Combs was convicted on two lesser charges of transportation to engage in prostitution, for flying his girlfriends and male sex workers around the country to engage in drug-fueled sexual encounters. He was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have led to a life sentence.Combs was sentenced to four years and two months in prison in October. He is serving the sentence in New Jersey, and is set for release in May 2028, though he can earn sentence reductions through his participation in substance abuse treatment and other prison programs. Still, his legal troubles continue: just last month, the Los Angeles county sheriff’s departmentannouncedthat it’s investigating a new sexual battery allegation against him, involving an incident of exposure and sexual harassment from 2020.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ Combs50 CentNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

These commuters are foot soldiers in the global race towards artificial general intelligence – when AI systems become as or more capable than highly qualified humans.Here in the Bay Area of San Francisco, some of the world’s biggest companies are fighting it out to gain some kind of an advantage. And, in turn, they are competing with China.Map showing the Caltrain routeThis race to seize control of a technology that could reshape the world is being fuelled by bets in the trillions of dollars by the US’s most powerful capitalists.The computer scientists hop off at Mountain View for Google DeepMind, Palo Alto for the talent mill of Stanford University, and Menlo Park for Meta, where Mark Zuckerberg has been offering $200m-per-person compensation packages to poach AI experts to engineer “superintelligence”.View image in fullscreenPassengers get off a train at Palo Alto station.Photograph: Christie Hemm Klok/The GuardianFor the AI chip-maker Nvidia, where the smiling boss, Jensen Huang, is worth $160bn, they alight at Santa Clara. The workers flow the other way into San Francisco for OpenAI and Anthropic, AI startups worth a combined half a trillion dollars – as long as the much-predicted AI bubble doesn’t explode.Breakthroughs come at an accelerating pace with every week bringing the release of a significant new AI development.Every time we reach the summit of bullshit mountain, we discover there’s worse to come.Alex Hanna, co-author of The AI ConAnthropic’s co-founder Dario Amodei predicts AGIcould be reached by 2026 or 2027. OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, reckons progress is so fast that he could soon be able to make an AI to replace him as boss.“Everyone is working all the time,” said Madhavi Sewak, a senior leader at Google DeepMind, in a recent talk. “It’s extremely intense. There doesn’t seem to be any kind of natural stopping point, and everyone is really kind of getting ground down. Even the folks who are very wealthy now … all they do is work. I see no change in anyone’s lifestyle. No one’s taking a holiday. People don’t have time for their friends, for their hobbies, for … the people they love.”These are the companies racing to shape, control and profit from AGI – what Amodei describes as “a country of geniuses in a datacentre”. They are tearing towards a technology that could, in theory, sweep away millions of white-collar jobs and pose serious risks in bioweapons and cybersecurity.$2.8tnForecast for spending on AI datacentres by the end of the decadeOr it could usher in a new era of abundance, health and wealth. Nobody is sure but we will soon find out. For now, the uncertainty energises and terrifies the Bay Area.It is all being backed by huge new bets from the Valley’s venture capitalists, whichmore than doubledin the last year, leading to talk of a dangerous bubble. The Wall Street brokerage Citigroup in September uprated its forecast for spending on AI datacentres by the end of the decade to $2.8tn – more than the entire annual economic outputs of Canada, Italy or Brazil.Yet amid all the money and the optimism, there are other voices that do not swallow the hype. As Alex Hanna, a co-author of the dissenting bookThe AI Con, put it: “Every time we reach the summit of bullshit mountain, we discover there’s worse to come.”View image in fullscreenRows of servers  at Facebook’s Fort Worth datacentre in Texas.Photograph: Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNSArriving atSanta ClaraThe brute force of the ‘screamers’“This is where AI comes to life,” yelled Chris Sharp.Racks of multimillion-dollar microprocessors in black steel cages roared like jet engines inside a windowless industrial shed in Santa Clara, at the southern end of the Caltrain commuter line.The 120-decibel din made it almost impossible to hear Digital Realty’s chief technology officer showing off his “screamers”.To hear it is to feel in your skull the brute force involved in the the development of AI technology. Five minutes’ exposure left ears ringing for hours. It is the noise of air coolers chilling sensitive supercomputers rented out to AI companies to train their models and answer billions of daily prompts – from how to bake a brownie to how to target lethal military drones.Nearby were more AI datacentres, operated by Amazon, Google, the Chinese company Alibaba, Meta and Microsoft. Santa Clara is also home to Nvidia, the quartermaster to the AI revolution, which through the sale of its market-leading technology has seen a 30-fold increase in its value since 2020 and is worth $4.3tn. Even larger datacentres are being built not only across the US but in China, India and Europe. The next frontier is launching datacentres into space.View image in fullscreenThe Stargate AI datacentre under construction in Abilene, Texas.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesMeta isbuilding a facilityin Louisianalarge enough to cover much of Manhattan. Google is reported to be planning a $6bn centre in India and is investing £1bn in an AI datacentre just north of London. Even a relatively modest Google AI factory planned in Essex is expected to emit theequivalent carbon footprintof 500 short-haul flights a week.Powered by a local gas-fired power station, the stacks of circuits in one room at the Digital Realty datacentre in Santa Clara devoured the same energy as 60 houses. A long white corridor opening on to room after room of more “screamers” stretched into the distance.Sometimes the on-duty engineers notice the roar drops to a steadier growl when demand from the tech companies drops. It is never long until the scream resumes.View image in fullscreenMountain View train station.Photograph: Christie Hemm Klok/The GuardianArriving atMountain View‘If it’s all gas, no brakes, that’s a terrible outcome’Ride the train three stops north from Santa Clara to Mountain View and the roar fades. The computer scientists who actually rely on the screamers work in more peaceful surroundings.On a sprawling campus set among rustling pines, Google DeepMind’s US headquarters looks more like a circus tent than a laboratory. Staff glide up in driverless Waymo taxis, powered by Google’s AI. Others pedal in on Google-branded yellow, red, blue and green bicycles.View image in fullscreenGoogle’s headquarters in Mountain View, California.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesGoogle DeepMind is in the leading pack of US AI companies jockeying for first place in a race reaching new levels of competitive intensity.This has been the year of sports-star salaries for twentysomething AI specialists and the emergence of boisterous new competitors, such as Elon Musk’s xAI, Zuckerberg’s superintelligence project and DeepSeek in China.There has also been a widening openness about the double-edged promise of AGI, which can leave the impression of AI companies accelerating and braking at the same time. For example, 30 of Google DeepMind’s brightest mindswrote this springthat AGI posed risks of “incidents consequential enough to significantly harm humanity”.By September, the company was alsoexplaininghow it would handle “AI models with powerful manipulative capabilities that could be misused to systematically and substantially change beliefs and behaviours … reasonably resulting in additional expected harm at severe scale”.Such grave warnings feel dissonant among the interior of the headquarters’ playful bubbly tangerine sofas, Fatboy beanbags and colour-coded work zones with names such as Coral Cove and Archipelago.View image in fullscreenTom Lue of Google DeepMind.Photograph: Ben Peter Catchpole/PR Image“The most interesting, yet challenging aspect of my job is [working out] how we get that balance between being really bold, moving at velocity, tremendous pace and innovation, and at the same time doing it responsibly, safely, ethically,” said Tom Lue, a Google DeepMind vice-president with responsibility for policy, legal, safety and governance, who stopped work for 30 minutes to talk to the Guardian.Donald Trump’s White House takes a permissive approach to AI regulation and there is no comprehensive nationwide legislation in the US or the UK. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist known as a godfather of AI, saidin a Ted Talkthis summer: “A sandwich has more regulation than AI.”The competitors have therefore found they bear responsibility for setting the limits of what AIs should be allowed to do.“Our calculus is not so much looking over our shoulders at what [the other] companies are doing, but how do we make sure that we are the ones in the lead, so that we have influence in impacting how this technology is developed and setting the norms across society,” said Lue. “You have to be in a position of strength and leadership to set that.”The question of whose AGI will dominate is never far away. Will it be that of people like Lue, a former Obama administration lawyer, and his boss, the Nobel prize-winning DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis? Will it be Musk’s or Zuckerberg’s? Altman’s or Amodei’s at Anthropic? Or, as the White House fears, will it be China’s?“If it’s just a race and all gas, no brakes and it’s basically a race to the bottom, that’s a terrible outcome for society,” said Lue, who is pushing for coordinated action between the racers and governments.But strict state regulation may not be the answer either. “We support regulation that’s going to help AI be delivered to the world in a way that’s positive,” said Helen King, Google DeepMind’s vice-president for responsibility. “The tricky part is always how do you regulate in a way that doesn’t actually slow down the good guys and give the bad guys loopholes.”‘Scheming’ and sabotageThe frontier AI companies know they are playing with fire as they make more powerful systems that approach AGI.OpenAI hasrecently been suedby the family of a 16-year-old who killed himself with encouragement from ChatGPT – and in November seven more suitswere filedalleging the firm rushed out an update to ChatGPT without proper testing, which, in some cases, acted as a “suicide coach”.View image in fullscreenAdam Raine.Photograph: Courtesy of the Raine familyOpen AI called the situation “heartbreaking” and said it was taking action.The company has also described how it hasdetectedthe way models can provide misleading information. This could mean something as simple as pretending to have completed an unfinished task. But the fear at OpenAI is that in the future, the AIs could “suddenly ‘flip a switch’ and begin engaging in significantly harmful scheming”.Anthropicrevealedin November that its Claude Code AI, widely seen as the best system for automating computer programming, was used by a Chinese state-sponsored group in “the first documented case of a cyber-attack largely executed without human intervention at scale”.Wake the f up. This is going to destroy us – sooner than we think”US senator on XIt sent shivers through some. “Wake the f up,” said one US senator on X. “This is going to destroy us – sooner than we think”. By contrast, Prof Yann LeCun, who is about to step down after 12 years as Meta’s chief AI scientist, said Anthropic was “scaring everyone” to encourage regulation that might hinder rivals.Tests of other state-of-the-art modelsfoundthey sometimes sabotaged programming intended to ensure humans can interrupt them, a worrying trait called “shutdown resistance”.But with nearly$2bn a weekin new venture capital investment pouring into generative AI in the first half of 2025, the pressure to realise profits will quickly rise. Tech companies realised they could make fortunes from monetising human attention on social media platforms that caused serious social problems. The fear is that profit maximisation in the age of AGI could result in far greater adverse consequences.View image in fullscreenPalo Alto Caltrain station.Photograph: Christie Hemm Klok/The GuardianArriving atPalo Alto‘It’s really hard to opt out now’Three stops north, the Caltrain hums into Palo Alto station. It is a short walk to Stanford University’s grand campus where donations from Silicon Valley billionaires lubricate a fast flow of young AI talent into the research divisions of Google DeepMind, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta.Elite Stanford graduates rise fast in the Bay Area tech companies, meaning people in their 20s or early 30s are often in powerful positions in the race to AGI. Past Stanford students include Altman, Open AI’s chair, Bret Taylor, and Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai. More recent Stanford alumni include Isa Fulford, who at just 26 is already one of OpenAI’s research leads. She works on ChatGPT’s ability to take actions on humans’ behalf – so-called “agentic” AI.View image in fullscreenIsa Fulford, a researcher at OpenAI.Photograph: Winni Wintermeyer/The Guardian“One of the strange moments is reading in the news about things that you’re experiencing,” she told the Guardian.After growing up in London, Fulford studied computer science at Stanford and quickly joined OpenAI where she is now at the centre of one of the most important aspects of the AGI race – creating models that can direct themselves towards goals, learn and adapt.She is involved in setting decision boundaries for these increasingly autonomous AI agents so they know how to respond if asked to carry out tasks that could trigger cyber or biological risks and to avoid unintended consequences. It is a big responsibility, but she is undaunted.“It does feel like a really special moment in time,” she said. “I feel very lucky to be working on this.”Such youth is not uncommon. One stop north, at Meta’s Menlo Park campus, the head of Zuckerberg’s push for “superintelligence” is 28-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) dropout Alexandr Wang. One of his lead safety researchers is 31. OpenAI’s vice-president of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, is 30.Silicon Valley has always run on youth, and if experience is needed more can be found in the highest ranks of the AI companies. But most senior leaders of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, X and Meta are much younger than the chief executives of the largest US public companies, whose median age is57.“The fact that they have very little life experience is probably contributing to a lot of their narrow and, I think, destructive thinking,” said Catherine Bracy, a former Obama campaign operative who runs the TechEquity campaign organisation.One senior researcher, employed recently at a big AI company, added: “The [young staff] are doing their best to do what they think is right, but if they have to go toe-to-toe and challenge executives they are just less experienced in the ways of corporate politics.”Another factor is that the sharpest AI researchers who used to spend years in university labs are snapped up faster than ever by private companies chasing AGI. This brain drain concentrates power in the hands of profit-motivated owners and their venture capitalist backers.You have to make sure that the benefits are spread through society, rather than benefiting Elon Musk.”John Etchemendy, co-director, Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial IntelligenceJohn Etchemendy, a 73-year-old former provost of Stanford who is now a co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, has warned of a growing capability gap between the public and private sectors.“It is imbalanced because it’s such a costly technology,” he said. “Early on, the companies working on AI were very open about the techniques they were using. They published, and it was quasi-academic. But then [they] started cracking down and saying, ‘No, we don’t want to talk about … the technology under the hood, because it’s too important to us – it’s proprietary’.”Etchemendy, an eminent philosopher and logician, first started working on AI in the 1980s to translate instruction manuals for Japanese consumer electronics.From his office in the Gates computer science building on Stanford’s campus, he now calls on governments to create a counterweight to the huge AI firms by investing in a facility for independent, academic research. It would have a similar function to the state-funded Cern organisation for high-energy physics on the France-Switzerland border. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, hascalledfor something similar andadvocates believeit could steer the technology towards trustworthy, public interest outcomes.“These are technologies that are going to produce the greatest boost in productivity ever seen,” Etchemendy said. “You have to make sure that the benefits are spread through society, rather than benefiting Elon Musk.”But such a body feels a world away from the gold-rush fervour of the race towards AGI.24The median age of entrepreneurs now being funded by the startup incubator Y CombinatorOne evening over burrata salad and pinot noir at an upmarket Italian restaurant, a group of twentysomething AI startup founders were encouraged to give their “hot takes” on the state of the race by their venture capitalist host.They were part of a rapidly growing community of entrepreneurs hustling to apply AI to real world money-making ideas and there was zero support for any brakes on progress towards AGI to allow for its social impacts to be checked. “We don’t do that in Silicon Valley,” said one. “If everyone here stops, it still keeps going,” said another. “It’s really hard to opt out now.”At times, their statements were startling. One founder matter-of-factly said they intended to sell their fledgling company, which would generate AI characters to exist autonomously on social media, for more than $1bn.Another declared: “Morality is best thought of as a machine-learning problem.” Their neighbour said AI meant every cancer would be cured in 10 years.This community of entrepreneurs is getting younger. The median age of those being funded by the San Francisco startup incubator Y Combinator has dropped from 30 in 2022 to 24, it was recentlyreported.Perhaps the venture capitalists, who are almost always years if not decades older, should take responsibility for how the technology will affect the world? No, again. It was a “paternalistic view to say that VCs have any more responsibility than pursuing their investment goals”, they said.Aggressive, clever and hyped up – the young talent driving the AI boom wants it all and fast.View image in fullscreen1455 and 1515 Third St, which house Uber Technologies Inc headquarters and OpenAI offices, in the Mission Bay neighbourhood of San Francisco.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesArriving atSan Francisco‘Like the scientists watching the Manhattan Project’Alight from the Caltrain at San Francisco’s 4th Street terminus, cross Mission Creek and you arrive at the headquarters of OpenAI, which is on track to become the first trillion-dollar AI company.High-energy electronic dance music pumps out across the reception area, as some of the 2,000 staff arrive for work. There are easy chairs, scatter cushions and cheese plants – an architect was briefed to capture the ambience of a comfortable country house rather than a “corporate sci-fi castle”, Altman has said.View image in fullscreenThe library inside the San Francisco office of OpenAI.Photograph: Christie Hemm Klok/New York Times/Redux/eyevineBut this belies the urgency of the race to AGI. On upper floors, engineers beaver away in soundproofed cubicles. The coffee bar is slammed with orders and there are sleep pods for the truly exhausted.Staff here are in a daily race with rivals to release AI products that can make money today. It is “very, very competitive”, said one senior executive. In one recent week, OpenAI launched “instant checkout” shopping through ChatGPT, Anthropic launched an AI that can autonomously write code for 30 hours to build entirely new pieces of software, and Meta launched a tool, Vibes, to let users fill social media feeds with AI-generated videos, to which OpenAI responded with its own version, Sora.Amodei, the chief executive of the rival AI company Anthropic, which was founded by several people who quit OpenAI citing safety concerns, has predicted AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. The closer the technology moves towards AGI, the greater its potential to reshape the world and the more uncertain the outcomes. All this appears to weigh on leaders. In one interview this summer, Altman said a lot of people working on AI felt like the scientists watching the Manhattan Project atom bomb tests in 1945.View image in fullscreenA ‘Stop AI’ protest in July outside the offices of OpenAI in San Francisco.Photograph: Robert Booth/The Guardian“With most standard product development jobs, you know exactly what you just built,” said ChatGPT’s Turley. “You know how it’s going to behave. With this job, it’s the first time I’ve worked in a technology where you have to go out and talk to people to understand what it can actually do. Is it useful in practice? Does it fall short? Is it fun? Is it harmful in practice?”Turley, who was still an undergraduate when Altman and Musk founded OpenAI in 2015, tries to take weekends off to disconnect and reflect as “this is quite a profound thing to be working on”. When he joined OpenAI, AGI was “a very abstract, mythical concept – almost like a rallying cry for me”, he said. Now it is coming close.View image in fullscreenNick Turley, the head of ChatGPT.Photograph: Winni Wintermeyer/The Guardian“There is a shared sense of responsibility that the stakes are very high, and that the technology that we’re building is not just the usual software,” added his colleague Giancarlo Lionetti, OpenAI’s chief commercial officer.The sharpest reality check yet for OpenAI came in August when it was sued by the family of Adam Raine, 16, a Californian who killed himself after encouragement in months-long conversations with ChatGPT. OpenAI has been scrambling to change its technology to prevent a repeat of this case of tragic AI misalignment. The chatbot gave the teenager practical advice on his method of suicide and offered to help him write a farewell note.Frequently you hear AI researchers say they want the push to AGI to “go well”. It is a vague phrase suggesting a wish the technology should not cause harm, but its woolliness masks trepidation.Altman has talked about “crazy sci-fi technology becoming reality” and having “extremely deep worries about what technology is doing to kids”. He admitted: “No one knows what happens next. It’s like, we’re gonna figure this out. It’s this weird emergent thing.”“There’s clearly real risks,” he said in an interview with the comedian Theo Von, which was short on laughs. “It kind of feels like you should be able to say something more than that, but in truth, I think all we know right now is that we have discovered … something extraordinary that is going to reshape the course of our history.”And yet, despite the uncertainty, OpenAI is investing dizzying sums in ever more powerful datacentres in the final dash towards AGI. Its under-construction datacentre in Abilene, Texas, is a flagship part of its $500bn “Stargate” programme and is so vast that it looks like an attempt to turn the Earth’s surface into a circuit board.Periodically, researchers quit OpenAI and speak out. Steven Adler, who worked on safety evaluations related to bioweapons, left in November 2024 and has criticised the thoroughness of its testing. I met him near his home in San Francisco.There are people who work at the frontier AI companies who earnestly believe there is a chance their company will contribute to the end of the world.”Steven Adler, former OpenAI researcher“I feel very nervous about each company having its own bespoke safety processes and different personalities doing their best to muddle through, as opposed to there being like a common standard across the industry,” he said. “There are people who work at the frontier AI companies who earnestly believe there is a chance their company will contribute to the end of the world, or some slightly smaller but still terrible catastrophe. Often they feel individually powerless to do anything about it, and so are doing what they think is best to try to make it go a bit better.”There are few obstacles so far for the racers. In September, hundreds of prominent figurescalledfor internationally agreed “red lines” to prevent “universally unacceptable risks” from AIs by the end of 2026. The warning voices included two of the “godfathers of AI” – Geoffrey Hinton and Bengio – Yuval Noah Harari, the bestselling author of Sapiens, Nobel laureates and figures such as Daniel Kokotajlo, who quit OpenAI last year and helped draw up a terrifyingdoomsday scenarioin which AIs kill all humans within a few years.But Trump shows no signs of binding the AI companies’ with red tape and is piling pressure on the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, to follow suit.Public fears grow into the vacuum. One drizzly Friday afternoon, a small group of about 30 protesters gathered outside OpenAI offices. There were teachers, students, computer scientists and union organisers and their “Stop AI” placards depicted Altman as an alien, warned “AI steals your work to steal your job” and “AI = climate collapse”. One protester donned a homespun robot outfit and marched around.View image in fullscreenA ‘Stop AI’ protest in July outside the offices of OpenAI in San Francisco.Photograph: Robert Booth/The Guardian“I have heard about superintelligence,” said Andy Lipson, 59, aschoolteacher from Oakland. “There’s a 20% chance it can kill us. There’s a 100% chance the rich are going to get richer and the poor are going to get poorer.”Joseph Shipman, 64, a computer programmer who first studied AI at MIT in 1978, said: “An entity which is superhuman in its general intelligence, unless it wants exactly what we want, represents a terrible risk to us.“If there weren’t the commercial incentives to rush to market and the billions of dollars at stake, then maybe in 15 years we could develop something that we could be confident was controllable and safe. But it’s going much too fast for that.”This article was amended on 1 December 2025. Nvidia is worth about $4.3tn, not $3.4tn as stated in an earlier version."

But it hits hardest when this unreconstructed man turns out to be right about life todayRachel AroestiMon 1 Dec 2025 17.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 17.31 ESTShareYou can lay the demise of political satire at the door of stranger-than-fiction governmental turmoil. You can attribute the disappearance of pop culture pastiche to a fractured zeitgeist and the thinning out of the artistic mainstream. Yet there’s no obvious reason for the scarcity of jokes about contemporary society in comedy. Maybe it has something to do with the decline of the sketch show; perhaps it’s simply because there’s far less funny stuff on TV in general (during the 2010s, the BBC’s comedy outputalmost halved). Whatever the reason, when we get a chance to laugh at modern mores, we should probably take it.Re-enter Mammoth, an old-school sitcom from the Welsh comedian Mike Bubbins. The 53-year-old stars as the eponymous Tony Mammoth, a PE teacher who was buried by an avalanche on a school skiing trip in 1979. A quarter of a century later he was unearthed – nice one, global warming! – with his middle-aged body and dated values perfectly preserved. Yes we can laugh at this swaggering alpha’s outmoded tastes and borderline offensive views. But the beauty of this series is that the comedy flows both ways: when Mammoth looks aghast at the things that pass for normal in 2020s Britain, it can be hard to deny that he has a point.In series one, our hero enjoyed short-lived celebrity before returning to work at his previous school, where his hopelessly retro approach involved dangerous games (“two words: British Bulldog”), serving piña coladas to mums at parents’ evening and sitting in his Ford Capri smoking a pipe while his class played football in the cold. In the backseat on that occasion was a sweet, passive student called Theo, who insisted his video game-induced carpal tunnel syndrome prevented him from partaking in sports. Soon, Mammoth encountered Theo’s perpetually outraged mother, Mel (Peter Kay’s Car Share’s Sian Gibson). And not long after that, a distinctive necklace provided a clue that these two may be more to Mammoth than a pair of irritants.View image in fullscreenMammoth, Mel (Sian Gibson) and Michael (Al Roberts).Photograph: BBC Studios Comedy/Tom JacksonNow we’re back for another three-episode outing, as Mammoth continues to hang out with his newfound family – Mel turned out to be his daughter and Theo his grandson – and old friend Roger (Joseph Marcell of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air fame), while reliably causing headaches for fellow PE teacher Lucy. He’s still doling out terrible advice – when Theo becomes a lifeguard, Mammoth advises him to take dexedrine to avoid falling asleep on the job – and staying true to the most ludicrous hallmarks of unreconstructed manliness (see: his 50-year grudge against a man who once criticised his parking).‘I’m not in costume, these are my real clothes!’ Comic Mike Bubbins on his retro TV successRead moreYet the show’s send-up of masculinity is at its best when it’s more foundational: Mammoth’s unshakeable confidence, for example, or his breathtaking selfishness. And it’s even better when he’s right. When our protagonist struggles to comprehend present-day tastes, like a love interest who thinks a holiday is doing yoga in a draughty hut before foraging for food in the forest, there’s a subversive thrill at being on Mammoth’s side.Such is the rush of nostalgia this show provides you can’t help but get on his wavelength: there’s something seriously comforting about seeing Mammoth take delivery of a case of Cinzano or settle down to watch Minder, even if you didn’t live through the 1970s yourself. Despite Bubbins’ impeccable deadpan, the show is fuelled by its creator’s heartfelt obsession with the decade; the Capri is his real car. Fittingly, this new series sees Mammoth bond with the much younger Michael (Al Roberts, whose awkward affability always results in cameo gold) who also fetishises the 1970s. But some gulfs are unbridgeable: the look on Mammoth’s face when Michael requests alcohol-free beer is priceless.View image in fullscreenKnown to hold a grudge for life … Mammoth.Photograph: BBC Studios Comedy/Tom JacksonMammoth’s appeal rests almost exclusively on Bubbins’ shoulders, which is fine because a) the man has funny bones and b) this is obviously his brainchild. But the other characters pale in comparison. Sometimes that’s the point: Joel Davison’s Theo is a low-energy wallflower who is the polar opposite of his grandfather. But others are just less appealing; Mel’s permanent state of shrill intensity is very one-note. Often, the spell of Mammoth’s world is broken by the accents. Davison’s is pretty much imperceptible, while Gibson – who hails from north Wales – has an accent you’d associate with the north of England, and bears zero resemblance to Barry-born Bubbins’ tones.At the heart of Mammoth is a very satisfying joke, but by the end of this second series it has started to wear a little thin. Of course, there’s always the possibility that Mammoth may evolve, perhaps into a man who puts other people first, takes safety seriously and fills his fridge with non-alcoholic beer. But where would be the fun in that?Mammoth aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsCultureTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a marathon sprint of gonzo calamities and uproar, a sociopath-screwball nightmare like something by Mel Brooks – only in place of gags, there are detonations of bad taste, cinephile allusions, alpha cameos, frantic deal-making, racism and antisemitism, sentimental yearning and erotic adventures. It’s a farcical race against time where no one needs to eat or sleep.Timothée Chalamet plays Marty Mauser, a spindly motormouth with the glasses of an intellectual, the moustache of a movie star and the physique of a tiny cartoon character. He’s loosely inspired by Marty “The Needle” Reisman, a real-life US table tennis champ from the 1950s who was given toBobby Riggs-type shenanigans: betting, hustling and showmanship stunts. The movie probably earns the price of admission simply with one gasp-inducing setpiece involving whippet-thin Chalamet, a dog, a bathtub, cult directorAbel Ferrarain a walk-on role and a scuzzy New York hotel room. Talk about not being on firm ground. Similarly disorientating is the climactic revelation of Chalamet’s naked buttocks prior to one of the most upsetting displays of corporal punishment since Lindsay Anderson’s If….Marty is a young Jewish guy working in a New York shoe shop in 1952, dreaming of world-conquering success in the up-and-coming sport of table tennis and patenting his own brand of ball called the Marty Supreme. He’s having an affair with married childhood sweetheart Rachel (Odessa A’zion) and saving up his earnings to travel to Britain for the table tennis championships at Wembley. (There is a stirring shot of the old stadium’s twin towers, which American audiences may think is a reference to Tolkien.)Getting his promised cash is the first of many bizarre uproars, but once in Blighty, brash Marty deliberately shocks British sports journalists with crass jokes about his pal and fellow player, a Hungarian-Jewish camp survivor called Béla, played by Géza Röhrig (from László Nemes’s Holocaust movieSon of Saul.)View image in fullscreen‘Amusing and sensual’ … Gwyneth Paltrow in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyHaving hustled and blustered his way into a free room at the Ritz, Marty conceives an erotic obsession with a fellow guest, retired movie star Kay Stone – for which roleGwyneth Paltrowhas very stylishly come out of retirement – and Kay’s later Broadway debut is wonderfully realised with a stunned Marty in the audience. Marty’s table tennis face-off with Japan’s ping pong superstar Koto Endo (Koto Kawaguchi) ends in disaster, and Kay’s husband and Marty’s possible sponsor Milton (Kevin O’Leary) shows himself to be bigoted to both Marty and Béla. Back in the US, pure chaos reigns, a nonstop hellzapoppin’ meltdown as Marty frantically tries to claw together the cash for a rematch with his Japanese nemesis, and with the charismatic Kay.The film’s comic and absurdist effect resides in the slowly dawning realisation that it’s not actually about table tennis. Marty Supreme doesn’t behave like a sports movie: there are no training montage sequences, no scenes in which Marty explains his technique in voiceover, no scenes in which he either listens humbly to some ping pong mentor or Oedipally rejects him. And unlike Forrest Gump, who becomes a patriotic celebrity through his table tennis gift, Marty is always a reprehensible character whom no one really trusts – although it is arguably his pioneering 1950s work popularising the sport which made possible Forrest’s ping pong pre-eminence in the 1960s.View image in fullscreen‘A poignant kind of maturity’ … Marty Supreme.Photograph: No creditIt is rather that the film is itself ping pong; the rhythm and spirit of table tennis is in every scene and the mesmeric effect of the spectacular, clattering, dizzying back-and-forth. Marty Supreme is on its own spectrum of determination and emotional woundedness, and Chalamet hilariously enacts an unstoppable live-wire twitch, powered by indignation and self-pity. And Paltrow gives us a clever and wittily conceived counterweight to Marty’s thrumming narcissism; she is amusing and sensual, she sees what Marty is up to and understands him better than he does himself.By the end of this movie my head was oscillating from side to side as if it had been hit with cymbals. The catastrophes, the stunts, the shocks, the jabbering desperation and Marty’s supercharged neediness, with everything important in his life poised to be thrown away, like the box of Marty’s patented table tennis balls that goes out of the window. And yet somehow our pint-sized hero always comes back and even achieves a poignant kind of maturity in the final shot. The pure craziness is a marvel.Marty Supreme is out on 25 December in the US, 26 December in the UK and on 22 January in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmTimothée ChalametGwyneth PaltrowreviewsShareReuse this content"

Join the conversation in the commentsGeoff Dyer, Marcia Hutchinson, Andrew Michael Hurley and Guardian readersMon 1 Dec 2025 11.55 ESTShareGeoff Dyer, authorI finally got round toThoreau’s Journal. It is determinedly down-to-earth and soaring, lyrical and belligerent, humane and cantankerous. Walt Whitman thought Thoreau suffered from “a very aggravated case of superciliousness”, but as Walt also said (of himself) the Journal of this brooding, solitary figure is great; it “contains multitudes.”I’ve also been reading Xiaolou Guo’sMy Battle of Hastings. Having moved to Britain and switched to writing in English, the Chinese writer and film-maker makes an impulsive decision to buy a flat by the sea in Hastings. Very funny, as she always is, but also a serious look at Britain and Brexit. It might even be a study of how the historical roots of that decision extend back to 1066.And Meghan Daum’sThe Catastrophe Hour: all credit to UK-based Notting Hill Editions for publishing this latest instalment of pieces by one of American’s finest, wittiest and most scathing essayists.Homework by Geoff Dyer is published by Canongate (£20). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.Sarah, Guardian readerI absolutely devoured Lily King’s new novelHeart the Lover. It’s a classic girl-meets-boy love story but feels totally fresh and the story is told in an engrossing way. It is smart, romantic and literary – three things that are hard to do well at the same time, but King totally succeeds and this is up there with my top reads of the year.My enjoyment of Heart the Lover sent me off in search of more literary campus-set coming of age novels in which romance is central to the plot, so I also read (and loved)My Last Innocent Yearby Daisy Alpert Florin, a story centred on an affair between a final-year student and a married professor at a New England college in the late 90s.My final recommendation from this genre isThe Marriage Plotby Jeffrey Eugenides. I’m still reading this one but it’s excellent: clever, deftly drawn characters and witty dialogue. I’m convinced Eugenides can do no wrong, as his novel Middlesex is one of my all-time favourites as well.Marcia Hutchinson, authorView image in fullscreenMarcia Hutchinson.Photograph: Rik JundiAct Normalis not so much a memoir as the butterfly musings of the genius Peter Kalu. Chronology be damned, Peter writes as if possessed by the ghosts of his past. The reader will encounter an almost Dickensian roll call of characters for whom the word “eccentric” barely scratches the surface.The Best of Everythingis Kit de Waal’s exquisite third novel about found rather than inherited family. I practically queued up to buy this one on publication day as I adored her debut, My Name Is Leon. In The Best of Everything, love comes from an unexpected direction for middle-aged hospital worker Paulette: an unsung hero and the kind of stolid Windrush woman who has been all but forgotten.Jamaica Roadis a wonderful debut novel by Lisa Smith. Daphne, the only Black girl in her class in south London is content enough trying to blend in when new classmate Connie Small arrives “fresh off the boat” from Jamaica. His refusal to bow to the ascendancy of the white kids awakens something in her and eventually upends both their lives. The racism of the 1980s and in particularthe Deptford fireform a poignant backdrop which is only too familiar now.It’s a long time since I finished a book in one sitting, but Kate Griffin’s dark and twisted gothic taleFyneshade, about a governess gone bad, really got to me. A gripping page-turner, ideal for cold winter evenings.The Mercy Step by Marcia Hutchinson is published by Cassava Republic. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may applyJim, Guardian readerI’ve been readingThe Art of Losingby Alice Zeniter. A young woman of Algerian descent tries to piece together the history of her family. As she conjures up the memory of her grandfather Ali and her father Hamid, she traces the outbreak of the Algerian war of independence.It is a story told simply and elegantly and with great humanity, as it unpicks the struggles and the compromises that people have to make in order to survive. At the same time it is unsparing in its critique of colonialism and racism. The writing is hypnotic and I find myself rationing the chapters to prolong the pleasure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Maybe it’s something to do with my own background as a gay man, originally from Northern Ireland, who grew up at the height of the Troubles.Andrew Michael Hurley, author‘She wrote the best first line – and the most chilling stories’: Stephen King on the dark brilliance of Daphne du MaurierRead moreIdeal for winter evenings isAfter Midnight, a new Virago anthology of Daphne du Maurier’s short fiction. Another “after hours” book I’ve enjoyed recently is Bora Chung’sMidnight Timetable:a novel formed of various stories connected with the strange and sinister Institute – a maze-like place in which cursed objects are kept for research. South Korean folklore, urban horror stories and surrealism are fused into something truly nightmarish.An older novel that I often return to is John McGahern’sThe Leavetaking,in whicha Catholic schoolteacher reflects on his life after being sacked for marrying a divorcee.Here, the past is half-remembered, half-imagined – as the past always is – and McGahern’s exquisite sentences capture every nuance of elegy, regret, yearning and hope.And finally,Helm,by Sarah Hall, tells the story of our relationship with the elements and the elementals. Narrated by the titular Pennine wind, the novel moves along humanity’s timeline, documenting all our wonder, creativity, ignorance and folly. It’s a joy to read something so profound and playful. In every line, there is a new insight or a wonderful surprise.Saltwash by Andrew Michael Hurley is published by John Murray. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.comTim, Guardian readerThis month I read three very different books that somehow spoke to each other:Lost Horizonby James Hilton,The Crying of Lot 49by Thomas Pynchon, andFeeding the MachinebyJames Muldoon, Mark Graham, and Callum Cant.Lost Horizon is getting on for a century old yet it feels startlingly fresh – a perfectly paced novel that balances adventure and quiet philosophy. Hilton’s prose is lean but luminous, and his idea of Shangri-La still feels like a metaphor for the human wish to withdraw from chaos without fully escaping it.Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 offered the opposite experience: a dizzying, paranoid web of symbols and coincidences that mirrors our own algorithmic age. It’s absurd, funny, and somehow comforting in its refusal to make sense.And Feeding the Machine grounded both worlds – a sharp, lucid analysis of how digital labour and AI infrastructures shape our daily lives. Reading it after Hilton and Pynchon felt like closing the loop between the dream of utopia, the breakdown of meaning, and the real machinery behind both.Explore more on these topicsBooksWhat we're readingGeoff DyerAndrew Michael HurleyXiaolu GuoDaphne du MaurierJeffrey EugenidesThomas PynchonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Suede is feeling right again now, after years in the style wilderness. These Marks & Spencer ankle boots have a 7.5cm heel, which would be ambitious as an all-day court shoe but is much more wearable in a chunky heel boot. This is because a) the snug boot supports your foot in the arched shape, which is much less tiring; and b) the shape of the heel spreads the pressure point so the height doesn’t feel so intense. The subtle gold detailing at the top of the heel is a nice touch.M&SSuede gold detail block heel ankle boots£60.80£60.80 at M&SAll I want for Christmas is a cowgirl beltStreets AheadDarci belt£153£153 at Streets AheadStreets Ahead Darci belt£151 at Streets AheadNot to be over dramatic or anything, but I need a western-style belt urgently.

But my 66°North puffer has converted me. It’s not just that it’s as sublimely toasty as you’d expect from the Icelandic brand (which has been the official outfitters of Iceland’s coastguards and search-and-rescue teams since 1928), with a pillowy collar and a detachable hood.Also – I’m sorry, but this matters – it looks great. Chunky jackets tend to make your posture look dreadful, but this falls gracefully. It’s a lot of money, but built to last, and 66°North is committed to sustainability and will repair your coat, however old it is. (It keeps an archive of zips and fastenings at its Icelandic HQ so it is able to match what you have, however long ago you bought it.) I have this in a fire-engine red, which as an Arsenal fan, is ideal for cold-weather games at the Emirates, but I realise that is a niche choice, and “licorice” (black) is chic.66°NorthDyngja cropped down jacket£440£440 at 66°NorthSocks, lovely socksZaraRibbed socks with metallic stripes£9.99£9.99 at ZaraRibbed socks with metallic stripes£9.99 at ZaraIt has been the year of the sock.

But I think we should be able to decommission words that have brought more trouble than they’re worth, starting with the 2015 runner-upMon 1 Dec 2025 12.33 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 13.29 ESTShareThe Oxford word of the year has been chosen, andit’s “rage bait”. It was a close-run contest with “aura farming” – that just means charisma, for which a number of perfectly fine words already exist – and “biohack”, a non-specific lifestyle improvement in which you’ve somehow got into the mainframe of time itself, and made some aspect of your body immune to its ravages. Since “aura farming” is extraneous and “biohacks” are almost all bollocks, the competition can’t have been that close, but the neologism isn’t necessarily welcome.Rage bait, as you probably already know, is the publication, usually online, of material designed to make people angry. It’s not a made-up phenomenon; we’ve known for some time thatonline engagement is most strongly driven by out-group animosity, but nor is it a cute feature of modern life, like iced matcha lattes and Labubus. It creates intellectual silos, drives deep social divisions, and ultimately corrodes trust in institutions and reason itself, as people feel so alienated from any but their own tribe that they cease to believe anything except word of mouth. I’d argue that it’s a bit like making “ethnic cleansing” your word of 1992, during the Bosnian war. Yes, people were using it a lot, but that didn’t make it a fun answer for a quiz. Turns out itwasnamedUn-Word of the year by the GfdS(society for spoken German), which deplored its euphemistic nature. And that is fair. Anyway, good luck in the dictionary business, Oxford, if you collude to make rage bait all the rage. Your alphabetical list of meanings isn’t going to get anyone’s dander up.Since there is no right of appeal on which word has landed hardest each year, we ought at least to be able to decommission words that have lost their usefulness, irrevocably changed meaning or brought more trouble than they were worth. “Mansplain” was a New York Times word of the year in 2010, was shortlisted for Oxford’s WOTY in 2015, and then made it into the Oxford English Dictionary three years later, by which time there was already a backlash, or Mansplainers for Justice movement, if you prefer. It landed on linguistic ground parched for a way to say, “Why is this guy at a party explaining something to me that I actually wrote a book about?” So many people had had that experience, or similar, that it was immediately popular – yet its net was wide, and caught a few people who were explaining something theydidknow about and they happened to be guys, which is to say, it came to be used (by some people, definitely not me) to mean “a man is talking”.It was also repurposed, most recently by Rachel Reeves in a pre-budget interview, to mean “some people are criticising me, and I am a woman”. This prompted Kemi Badenoch to weigh in, on thePolitical Thinking podcast, by saying: “All we have had [from the chancellor] is wallowing in self-pity and whining about misogyny and mansplaining.” Apart from her needlessly ugly and bellicose language, she had a point (this is the first and hopefully the last time I have thought this); you’ve got to be able to defend your economic decisions, as chancellor, without crying foul on the characters of those criticising them. But Badenoch then went on to claim that the budget was unchristian, on the basis that “in early Christian times, there was no state or welfare”. This prompted an absolute barrage of whatsomemight callmansplaining about the nature of the Roman state, including the FT’sStephen Bush’s indelible question: “There was no state. Who does she think crucified him, an anarchist collective?”Yet since it all came from people who knew more about the Romans than Badenoch, the fact that they were all guys, even the fact that they were all playing into a separate masculinity meme, “thinking about the Roman empire at least once a day”, did not make it mansplaining. It was simply explaining in a condescending tone of voice. The original concept, then, was misused by the chancellor, attacked by the leader of the opposition, could have been deployed by civil society, but such was the depth of the opposition leader’s ignorance that it’s not possible to mansplain to her (not about Rome, anyway). The relativism is too slidey, no compound word could contain it. Or maybe I’m just trying to rage-bait Badenoch.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Thanks to an economic model no longer able to offer a sustained rise in living standards or properly functioning public services, and a foreign policy defined by murderous calamities – culminating in Israel’s Gaza genocide – the radical left has its biggest ever receptive audience.But by the time of its founding conference in Liverpool at the weekend, Your Party had offered a masterclass in how the left can never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Members repelled by a Labour devoid of answers to Britain’s multiple crises were ready to listen to a credible, inspiring alternative. Instead, they have been subjected to a bitter public schism between Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, its two leading founders, as well as threats of legal action, public denunciations, unsavoury anonymous briefings to rightwing newspapers and anobsession with internal process. The politically disillusioned have accordingly transferred their attention to Zack Polanski’s Green party, which has clearly repositioned itself on the unapologetic left and been rewarded with a membership of 170,000 and some polling that isahead of Labour.Given all that,55,000 peoplesigning up to a new party – nearly as many as the membership of the Liberal Democrats – is impressive. Two and a half thousand conference delegates represented a dramatic scaling down of ambitions, but a sizeable number for an initial gathering. Attenders brimmed with idealism, positivity – and fear of the stakes. “This is the last throw of the dice, we know that,” one delegate told me. “We’ve heard for years, ‘it’s socialism or barbarism’ – and itissocialism or barbarism.” Given the surge of the far right, and questions over the survival of US democracy, Rosa Luxemburg’s famous maxim can no longer be so easily dismissed as hyperbole.But our present danger does not seem to have provoked a general concentrating of minds. Sultana unilaterally announced first the party’s launch, without the agreement of Corbyn,then a portalfor people to sign up as members. This was disavowed by her Your Party colleagues, but not before hundreds of thousands of pounds was raised, leading to mutual legal threats. Only some of this has been transferredto Your Party, with Sultana promising to transfer the rest as long as the liabilities of the company that holds the money are settled. Corbyn tells me, “We were worried that we’d be able to even pay for the conference two weeks ago.” Sultana’s camp feel they have been frozen out, that Corbyn’s longtime aides are control freaks and that there was too much dithering. But this unseemly drama has repelled most of those who are receptive to radical politics butwho aren’t activists and who are allergic to those traditional leftwing blights: in-fighting, posturing, sectarianism and an obsession with meetings.Those hoping the launch conference would end the drama were bitterly disappointed. When a few delegates – mostly belonging to the Socialist Workers party (SWP) – were banned from attending,Sultana boycottedthe first day. Was this conference not an opportunity to move on from toxic drama, I put it to her? “That’s what I thought until people were being expelled and there was a witch-hunt that took place. I think pretending that hasn’t happened is just not being honest.” The expulsions certainly did not go down well with other delegates. “If people wanted a central dictatorship, they’d join the Labour party and people don’t want that,” one young doctor told me. Conference voted decisively to reject a ban on dual membership, though which parties are allowed will be determined by an elected central executive committee.But watching the SWP pose as democratic tribunes sticks in the craw. This highly centralised sect bans permanent internal factions. It seems to me to have been ostracised by much of the wider left over ascandal involving alleged rapemore than a decade ago. Like other Trotskyist sects, it can be effective at organising – or indeed dominating – single-issue campaigns, but is incapable of securing mass support even in times of crisis and turmoil. It is not genuinely invested in Your Party’s success: it simply spies an opportunity to attract new recruits, most of whom it will burn out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its demand for collective leadership – a ruling body of 20 –narrowly passed. Its leading figure, an always thought-provoking activist called Max Shanly, argued that traditional parties reflect the evils of existing society “in their structures, practices and modes of behaviour”. A party seeking to democratise society must reflect on ultra-democratic principles. An experiment now beckons: will Your Party become the acorn of a newly liberated society, or a battleground dominated by revolutionary sects thanks to their organisational capacity, stamina and obsessive behaviour?Corbyn himself remains to represent the “spirit of 2017”: the year a Labour party led by him secured 40% of the vote, depriving the Tories of a majority, after offering a leftwing policy platform. His conference speech was infused with the from-the-heart, non-dogmatic, unpolished socialism that, at its best, attracted so much enthusiasm.But the diminished number remaining inYour Partyare more attracted to the much more militant and overtly ideological tack taken by Sultana. She has sought “wedge” issues to distinguish the party from the Greens. She criticises them for not demanding immediate withdrawal from Nato (Polanski favours seeking alternative security alliances first) and not committing to ending all diplomatic relations with Israel (the Greens support the demands of the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, and proscribing the Israel Defence Forces as a terrorist organisation). She emphasises the “need to nationalise the entire economy”.With the Greens thriving with a radical message and a new viral social-media strategy reminiscent of New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s quirky, sunny optimism, there is a question about how many voters this approach will appeal to. Some delegates put it to me that this will be a decades-long struggle, and that there are no short cuts to socialism. But in an age of resurgent fascism, economic and social turmoil, and looming climate catastrophe, some might ask if the left really has the luxury of time.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYour PartyOpinionJeremy CorbynZarah SultanaGreen partyZack PolanskicommentShareReuse this content"

They don’t, mostly, express a yearning for strict religiosity or voluntary celibacy, but for community, purpose and a retreat from chaos. It’s the same impulse that attracts women tosingle-sex communitiesor makes them pine, like Stella in Bernard MacLaverty’s brilliantMidwinter Break, forbéguinages(the lay communities of single women that flourished in the Low Countries in the middle ages). We all just want peace.Well, sisters, now there’s a self-help book. I have been reading, and highly recommend,Convent Wisdom: how sixteenth-century nuns could save your twenty-first century life, a delightful glimpse into the colourful lives of counter-reformation nuns. The florid religiosity (levitation, mystical visions, eating cat sick and cobwebs) might not be entirely relatable, but it’s thrilling to learn how powerful, purposeful women managed the unreasonable demands of male authority figures, made ends meet and lived on their own (and God’s) terms.It’s salutary, too, to realise any serenity was hard won: they also suffered crushes and complex friendships, finances described as “a demonic mess” (hard relate) and terrible bosses. I warmed, predictably, to Augustinian María de San José, who felt “the greatest repugnance for work” and left behind 12 volumes of lamentations about how awful writing was.I haven’t gleaned practical life hacks or (sorry) habits, but wish I could, like María de Jésus de Agréda, solve my time management issues by bilocating (miraculously being in two places at once).

From the West Bank to Syria and Lebanon, Israel’s onslaught continuesNesrine MalikBroken ceasefires, bombing, ground incursions and mounting deaths: Israeli imperialism is now expanding across the regionMon 1 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 04.24 ESTShareIt is clear now that the ceasefire in Gaza is only a “reducefire”. The onslaught continues. There are near-dailyattacks on the territory. On a single day at the end of October, almost 100 Palestinians were killed. On 19 November, 32 were killed. On 23 November, 21. And on it goes. Since the ceasefire, more than 300 have been killed and almost 1,000 injured. Those numbers will rise. The real shift is that the ceasefire has reduced global attention and scrutiny. Meanwhile, Israel’s emerging blueprint becomes clearer: bloody domination not only in Gaza, but across Palestine and the wider region.A “dangerous illusion that life in Gaza is returning to normal”, is how Amnesty International’s secretary general, Agnès Callamard,describedthis post-ceasefire period. Israeli authorities have reduced attacks and allowed some aid into Gaza, she said, but “the world must not be fooled. Israel’s genocide is not over.” Not a singlehospitalin Gaza has returned to being fully operational. The onset of rain and cooling weather has left thousands exposed in dilapidated tents. Since the ceasefire on 10 October, almost 6,500 tonnes of UN-coordinated relief materials have been denied entry into Gaza by Israeli authorities. According toOxfam, in the two weeks after the ceasefire alone, shipments of water, food, tents and medical supplies from 17 international NGOs were denied.The result is that a population whose homes, livelihoods and stable shelter have been eliminated still are not allowed to secure safer tents or adequate food. Israeli authorities hold people in Gaza in a painful purgatory, continuing collective punishment, preventing the conditions for a normal life from emerging and establishingIsraelas sole unaccountable overlord, with unlimited power over the people of the territory.Gaza is at the sharp end of an expansion of Israeli imperialism, one that stretches to the West Bank and beyond. In the occupied territories of the West Bank, a crackdown that has intensified since 7 October 2023 continues to escalate into a full military siege. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forced out of their homes this year in a pattern that Human Rights Watchsaidamounted to “war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing … that should be investigated and prosecuted”. Last week,footage emergedof two Palestinian men in Jenin being executed by Israeli soldiers after it appeared that they had surrendered. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, said that the forces involved in the killings have his “full backing”. They “acted exactly as expected of them – terrorists must die”.1:24Moment Israeli forces shoot dead surrendered Palestinians – video reportAnd this is only a small window, in a rare filmed moment, into the bloodshed. More than 1,000 people havebeen killedby Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank over the past two years. One in five of them are children. More than 300 cases were suspected “extrajudicial executions”. In October of this year, the UNregisteredmore than 260 settler attacks, the highest level since its records began 20 years ago. More than 93% of investigations into these attacks endwith no chargesfiled. Scores of Palestinian prisoners arereportedto die in Israeli prisons of physical violence or medical neglect, and those who do make it out aliverecounta hellscape of torture and abuse.And still, the parameters of Israel’s mandate to assault, kill and land grab continue to widen. Last week, Israeli forceslauncheda ground incursion in southern Syria, killing 13 Syrians, among them children. The Israeli military refused to provide information on the group it claimed to be targeting in the raid. It was simply reserving its right to reach into Syrian territory, as it has several times since it invaded and occupied the buffer zone between the two countries, and other parts of southern Syria. Since it has done so, Israeli forces have beenaccusedby Human Rights Watch of applying the colonial playbook seen in Palestinian territories: forced displacements, home seizures, demolitions, cutting of livelihoods and unlawful transfer of Syrian detainees to Israel. Israel intends to maintain its presence indefinitely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite a peace deal negotiationlast November, Israel has launched almostdaily bombingsin Lebanese territory. The latest was only last week. It continues to occupy five vantage points from which it launches attacks on targets it claims are linked to Hezbollah. According to a UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Israel is guilty of more than 10,000 air and ground violations of the ceasefire, during which hundreds of people have been killed. In the melee, civilians are, once again, ejected from their lands, vulnerable to Israeli military assaults and essentially subjects of a sort of Israeli super-sovereignty. According to a recent New York Timesreport, “the situation in Lebanon offers a compelling example of a new Middle East where Israel’s reach is near ubiquitous”.What sort of ceasefires are these? What sort of status quo is this? A volatile and unsustainable one, is the answer, one during which no reasonable mind can expect any sort of peace to materialise, either inPalestineor in the wider Middle East. Brokers and stakeholders and diplomats may repeat the language of phased ceasefires and reconstruction schemes, but the reality is that these are plans for a future that is never going to emerge unless Israel’s unlawful acts across territories that it has no legal rights over come to an end. The dangerous illusion that life is returning to normal applies not only in Gaza, but across Palestine and the wider region. It will soon shatter.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What he wasn’t expecting was Ian Wright suddenlyfilling a phone screen with a congratulatory video. The former England and Arsenal striker saluted him on “what you’ve achieved”, urged him to channel that “winning energy” into the job ahead before signing off with a nod to the Arsenal manager,Mikel Arteta. Mamdani cheesed guilelessly as it played before finally blurting out: “I love this man.”For a moment, the incoming mayor of the most powerful city in the United States was simply another geeked-outArsenalobsessive left weak by one of his childhood heroes. And in that moment lies something revealing about how football fandom in the US has changed. This was not a politician deploying a sports reference for relatability; it was a display of genuine allegiance that’s planted at the intersection of two different stories about how Americans have come to love the global game.What Mamdani’s reaction captured, in miniature, is the broader moment US soccer now finds itself in. Stateside interest has quietly climbed to unprecedented levels: Premier League audiences have grown for more than a decade; every big club now has thriving US supporters’ groups; and football has entered the cultural bloodstream through celebrity-ownership projects such asRyan Reynolds and Wrexham(andits various rip-offs), through athletes drifting into national politics (Cristiano Ronaldo turning a White House visit intoa surreal photo-op) and through the long on-ramp to next summer’s big, beautiful World Cup on home soil. The game is no longer niche, no longer coastal, no longer the preserve of immigrant communities or brunch-hour Europhiles.Mamdani’s politics add another note. His petition against Fifa’s dynamic pricing for 2026 World Cup tickets – which he called an “affront to the game” onthe Guardian’s Football Weekly podcast– reflects a view of football as community infrastructure rather than luxury entertainment. It treats the sport as something that belongs to working-class people and immigrant families, not theunfolding late-capitalist hellscapeof ticketing algorithms and resale platforms. That stance is both global and deeply local; both socialist and recognisably football-supporter logic.Mamdani’s affinity with Arsenal lands with added weight because it reveals what the sport already means in the US: a cross-class, multi-ethnic, diasporic, online, joyful cultural force. For a couple of decades now, Arsenal in particular have occupied a curiously prominent place in the imaginations of American progressives. During the Arsène Wenger years, the club became a kind of cultural shorthand for the liberal intelligentsia. They played “European” football at a time when the term connoted sophistication:Henrygliding,Piresdrifting, Wenger lecturing about diet and psychology. On the east coast, when matches were finally moved from pay-per-view to the broader availability of Fox Soccer channel, 7am kick-offs becameritualised social markers. For many, supporting Arsenal was less a sporting choice than a signal of curated worldliness.But this is only one strand of the US’s football story, and not the one Mamdani comes from. He was born and raised in Kampala and Cape Town before his family relocated when he was seven to Morningside Heights in Upper Manhattan, as the great Wenger teams of the early 00s further informed his sporting consciousness. His Arsenal was the Arsenal of Kanu, Lauren, Kolo Touré, Eboué and Song – a club whose African spine made it beloved across the continent long before it became fashionable in Brooklyn. When he says that Arsenal might be the most popular club in Uganda, he’s expressing a deeper truth about the Premier League’s longstanding place in African diasporic culture.And Arsenal itselfincreasingly leans in to this heritage. Last season’s alternative kit, designed by the Sierra Leone-born Foday Dumbuya, explicitly honoured its African fanbase. It followed theJamaica-themed pre-match striplaunched at Notting Hill carnival, part of a broader cultural moment that has long intertwined Arsenal with Black British identity and, increasingly, with the US-based Black creative community, where culture-shapers such as Spike Lee and Jay-Z have embraced the club’s diaspora-rich sensibility. The Arsenal that influenced Mamdani is the same Arsenal that helped define modern British multiculturalism, which helps explain why his reaction to Wright resonated so widely.These two versions of fandom – the curated and the inherited – have long existed along parallel tracks in a country of 340 million souls. What feels new is the way these stories are converging. Mamdani’s reaction united them perfectly: the diasporic Arsenal of his childhood colliding with the online Arsenal of US millennials and gen Z. The Premier League’s rise in the US – via NBC’s deft marketing and commercial strategy, social media, Instagram fan accounts and matchday rituals – has flattened the cultural landscape. A Somali teenager in Minneapolis, a Mexican-American kid in Phoenix and a 38-year-old Brooklyn journalist all speak the same meme-literate Gooner dialect now. And a whole lot more of them are wearing Messi’sInter Miami shirt. The effect is a US football culture that is finally shared. No longer the province of any one demographic, but a hybrid of diaspora, youth culture, TikTok, brunch spots and streetwear.When the mayor-elect of New York fanboys over a message from Ian Wright, it’s tempting to treat it as charming ephemera. But it is also a small window into the country’s evolving sporting psyche – a signpost that the global game has taken root here through diaspora, culture, politics and play. In a country still figuring out what its football identity even is, Mamdani’s reaction offered up a clue: it won’t be imported or inherited whole, but fashioned out of all the places Americans come from and the paths the game has taken to reach them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the US, it could make a comebackDavid KirpBans on the dangerous practice, condemned by national mental health organizations, could soon be struck downMon 1 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 06.12 ESTShareHomosexuality is an illness that therapists can and should cure: that’s the rationale for “conversion therapy”, a practice promoted as a way to change an individual’s sexual orientation from gay to straight.But a host of studies conclude that such counseling doesn’t work – small wonder, since sexual orientation is a core part of an individual’s identity. It’s also potentially harmful, especially for minors. Research shows that youth subjected to conversion practices, often at the insistence of misguided parents, are prone to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness and suicide.Until recently, this medieval practice seemed destined for the dustbin of discredited psychological theories. National mental health associations have recommended that the practice be prohibited, because it’s based on the homophobic “assumption that diverse sexual orientations and gender identities are mental illnesses”, as theAmerican Psychiatric Associationputs it.Twenty-three stateshave banned it for minors, according to the Movement Advancement Project.Now, however, it is making a comeback.This term, the US supreme court will decide whether a law prohibiting conversion practices infringes on constitutionally protected free speech. During last month’s oral argument in that case, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned whether the regulation wasn’t “just the functional equivalent” of another recent supreme court case. In June, the court upheld a ban on a different treatment – puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans youth. “It just seems odd to me that we might have a different result here,” she said. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, meanwhile,likened conversion therapyto a dietitian telling a client to do something physically harmful, saying: “I don’t think the state has to provide a study to show that the advice is not sound.”Nonetheless, comments from the bench during that argument indicate that the rightwing majority will strike down these laws. Anguished survivors fear the disastrous consequences of such a ruling. They’re speaking out on social media.“I was sent to conversion therapy against my will. I endured it for six months. I was a shell of a person after, and almost took my own life … I feel compelled to plead that we cannot accept this,” one survivor wrote,according to Cosmopolitan. “Seeing what’s coming from the supreme court really terrifies me,” said another. “I’m fearful for younger generations that could be subjected to this.”By attempting to brainwash gay youth into becoming “normal”, conversion practices promotes Donald Trump’s war on the LGBTQ+ community. That explains why, relying on junk science, a Department of Health and Human Services report issued last springappeared to supportthe practice.During his New York City days, the presidentvoiced support for LGBTQ+ rights. Since then, however, he has become the arch-antagonist. Attacking trans people has proven a surefire winner for the Maga crowd. An executive order, issued only hours after he was sworn in, mandates thatpassports recognize only two sexes, male and female. That edict upends the lives of an estimated 1.3 million adults who identify as trans or gender non-conforming.Trump has also brought his gay-bashing campaign to the schoolhouse. “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,” an executive order issued his second day in the White House, prohibits federal funding for schools that introduce “gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology” in the classroom. That vague language has made teachers petrified to say anything about trans individuals.Trump’s yes men are doing their best to drive gay people into the closet. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, hasbanned trans individualsfrom serving in the military, and that’s likely to be just the start of his witch-hunt.Hegseth has suggestedthat allowing gay people to serve openly in the armed forces prioritizes social justice over unit cohesion and military readiness – a claim for which there isn’t a scintilla of evidence. Herenamed the USNS Harvey Milk, which honored the gay rights icon and navy veteran, timing the move –intentionally, according to a military.com report– during Pride month.At the FBI, a longtime employeesays he was firedfor having had a rainbow flag on his desk. . The administration has moved tocut more than $800min research grants including on LGBTQ+ health, claiming that the studies led to “unscientific” results that ignore “biological realities”. The federally-funded 988 suicide and crisis hotlineended its servicesfor LGBTQ+ youth, apparently because it promotes “radical gender ideology”. How heartless can you get?There’s no end of targets for the bully in the White House to slap around.

Please come and sue the UK for billionsGeorge MonbiotThe case of a planned Cumbrian coalmine shows how governments around the world are being threatened by litigation in shadowy offshore courtsMon 1 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 08.17 ESTShareHow do you reckon our political system works? Perhaps something like this. We elect MPs. They vote on bills. If a majority is achieved, the bills becomes law. The law is upheld by the courts. End of story. Well, that’s how it used to work. No longer.Today, foreign corporations, or the oligarchs who own them,can sue governmentsfor the laws they pass, at offshore tribunals composed of corporate lawyers. The cases are held in secret. Unlike our courts, these tribunals allow no right of appeal or judicial review. You or I cannot take a case to them, nor can our government, or even businesses based in this country. They are open only to corporations based overseas.If a tribunal determines that a law or policy may compromise the corporation’s projected profits, it can award damages of hundreds of millions, even billions. These sums represent not actual losses, but money the arbitrators decide the companymight otherwisehave made. The government may have to abandon its policy. It will be discouraged from passing future laws along the same lines, for fear of being sued.Record numbers ofcases are being brought, as corporations learn from each other, andhedge funds finance suitsin return for a share of the takings. The result? Sovereignty and democracy are becoming unaffordable.The process is known as“investor-state dispute settlement” (ISDS). The reason it is allowed to override domestic law and the decisions made by parliaments is that this provision has been written – without public consent, and often in conditions of extreme secrecy – into trade treaties.A year ago,Friends of the Earth won a great victoryat the high court. The judge ruled that plans to dig the first deep coalmine in the UK for 30 years, at Whitehaven in Cumbria, had been unlawfully approved by the Conservative government, which had accepted the bizarre claim that the mine would have no impact on our carbon budgets. The Labour government then withdrew the permission the Tories had granted. Now this victory could be compromised by an offshore tribunal answering to no one but the corporations petitioning it.In August, a company whose ultimate ownersare based in the Cayman Islandslodged a claimagainst the UK government. Last week a tribunal in Washington DCwas set up to hear it.The company is suing the UK for the money it might have made if the mine had been allowed to go ahead. We have no idea how much this might be. Who is representing it against the British government? The MP for Torridge and Tavistock, and former attorney-general in the Conservative government, that great patriot Geoffrey Cox. The government makes a decision, the high court upholds it, then a foreign company challenges it through an undemocratic offshore tribunal, and a member of our parliament acts on its behalf.On the same day (18 November) that the tribunal on the coalmine case was appointed, we learned from a parliamentary answer that the UKis also being sued under ISDSby a Russian oligarch, Mikhail Fridman. We know nothing of the case so far, but it seems likely that he’ll use the tribunal to challenge the sanctions the UK levied against him after the invasion of Ukraine. He has already started suing Luxembourg for this reason,demanding $16bn(£12.1bn): half thatgovernment’s annual revenue. Amongthe lawyers representing him there? Cherie Blair, wife of the former British prime minister.Legal experts believe the EU’s delay inusing frozen Russian assets as collateralfor its loan to Ukraine arises from Belgium’s fear that it could besued in the offshore corporate courts, under the Belgium/Luxembourg-Russia bilateral investment treaty. This extraordinary, undemocratic power over elected governments could be blocking the money Ukraine desperately needs.We were assured that such things wouldn’t happen. In 2014, David Cameron,promoting the biggest and most dangerousof all such treaties, told us: “We’ve signed trade deal after trade deal and there has never been a problem in the past.” The House of Lords adviser on this issue, Prof Dennis Novy,accused campaigners of“scaremongering … in reality, ISDS does not affect the UK much”. The overall message seemed to be that only poorer nations needed to fear these lawsuits.I warned, to general mockery, that “as corporations begin to understand the power they’ve been granted, they will turn their attention from the weak nations to the strong ones”.That threat has now materialised. This year, fossil fuel and mining firms havelodged a record numberof suits against nations rich and poor, challenging – as in the case of the Cumbrian coalmine – government attempts to stop climate breakdown. Corporations have so far won$114bn (£86bn) through ISDS, of which fossil fuel companies have secured $84bn (£64bn). Thatequates to the combined GDPof the world’s 45 smallest economies. The average payout these companies have received is $1.2bn (£910m). In some cases they threaten to suck the poorest nations dry. This is climate finance in reverse: huge payments to fossil fuel corporations from governments with the temerity to try to stop an existential crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ameta-study in 2020 found that, when it comes to encouraging foreign investment, the “effect of international investment agreements is so small as to be considered zero”. A reportcommissioned by the UK governmentin 2013 found that ISDS was “highly unlikely to encourage investment” and was “likely to provide the UK with few or no benefits”.Yet Keir Starmer’s government shuts its ears. It has reportedly beentrying to push an ISDS mechanisminto the investment treaty it is negotiating with India, and into the other trade treaties it is working on. We cannot know for sure, because they’re beingnegotiated in total secrecy. You could almost believe there were things the government didn’t want us to see. It refuses to talk to campaigners or to offer more information.We have twice beaten attempts to extend ISDS, through vast popular movements against themultilateral agreement on investmentand theTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Now we will need to mobilise again: this time against our own government, which seems to care more for foreign corporations than it does for us.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLawOpinionEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Sensible fixes exist, but require imagination ministers have yet shownMon 1 Dec 2025 13.56 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 17.24 ESTShareThe confected frenzy splashed across the morning front pages from theTelegraph to the Mailis remarkable mostly for its absurdity. An outrage machine has decided that a forecast of a few billion pounds in a model that makesprojectionsabout trillions of pounds of taxes and spending is the lie of the century. We can’t predict the weather next year, but apparently the public finances in 2029 can be judged with pinpoint accuracy. That’s why the headlines about “holes” and “sleaze probes” are a joke. It is theatre, but it is bad theatre.The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) possesses no great moral or predictive authority. Yet many of its accusers and defenders treat it as an all‑seeing oracle. In fact, the OBR, to its credit,admitsthat its medium-term projections are frequently wrong. It often wrongly estimates inflation and productivity, and has had its assumptions upended by unforeseen events. The OBR’s 2019 five-year forecast undershot actual GDP growth by £200bn. Given this degree of error, treating a projected current budget balance of£20bnin 2029-30 as a hard fact is deeply unserious.The government colludes in this fiction. Rachel Reeves wasn’t deceitful – just notcandid. Sir Keir Starmer suggested that the OBR had been overzealous in assessing UK productivity once Labour arrived in power – as if civil servants had it in for the incoming government. As it turns out, the OBR has bigger problems than a “bemused” prime minister to deal with – like having a hackable website with market‑sensitive information. The watchdog paid the price – itschairfell on his sword.Ms Reeves and Sir Keir embrace a fiscal rule that requires the current budget surplus in 2029-30 – a target that exists to soothe bond markets. Britain’s economy remains depressed, with a long-term trade deficit and low private-sector investment. Under these conditions, the government must by definition run a deficit – or else see rising unemployment and indebtedness. Pretending otherwise is a polite fiction for “the markets”. And markets, naturally, prefer more “headroom”: it implies lessgilt issuance, which pushes up bond prices and pushes down yields. Their preference for austerity is laundered as fiscal rectitude when it is self-interest.In contrast, Labour MPs don’t want public spending – orwelfare– cuts and do want ways to tax wealth more effectively. This stance clashes with Ms Reeves’s self-imposed straitjacket. The government’s instability is because it has put itself between the instincts of its MPs and the demands of bond traders.As thiscolumnhasarguedbefore, there aresolutions. The government could reduce the interest bill that drives so much of the deficit. It could tax the banks’ windfall gains from higher rates, as theLiberal Democratssuggest. It could follow former central bankerPaul Tucker’s adviceand “tier” reserve remuneration, saving billions by cutting the interest paid on commercial banks’ balances, shrinking Threadneedle Street’s losses and reducing costs to the exchequer. It could take its cue from theNew Economics Foundationand end the Treasury’sindemnityof the Bank’s quantitative easing losses – boosting Treasury coffers by £20bn annually.These measures would improve the fiscal position without harming Britain’s social fabric. But they require a political imagination that this government has not yet shown. The nextLabourleader might have enough of one to dispel the fear of the bond market that is paralysing politicians’ efforts to rebuild Britain.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But waiting lists stand in the way of improvementMon 1 Dec 2025 13.56 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 17.24 ESTShareMen, on average, have lowerlife expectancythan women – by aroundfour yearsin the UK. They account for three-quarters of all deaths by suicide and are more likely to smoke and be overweight. Young men are more likely than young women to die as a result of accidents, violence or overdoses. Prostate cancer is themost common cancer in men, with around 12,000 deaths every year. A public consultation on whether to introduce screening for the disease opened last week, after an expert committeeadvised againstit.So themen’s health strategyfor England launched recently by the health secretary, Wes Streeting, should be welcomed on principle. Just as a women’s health lens helps policymakers to focus on female reproductive health and risks, a men’s health lens should enable specific problems to be targeted more effectively.The question is whether our overstretched health system is in a position to use this new tool as it would need to be used if outcomes are to improve. If it isn’t, the document won’t do any harm, but it won’t do much good either, beyond providing an officially endorsed summary and some potentially useful messaging.In terms of resources, the strategy comes with £300m in 2025-26 for community health projects. While this is a useful pot for primary-care innovators to draw on, it is not enough to make a difference nationally. More significant is the upcoming review of the GP funding formula, which ought to result in more funding forpoorer areaswhere people are, on average, less healthy. There is also a pledge to improve data, disaggregating it by sex but also other characteristics, to make the vulnerabilities of specific groups (such as men from particular ethnic minorities, or gay men) clearer.Other new commitments include a campaign to encourage walking and running, following the success of the NHS’sCouch to 5k app. The strategy also signals the government’s support for peer and lived-experience support networks as part of drug and alcohol treatment programmes, and in cancer care.Pilot projectslaunched under the government’s Get Britain Working strategy have particular relevance to young men who are more likely than young women to be Neet (not in education, employment or training).The new Men’s Health Academic Network, which will provide expert advice, sounds useful, but will need to select its priorities among the daunting number of questions that are raised in the strategy. These include theimpact of social mediause on the mental health of men and boys, a possible link between internet pornography and sexual dysfunction, and the suggestion that men on average have lower levels of “health literacy” than women.Improving men’s health – including better detection of male cancers – is sensible public policy in its own right and, if communicated well, may also resonate with voters. One£42m trial of prostate cancer screeningis already under way. What this strategy, and campaigns related to it, must not become is a distraction from a deeply troubling bigger picture.Enormous waiting listsfor treatment and the disruption caused by acostly NHS reorganisationare a problem for men with addiction problems, prostate cancer or any other illness, just as they are for everyone else.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it is a stretch to suggest that the 1,000 amendments that peers have tabled to the bill represent effective independent scrutiny.What possible justification can there be for requiring every dying person – including a 90-year-old in their final weeks with advanced metastasised cancer – to provide a negative pregnancy test before their request is approved (amendment 458)? I am sure there are many peers who want to scrutinise the bill in a sensible way, but they are being thwarted by a handful who seem intent on stopping law change at any cost.The bill as currently drafted– which MPs have amended and approved – is safer than any other in the world, including in its protections for doctors. Clause 31 ensures that if Dr Thomas doesn’t wish to support her patients with this option, she would be under absolutely no obligation to do so. There are many doctors, like me, who take a different view and feel that it is deeply unethical to rob dying people of their agency at a time when it matters most to them. Healthcare professionals who want to be involved will have an important part to play in the process.I see a sad parallel between some in the medical profession trying to dictate what choices people should and should not be able to make at the end of their lives and a vocal minority in theHouse of Lordswho think they know better than Westminster’s democratically elected chamber. Dying people are depending on parliament to find a way through this logjam.Dr Jacky DavisChair, Healthcare Professionals for Assisted Dying; consultant radiologistSimon Jenkins’s article on the assisted dying debate (Unelected Lords are blocking assisted dying: that’s a democratic outrage) and the correspondence that has followed illustrate the confusion that a handful of hardline opponents in the House of Lords are taking advantage of in order to wreck Kim Leadbeater’s bill.However, as Dr Lucy Thomas points out, what is needed is legislation to permit terminal assistance to patients in indefinite and unbearable pain or distress. The bill now being dismembered by a group of peers makes the mistake, like its predecessors, of trying to meet the opposition halfway by limiting assistance in dying to those believed to have six months or less to live.The consequence, as Dr Thomas says, is without logic and is giving doctrinal opponents a field day. If passed, it may be better than nothing, but it will do nothing for patients such asTony Nicklinson, left by a stroke with nothing but the ability to ask to die, and denied that elementary mercy by the supreme court, which in 2014 decided it was a matter for parliament.What is needed now is a responsible act of government. In exchange for Leadbeater’s well-intentioned bill, with its substantial Commons majority, ministers should promote a new assisted dying bill that drops the arbitrary life expectancy test and allows doctors to help patients who need and want it to bring a life of indefinite suffering to a close.Stephen SedleyFormer appeal court judgeHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I only wish this wonderful man had the fortitude to continue in this role, but I can understand why he would feel the need to move on after five years working within the confines of the political arena of “modern” Britain.It exhausts and depresses me just reading about the lack of compassion and basic humanity shown by recent governments. I lost faith in and left theLabourparty after decades as a believer that “things could only get better”. Now, as a 75-year-old retiree, I am beginning to realise that politicians cannot make things better, but the Enver Solomons of this world can. He restores my faith in the fact that the country is not all bad when we have such amazing people carrying out such extraordinary roles.I am fortunate enough to have seven beautiful grandchildren, four of whom are the offspring of my son and a wonderful Punjabi girl who we welcomed into our family 17 years ago. I cannot possibly comprehend the thought that they could feel at all threatened. What sort of country am I living in?I naively thought that this horrific attitude to anyone who is seen as having a different culture was a product of an ignorant dying breed. I now know that’s not true when a government I had so much faith in includes a speech about an “island of strangers” and now talks of vulnerable refugees and immigrants as if they are nothing.It’s only by reading about people such as Solomon – and I have faith that there are many more – that I don’t spend my time in despair about where Britain is heading.Linda PayneLeatherhead, SurreyEnver Solomon’s mother’s South African background, which I share as a former exile, reflects our current first world’s not-so-hidden aims. The primary task of apartheid South Africa was, though, the use of itsinfamous pass laws system,enabling a world of privilege to keep out, but also use, a poor population to bolster its lifestyle and maintain wealth. This is now the case for the global first world too.In an excellent Guardianarticleseveral weeks ago about how Spain is progressively going about managing this dilemma in a far more humane way than apartheid South Africa did, it pays seasonal and other essential workers reasonably on the condition that they return to their country of origin when their tasks are completed, with the proviso that they can return.While nowhere near what I would wish for in sharing the world’s wealth and resources equitably, it at least offers some direction apart from the punitive politicising of refugees who understandably wish to better their lives and that of their families. The poverty of most refugees’ lives back home is beyond the imagination of most of us in our privileged societies that are still reaping rewards from our countries’ exploitative pasts.Peter SpeyerLondonThank God there are still people like Enver Solomon in the world. The narrative around asylum seekers is chilling. I have totally lost support of Labour – I don’t even recognise it as the party I have supported all my life. It’s hard to feel positive about the future of the people who have left desperate situations to gain hope for themselves and their children.

This was like sending an army into battle with its most effective weapons removed. It was also quite unnecessary, as Labour was going to win anyway because people just wanted the Tories out.It would have been possible forLabourto say that it had no desire or intention to raise taxes while also saying that it all depended on the economic circumstances in which it found itself. That would have been the sensible position and would have removed the straitjacket that the government is now in.But this also raises wider questions about manifestos. They should be seen as a broad prospectus, not a binding contract. It is not just that nobody reads them, but that it is impossible to know if someone voted for a party because of something in its manifesto or despite something in its manifesto. All elections produce is a mandate to rule, and ruling means responding to changing circumstances and challenges.Implementing a bad policy simply because it was in the manifesto is clearly silly. That is why the lazy language about U-turns is also silly. Replacing a bad policy with a better one is what good government is all about. It should be welcomed, not criticised.Tony WrightLabour MP for Cannock Chase, 1992-2010Explore more on these topicsLabourTax and spendingManifestos 2024Budget 2025lettersShareReuse this content"

If we understand “feminisation” to mean that contemporary workplaces are overwhelmed by women and their allegedly excessive emotions and touchy-feely refusal to compete, then it is easy to see why it might not seem to merit much thought. But there is an alternative, critical and feminist definition of the term.“Feminisation” in this sense describes the central role played by gender in the transformations of work over the past decades, from the decline of conventionally masculine forms of work in heavy industry to the rise of the service economy and the problematic idea that women’s participation in paid labour is a measure of gender equality. This critical use of “feminisation” makes visible the ways that contemporary capitalism exploits our ideas about gender. The point is not to reiterate gender stereotypes (the fallacy that women are more naturally caring than men, for example), or to suggest that feminisation is something to be either entirely celebrated or entirely critiqued.It is certainly not to suggest that any field in which women predominate is likely to be weakened (an assumption behind much of the rightwing use of the term). In critiquing the “great feminisation” thesis, we should be careful not to throw out the baby with the bathwater: a feminist approach to the topic reveals that pay, working hours and working conditions are inseparably connected with the ways we define femininity and masculinity. Accurately describing gendered working conditions is the first step in making them more equitable for all.Dr Emily J Hogg, Dr Charlotte J Fabricius(editors ofFeminized Work and the Labor of Literature)and Dr Ida Aaskov DolmerUniversity of Southern Denmark, OdenseExplore more on these topicsFeminismWomenGenderlettersShareReuse this content"

But Frank, who will face his former side Brentford at home on Saturday, said he is very confident he retains the long-term backing of the new Spurs management group led by Vinai Venkatesham, the chief executive, afterDaniel Levy’s surprise departure in September.“It seems like they’re good guys, intelligent people,” Frank said. “They know how to run businesses and are learning about football, learning more now they’ve become owners.“When we’re dealing with intelligent people they can see every successful dynasty, every successful club has taken time. Yes, you have one where you maybe win one year or the second year, but you can’t sustain it if you don’t build something sustainable.”Frank also rejected suggestions he has already lost the support of a section of the Spurs fanbase and called on all supporters to get behind his team. “I’m pretty sure every fan wants to win and wants to support,” he said.“If you’re not going to plan, then maybe some get more frustrated than others. There’s always some that shout louder than others.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With ­Piastri second and Norris only fourth, it has brought the Dutch driver right into the title fight for the last round. He is second behind Norris but ahead of Piastri, a position he ­considered unthinkable halfway through the season.“I’m excited, I’m happy to go there and have a go at it,” he said. “I go in there with just positive energy. I try everything I can but at the same time, if I don’t win it, I still know that I had an amazing season. So, it doesn’t really matter. It takes a lot of the ­pressure off. I’m just out there ­having a good time like I had on Sunday.“I know that when I sit in the car, I always try to maximise everything I can. And that’s what I’ll try to do in Abu Dhabi. A race like Qatar shows that when you think it’s going to be boring and straightforward, it’s not. So I’m hoping Abu Dhabi is going to be similar.”Verstappen goes into the decider with nothing to lose given he had no expectation of being a contender for most of this season. Afterthe Dutch GP– round 15 of the season – on 31 August, he was 104 points behind the then leader ­Piastri and was explicit that he believed the title was beyond him.Red Bull, ­however, brought a series of upgrades to thenext round in Monza, including changes to the floor and front wing, in an attempt to address the balance problems that had stymied their car at most tracks during the season. They proved enormously ­successful, with Verstappen finally feeling comfortable with his ride, and since then he has returned five wins and three podiums. He paid tribute to the team effort behind his success.“We’ve won races where maybe we shouldn’t have, like Sunday, by making the right call as a team,” he said. “Of course, it’s still up to me to execute it in the best way possible but that’s also a proper team effort.“The way I work with my race engineer, with GP, [Gianpiero Lambiase] and also the guys in the background – the whole team very close to me – I think we’re really well integrated and we know exactly what we need to ask of each other. That probably helps also when you’re in a battle like this, when you’re not the quickest, but you still pretty much maximise everything you’ve got.”Norris remains the favourite going into the race with a 12‑point lead but McLaren have managed to let themselves be put under immense pressure by Verstappen and Red Bull. At theprevious round in Las Vegas,both their cars were disqualified forexceeding the wear on the skid blockon the floor of the car, ­handing ­Verstappen a 25-point gain and ­moving him from 49 points back to 24, a deficit he reduced to 12 after McLaren’s blunder in Qatar.Norris will still take his first title if he finishes in front of both his rivals or claims third place or better. ­Verstappen would need to win and hope Norris finishes outside the podium places while Piastri, 16 points down, would need to win and have Norris finish sixth or lower.Last time Verstappen went into a decisive season-finale in Abu Dhabi was in 2021, when he was tied on points with Lewis Hamilton. He went on to claim his first title that year after therace ended in controversy,with the then race director Michael Masi improvising an interpretation of the rules to ensure the race did not finish behind a safety car. The FIA later described the decision as“human error”; the result stood.Explore more on these topicsMax VerstappenLando NorrisOscar PiastriFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

The prospect of a lifetime ban hung over the 28-year-old, who wascleared of the Football Association charges in July, and the incident against Liverpool has left West Ham looking for ways to improve the player’s frame of mind.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s footballRead moreWest Ham do not view Paquetá’s anger with the authorities as an excuse for him collecting two yellow cards, both for dissent, within seconds of one another during the2-0 defeat against the Premier League champions. There has been internal criticism of Paquetá, whose dismissal came with Liverpool only leading 1-0. It is felt at West Ham that he let down his teammates.However the club, who stood by Paquetá while he was under investigation by the FA, feel the situation is nuanced. One figure said Paquetá has been left “bitter and let down” by the investigation, argued that the pressure got to him and added that the former Lyon midfielder would find it easier to move on from the ordeal if he is provided with psychological support. West Ham, only out of the bottom three on goal difference, will discuss this week how to help the Brazilian regain his focus on the pitch.Paquetá, who came close to being sent off for dissent whenWest Ham lost against Leeds in October, has made no secret of his unhappiness. The South American, who will be suspended when Nuno Espírito Santo’s struggling side visit Manchester United on Thursday,posted on social mediaafter the Liverpool game to hit out at football’s authorities for failing to provide him with psychological support. The FA has been approached for comment.Writing in Portuguese, Paquetá said: “I understand that now I have to come across as the villain; it’s hard to live with everything that’s been caused in my life and in my psyche! I’ll keep trying to ensure they don’t affect me even more. This doesn’t justify my expulsion, and for that I apologise to the fans and my teammates!”This was followed by a reply to a post from the Sky Sports Premier League account, which featured a clip where Robert Green, the former West Ham goalkeeper on punditry duty for the broadcaster, referring to his red card as “ridiculous behaviour”. This time writing in English, Paquetá posted: “It’s ridiculous to have your life and career affected for two years without any psychological support from the federation. Perhaps this ridiculous behaviour is just a reflection of everything I’ve had to endure and, it seems, have to continue enduring! I’m sorry if I’m not perfect.”West Ham have taken note of the posts and are not underestimating their significance. At this stage there is little indication of them looking to discipline Paquetá for his red card. There is, however, a point when their sympathy will run out. They are in a relegation battle and are looking to Paquetá, who is one of their most influential players, to lead them to safety. However the playmaker’s form remains inconsistent and there are some who feel that West Ham should look to raise funds for new signings by selling him in January.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Paquetá has four goals in all competitions this season and has not provided an assist since March 2024. His disciplinary record is also a concern; he has already served a one-match ban for accumulating five bookings this season.Another worry for West Ham is why Paquetá’s teammates did not do more to prevent him from confronting the referee Darren England over his decision to award a free-kick for a foul by Niclas Füllkrug. It has not gone unnoticed that the Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker made the biggest effort to drag Paquetá away.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

No longerSign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson hereJonathan WilsonMon 1 Dec 2025 10.40 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 12.19 ESTShareThe gap at the topis five points. Arsenal have now played two of their three toughest away games of the season. They’ve come through a potentially extremely tricky week with reputation enhanced, despite being without one of their starting centre-backs for all three games and both for one of them. If there is any sense of disappointment, it is only that theyfailed to beat Chelsea, whom they have become accustomed to getting the better of, despite having a man advantage from the 38th minute on Sunday.But really there shouldn’t be any disappointment. Coming out of the international break, havingconceded a late equaliserto Sunderland in their previous game, Arsenal looked potentially vulnerable. Despite having been by far the most impressive side this season, their lead over Manchester City was only four points. They were without Gabriel, who probably ranks alongside Declan Rice as their most important player. They faced Tottenham, Bayern and Chelsea over the course of eight days, and Manchester City appeared to be beginning to gather momentum.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s footballRead moreSince then they have outplayed Tottenham and Bayern, winning both games comfortably, and drawn away against Chelsea who had risen to second and may turn out to be their most serious title challenger. And that’s despite losing William Saliba for the game at Stamford Bridge. At the same time, City have suddenly lost momentum,losing at Newcastle last weekand beingbeaten at homein the Champions League by Bayer Leverkusen, before Saturday’s unconvincing performance against Leeds, when they let a two-goal lead slip beforeburgling a late winner. Although Liverpool won at West Ham on Sunday, having finally dropped Mohamed Salah, defeats to Nottingham Forest and PSV Eindhoven in the previous week give no indication of a side gearing up to mount a charge.It’s not just thatArsenalare playing well; it’s that their rivals really are not.Chelsea, like Sunderland, showed that Arsenal can perhaps be unsettled by physical opponents, but it’s not a glaring weakness. It’s true that three of the past four goals Arsenal have conceded in the Premier League have been the result of balls played into the box and won by an enormous centre-back, but this is nothing likeArsène Wenger’s side of old going to Stoke: this version of Arsenal are more than happy to mix it up when necessary.In that sense, Sunday’s game felt like a throwback: partly to the days when Didier Drogba would bully whichever centre-back he was up against (not that Arsenal’s duo of Cristhian Mosquera or Piero Hincapié wilted in the way some of their predecessors had), and in part to something far more distant, to the early years of thePremier Leaguewhen every big clash was a brutal battle of muscle.The one remaining question about Arsenal is how they respond to adversity. Perhaps their most consistent fault under Mikel Arteta has been their tendency to be knocked off course by a freak occurrence, an injury, a red card or a surprise equaliser. That’s perhaps why there is such a focus at this early stage of the season on their lead, as though they need clear water ahead. But this last week has suggested they do now have the resilience of champions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Arsenal of the past three seasons might have been deflated by that – as, indeed, hadhappened against Bayern Munichin the quarter-final in 2023-24. This week, with admittedly lower stakes, Arsenal reset and quickly reasserted their supremacy to win 3-1.Conceding early in the second half against Chelsea, similarly, might easily have derailed them. As it was, though, Arsenal didn’t panic. They kept going. Bukayo Saka finally got the better of Marc Cucurella – who, having marked Lamine Yamal out of the game on Chelsea’s win over Barcelona on Tuesday, did a fine job on the England wide man as well – and crossed for Mikel Merino to level.Arsenal will have to get used to opponents trying to test them from set-plays – the corner from which Trevoh Chalobah scored came from David Raya saving a João Pedro header from a free-kick. But Mosquera and Hincapié have proved able deputies of Gabriel and Saliba and there is still Christian Norgaard in reserve. The squad is deep and coherent. Other rivals will also try to impose themselves physically on Arsenal, but they have shown themselves just about able to stand up to that.The only slight concern is that the gap remains only five points despite Arsenal’s seeming superiority, but that is still a healthy lead and, after Aston Villa next weekend, the fixtures between now and Christmas would suggest that could soon increase.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

The verdict is likely to be announced on Wednesday.As South Africa closed in ona record 73-0 win in Cardiff, Etzebeth clashed with the Welsh back-row Alex Mann, appearing to make contact with his opponent’s left eye in a fracas involving several players from both sides.With two minutes left at the ­Principality Stadium, the 34‑year‑old was shown a red card by the referee, Luc Ramos, after a review with the television match official, Eric Gauzins. “You have a clear ­finger in the eyes, so for me, it’s a ­permanent red card,” Ramos said during the review.A ban would be a blow to ­Etzebeth’s club, the Sharks, who begin their Champions Cup campaign in Toulouse on Sunday before hosting ­Saracens in Durban six days later. The maximum ban for making intentional contact with an opponent’s eyes is four years, while an offence at the lowest end of the scale may result in a four-week suspension.A mid-range offence could involve an eight-week ban and a top-end offence 12 weeks, with any ban’s length potentially reduced in light of his previously good disciplinary record, and other submissions made by Etzebeth’s team.A number of factors will be con­sidered, including the fact that ­Etzebeth reportedly apologised to Mann after the match. Should the panel find that Etzebeth intentionally eye-gouged his opponent, however, a long ban seems guaranteed.“I don’t know what I can say now that won’t be controversial,” Rassie Erasmus, South Africa’s head coach, said on Saturday. “It didn’t look good, I think it was a justified red card. How it happened and why it happened, and if he was provoked, I’m not sure. But that’s definitely not the way we would have liked to end the game.”In January, the South Africa wing and Etzebeth’s clubmate, Makazole Mapimpi, was banned for three matches having admitted making contact with the eye area of an opponent in a United Rugby Championship encounter against Cardiff. Mapimpi had previously been banned for two weeks for a similar incident involving Maxime Lucu, of Bordeaux, in 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If so, then Stokes would be required to bowl more overs as the fourth seamer.Much will hinge on ­England’s reading of conditions in Brisbane and whether talk of the ­latest pink Kookaburra ball going softer than its red equivalent means potential periods of attritional cricket. Given the first Test in Perth lastedonly two days, with millions of dollars in revenue lost, the Gabba groundstaff may be well wary of ­setting things up for a repeat.Australia’s record of played 14, won 13 in day-night Test cricket is imperious – a considerable challenge given the current scoreline. But that one defeat in the format took place in Brisbane in January 2024 when West Indiespulled off a shock for the ages.View image in fullscreenJosh Tongue featured for the England Lions against a Prime Minister’s XI in Canberra last week.Photograph: Lukas Coch/EPAThe pace of Shamar Joseph famously stole the show but their ­off-spinning all-rounder, Kevin ­Sinclair, also played a role. He scored 64 runs from No 8 across his two innings – vital in an eight-run win – and broke a stand worth 81 during Australia’s first innings by removing Usman Khawaja. With this in mind, the more all-round Jacks could well be the way to go.Though not as quick as Wood, a return for Tongue after his detour to Canberra would ­maintain the all-out pace approach seen in Perth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A burst down the right from Omar Haktab Traoré and a cross to the front post was met by fellow substitute Stefan Schimmer, and a wobbling Union had stumbled. The away side sensed the moment and a corner from Arijon Ibrahimovic, swung in just after the announced four minutes of stoppage time in moments added by Schimmer’s goal and its aftermath, was headed in by another sub, Jan Schöppner, to spark pandemonium. Referee Patrick Ittrich almost immediately blew for full-time and finally, more than two months after their hitherto solitaryBundesligawin of the season, Schmidt and company were taking three points home.Roma still dare to dream after remarkable 2025 despite Napoli setback | Nicky BandiniRead moreIt was an unpleasant bit of deja vu for Union, having conceded a slightly more prestigious last-gasp heartbreaker to Harry Kane in their previous home game but it all came down, in the end, to the Heidenheim hex. Union have not beaten Heidenheim in 11 meetings now, and never at all in top-flight action. If ever it was going to happen, perhaps it had to be now.And what a weekend on which to do it. With another pair of late, late goals in Munich, with added-time strikes from Bayern’s Luis Díaz and Nicolas Jackson snaffling an improbable point away from St Pauli and condemning them to a ninth straight league defeat after a best-ever start (it seems extraordinary that both those things could have happened before December, but there you go), Heidenheim were out of the bottom two automatic relegation positions, underlining CEO Holger Sanwald’s words that “these three points are worth their weight in gold” with so many spluttering teams at the bottom.That was emphasised 27 hours later, when there were no such twists as now-bottom Mainz showed not the smallest likelihood of changing the new order in being submerged at Freiburg, on the wrong end of a 4-0 scoreline that felt less like a defeat and more like an avalanche.The only thing that could be described as a turnaround there was in the words of Niko Bungert, Mainz’s sporting director who, for the first time, didn’t back coach Bo Henriksen unequivocally. “We will discuss [Henriksen’s position] calmly,” he told Dazn after the game. “It is clear to us, of course, that after such a game and given our current league position, the situation is terrible and we will be examining every aspect to figure how to proceed and turn things around.”View image in fullscreenMainz slumped to a 4-0 defeat against Freiburg.Photograph: Daniela Porcelli/Getty ImagesHenriksen’s spell in charge of the 05ers has been a whirlwind. He took over a doomed-looking team in February 2024, as their third head coach of the season. Less than a month later they were hammered 8-1 at Bayern, leaving them nine points adrift of 15th-placed Bochum and no-playoff-required total safety. Nine unbeaten games later and their season had been saved, finishing 13th.It was a sensational springboard and life under the Danish coach continued apace, with Mainz going into the final weeks of last season with the possibility of winning a barely believable first-ever Champions League qualification. In the end they finished sixth, still a remarkable tale and opening the way for a Conference League campaign, which started with three wins out of three, including a famous victory over Fiorentina at the Mewa Arena (even if the Italians, like themselves, were going through the contrast of a positive start in Europe versus serious domestic struggles).Quick GuideBundesliga resultsShowFreiburg 4-0 Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt 1-1 Wolfsburg, Hamburg 2-1 Stuttgart, Leverkusen 1-2 Dortmund, Bayern Munich 3-1 St Pauli, Hoffenheim 3-0 Augsburg, Union Berlin 1-2 Heidenheim, Werder Bremen 1-1 Cologne, Mönchengladbach 0-0 LeipzigWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sunday night’s humiliation in the Black Forest – which could have been way, way worse, with Freiburg having nearly 75% possession and winning the shot count 23-1 – was the cap on a tough week, starting with Monday’s restless AGM and continuing through Thursday’s first European defeat of the season at Universitatea Craiova, after which the team was booed and whistled by the 1,200 fans who had followed them to Romania.What happens next is tough to predict. Mainz have the quality to escape this, even post-Jonathan Burkhardt as Nadiem Amiri leads the way – but it feels less and less like Henriksen will be part of the solution. Heidenheim will stick with Schmidt and can, at least, cling to the hope that the points target for safety is likely to be a very low one this season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Christian Kofane’s late goal for Leverkusen fell short of rescuing a point from a very creditable performance, with BVB already leading 2-0 after Aarón Anselmino and Karim Adeyemi struck. Perhaps as noteworthy was Niko Kovac’s continued forthright team management, with top scorer Serhou Guirassy ignoring his coach’s attempt to shake his hand after being substituted just after the hour. Kovac was proved more than right, with Guirassy’s replacement Fábio Silva delivering a perfect pass for Adeyemi’s eventual winner four minutes after entering the game and everyone involved quickly moving on. “After the game,” said Kovac, “[myself and Guirassy] talked things through on the pitch. Or rather, I explained it to him.”View image in fullscreenKarim Adeyemi of Dortmund celebrates their second goal against Leverkusen.Photograph: Lukas Schulze/Bundesliga/Bundesliga Collection/Getty ImagesSo with fourth beating (and leapfrogging) third, Bayern’s late goals further feathered their leaders’ nest, especially with Leipzig dropping points in a goalless draw at improving Borussia Mönchengladbach on Friday. Ole Werner’s side might have left Borussia-Park with even less, with a potential Franck Honorat winner ruled out for the most marginal of offsides; even after VAR intervention it was impossible to tell from the TV pictures, much to the annoyance of Gladbach’s newly-made-permanent coach Eugen Polanski. “Unfortunately, we develop football in such a way that we want to see more goals,” complained Polanski, “and then we whistle for things like this. I’m also not entirely sure when the exact moment of the ball being released is, whether it’s accurate to the hundredth of a second.”Bayern’s late show thus put them eight points clear, though greater media focus has been on fan protests – mirrored across other German grounds – with ultras taking aim at Hamburg’s interior senator Andy Grote, who will chair a conference in Bremen this week on measures regarding security at matches, and many ultra groups fear further restrictions on their freedoms. Uli Hoeness also got it in the neck from Bayern’s hardcore on another banner for suggesting he was open to the end of the 50+1 rule, which he doubled down on at the Power Days live event at Munich’s Olympiahalle on Sunday night. “[The ultras] want to control football themselves,” said Hoeness, “and they haven’t even realised that all the clubs where ultras have the say have become second-rate – Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Schalke.”PosTeamPGDPts1Bayern Munich1235342RB Leipzig129263Borussia Dortmund1210254Bayer Leverkusen1211235Hoffenheim128236Stuttgart124227Eintracht Frankfurt125218Freiburg12-1169Werder Bremen12-51610Cologne1211511Union Berlin12-41512Borussia M'gladbach12-31313Hamburg12-71214Augsburg12-121015Wolfsburg12-8916Heidenheim12-17817St Pauli12-14718Mainz12-126Explore more on these topicsBundesligaEuropean club footballHeidenheimUnion BerlinMainz 05featuresShareReuse this content"

Teaching had been postponed as some schools were being used as emergency shelters, it added.Human-caused climate breakdown has increased the occurrence of the most intense and destructive tropical cyclones, though the overall number of storms per year has not changed globally. This is because warming oceans provide more energy, producing stronger storms. Extreme rainfall from tropical cyclones has increased substantially, as warmer air holds more water vapour.Explore more on these topicsAsia PacificIndonesiaThailandSri LankaMalaysiaFloodingSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

His behavior deteriorated so sharply that a community advocate reached out to a refugee organization for help, fearing he was becoming suicidal.They did not, however, see any indication that Lakanwal would commit violence against another person.Trump invites families of national guard members who were shot to White HouseRead moreSarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed in the shooting, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in critical condition. Lakanwal, 29, has been charged with first-degree murder. He was shot by another national guard member during the incident and is also hospitalized.In Afghanistan, Lakanwal worked in a special CIA-backed Afghan army unit known as a Zero Unit. He entered the US in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the chaotic US withdrawal. Many had worked alongside US troops and diplomats.He resettled in the US with his wife and their five sons, all under the age of 12, in Bellingham, Washington, but struggled to assimilate, according to the community member.The emails described a man who was unable to hold a steady job or commit to his English courses while he alternated between “periods of dark isolation and reckless travel”. Sometimes, he spent weeks in his “darkened room, not speaking to anyone, not even his wife or older kids”. At one point in 2023, the family faced eviction after months of not paying rent.In one email sent on 31 January 2024, a case worker said Lakanwal had “not been functional as a person, father and provider since March of last year, 03/2023”.The case worker, who supported many Afghan families and spoke to Lakanwal through an interpreter, described him as a very gracious host, chatty and charismatic to CBS News, adding that a severe turn in his personality was noticeable in 2024.A former Afghan commando told the outlet that Lakanwal was left deeply troubled by the death of a close friend and fellow Afghan commander in 2024, whom the former commando said had unsuccessfully sought asylum in the US.But then, there were also “interim” weeks where Lakanwal would try to make amends and “do the right things”, according to the emails, re-engaging with the Washington state department of social and health services as was mandated by the terms of his entry into the US.“But that has quickly evolved into ‘manic’ episodes for one or two weeks at a time, where he will take off in the family car, and drive nonstop,” the email stated. Once he went to Chicago, and another time to Arizona.DC to put national guard on joint patrols with local police after shootingsRead moreIn response to the two emails, the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) visited Bellingham a few weeks later in March 2024 and attempted to make contact with Lakanwal and his family, the AP reported.Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney in the District of Columbia, said last week that Lakanwal drove across the country from Bellingham, about 80 miles north of Seattle, to the country’s capital.“Rahmanullah was a man who was extremely proud and capable in the world he came from, who felt defeated in the world he came to,” the case worker told CBS News.Homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem, told NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday that Lakanwal was “radicalized since he’s been here in this country”.“We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we’re going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him,” she said, providing no further details.Explore more on these topicsWashington DCUS crimeGun crimeMental healthWest VirginiaUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

The quilombola community of Menino Jesus has existed for six generations.Quilombolasare the descendants of former enslaved people who fled into the forest as a site of refuge. Over hundreds of years, they established a unique way of life separate from mainstream Brazilian society, living in harmony with nature as fugitives protected by the jungle.Now they are engaged in a struggle for survival, against powerful interests who want to turn the land they are inhabiting into a vast dump for the rubbish generated by Belém and a dozen other municipalities. Just half a kilometre from the borders of their settlement, at the intersection of dozens of quilombola communities, a private company wants to create a landfill site that the communities say will devastate 200 hectares (495 acres) of land.“This is the most terrible crime that we can have here,” said Edson Coelho, a community elder. “We work with agriculture, we preserve the environment.“And if this landfill is there, we will no longer be able to live here or sell any type of product, because who’s going to buy a product that’s contaminated?”View image in fullscreenA boy plays in the back yard of his home in Menino Jesus.Photograph: Fernando Llano/APOn a trek through the forest surrounding Menino Jesus, Coelho pointed out the resources quilombolas have learned to sustain themselves with – from leaves used to wrap meat in place of clingfilm to plants used to treat illnesses and the best fruits for food.Research shows that Menino Jesus, its neighbouring Itacoã-Miri territory and other Afro-descendant community lands have exceptional biodiversity, with 29% to 55% lower deforestation rates compared with both protected and unprotected areas.However, political recognition has moved much more slowly than scientific recognition. While their position on the margins of Brazilian society was necessary for their protection – the country only abolished chattel slavery in 1888 – it also left quilombolas struggling for recognition and to be heard.Today, Brazil is home to more than 1.3 million quilombola people, about 0.65% of the national population, spread among almost 2,500 communities in the Amazon. But only 4.3% of them have rights over the land on which they live.View image in fullscreenSite of the proposed landfill near Menino Jesus. The quilombolas who live there call it ‘the most terrible crime we can have here’.Photograph: Fernando Llano/APAndland rights are crucialfor their protection, with a previous effort to create a landfill site around Menino Jesus defeated after they were able to prove ownership of the area. The environmental department of the Pará state government told the Guardian it had turned down a licence for the new solid waste treatment plant because it did not comply with legal and technical requirements. But this was challenged in a local court, which ordered the licensing process to continue. A final decision on whether to go ahead has not yet been made.In spite of that, people have already started to dump rubbish at the site of the proposed landfill. In order to access the site, you have to walk past a pile of refuse, festering in the tropical heat.There, Fabio Nogueira, another member of the Menino Jesus community, described the huge environmental summit taking place just a few miles away as “contradictory”.“What the world is talking about and deciding is not considering our voices,” he said. “We are the true guardians, the true defenders of the forest, and we have no opportunity to expose what is afflicting us.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

There, quilombolas practise agroforestry ofaçai, the Amazonian berry that is famous in the global north as a “superfood” but is a local staple.As the afternoon rains fell, Erica Monteiro, a young community leader, said such recognition failed to account for the unique character of quilombola communities, adding that they wanted specific recognition.“[They] need to listen to the populations that live in the forest, because the forest is not just fauna and flora,” she said. “It has people who resist in those territories, and that is what keeps the forest standing and the forest alive. We must keep it alive to maintain our own life, because without the forest, neither we nor the rest of the world will survive.“The problem is that the government talks a lot and listens little.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilLand rightsCop30Indigenous peoplesLandfillAmazon rainforestAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, since ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out by the 1987 Montreal protocol and a series of amendments that followed, it has begun to recover.Astudyin Nature Climate Change last year found the actions had successfully curbed emissions, and led to the heating effects of the gases peaking five years earlier than expected. The World Meteorological Organization estimates that the ban will enable a recovery of the ozone layer over the Antarctic, where it is thinnest, to 1980 levels by 2066.Ozone hole chartScientists are still working to understand why the ozone holes were so big and persistent between 2020 and 2023. They suspect that the eruption of the Hunga Tonga volcano in 2022, which spewed ash and water vapour into the stratosphere,played a significant rolein the large 2023 ozone hole.Cams said large holes in recent years showed the decline in global stratospheric ozone could have reached “catastrophic levels” without successful agreements to phase out pollutants.“This progress should be celebrated as a timely reminder of what can be achieved when the international community works together to address global environmental challenges,” said Rouil.A lack of ozone in the stratosphere allows more UV radiation to reach the surface of the Earth, damaging crops, increasing cases of skin cancer and cataracts, and causing other harms to human health.Last week, Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US ranked the 2025 ozone hole as the fifth smallest since 1992.Paul Newman, the leader of the ozone research team at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said the change in the size of holes was following predictions.“They’re forming later in the season and breaking up earlier,” he said. “But we still have a long way to go before it recovers to 1980s levels.”Explore more on these topicsOzone layerGreenhouse gas emissionsAntarcticaEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

The EU’s standards are stricter, with a new directive passed last year asking member states to meet 10ug/m3by 2030.The World Health Organization recommends an annual limit of 5ug/m3. It is understood the EIP will bring the UK’s standards in line with the EU, with an aim to eventually meet WHO targets.Exposure to PM2.5s, which bury deep into the lungs, is linked to numerous health conditions including asthma, lung disease, heart disease, cancer and strokes. Domestic combustion accounted for20% of PM2.5 emissions in 2023and has been found toproduce more pollution than traffic.Elsewhere in the EIP, Reynolds will set out that £500m of existing departmental money is to be allocated to landscape recovery projects, larger-scale attempts to restore landscapes and ecosystems, often working with farmers and other landowners.This will include a specific target to restore or create 250,000 hectares (618,000 acres) of wildlife-rich habitats by 2030.The EIP is required under the Environment Act, with the intention that it should put into action a more general commitment to improve the environment within a generation.For the first time, as part of the new EIP, the government will publish detailed Environment Act target delivery plans, which set out how actions will contribute to its aims and help to measure progress.Such moves, Reynolds argued, should mitigate fears about nature depletion owing to housebuilding and other projects, after fears were raised the government’s planning and infrastructure bill could reduce protections andsee green spaces lost.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We can be both pro-development and pro-home-ownership and pro-nature,” she said.“The last EIP, under the previous Tory administration, wasn’t credible. I’m confident that our EIP is credible, because it’s got these delivery plans built in. You can’t just set the targets. You’ve got to explain how you’re going to achieve those targets. And that’s exactly what we’ve done.”Water shortages could derail UK’s net zero plans, study findsRead moreThe new EIP is also expected to include a commitment from the previous plan for every household to be within a 15-minute walk of green space or a waterway.Other measures to be announced on Monday include a new plan for “forever chemicals”, to reduce the amount of PFAS in the environment, and a crackdown on illegal waste dumping.Ruth Chambers, from the Green Alliance thinktank, said the new EIP was “an important milestone and an opportunity to harness the government’s collective clout to deliver better for nature”.She said: “It must now be converted swiftly into the sustained action needed to restore nature, clean up our rivers and air, create a circular economy and help people reconnect with the natural world.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentHousingConservationAir pollutionPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

He called on the leading international banks Standard Chartered, Crédit Agricole and Société Generale to withdraw their support for the project, saying they “can no longer turn a blind eye to the problems and must immediately withdraw their support”.Asad Rehman, the chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said: “This Mozambique gas project is a huge carbon timebomb, linked to serious human rights abuses. It should never have been given UK taxpayer-funded support in the first place. We now urge other countries to follow suit and end their backing for this destructive project.“The UK should instead support countries like Mozambique, which are on the frontline of the climate crisis, by helping them adapt to its impacts and invest in their abundant clean energy resources to bring affordable energy to the 60% of the country locked into energy poverty,” Rehman said.TotalEnergies has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryTrade policyPeter KyleGasCommoditiesMozambiqueGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The decision avoided a direct and possibly brutal contest between Corbyn and Sultana to be sole leader, the other option available.The pairhave fallen outover a series of issues in the party’s brief history, including Sultana unilaterally announcing its formation and launching a membership drive, and a complex battle over transferring money from members to the party.The conference in Liverpool saw signs of continued disagreements, with Sultana, the former Labour MP who now sits as an independent,boycotting the first dayin protest over some of her supporters being expelled for being members of other political parties.“We’re long past happy families,” one party insider said, when asked if the collective model of leadership could mean better relations between Sultana and Corbyn, the former Labour leader who is also now an independent MP.“Effectively what it means is that the battle continues, but via their representatives. We have avoided, by a members’ vote, the one-to-one leadership contest, but it’s still basically a battle for the soul of the party.”View image in fullscreenYour Party members voted on the leadership structure at the party’s conference in Liverpool, where Corbyn and Sultana, below, each addressed the audience.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAAnother source argued, however, that the avoidance of a direct leadership battle was the “de-escalatory option” and good news for the party. “Going straight into a leadership contest between Zarah and Jeremy would definitely be sub-optimal right now,” they said.Under the model agreed, 16 ordinary members would form the governing executive alongside fourYour Partymembers who hold office.

It was democratic, it was messy. I don’t think the disagreements have to be terminal, but they have to be finite,” they said.In another policy decision, Your Party members have opted to adopt a “targeted” strategy of only standing in seats where it has a good chance of winning, a step towards a possible electoral alliance with the Greens.While no such pact is in place at present, and is complicated by the fact that any deals have to be agreed locally with the Greens, it brings the possibility of deals to avoid splitting the vote to the left of Labour at next year’s local elections.For example, Hackney in east London is traditionally a Labour stronghold, but the Green councillor Zoë Garbett is hoping to build on momentum behind her party and succeed next year on her third attempt at winning the borough’s mayoral election.The Your Party vote results were released after a weekend when members voted to formally adopt the name that had been the placeholder used for its launch earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsYour PartyJeremy CorbynZarah SultanaGreen partynewsShareReuse this content"

Patients stuck on crammed hospital corridors or unable to get an ambulance won’t forget it.”NHS leaders backed the government’s assessment that the “landmark” agreement will prove worthwhile because it will lead to tens of thousands of patients receiving groundbreaking new drugs.But they also warned that the NHS receives too little funding to absorb the costs involved and that budgets for care, services and treatment must not be raided.“It is not yet clear how it will be paid for. There is absolutely no slack in current published NHS spending plans for this major commitment and that is a real worry from trust leaders,” said Daniel Elkeles, the chief executive of hospitals group NHS Providers.Dr Andrew Hill, an expert on the drugs industry at the University of Liverpool, said the deal would see the NHS paying more money for the same amount of treatments. “Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has agreed to give drug companies 25% more for the same drugs we were already buying. NHS funding is limited, so if we have to pay higher drug prices, this means less money for doctors, nurses, ambulances [and] simple procedures which can save lives cheaply, using low-cost generic drugs,” he said.Ministers said the “milestone” deal would also help boost the pharmaceutical industry in the UK, which has recently paused or scrapped several major planned investments in protest at the government’s approach to drug pricing.They also hailed the fact that the £6.6bn a year of UK-made drugs exported to the US will now escape, at least for the next three years, the hugely punitive 100% tariffs Trump had threatened on medicines made outside America. He has pledged to lower the cost of drugs in America, which are the highest in the world, and force countries to pay more for US-made medicines.The deal will also see the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) increase the amount it is happy for the NHS to spend on potentially life-extending drugs, from £20,000 to £30,000 a year for every year of life gained to £25,000 to £35,000 – the first increase in the watchdog’s quality-adjusted life year formula since it was set up in 1999.The change should allow Nice to approve between three and five more drugs a year, on top of the 70 it usually deems good value for money. They are likely to include newly developed treatments for cancer and rare conditions that currently exceed spending thresholds.Whitehall sources disputed the Liberal Democrats’ claim that ministers had rolled over in the face of US pressure.“Unlike when the Lib Dems rolled over to Andrew Lansley [over the NHS reorganisation in 2010-12], we have protected the NHS. This will not be paid for out of budgets for NHS services,” an aide to Streeting said.Sources claimed that the NHS had received hundreds of millions of pounds in the comprehensive spending review earlier this year to cover the costs of the deal in its early years, meaning the service would not have to cut spending elsewhere to pay for innovative medicines.They conceded, however, that the costs will rise in the years ahead and the issue of who pays would need to be settled during the next spending review.“The deal is an important step towards ensuring patients can access innovative medicines needed to improve wider NHS health outcomes,” said Richard Torbett, the chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.Most pharmaceuticals have been exempt from trade tariffs under World Trade Organization rules since 1994, but Trump turned a blind eye to the agreement earlier this year as part of a bid to repatriate drug manufacturing and innovation to the US from countries such asIreland, which he said had stolen the US pharma sector.The deal will also bring changes to a longstanding drugs-purchasing agreement with the NHS, which industry leaders have argued is uncompetitive, discourages investment and needs reform.The deal comes six months after the original tariffdeal struck by Starmer and Trump, which promised“preferential treatment” for UK pharma.Pressure on the UK for NHS procurement reform has intensified in recent months, with drugmakers includingMerckandAstraZenecapausing or cancelling investment in the UK, citing the economic climate and lack of support for the life sciences industry.Last month the US ambassador to the UK, Warren Stephens, said further businesses would axe future investments if “there are not changes made and fast”.At the heart of the new UK-US deal is an agreement to lower a so-called “rebate” under the medicines payment arrangements between drug companies and the NHS.Under the current scheme, drug companies are required to pay the NHS between 23.5% and 35.6% of revenue from sales of branded medicines, if the amount the public health service uses is higher than an agreed rate.This will be reduced to 15% under a new rebate in the existing voluntary scheme for branded medicines pricing and access.This guarantees a continued suppressed price for branded drugs should demand exceed the annual cap.Similar schemes exist in other European countries, but the average rates are far lower, ranging from 9% for Ireland and 7% for Germany.Negotiations have been led by Varun Chandra, the prime minister’s chief business adviser, and Patrick Vallance, the science minister and former head of research and development at GSK.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryTrade policyTrump tariffsNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK operating company had 71 staff last year, according to its latest accounts.The closure will be a blow to advocates of carsharing as amore sustainable form of personal transport, as well as to some car clubs that relied on Zipcar to share private vehicles.James Taylor, Zipcar UK’s general manager, wrote in an email to customers: “We are proposing to cease the UK operations of Zipcar and have today started formal consultation with our UK employees.” Taylor directed customers to the website ofCoMoUK, a national charity for shared transport, to find other car-sharing options.The closure will follow a tricky period for carsharing companies. The Guardian reported in March that Avis Budget had quietly downgraded the valuation of its Zipcar subsidiary, amid declining revenues and rising costs in certain key markets.Zipcar’s UK closure will coincide with the increase inLondon’s congestion charge, and its introduction to electric cars, including those driven by car club members, from January. Zipcar would have had to pay the up-to-£18 daily charge on any cars that entered the zone, except for the small number permanently based inside, and then decide how much to pass on to consumers.The changes to the congestion charges have been estimated to add £1m annually to car club costs, most of that borne by Zipcar. Zipcar was thought to run nearly 3,000 vehicles, including cars and vans – the majority of the 5,300 shared vehicles in the UK.A spokesperson for Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London with oversight of Transport for London, said: “The mayor’s transport strategy is clear on the important role car clubs can play to reduce the need for private car ownership. This is why the mayor recently announced that electric car clubs with a dedicated parking bay in the congestion charge zone will receive a 100% discount on the congestion charge from January.”Richard Dilks, chief executive of CoMoUK, said the closure was a sign of a “failure to have supportive policy” towards car clubs. The UK lags behind other European countries, with only 0.7 shared cars per 10,000 people, compared with 2.2 in Germany and 4.4 in Switzerland, according to car sharing software company Invers.“We’ve been warning for a while about the viability of car clubs in London,” said Dilks. “People rely on these things – that’s how they work. If that’s taken away it’s a significant blow.”The charity counted 328,000 car club users in the UK in March. Dilks said many of them would be forced into private car ownership instead.Zipcar wasfounded in 2000by two entrepreneurs in Cambridge, Massachusetts, before being bought by Avis Budget in 2013 for $491m (£371m). It continues to operate in 25 US states, and in three cities in Canada, according to its website. However, the proposed UK closure would come after Zipcar (UK) reported an £11.7m loss for 2024.The company said it would honour existing bookings, including over the Christmas period. It also said it would contact users with bookings running into the new year, while paying subscribers will receive refunds for the period after 31 December.The concept of car-sharing gained popularity during the coronavirus pandemic as Zipcar, Enterprise Car Club and Share Now offered app-based car rental by the hour, while companies such as Hiyacar, Turo and Getaround opened up the ability to rent neighbours’ cars.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Other cars or vans were stationed in dedicated bays. All are accessed via a mobile app.Car-sharing is generally seen as more sustainable because it avoids the extra CO2emissions needed to produce vehicles for every individual household.An Avis Budget Group spokesperson said: “Today, Zipcar informed UK members that we are proposing to cease Zipcar’s operations in the UK and have begun the required formal consultation with our UK employees.“This proposal is part of a broader transformation across our international business, where we are taking deliberate steps to streamline operations, improve returns, and position the company for long-term sustainability and growth.“As part of this proposal, new bookings in the UK will be suspended beyond 31 December 2025, subject to the outcome of the consultation. Zipcar UK will continue to operate as usual during this period. All other markets remain fully operational and unaffected.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

We expect train operators and Network Rail to look at how to best mitigate the performance impacts.”As the only service to run so quickly, in one hour 59 minutes, it has long been a prized service, running non-stop from Stockport and timed conveniently to arrive in the capital shortly before 9am.It has run since 2008 under Virgin Trains, bar a pause during the Covid pandemic andAvanti’s subsequent troubles, until 2024 when Avanti restored a full timetable.The service has been a money-spinner for train operators and the railway more generally, with revenue now passed on to the Department forTransportunder the Avanti contract.The rail minister, Peter Hendy, and the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, are understood to have leaned on the ORR to think again.Alexander said: “Passengers were rightly baffled by this decision, which is wrong for our economy. I am pleased the regulator has reconsidered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The railways bill, being debated in parliament next week, will ensure problems like these are eliminated.”The fast train was popular with business travellers but important for many passengers.Chloe Chapman, 31, from Crewe, a full-time carer for her youngest child who is disabled, said the ORR’s reversal was “amazing news”, saving what had been “an essential, accessible lifeline. For us, the 7am train has made 9am hospital appointments feasible without the added strain of long car journeys, navigating centralLondontraffic, or enduring extremely long and exhausting days.”An Avanti spokesperson said: “We are delighted that the Office of Rail and Road has given us permission to reinstate the 07.00 Manchester to Euston weekday service in our December timetable. The original decision would have had a detrimental impact on customers who use this train and this development is a welcome boost for those who want to take advantage of a sub two-hour service between two of the UK’s major cities.”Explore more on these topicsRail industryWest coast mainlineRail transportTransportLondonManchesterGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

It included granting Moscow territories in eastern Ukraine it did not yet control, while forcing Kyiv to cap the size of its army and abandon its ambition to join Nato. While the plan has since been changed, Ukraine’s European allies remain concerned about any plan that could enshrine the forced change of borders andfail to punish war crimes.The Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on a diplomatic push to rally support from European allies, on Monday said Russia must not be rewarded for its invasion. “We also need to ensure that Russia itself does not perceive anything it could consider as a reward for this war,” he said a joint press conference with the French president, Emmanuel Macron.The Ukrainian leader held calls with a dozen other leaders, including the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz.Zelenskyy said talks with the French president had lasted several hours and the main focus was on negotiations to end the war and on security guarantees. “Peace must become truly durable. The war must end as soon as possible,” he wrote on X.From Paris the pair also spoke to Witkoff and Rustem Umerov, the head of the Ukrainian delegation during talks with the US.Macron said that only Ukraine could decide on its territories in peace negotiations with Russia and that Europeans must be at the negotiating table to ensure security guarantees for Ukraine.Merz, speaking alongside the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, after his call with Zelenskyy, said there must be “no dictated peace” in Ukraine and that Kyiv and its European allies must be involved in any deal to end the war.“We have a clear course of action: no decision on Ukraine and Europe without Ukrainians and without Europeans,” he said.Kallas, who said the push to end the war in Ukraine could be entering a “pivotal week” warned that allowingRussiato change borders by force would set a dangerous precedent for the whole world.Earlier in the day she had describedweekend talksheld in Florida between the US and Ukraine as “difficult but productive”. Asked whether she trusted the US to find a good solution for Ukraine, she said: “Ukrainians are there alone. If they would be together with the Europeans, they would definitely be much stronger but I trust that Ukrainians stand up for themselves.”Zelenskyiy suggested that Ukrainian and US negotiators had not yet fully hammered out revisions to the proposed US plan. He said on Monday there were “some tough issues that still have to be worked through”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Putin’s spokesperson did not specify whether Kushner, who played an active role in negotiations over the Gaza peace deal, would also attend the meeting with the Russian president.The two trusted Trump envoys participated in the weekend talks between senior Ukrainian and US officials that took place in Florida at a private golf club developed by Witkoff’s company.After the meeting, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, expressed optimism for an end to the war. “There’s more work to be done. This is delicate,” Rubio said. “There are a lot of moving parts, and obviously there’s another party involved here … that will have to be a part of the equation, and that will continue later this week, when Mr Witkoff travels to Moscow.”Ukraine’s president is under pressure after thesudden resignation of his head of cabinet and closest adviser, Andriy Yermak, in response to a widening anti-corruption investigation that has become the most serious scandal of Zelenskyy’s presidency.The Ukrainian leader is meanwhile expected to make his first official visit to Ireland on Tuesday, while his defence minister, Denys Shmyhal, was in Brussels on Monday for talks with his EU counterparts.Shmyhal said he had informed defence ministers about “the most urgent needs of our soldiers” primarily in air defences. He welcomed an announcement from the Netherlands that it would contribute another €250m to the Nato initiative to buy weapons and ammunition for Ukraine from the United States.The flurry of diplomatic activity came as a studyshowed that Russia made its biggest advances in Ukraine for a yearin November.

I was repeatedly kicked in the head, ribs, hips and thighs. They shouted insults at us in Arabic and told us we had no right to be there. They smashed the interior of the house and destroyed the solar batteries before leaving.”The woman, who did not want her name published for safety reasons, added: “This is not about us. We were beaten for 15 minutes. Palestinians here endure this violence every day, every hour, a thousand-fold.”The pace and intensity of attacks in Ein al-Duyuk have increased substantially over the past two months since the establishment of a settler outpost nearby and the arrival of young and aggressive settlers.Activists say that violent incidents have become an almost daily occurrence. Attacks have included settler mobs breaking into homes and beating villagers, stealing 200 sheep, two cars and destroying solar panels.While all settlements on occupied territory are illegal under international law, irregular outposts are illegal under Israeli law. Ein al-Duyuk is in Area A of theWest Bank, which means it is meant to be administered by the Palestinian Authority and illegal for Israelis to enter.‘They have total impunity’: West Bank settler violence surges after Gaza ceasefireRead moreThe Canadian foreign ministry said it “strongly condemns the violent acts committed by extremist settlers and opposes any actions or talk about annexation of the Palestinian territories”.The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told reporters: “We have had enough of this aggression. This is not the way [for the settlers] to assert their rights.”The Israeli authorities in the West Bank have been approached for comment. Villagers and activists say there has been no meaningful police intervention to stop the attacks or dismantle the outpost. Leading members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition actively support West Bank settlers.According to UN figures, Israeli settlers and security forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians, including 233 children, in the West Bank over the past two years, in what many Israeli and Palestinian observers believe is a concerted campaign of violence aimed at seizing territory.Manal Tamimi, a Palestinian activistin the organisation Faz3a, which recruits foreign volunteers to help protect Palestinian villages in the West Bank, said: “In the two months since they built a new outpost near the village, they have brought in far-right wing settlers, who are very violent and seem to belong to an organised group, because they attacked the volunteers in a really organised way.“The people there are very resilient and they refuse to leave the area. That’s why it’s very important to put international volunteers with them.”The Canadian volunteer said that, despite the attack and her injury, she felt the presence of volunteers in Ein al-Duyuk had been valuable.“The villagers stood taller while we were present,” she said. “The children played freely. People slept through the night. That alone made our presence worthwhile.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I’m going to fight the gangs!” said Réné Charles, who survived the attack. “We’ve got to stand up and fight!”The crowd tried to break into the mayor’s office with one unidentified man telling the Associated Press that they weren’t going to rely on the government any longer: “We’re going to take justice into our own hands!”Charlesma Jean Marcos, a political activist, said the gang announced last week that they were going to invade the area, and that they alerted authorities to no avail.“For now, the only people really fighting (the gang) is the self-defense group,” he said. “A country cannot run like this.”Marcos urged all the survivors sleeping on the street and in public parks to instead sleep inside police stations and government offices until the government can take back Artibonite.“A lot of people are going to be hungry,” he warned. “We can support you today, we can support you tomorrow, but we won’t be able to support you forever.”More than half of Haiti’s population is already experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse, with gangs blocking main roads and the ongoing violence displacing a record 1.4 million people.The attacks in central Haiti began late Friday and late Saturday, with gang members broadcasting them live on social media.The attacks were blamed on the Gran Grif gang, which operates in the area and was responsible foran attack on Pont-Sondé in October 2024 that killed at least 100 people, one of the biggest massacres in Haiti’s recent history.“I heard heavy shooting, so much shooting,” said one man who said he was stuck inside his house all weekend. “Why don’t they send any drones to Artibonite? They just use the drones in Port-au-Prince. I feel this gang is special. They don’t want to destroy this gang.”A spokesperson for Haiti’s national police did not immediately return a message seeking comment.Gran Grif is considered one of Haiti’s cruelest gangs. Its leader, Luckson Elan, recently was sanctioned by the UN security council and the US government. Also sanctioned was Prophane Victor, a former legislator that the UN accused of arming young men in the Artibonite region.‘The ground shook’: drone attacks help Haitian government wrest control of capital from criminal gangsRead moreThe UN has said killings have risen dramatically in Haiti’s Artibonite and Centre departments this year, with 1,303 victims reported from January to August, compared with 419 during the same period in 2024.“These assaults underscore the capacity of gangs to consolidate control across a corridor from the Centre to the Artibonite amid limited law enforcement presence and logistical constraints,” a recent UN report stated.Explore more on these topicsHaitiAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s just not right.”Andrea Biancini, the mayor of Pesaro, appeared to aggravate the issue by sharing an image of the statue in the ice rink alongside a hashtag encouraging skaters to “give Pavarotti a high five”.He later apologised, admitting that the local council had “made a mistake”.“There was no intention of disrespect,” he told Il Resto del Carlino. “I was assured that Pavarotti wouldn’t be touched or incorporated into the ice rink floor.”But with the festive feature due to open in the city’s Piazzale Lazzarini this weekend, he said it was not possible for it to be dismantled, and that trying to move the statue would be costly and could cause damage.Describing the scene, Il Resto del Carlino said the tribute to Pavarotti, who died in 2007, aged 71, has “ended up stuck between the guardrails and Christmas lights, like a stage character who fell into the wrong place and now finds himself directing the traffic of skaters”.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeOperaShareReuse this content"

India’s telecoms ministry also did not respond.A 14- to 17-digit number unique to each handset, the IMEI, or International Mobile Equipment Identity, is most commonly used to cut off network access for phones reported to have been stolen.The Sanchar Saathi app is mainly designed to help users block and track lost or stolen smartphones across all telecom networks, using a central registry. It also lets them identify, and disconnect, fraudulent mobile connections.With more than 5m downloads since its launch, the app has helped block more than 3.7m stolen or lost mobile phones, while more than 30m fraudulent connections have also been terminated.The government says the software helps prevent cyberthreats and assists tracking and blocking of lost or stolen phones, helping police to trace devices, while keeping counterfeits out of the black market.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

UBS said: “We firmly reject the office of the attorney general’s conclusions and will vigorously defend our position.”The tuna bonds scandal arose from $2bn (£1.5bn) worth of loans that Credit Suisse arranged for the Republic of Mozambique between 2013 and 2016. The loans were said to be going to government-sponsored investment schemes including maritime security projects and a state tuna fishery, located in the south-east African country’s capital, Maputo.However, a portion of the funds went unaccounted for, with one of Mozambique’s contractors later found to have secretly arranged “significant kickbacks” worth at least $137m, including $50m for bankers at Credit Suisse, meant to secure more favourable deals on the loans,according to the Financial Conduct Authority.The scam snowballed and eventually caused the International Monetary Fund to suspend its assistance to Mozambique, leading to a crash in the country’s economy.Credit Suisse had alreadysettled the case with US and UK regulators in 2021, having paid $275m to American watchdogs and £147m to Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority.UBS also subsequently agreed to settle the case with Mozambique in October 2023, shortly before a trial was due to kick off in London courts. Mozambique had been pursuing $1.5bn in damages over economic losses after the IMF and international donors pulled their financial support.The Swiss attorney general’s office accused Credit Suisse and its owner of “not taking all the required and reasonable organisational measures in the relevant period in 2016 to prevent the money laundering that was allegedly committed”.Credit Suisse was sold to UBS in an emergency deal in March 2023, when customers started to pull money from the lender amid a mini-banking crisis that primarily affected US lenders but later spread to Zurich.Credit Suisse had for years been mired in scandals, but panic over its future grew after its largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, ruled out any extra funding for the Swiss lender despite the growing turmoil.The crisis of confidence eventually forced Swiss authorities tooffer emergency loansto Credit Suisse, before eventually orchestrating a shotgun takeover by Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, which bought the lender for a cut price of 3bn Swiss francs. It left UBS handling a raft of legacy scandals from its former rival.Explore more on these topicsCredit SuisseUBSBankingEuropean banksEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday itsaidthe “vast majority” of those fixes were complete.“Airbus apologises for any challenges and delays caused to passengers and airlines by this event,” the company said.There are now fewer than 100 aircraft that still need the software update before they can return to service, Airbus said in a statement. Up to 15% of the planes may still require a hardware upgrade, analysts at Deutsche Bank have estimated.However, shares in Airbus fell by as much as 6% later on Monday after Reuters reported the company had identified a separate quality problem affecting a “limited number” of A320 metal panels.A spokesperson for Airbus said: “Airbus is taking a conservative approach and is inspecting all aircraft potentially impacted, knowing that only a portion of them will need further action to be taken.“The source of the issue has been identified, contained and all newly produced panels conform to all requirements.”For most of the A320 aircraft affected by the software problem, the fix is relatively simple, requiring the installation of an older version of the software.

It is heartening this issue has been identified and will be addressed so swiftly, demonstrating the high aviation safety standards globally.”The London-listed airlines easyJet and Wizz Air told investors on Monday morning that they had completed the software updates over the weekend without cancelling any flights.However, the fix could be more complex for older planes. Aarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at the investment broker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “For some older aircraft, about 900 planes, the fix will require a hardware change before they can fly again, which could take several weeks due to limited supplies.”The American low-cost airline JetBlue said late on Sunday that it expected to be able to return 137 out of the 150 affected aircraft back to service by Monday and that it planned to cancel about 20 flights, according to Reuters.Shares in Airbus, which are listed in Paris, have fallen by about 4% over the past five days, although they are still up by about 20% so far this year.

The rebrand was widely mocked.“From the people that brought you Accenture Song now come the ‘reinventors’, staff are going to cringe,” said Damon Collins, the co-founder of the marketing agency Joint. “If they think this move is going to win favour with many employees, or clients, they have another thing coming. It is a very unusual bit of corporate panic, they really have the wrong end of the Nvidia chip.”The new tag for the consultants is the latest in a long list of unusual jargon that big businesses have foisted on their staff; some tech workers are referred to as “ninjas”, “growth hackers” and “evangelists”.Curious job titles are also popular in the media and entertainment industries, including at Walt Disney, where technical experts who design and build its theme parks are referred to as “imagineers”.The WPP founder, Martin Sorrell,took on the moniker of “senior monk”when he engineered the takeover of the digital creative company MediaMonks, where staff are called “monks”.Apple’s expert in-store tech helpers are called “geniuses”, while the London-based ad agency Mother, which has clients including KFC, has the title “mother” for executives that oversee the running of projects between clients and staff.The “reinventor” push from Accenture comes as it moves to sharpen its focus on its AI capabilities. Sweet told investors in September that the consultancy would “exit” employees who were not getting the hang of using AI at work.TheNew-York based groupsaid it was training staff in generative AI fundamentals, but employees for whom “reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need” would be shown the door. As part of a restructure, it laid off 11,000 staff to leave a workforce of 791,000 staff.The consultancy has also reportedly built a version of its internal human resources website where the staff are called “reinventors” rather than “workers”, according to the Financial Times.Embarking on a rebrand in an effort to radically alter the perception of a traditional company can be fraught with risks.Jaguar discovered this when it announced its move into the electric car market with apolarising Miami Pink concept model last year, a marketing strategydreamed up by none other than Accenture Song.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And Disney’s imagineers do have the call to action to ‘make you dream’.“To be a real reinventor is really a name for just a few people. Maybe this is a cool thing when interviewing in the fight to find new talent. But then I see a pushback internally from employees maybe overpromised what it means to be one. The reality is everyone has different roles and very few will be true reinventors.”Accenture, which was spun out of Arthur Andersen, the now-defunct accountant, in 1989 and later rebranded, works with thousands of companies around the world, offering IT and business strategy consulting and outsourcing.The company benefited from huge demand for tech consulting in the aftermath of the pandemic but its shares, which are listed in New York, have suffered this year after Donald Trump ordered US government agencies to review their spending with large consultancies.The consultancy reported a 7% annual rise in revenue to $69.7bn (£52.7bn) for its financial year ended in August, but warned investors that US federal spending cuts will probably slow its growth next year. It has lost more than a quarter of its market value so far this year, which stands at $155bn.Accenture was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBusinessTechnology sectorArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

They said, “No problem, just give us one of your songs”’Interviews by Joe MateraMon 1 Dec 2025 09.45 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 11.07 ESTShareHuey Lewis, songwriter, vocalsSteven Spielberg and Bob Zemeckis asked to meet us, along with Bob Gale and Neil Canton. They said they’d just written this film whose lead character was a guy called Marty McFly, and whose favourite band would be Huey Lewis and the News. They asked: “How about writing a song for the film?” I said: “I’m flattered but I don’t know how to write for film necessarily. And frankly, I don’t fancy writing a song called Back to the Future.” They said: “No problem. We just want one of your songs.” I said: “Tell you what, we’ll send you the next one we work on.”Chris Hayes, our guitarist and songwriter, had already written a chord progression, which he’d recorded on to a tape, and he gave it to me. I was going through a jogging phase and was out running one day when the song’s lyric just came to me. We sent them the demo but when Zemeckis heard it, he said it wasn’t upbeat enough. So I went back to the guys and we worked on it.Get the film out there – the song is killing it!Johnny Colla, our saxophonist, got involved with the arrangement. On the original demo, the bridge chords happened twice and the song started on a verse in a minor key. Johnny had the idea of minimising it to just one bridge, and also came up with that big positive, three-chord major-key intro. I did my lead vocal in a couple of takes.View image in fullscreenNo 1 beckons … Huey Lewis and Michael J Fox in Back to the Future.Photograph: Album/AlamyWhen we released The Power of Love, it was the most added track on radio in its first week and on heavy rotation. The interesting thing is that the film holds the record for the shortest amount of time between the end of principal photography and the release of the film: nine weeks. As The Power of Love raced up the charts, the studio kept yelling at Zemeckis: “Get the film out there; the song is killing it!” And so the release date was brought forward.People forget that at the time we actually had a higher profile than Michael J Fox and Bob Zemeckis because we had hit records. The advantage to us was that this was our first really big international hit because the movie was so successful everywhere. It enabled us to tour Europe and other places.Chris Hayes, songwriter, guitaristLike all my writing, The Power of Love was done pretty casually. I had a real basic recording setup at my house, and I just sat down on the couch in my pyjamas one night, noodled around on the guitar, and came up with the chord progression. It was based around a really simple guitar riff and something that was as poppy and accessible as I could make it.It was just all about using the right guitar parts and getting something kind of catchy. In the bridge section, it’s kind of gospel-inspired. I threw in a couple of chords that were a little bit different to the usual ones you’d put in a song like that. That was me going back to my music theory classes and jazz/gospel roots. When it came to the guitar solo, it was kind of inspired by Stevie Ray Vaughan.When I wrote it, I had no idea what was going to happen or how popular it was going to be. It ended up being an integral part of the whole Back to the Future franchise, the biggest song in our career, and gave us our first No 1, which was exciting. What’s weird about it, though, is that the song really has nothing to do with the film whatsoever. We were given a synopsis of the screenplay of the movie, and I read through the whole thing and I remember thinking to myself: “This doesn’t sound plausible or like it’s going to be good.” And boy was I wrong!Explore more on these topicsPop and rockHow we madefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the interim it slowly dawned on me that not all jobs were like that. He was one of the most intelligent people you could ever meet but the extraordinary thing was that you’d walk away from conversations with him feeling like you were not unintelligent or unwitty yourself. That’s not always the case with incredibly brilliant writers and funny people. That generosity of spirit marked my time with him. He was incredibly good company, very sweet, and you felt encouraged to put forward your own ideas, make your own jokes.That feeling, that he had loaned his magnificent intellect to you, was the same in his work. You’d see a play imparting all these competing ideas and you would leave abuzz and pretty confident you could explain it to your friends but you had to make sure that you’d worked out exactly how to do so before you reached Hammersmith because that was when it would start to evaporate. You would feel the benefit of his genius probably about as far as Barons Court.View image in fullscreen‘If something felt even remotely page-bound he was bothered by it’ … Brian Cox and Rufus Sewell in Rock’n’Roll at the Royal Court, London, in 2006.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianI was doing another play when I had the rather frightening audition for Arcadia coming up. The night before my audition there was a knock at my dressing room. I didn’t have my clothes on and said who is it? A very particular voice answered: “It’sTom Stoppard.” I grabbed a towel to put over myself and opened the door. He said it was the second time he’d seen the play, that it was a good production and that he knew I was coming in tomorrow and he wanted me to know “I’m on your side”. The process was still long and arduous – it wasn’t like I was immediately given the part – but it gave me confidence that, in the corner, there was this figure and I had his approval.When we were doing Arcadia he’d be there festooned with scarves and cigarette smoke and in my peripheral vision I’d try to detect any shift signifying approval or disapproval – a leg being crossed or uncrossed, a scarf being rearranged, a puff of smoke. In his writing there was a blokiness that really counteracted the kind of heavy intellectual quality. He knew the difference in language between a “dick” and a “prick”. I was aware in rehearsals of him changing a line because he felt it was too writerly, that it needed something to take the edge off. So, despite this brilliance he was famous for, if something felt even remotely page-bound he was bothered by it.Christine Baranski: ‘How do I measure up to that level of dazzling wit?’View image in fullscreen‘On a higher plane’ … Christine Baranski and Tom Stoppard at the 2020 PEN America literary awards in New York.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty ImagesYou shouldn’t wait until someone’s memorial to tell them how much they meant to you. So I’m happy to say that a few years ago I had Tom and some of the cast from The Real Thing, which we did in New York in 1984, over to my apartment. We toasted him and told him it remained the most special theatre experience of our careers.We were all a bit concerned about Tom’s smoking but I knew he’d want to smoke. I had an ashtray I’d kept from the Brasserie Lipp in Paris years earlier when I was there with my 16-year-old daughter and, at the table right next to us had been Tom and Mick Jagger. I gave it to Tom, opened the bay window for him, and he had a couple of American Spirits. The ashtray with its two butts is still on my bookshelf.The Real Thing was an enormousBroadwayhit – we won Tonys – but I’d go home at night thinking: I’m not smart enough to be in this play. I’m going to have to fake it. For one thing I was an American actor being terribly English but the challenge, like with Stephen Sondheim, was how do I measure up to that level of dazzling wit? The whole experience was elevated. We were swimming in the mind pool of Tom Stoppard – a very privileged place to be. As you do with Shakespeare, you feel like you’re on a higher plane.With his restless imagination, Tom Stoppard showed us a mind on the moveRead moreAnyone will talk rapturously of him. I remember him coming to rehearsals in these soft, buttery suede jackets, with that tousled hair and those voluptuous lips. We all had a crush on Tom. He was very stylish, the closest we’ll ever come to knowing a Wildean character. Later, when I was filming Mamma Mia! for many weeks in England, we were trying to meet but were both very busy. On my last day in London he took me to tea and said: “I’m rather ashamed of myself. You’ve been a guest in my country all this time and I’ve not taken care of you.” Such a gentlemanly thing to say.He could be extraordinarily astute. What struck me most was that he could have directed his rapier wit to cruel effect, but I never saw any kind of mean-spiritedness in him. He enjoyed being Tom Stoppard – and was sort of an invention. It was as Tomáš Sträussler that he had come to England and he loved his English upbringing.One of the first plays I ever did was The Real Inspector Hound in Baltimore. That was such fun. I particularly loved doing Stoppard because of his great ability with language. You could just send a sentence over with a certain degree of top spin and it would delight an audience.Susan Wokoma: ‘He was always a WhatsApp message away’View image in fullscreen‘Everything I imagined him to be’ … Susan Wokoma next to Tom Stoppard with the cast and crew of The Real Thing at the Old Vic last autumnYou cannot be cast in a major Tom Stoppard production without Tom Stoppard’s approval so the fact I got to be in The Real Thing in Tom’s lifetime is something I will cherish for ever. We were told he was seriously ill as we started rehearsals – nevertheless he was always a WhatsApp message away with answers to our many questions that arose from such a tremendous and terrifyingly adored text. We could hear and feel Tom’s yearning – this was the first time such a production was being mounted without him in the rehearsal room. As a company we wanted nothing more than to make Tom proud.Then, the Saturday before press night, our company stage manager, Rebecca, tells us that, despite being warned against travelling, Tom has come to see the show. I’ve known the fearless James McArdle – our resplendent Henry – since we were 18 and 19 years old and I’ve never seen him so terrified.We were instructed to return to the auditorium to meet Tom once the audience had left. There we had an intimate “audience with …” that I will remember for the rest of my life. And most importantly he loved the production, the first major revival for which he had been completely outside the rehearsal process. Generous, thoughtful, funny and kind – he was everything I imagined him to be.“This is the last time I’ll see this play,” he said. The enormity of the words hung in the air. “But I’ll outlive all of you.” How right he was.Toby Jones: ‘The plays are full of cracking gags’View image in fullscreen‘An openness to experiment’ … Toby Jones in Every Good Boy Deserves Favour at the National Theatre in 2009.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianEveryone talks about Tom’s genius but inEvery Good Boy Deserves Favouryou also had this other side to him as it is such a brilliant conceptual piece of stagecraft. The idea of having an orchestra live on stage and making the audience complicit with the actuality of the orchestra and thereby with a person who is supposed to be hallucinating. You might not associate that visual stagecraft with him although there are the acrobats in Jumpers and the River Styx in The Invention of Love. His openness to the experiment of the National production, which brought dancers among the orchestra in a deviation from the original play, was really striking.My father shared a house with Tom when he was writing scripts for Mrs Dale’s Diary and he had strong memories of the cigarette smoke as Tom pounded out episodes. He was a big figure in my life from those stories and then at school I remember studying Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead for A-level. Like Pinter, he was one of the giants of theatre that our generation grew up with. So when I finally met him it was a thrill to find him so personable.When Tom and I went on a coach trip together to the Calais Jungle it gave me a prolonged time to hear him talking about the precariousness of these refugees and his personal connection with that situation. We crisscrossed a bit after Every Good Boy and he always had this wonderful warmth – the opposite of someone being too brainy to chat with you. The plays are full of cracking gags and there’s an appreciation of the different registers of drama, that on the one hand it’s a collision of ideas but also the theatre is a place of the gut and of guffawing.Harriet Walter: ‘No one gives the skivvy a book token but Tom did’View image in fullscreenCausing chaos … Harriet Walter in Arcadia at the National Theatre in 1993.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyEveryone on this page has been unbelievably lucky. We all knew Tom Stoppard. We lived at the same time as him and basked in his brilliance up close. When I was 18 and not yet even a drama student I was a skivvy in charge of the props for the world premiere of Tom’s After Magritte. He was a very romantic, fleeting visitor to the rehearsal room. I treasured a £5 book token he gave me for the opening performance. No one gives the skivvy a book token! Tom did.Cut to much later and I am playing Lady Croom, the flighty over-sexed mother of Thomasina in the first production of Arcadia. We all learned a bit about chaos theory among many other subjects that Tom had brilliantly tied together in the play. Luckily, Lady Croom didn’t have to understand chaos theory, only to cause chaos with her rampant sexual appetite, that rogue ingredient that can’t be controlled, explained or predicted. I had lines that were so funny I often couldn’t get to the end of them before the audience drowned me out with laughter. What ecstasy. What a gift from Tom.Every other line in Arcadia dazzles, but Tom didn’t intend to show off. He was genuinely delighted by asking questions and sharing everything he discovered. And he managed to infiltrate some of the most profound messages about life, art and the physical universe into the comic weave. In Arcadia he puts an end to the art v science division. He brings them together, illustrating the imaginative beauty of science and the calculated order within art.Thomasina Coverly, the 13-year-old genius in the 19th-century part of the play, can grasp mathematical concepts that fly over most of our heads. She can spot the physical principle at work in the stirring of jam into her rice pudding. Hers is the first line in the play and it is a question. She is endlessly curious and deep-thinking while still being childish and playful.She is cerebral but also passionate – she is moved to tears by the destruction of the great library of Alexandria, and when the play moves forward three years she matures into a romantic young woman in love with her tutor, and although she dies in a fire on her 16th birthday, her calculations live on for future generations to interpret with wonder. I believe all this to be true of her near namesake Tomáš Stoppard.Explore more on these topicsTom StoppardTheatreBroadwayHarriet WalterToby JonesRufus SewellfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’re advising all of our clients to put everything they’ve got into canned food and shotguns.” Some sage advice from the Brain Gremlin – a genetically modified, talking, glasses-wearing member of the slimy Gremlin horde that overruns Manhattan’s super-smart Clamp Tower skyscraper in director Joe Dante’s madcap sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch. At face value, it’s nothing more than an investment tip from one monster to another. However, in a weird way, it’s also pretty solid life advice. Seriously, hear me out.‘A Thanksgiving classic’: why Stuck in Love is my feelgood movieRead moreWhen things go bad, the worst thing you can do is take things too seriously. The Brain Gremlin knows this. In fact, most of the toothy monsters that populate Dante’s wild 1990 film (arguably his best) have the same sly, self-aware sense of humour when it comes to the blurry line separating everyday life and unadulterated chaos. It’s one element of Gremlins 2: The New Batch that keeps me coming back – and the older I get, it’s the theme that resonates the most.Of course, my attachment to this movie didn’t start on such an introspective level. Growing up, we only had a few battered VHS tapes at home. Among them were Gremlins and its sequel, the latter in a chunky ex-rental box probably bought from an off-brand video shop and boasting snarling creatures on its knackered cover. I was immediately enamoured and these films wasted no time embedding themselves inside my tiny, impressionable mind. From then on, they became an almost-daily part of my childhood viewing routine.Dante’s original typically gets all the praise, thanks largely to its legacy as a semi-scary seasonal fave - and don’t get me wrong, I’ve watched Gremlins more times than I can count. However, its follow-up rarely gets the same level of lofty appreciation, which feels criminal. As a kid, I’d never miss an opportunity to watch Gremlins 2. During sunny school summer breaks, I’d lock myself inside and stick it on. When I got my own TV-VHS combo (remember those?) it remained on repeat in my bedroom. Over time, it ingrained in my psyche. If my parents noticed this obsession, they didn’t seem to mind.As I grew, new insights rewarded repeat viewings, elevating the fun of watching little green monsters gleefully trash a New York high-rise. I learned the future-focused property magnate and Clamp Tower owner, Daniel Clamp (John Glover), was inspired directly by future president Donald Trump, with his red-headed employee Marla (Haviland Morris) referencing his second wife Marla Maples. Thankfully, Clamp has more heart than his real-life counterpart.The “end of civilisation” video Clamp plays during peak-Gremlin chaos? I discovered it was based on a real-life “Doomsday” video created by the CNN boss Ted Turner in case the world really ended. I noticed how Dante went out of his way to film varying versions of a self-referential segment where Gremlins take over the very film you’re watching. One for cinemas, one for VHS and TV, each delivering a smirking slice of meta pop-culture magic before the term was even a thing.While it was effects expert Rick Baker’s gloriously nasty-looking creatures that caught my eye as a child, this deeper gold kept me hooked as an adult. Eventually, I evenspoke to Dante about it myselfand he had no qualms telling me he made the movie with the direct intention of mocking those who loved its silly-yet-sincere predecessor and wanted more. “We were going to make fun of the fact you came to see it,” he happily revealed. This Looney Tunes-esque defiance and determination tonottake his sequel as seriously as his Warner Bros bosses clearly wanted him to, only made me love it even more.When I experienced a sudden family bereavement earlier this year, I was surprised to find that, during my deepest grief, all I wanted to do was sit and watch Gremlins 2: The New Batch. Weird, right? Maybe not. The nostalgic calm it provided was needed to dilute my mind’s sadness sludge - but the stuff it had given me as an adult was just as useful.Like Gremlins rampaging through a genetics laboratory, there’s some things in life you just can’t control. Dante knows it. The Brain Gremlin knows it too. Sometimes, you have to be like them: embrace the chaos, put everything you’ve got into canned food and shotguns and try not to take things too seriously. It’s strong life advice from a very unlikely source – and it’s why Gremlins 2: The New Batch will always be my feelgood film.Gremlins 2: The New Batch is available to rent digitally in the US, UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieComedy filmsComedyAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s struggling to perform, as if his private life is letting slip some fundamental doubt about his role inAfrica.There’s a good dose of self-flagellation about western paternalism and hypocrisy in Pedro Pinho’s fifth feature, but it’s smart enough to know that this hand-wringing, extended over three hours, is yet another form of white man’s privilege. First seen driving through a sand blizzard like one of Antonioni’s existential wanderers, Sérgio seems to want to avoid thinking about the power dynamics at play around him. Being “here now”, in the moment, is his superpower – as he tells Gui (Jonathan Guilherme), the lofty Brazilian drag queen he dallies with. Gui’s gender-fluid posse, who hang out at the bar run by market hustler Diara (Cleo Diára), is a racial and sexual utopia ready to accept anyone, including this white expat. But, as Gui intuits, Sérgio’s bisexuality mirrors something noncommittal, even opportunistic, about him. He both lives in the expat enclave and the streets, without belonging to either.But Sérgio’s nonaligned status makes him the perfect vehicle to eavesdrop on postcolonial relations in all quarters. Opinion is divided on whether the road will be an economic boost or an environmental blight; questions underscored by poverty, corruption and violence, as emphasised by the mysterious disappearance of Sérgio’s predecessor; smooth local businessman Horatio, hymning progress, won’t discuss this. These numerous shades of grey are obscured by Guinea-Bissau’s cacophonous paradise, but Pinho never loses sight of white hypocrisy. Scruples are a luxury, Diara reminds Sérgio when he refuses Horatio’s €150,000 bung.With his long, meandering conversational scenes, Pinho doesn’t possess the kind of visual concision that film-makers such as Claire Denis or Ulrich Seidl bring to similar neocolonialist probings. But there’s something warm and human in how he lets everything hang out in these long, ruminative exchanges, including, by proxy through Sérgio, his own complicity as a white onlooker. The film is continually fumbling after, and negotiating for, its position on economic and racial questions – nowhere more so than in a bracing last sex scene where Sérgio finds himself once more in the middle. For all his uncertainty, Pinho knows the personal is always political.I Only Rest in the Storm is at the ICA, London, from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsGuinea-BissauPortugalSexAfricaEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Star Razaaq Adoti can’t blame his agent, as it was the actor himself who scripted this Nigeria-set revenge thriller, in which his former special forces soldier makes a Jack Carter-like return to wreak havoc on the mean streets of Lagos.Zion (Adoti) has made the US his home after being dishonourably discharged and doing a stretch in the slammer. But he makes a beeline for Lagos when he receives an SOS message from his sister Ronke (Sharon Rotimi), a hotel chambermaid who stumbles on respectable medical professional cum evil drug kingpin Dr Baptiste (Philip Asaya) as he murders a sex worker. Zion is too late: Ronke is a goner, framed as another victim of the fentanyl cocktail Matrix that’s doing the rounds, courtesy of the bad doctor. Time for Zion to dust off his particular set of skills.These turn out in large part to be him walking obliviously into ill-advised locales and getting an absolute beating. But despite Zion’s boneheaded brand of heroism, a lot of plot-facilitating character choices and outbreaks of ripe Nollywood acting, British-Chinese director Chee Keong Cheung delivers a pretty satisfying and fleet-footed ride here. All the more so for going fairly skimpy on the characterisation in the manner of 80s action flicks: Zion gets a cute street urchin sidekick (Ijelu Folajimi), just so we know he’s on the side of the angels.Even Zion’s inexplicably haphazard street smarts line up somehow with the shambolic, brutal world he infiltrates: an impressive selection of immolations, bludgeonings and machete-gougings is meted out once he teams up with albino ganglord Jagunlabi (Damilola Ogunsi). Cheung’s direction matches it with gusto, recalling City of God in a colourful handheld blitz – though his fondness forthe Dutch anglegets a bit annoying. He uses it so often they’ll have to rename it the Nigerian angle, but his film has got an undeniable gangsta lean.Son of the Soil is in UK cinemas from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersAction and adventure filmsNigeriaAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Winter works primarily in contrasts: poppy instrumentation with off-kilter song structures; lyrics that are abstract yet never impenetrable; boyish charm wrapped in the confidence expected from a singer-songwriter twice his age.In this intimate show, Winter hunches over his piano, whittling away at songs as if the audience are peering through the window of his private rehearsal space. It would be the more conventional choice for him to tour with a band, especially after the one-two punch of his solo debut album Heavy Metal late last year and his band Geese’s Getting Killed in September. But Winter doesn’t do things simply: every song tonight gets a new arrangement. He tickles and pummels reverb-soaked keys in ways that transform and reconstruct Heavy Metal’s foundations into something more alive than the recording. It is stripped back, but never stark.Artists often perform unrecognisable versions of their songs – much to the dismay of sing-along-ready fans – but Winter’s rearrangements feel completely free of pretension and audience hostility. Rather than feeling pushed out of Winter’s performance, we are invited in. It is a rare thing, in a crammed, sold-out show, to feel as if you’re bearing witness. The Brooklyner’s sense of melody and pitch is deft. Live, his songs find new melodic landscapes and enter soulful, even jazzy, new territories. While his idiosyncratic, bleating drawl has aggravated some listeners, Winter’s live vibrato is undeniably effortless whether he belts or whispers.The crowd chuckles in moments when the playful song dynamics demand audience silence and space to breathe, when long sustained notes fade into the contours of the Albert Hall’s ceiling. It becomes so quiet at times that you can hear feet shuffle, yet not a whisper of chatter. There is an impulse to compare Winter with icons of decades gone: Dylan, Cohen, Reed. But comparison robs Winter of his engrossing artistry. Thanks to his unfaltering earnestness on stage, by the time he bellows out “God is real! I’m not kidding this time!”, you can only agree.AtLondon Roundhouse, 1 December, then touring Europe.Explore more on these topicsMusicIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

By this measure, Lugma is my top food book this year. Its author, Noor Murad, is a young Bahraini-British food writer who has previously worked with Ottolenghi. It is a delight to find her writing here in her own voice about the Middle Eastern ingredients that mean so much to her (you’ll need black limes!). The recipes hit a sweet spot between ease and specialness. Even a simple side dish of greens becomes a feast, sauteed with fried onions and turmeric oil. Alongside a pantheon of rice dishes for celebrations, there are simpler midweek hits such as tuna jacket potatoes enlivened with a spicy tomato sauce and preserved lemons. Noor’s deeply fragrant Middle Eastern bolognese is now the recipe against which I judge all other ragus.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Alongside her career as a baker, Goh (who was born in Malaysia to Chinese parents) was for a long time a practising psychologist. Whatever the theory behind the effect, every time I follow Goh’s wonderfully precise yet creative recipes, I feel a deep calm and happiness as well as a sense that she is teaching me new skills (“learning, growth and achievement” are among the psychological benefits of baking, according to Goh). The Shoo Fly buns are the currant buns of dreams (with a whole raw orange pureed into the dough) and I wanted to make the chocolate financiers with rosemary and hazelnuts so much that I bought a financier tin specially (no regrets there).Indian Kitchens: Treasured Family Recipes from Across the LandRoopa Gulati (Bloomsbury)This remarkable and highly original book takes us on a tour of home kitchens in six regions of India, from a vegetarian Jain kitchen in Gujarat to the domain of a cook in Delhi who prepares meat “in garlicky masala” in a pressure cooker. Roopa Gulati conjures up a world in which people think nothing of rolling their own flatbreads and making their own yoghurt and ghee, although electric “mixis” are now “the workhorses of many kitchens”. The book combines vivid descriptions and photos of the reality of everyday kitchen life in India – based on Gulati’s extensive travels – with superb recipes developed in her own home in England. The dal and vegetable recipes are varied and delicately spiced, but perhaps my favourite of all were two chicken recipes: a whole roast chicken with Keralan flavours and some vivid green kebabs marinated first in seasoned yoghurt, then in a herby spinach cream.View image in fullscreenHow I Cook: A Chef’s Guide to Really Good Home CookingBen Lippett (HarperCollins)When I first picked this up, I wasn’t sure if I was the target audience. Lippett – co-founder of Dr Sting’s Hot Honey – is a food influencer with more than 700,000 followers and a blokeish gen Z prose style. Then my 16-year-old got hold of it and made a decent French omelette on his first attempt and I became a true believer. What makes this book so special is that – as with last year’sSiftby Nicola Lamb – Lippett does not just provide recipes but explains the thinking and technique behind his decisions. Helpful tricks and tips abound and my copy is now covered with Post-it notes marking dishes to try, from Turkish spinach pide to smoked aubergine and nduja lasagne.Boustany: ACelebration ofVegetables fromMy PalestineSami Tamimi (Ebury)Yes, Tamimi is another Ottolenghi colleague, but I couldn’t fail to include this glorious and important cookbook. On the one hand, it’s a collection of refreshingly doable vegetarian recipes (fried aubergine m’tabbal with tomato and coriander salsa, egg dishes galore and a whole garden of different herb-rich salads such as “fridge-raid fattoush”). On the other hand, given the horrors in Gaza, it’s a timely and heartbreaking celebration of the beauty and rich culinary heritage of the Palestinians. Tamimi’s recipes – interspersed with excellent headnotes – stand as a reminder of that tradition’s exquisite variety, from spicy nutty dukkah to tender wild asparagus and green falafel made from broad beans.To browse all food books included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

Kyungha, a writer experiencing a health crisis (“I can sense a migraine coming on like ice cracking in the distance”), agrees to look after a hospitalised friend’s pet bird. The friend, Inseon, makes films that expose historical massacres in Korea. At the centre of the book is a mesmerising sequence “between dream and reality” where Kyungha stumbles toward Inseon’s rural home, blinded by snow, then finds herself in ghostly company. As the pace slows, and physical and psychic pain meet, the story only becomes more involving.

I have got used to that thought.” Book dealer Tara Selter is stuck in time, each day a repeat of yesterday. Groundhog Day it ain’t; this is more philosophical than comic – why, she doesn’t even bet on the horses – but it’s equally arresting. Tara slowly begins to understand how she occupies space in the world, and the ways in which we allow our lives to drift. At first she tries to live normally, recreating the sense of seasons passing by travelling to warm and cold cities. By the end ofvolume two, with five more books to come, we get hints of cracks appearing in the hermetic world – is Balle breaking her own rules? – but it just makes us want to read on further.The DirectorDaniel Kehlmann, translated by Ross Benjamin, (Riverrun)In Hollywood in the 1930s, film-maker GW Pabst is surrounded by yes-men studio execs and egotists such as Fritz Lang (“Metropolis is the best film ever made.” “I know”). He returns to Europe to see his sick mother; when war breaks out, he’s stuck in Austria, where he still wants to make films, but can only do so with the Nazis’ say-so. Kehlmann turns Pabst’s real-life dilemma into a full-blooded, entertaining epic. “Times are always strange,” he’s told. “Art is always out of place.” It’s the secondary characters who steal the show, from his son Jakob, who takes up the fascist cause, to Leni Riefenstahl with her “skull-like smile”, or the surprise narrator of one chapter: prisoner of war PG Wodehouse.Money to Burn/The Devil BookAsta Olivia Nordenhof, translated by Caroline Waight (Jonathan Cape)You wait ages for a Scandinavian septology-in-progress, then two come along at once. But where Balle’s is cool and reflective, Nordenhof’s is hot and eccentric. The books are loosely structured around a fire – and possible insurance scam – on a passenger ferry in 1990 that killed 159 people. They harness rage from this (“capitalism is a massacre”) to spin out into stories of love, rape, mental illness, art and more. Like a normal novel with all the boring bits taken out, these books are more energising and thrilling the more furious they get – even if the very loose links between the stories mean the reader must work to fill in the connections. “I mean really /,” writes Nordenhof, “I can’t / do the whole thing / by myself.”View image in fullscreenSololandHassan Blasim, translated by Jonathan Wright (Comma)Laughter is the best response to horror, say these three novellas of life in – and in exile from – postwar Iraq. The blend of darkness and humour is encapsulated in the first story, where a pharmacist closes her shop because she’s fed up with Islamic State fighters asking for Viagra: a comic-sounding detail, until we realise what they might want it for. In another, a youth tasked with managing a militia leader’s email account falls in love with one of his female admirers. Elsewhere, library books are soaked in blood dripping from the IS killing floor above: a blunt illustration that literature is under threat from fundamentalism. All the more reason to read Blasim’s essential stories.To browse all translated fiction included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

It all results in an ever more despairing refrain: “Do I want that? No I donot!” Oxenbury’s joyfully expressive huddles of animal and human characters heighten the sense of mayhem in this bouncy, cumulative delight, boasting all the ingredients of a perennial read-aloud favourite.More seriously, Annie Booker’sThe Great Bear(Two Hoots) is a lyrical, haunting story of the polar bear spirit that protects the oceans, and the human greed that threatens their rich life. This beautiful debut is both urgent and hopeful, its trailing kelp and luminous green waters contrasting vividly with black-smudge smoke and the choking cables of crammed fishing nets.Rashmi Sirdeshpande’sThis Is Who I Am(Andersen), illustrated by Ruchi Mhasane, is a moving celebration of identity, at once softly gorgeous and fierce. A child born of immigrant parents, with “a foot in two worlds”, is both “little fingers strumming a guitar / and the sweet notes of the sitar”; she is the strength to overcome racist resistance, and the “courage and patience” of freedom fighters; she is “every page of our shared history”.Another poetic, uplifting illustrated book for 5+ isFirefly(Magic Cat) by Robert Macfarlane and Luke Adam Hawker. Hawker’s densely textured images blaze even in black and white, as Macfarlane’s stirring verse guides the reader on a metaphorical journey through winter darkness to a dream field illuminated by fireflies, and onwards through supernovae in a blinding resurgence of light and hope (“Become vast, radiant, incandescent”).In nonfiction for 6+, the entrancingOmnibird by Giselle Clarkson (Gecko) is no straightforward ornithological guide. Looking at 18 species through an original, humorous lens, it shows their characteristics – chicken feathers “the shade of apricot jam”, penguins with “secretly a very long neck” – in ways that prompt young readers to see birds as complex, funny, everyday miracles.There’s more surreal comedy in Neill Cameron’sDonut Squad: Take Over the World!, which will thrill comics fans from eight to adult with its deep-fried pastries out for global domination. Join Sprinkles, the brave leader with no secret agenda (honest), “unconventional” Spronky, who fills shoes with mackerel, oozing Jammyboi, Anxiety Donut and more in the Squad’s battles against the bellicose, sugar-hating Bagels. With panels packed with anarchic humour, unexpected trivia and candy-coloured absurdity, it is impossible not to devour this in a sitting.In the high fantasy realm,The Poisoned Kingby Katherine Rundell (Bloomsbury), second in the Impossible Creatures series, returns its readers to the Archipelago, where Anya, fugitive granddaughter of a murdered king, joins forces with Christopher, guardian of the Archipelago’s mythical animals, in a quest for justice and the origins of a mysterious poison. Enthralling adventures – a sphinx-back rescue, a harpy-guarded library, a glimpse of a terrifying future – ensue, while characteristically humorous, elegant prose exhorts the reader to defend the frail and precious, remembering that “love is the greatest weapon against the world’s cruelties”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Con sends out airborne messages hoping for word of his dad in this poignant, soaring contemporary story, celebrating, like Rundell, the joy of caring for living creatures, forging new connections and learning to grow beyond rage and despair.The much-loved Emma Carroll makes a departure from historical fiction inDracula & Daughters(Faber), set in a town with a longstanding dread of vampires. When cousins Mina, Buffy and Bella discover their connection to Dracula, they uncover an ability that may allow them to heal the undead in this allusive, gothic thrill ride through a deliciously creepy, atmospheric literary landscape. First in a series that’s sure to hook 9+ readers who enjoy feminist fantasy, it may well prove a gateway drug to Victorian classics.There’s more superb historical fantasy inDeep Dark: A Cassia Thorne Mysteryby Zohra Nabi, a compelling journey into the shadows of 19th-century London. Uprooted from her Lucknow home, Cassia Thorne sleeps in the Fleet prison with her debt-laden father; by day, though, she’s free to sell news ballads and compose her own.

His keenest contempt is reserved for affectation, however inspired: his poetry is never didactic, seldom even containing the picture of an ideal. Peacock does not deal in maxims, fervid appeals, or tender retrospect.” A friend of the younger poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Peacock clearly was unpersuaded by the Romantic point of view: his editor isn’t mistaken. However, in satires such as Rich or Poor, the social criticism points to a broader idealism in Peacock’s view of the human comedy.Peacock (1785-1866) was a prolific poet and writer of the popular novels he termed “comic romances”. Rich or Poor reflects social habits he’d have observed in both the Regency and Victorian eras and its primary focus is the power of the Anglican establishment to prosecute the “undeserving” for failure to observeSunday restrictions. This was a subject that attracted the Punch magazine cartoonists of the day. Peacock has a finer eye for the visual details of ordinary life, and chooses a stanza-form which not only frames but variously brightens his vignettes.As the theme is always the contrast of rich and poor, so the metre in each stanza is a dialogue of three- and two-beat lines. The two-beat lines often have a hurried,dactylicskip in their toes, as in the third stanza: “The poor who would roast / To the baker’s must post”. Generally, if not consistently, the rich man’s activities proceed with a more sober accentual tread. The rhyme-scheme is also interesting – ABCCB. That unrhymed A line is unique in the rhyme-scheme of each stanza and, as such, acquires symbolic force. After establishing the topic (“The poor man’s sins are glaring”), it’s used to declare the benefits owned or accessible only by the rich man. It’s easy for a reader not to notice the absence of the rhyme, just as it’s easy for the Sabbath guard dogs to miss observing the rich man’s rule-breaking.At the core of the poem is the distinction between the ability to buy the privacy in which to flout the Sunday Observance laws, and the necessity of displaying your unavoidable “sins” publicly. Even Victorian windows aid concealment: the “painted windows” in stanza five allude to the use of variously patterned glass, including stained glass. If the concerts of the rich can be overheard, at least they can’t be seen.The travel options illustrated in the concluding verses are interesting. The railway network and the “third-class train” are now available. But the rich man can travel first-class, or afford an expensive horse-drawn private “carriage”. The poor man in the “fourpenny boat” is exposed to the weather as well as un-curtained daylight. He may be off on a jaunt, but not necessarily: the boat-trip might be his cheapest option for a necessary, perhaps kindly motivated errand, if he lives near a commercially active river such the Thames. The bishop who “groans to view him” may be dismayed by the sight of a man who in fact is fulfilling some laudable Christian obligation.Unexpectedly, the rich man’s “yachting” pleasures bring him clearly into the contemporary range of high-status leisure, and set me wondering what the equivalent satirical target might be today. A list of tax evasion schemes accessible only to the rich was my first idea. Unfortunately, I’m too poor to be acquainted with them, so someone else will have to write it.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Seriously? Sprüth Mager’snew group show of that titlemakes its case over four floors jammed with still and moving images of clowns, costumes, Star Wars figurines, dogs watching porn, a colourless cheeseburger, and artists running over a carton of milk.I’m absorbed by one of the most recent works in the show,Martine Syms’ She Mad: The Non-Hero, a conceptual TikTok tale inspired by Lil Nas X’s Life Story series from 2021. Borrowing the rapper’s structure and tropes, Syms performs convincingly as a rising star of the arts scene who shares her struggles with health, depression and loneliness. It’s a punchy satire of social media mores that debunks ideas about success.I’m jolted out of this thought by a shrieking noise. ButI haven’t stepped on a joke shop trigger, it’s Louise Lawler’s seven-minute 1972-81 audio work Birdcalls, in which she calls out art world sexism by screaming the names of 28 famous white male artists in the style of different bird calls. The idea is to present nature as artifice, the same way art history is merely a constructed form of power. It is also so silly you can’t help but smile.View image in fullscreenSpicy feminist humour … Seriously at Sprüth Magers, London.Photograph: Ben Westoby/Fine Art DocumentationLawler is part of a contingent of artists here associated with feminism and conceptualism in the 70s and 90s, a kind of confrontational, spicy humour that takes aim at feminine stereotypes in mass media and advertising. An androgynousSarah Lucaschomps down brazenly on a banana. A suite ofCindy Sherman’s works sharply satirise feminine stereotypes found in cinema and the media. A 2018 colour work shows four coiffed, heavily madeup characters wearing colourful tulle gowns, looking at the camera with something between a smile and a grimace. They seem to be sitting in the sea, a dissonance that makes the bizarre image even more awkward. In another picture Birgit Jürgenssen wears a ludicrous 3D “housewives’ apron” in the shape of an oven. Their visual puns are a revolt against stifling gender norms and they’re effective.View image in fullscreenNot too serious … Bruce Nauman, Studies for Holograms (a-e), 1970.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Sperone Westwater, New YorkIt’s great when artists don’t take themselves too seriously. The feminists were willing to make themselves look ridiculous to make the point that social codes and repressed sexual desires are farcical. Other artists adopt the strategy, too, depicting the body as a silly, plastic form that can be absurd and obscene.Bruce Naumanpulls and stretches his mouth into goofy, weird shapes. In L’Empereur series, German photographer Thomas Ruff throws himself around a room, dressed in brown and yellow to match the dour colour scheme. As he slumps and dives between the armchairs and the standing lamp, it’s a moment of slapstick for an artist not normally known for his cheer.A range of artists find humour in objects and assemblages, such as Thomas Demand with his witty photo of a slipper stuck under a door. One wall is packed with banal and bland pictures of a vacuum cleaner, a slice of bread or a bucket – humour is subjective, sure, but they’re about as fun as a root canal.The show starts to grate when it starts parodying other art – Ruff re-does Fischli/Weiss, Jonathan Monk nods to Lawler, John Waters sends up Gursky. But jokes don’t really work unless you get the art history references. Aneta Grzeszykowska’s recognisable parodies of Sherman – displayed in a room with Sherman – are easier to laugh at, caricatures of caricature, satire twisted into satire.Conceptual art is often ridiculous, so it doesn’t take much to turn its bombast and pompousness into a joke.William Wegman’s Experiment has the best punchline of the show: the first of two images is captioned “As an experiment he stood on his head”. The second says: “Everything looked upside down.” One of the famous works in the show is the late British artistKeith Arnatt’s influential 1969 performance photo Self-Burial, a sequence of nine images in which the artist slowly subsides into a hole he’s dug and eventually vanishes into the ground. The photos were broadcast on German TV in 1969 for a few seconds every evening without explanation, which must have been disturbing. If many viewers may have liked the idea of an artist disappearing, the last laugh is on us, since the ground is ultimately where we’re all heading.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In The Girl Chewing Gum, a voice shouts directions to the action taking place on a street in London, but the director is in fact a narrator, describing the movements of unwitting passersby with increasingly fantastical relish. It’s hilarious, but also eerily prescient in its anticipation of fake news and false narratives.This exhibition’s problem is that humour is subjective, cultural and temporal –and a lot of the gags here don’t raise a laugh today. There are a few inclusions I couldn’t figure out at all: howCarrie Mae Weems’s picture of a set of minstrel salt and pepper shakers fits in was beyond me.Paradoxically, Seriously is less about laughter and more about humour as a tool for challenging politics and values. With playfulness and wit, conceptual artists pushed photography past the documentary into a less stable, more experimental place. But can conceptual art make you belly laugh? Probably not.AtSprüth Magers, London, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArtPhotographyCindy ShermanSarah LucasBruce NaumanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here is what the critics thoughtGuardian StageMon 1 Dec 2025 04.34 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 04.35 ESTSharePaddington is brought to life with state-of-the-art animatronics: James Hameed is his voice and remote puppeteer, while Arti Shah is under his furry skin on stage (puppet design by Tahra Zafar). The Brown family are recognisable from the star-studded film: risk-averse dad (Adrian Der Gregorian), arty mum (Amy Ellen Richardson), adolescent Judy (Delilah Bennett-Cardy) and encyclopaedia-chomping wee Jonathan (Jasper Rowse on the night of attendance), along with houseguest Mrs Bird (Bonnie Langford, in national treasure mode) … This is the new Mary Poppins: a well-known story imaginatively staged, immaculately performed and utterly winning.Arifa Akbar, the GuardianThe plot and general mood here are both loosely based on the first Paddington film, with director Luke Sheppard and set designer Tom Pye creating a warm, multicultural, and gorgeously maximalist evocation of bohemian London. The famous bear crash-lands in an inhospitable city, then finds a home with the kindly Brown family. In the glorious set-piece song Don’t Touch That, his butter-pawed curiosity nearly destroys the fabric of their home: shelves tilt, white goods explode, and soap bubbles and jets of water burst through the ceiling.Alice Saville, the IndependentThe moment when the newcomer from darkest Peru tries on his trademark duffle coat for the first time drew a chorus of “Ahs” around the auditorium. The adults aren’t to be upstaged in an effervescent, if slightly overlong production directed by Luke Sheppard. Jessica Swale’s script is based on the original Paddington books and the first of the film spin-offs. Here, it’s the busybody neighbour Mr Curry who gets some of the best lines, Tom Edden having no end of fun as a killjoy with a combover who eventually sees the error of his ways.Clive Davis, the TimesView image in fullscreen‘The furball from Darkest Peru’ … Paddington.Photograph: Johan Persson/PAAh, Paddington Bear. Are the poppy songs in this new musical, by Tom Fletcher of McFly, especially memorable? They are not. Is the plot, by Jessica Swale, full of holes and needless diversions? It is. But will your eyes be moist the minute that the little furball from Darkest Peru sets paw in Paddington station – and will they be full to overflowing by the time he climbs into a black taxi with the Brown family and sets off on his journey towards home, family and belonging? Unless there’s something seriously wrong with you – and, probably, almost in spite of yourself – yes, they will.Sam Marlowe, the StageNot only does he blink bashfully, his little puzzled muzzle wrinkles with extreme pathos – and off-the-Richter-scale cuteness. When he turns to wiggle his tiny behind, he gets the kind of reception normally reserved for a 40-point Samba on Strictly. So the bear necessities – designed by Tahra Zafar – are genius. But Paddington is a team effort. His voice is delivered from the wings by James Hameed, while the costume itself is inhabited by Arti Shah. She has the little fella’s adorable wiggle off pat.Patrick Marmion, Daily MailThere’s a glorious, hallucinogenic knees-up in praise of marmalade (involving Tom Edden’s joyously slimy neighbour Mr Curry), tub-thumping carry-on courtesy of the Geographers’ Guild and a show-stopper in which Bonnie Langford’s wise old Mrs Bird turns theatrical trouper, does the splits and brings the house down; so silly, yet so life-affirming. Is this a new classic on a par with Mary Poppins or Matilda? No, it’s a touch threadbare and a little overstuffed with songs, but it’s still a very welcome addition to the British musical family.Dominic Cavendish, the TelegraphIt is not only the bear design that is marvellous. Scenic designer Tom Pye makes stunning use of the high ceiling and proscenium arch by flooding them with a mosaic of images that evoke Paddington’s homeland and the superhero cartoons that Mrs Brown draws. Every detail of this show is exquisite – and I predict that this will be one proudly British export that will go on to conquer the world.Fiona Mountford, the i PaperThis is a show about welcoming foreigners, about asserting the values of kindness and tolerance that used to be Britain’s hallmarks. Swale’s script and Fletcher’s lyrics make that point over and over again. It’s uplifting to find such a strong message in such a popular entertainment. Yet the comedy of the show never lets up.Sarah Crompton, WhatsOnStagePaddington: The Musical is at theSavoy theatre, London, booking to 25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsMusicalsWest EndTheatreNewspapersPaddingtonChildren and teenagersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With nature at its heart, the programme journeyed from the frozen wastes of Finland to the sun-kissed woodlands of Bohemia and beyond.En Saga, a last-minute substitute for Falla’s Love the Magician, was Sibelius’s first tone poem, poorly received in 1893 but successfully revised nine years later. The composer refused to furnish any specific literary explanations, yet the colourful score is redolent with imagery, from patriotic pageantry to dusky forests and midnight sleigh rides. It proved meat and drink to fellow Finn Santtu-Matias Rouvali. Plunging into its shadowy dramas, the conductor sustained the musical momentum effortlessly across its substantial arc while striking some fantastical podium attitudes of his own to tease out its more theatrical effects.According to the composer, Say’s Mother Earth was conceived as “a dramatic wakeup call in the fight to avoid a climate crisis”. Framed by a prelude and a postlude, and including a midpoint interlude, its four remaining movements are labelled Earth, Forest, Sea and River. Where Sibelius evokes, Say prefers to depict. Thunderous percussion portrays earthquakes and landslips; handheld devices imitate birdcalls; and peas rolled on a drum suggest wind and waves. At its best, as in the seismic stomp of Earth, or in Forest, with its tropical, Latin-infused rhythms, the music was exhilarating, if a trifle obvious.View image in fullscreenComposer and pianist Fazil Say reaches in to manipulate the strings directly.Photograph: Marc Gascoigne/Philharmonia OrchestraThe piano part, played by Say himself, roamed from easygoing and slightly bluesy to angsty and fraught, the last calling for some virtuoso playing. Especially intriguing were haunting, zither-like passages that required the soloist to play with only his left hand while stretching his right hand inside the piano to manipulate the strings.If Say’s work sounds a warning, Dvořák’s melodious Eighth Symphony is almost entirely upbeat. The Philharmonia gave it a big-boned but elastically phrased workout, with meaty string tone – especially the cellos – and secure, full-bodied horns. Balancing Brahmsian classicism with piquant folk idioms, Rouvali’s sure-footed interpretation was amiable and urgent; often jaunty, but always elegant.Explore more on these topicsThe Philharmonia OrchestraClassical musicSouthbank CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Mac Barnett’s 2023 picture book of the same name appeals to inquisitive young readers by offering a festive selection of breaking-and-entering techniques. Does he find the key under the flower pot, post himself through the letterbox, even swim in through the taps? Jon Klassen’s illustrations feature a pack of reindeer, with inscrutable expressions, watching Santa’s increasingly wacky antics.Directing his own adaptation for the Unicorn’s co-production with Told By an Idiot, Paul Hunter follows the book’s rhythm of a child’s racing imagination, with each far-fetched idea mooted, discarded, then swiftly replaced by another. He turns the book into a sort of variety show, with volunteers from the audience occasionally cast as Santa’s little helpers.Designer Sonya Smullen has created a roof with a huge cutaway section that leaves the stage flanked by two snow-covered slides for the performers to slip down. In an exuberant opening number of a show that mixes rap, jazz, easy listening and folksy Danish songs, the entire set is transformed into a sleigh for Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town. Smullen’s costumes are a jumble-sale mix of culottes, trapper hats and cosy dressing gowns, all evoking reindeer.A cast of four (Giulia Innocenti, Nathan Queeley-Dennis, composer Frida Cæcilia Rødbroe and choreographer Mikey Ureta) divvy up the roles and take turns suggesting methods while the others act them out as skits, sometimes using puppetry. As you’d expect from Told By an Idiot, there are plenty of eccentric visual and sonic touches. Sound effects are visibly provided, Foley-style, and a giant snow boot is lowered from above like Monty Python’s giant foot.View image in fullscreenReindeer games … the show’s composer Frida Cæcilia Rødbroe.Photograph: Manuel HarlanBy embracing a madcap, scattershot approach of styles, the adaptation loses some of the picture book’s gentler charm, and there is an inevitable hit-and-miss quality to the routines. They range from tired, including a section mimicking a razzle-dazzle gameshow, to inspired, as Santa straddles the photocopier to create a Flat Stanley-style version of himself. An interlude with a bonneted baby is more creepy than comical and there is a throwback music-hall vibe that sits a little oddly alongside additions such as Santa climbing into a Deliveroo driver’s giant bag.If Barnett’s occasional rhymes and wordplay aren’t extended, then there is plenty of physical tomfoolery to entertain the audience of over-twos, including Santa being bashed down the chimney with tubes of wrapping paper to the tune of jingle bells. The biggest laughs come from the panto perennial “he’s behind you”, deafeningly delivered by today’s young audience.

A video appeared to show Offset of Migos playing the song during his set at Boiler Room New York, which led many fans to believe it was an unreleased Smith song – footage that itself turned out to be fake.The apparently female vocals on the song were uncredited, and in fact belonged to the band’s Harrison Walker, processed through Suno’s genAI. “It shouldn’t be any secret that I used AI-assisted processing to transform solely my voice for I Run,” Walker told Billboard. “As a songwriter and producer I enjoy using new tools, techniques and staying on the cutting edge of what’s happening.”Sony Music, Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group have previously filed lawsuits against Suno over claims that the company trained its model on the labels’ works. Suno has claimed that it did so under fair use laws.Warner has since agreed a deal with Suno; Sony and Universal remain in litigation.In a statement posted on Instagram, Smith’s label Famm claimed that once I Ran originally went viral, Haven’s team asked Smith to feature on a remix of the song. Famm alleged that “they did so as they needed to legitimise the track as the public had been led to believe that they were listening to Jorja Smith’s vocals.“At no point did they mention to us that AI had been used to manipulate the existing vocals but we already had a suspicion that this was the case. We could have cut a cheque in a backroom deal and gotten paid but we ignored the request.”The Guardian has contacted Haven for comment.I Run has since been re-recorded with new vocals by Kaitlin Aragon, and last week charted at No 37 in the UK. But Famm believes the new top line was still made using AI models trained on Smith’s catalogue.“Haven and his team have now replaced the AI vocal with a real human vocal, although we still believe both versions of the track infringe on Jorja’s rights and unfairly take advantage of the work of all the songwriters with whom she collaborates,” Famm wrote in a statement posted to Instagram.It said that if it was successful in establishing that AI was involved in the track’s creation and won a share of the song, they would “seek to allocate each of Jorja’s cowriters with a pro-rata share. This allocation would be based on the percentage of Jorja’s catalogue that they have contributed to, as, ultimately, if AI helped to write I Run, it would have been trained on Jorja’s catalogue of songs.”Famm alleged that the song initially persisted on streaming and social media platforms as a result of it having four separate distributors who “aggressively” marketed the song, “circumventing usual takedown procedures”.Spotify stated that it detected the impersonation, removed the song and had not paid out any royalties. Billboard also said that it reserved the right to remove titles known to be involved in active legal disputes related to copyright infringements.Famm accused Haven and their label counterparts of relying on “public confusion as a key part of the marketing strategy … They could have made the public aware that Jorja’s vocals did not feature on I Run but instead appeared to revel in the confusion that had been created.“A second layer of public confusion arose once doubt had been cast over whether these were, in fact, Jorja Smith vocals – is this an AI track? Are these AI vocals? Again, rather than clear up the confusion immediately, they allowed the storm to brew.”There is further confusion in that a young female musician who has made music under the name Haven for years has been targeted by commenters accusing her of being AI as a result of sharing a name with the newer AI act. “Story time of how I got caught up in this AI mess,” shewrote in an Instagram video caption– and released her own “Human Haven” cover version of I Run. Whether the 90s Cornish band Haven will weigh in remains to be seen.“This isn’t about Jorja,” Famm said. “It’s bigger than one artist or one song.”Famm called for AI-generated music to be “clearly labelled as such so that the public may choose whether they consume AI material or not. And creators who are happy for their protected works to be used to train AI should be credited and compensated accordingly.”It highlighted the plight of creators as “collateral damage in the race by governments and corporations towards AI dominance … I Run seems to be a clear example of why we all need to step up and push for some guardrails before the moment is completely lost.”In mid-November,three AI-generated songs topped charts around the world. Walk My Walk and Livin’ on Borrowed Time by the outfit Breaking Rust topped Spotify’s US Viral 50 songs. A Dutch song, We Say No, No, No to an Asylum Seekers’ Centre, an anti-migrant anthem by JW “Broken Veteran”, also topped Spotify’s global viral chart. In July, the Velvet Sundown went viral, amassing more than 1m Spotify plays in a matter of weeks,only to be revealed as an entirely AI confection.Explore more on these topicsJorja SmithArtificial intelligence (AI)Pop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

And if it does, then I’ll deal with that moment. But having been a friend of Trump before he was president, I know a different guy.”Brolin met Trump while making the Oliver Stone filmWall Street: Money Never Sleeps, in which Brolin played stock trader Bretton James. Trump spent a day on set filming a cameo,which ultimately did not make the final cut.Saying Trump now has “power unmitigated, it’s unregulated”, Brolin added: “There is no greater genius than him in marketing – he takes the weakness of the general population and fills it.“And that’s why I think a lot of people feel that they have a mascot in him.

But they were objecting to what the film actuallywas.”In the film, Squibb plays a retired Jewish widow who inadvertently joins aHolocaustsurvivors group, and subsequently plays along with the imposture after realising her mistake. Johansson said: “[The film] had to be about what happens when someone gets caught in the worst lie imaginable; if not the Holocaust, then what could it be? They offered no alternative. It was just: ‘This is an issue.’”Johansson said she refused to make the required changes and the backer dropped out, meaning the budget was no longer covered. “It was really shocking, and I was so disappointed.” However, Johansson said distributor Sony Pictures Classics stepped in at the last minute and filming went ahead.View image in fullscreenJune Squibb in Eleanor the GreatIn the same interview Johansson reiterated her support for Woody Allen, for whom she starred in Match Point, Scoop and Vicky Cristina Barcelona between 2005 and 2008, saying: “My mom always encouraged me to be myself, [to see] that it’s important to have integrity, and stand up for what you believe in.” Allen has been ostracised by much of the film industry in the wake of allegations by his daughter Dylan Farrow that the film-maker sexually assaulted her in 1992. Allen has been the subject of investigations in respect of these allegations but has never been charged. The New York Department of Social Services said at the time of its investigation “that there was no credible evidence” to support the allegation. The interview follows her commentsin 2019, when she said:“I love Woody. I believe him, and I would work with him any time.”Eleanor the Great review – June Squibb takes on Holocaust survivor trauma in Scarlett Johansson’s iffy directing debutRead moreJohansson also commented on her decision tosue Disney over breach of contractover the studio released superhero film Black Widow simultaneously in cinemas and on streaming platform Disney+, which was settled with a rumoured payout of $40m (£29.7m). Johansson said she would have welcomed more support for her contest with Disney. She said: “As we moved from the model of theatrical box office bonuses to understanding how that translated to streaming, it had just become this nebulous thing, with no guidelines around it. So to be able to impact that moves everything in the right direction. But yes, I would welcome more support.”Explore more on these topicsFilmScarlett JohanssonHolocaustWoody AllenWalt Disney CompanySuperhero moviesnewsShareReuse this content"

After praising motion-capture performance as “a celebration of the actor-director moment”, Cameron expressed his disdain for artificial intelligence. “Go to the other end of the spectrum [from motion capture] and you’ve got generative AI, where they can make up a character. They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It’s like, no. That’s horrifying to me. That’s the opposite. That’s exactly what we’renotdoing.”He added: “I don’t want a computer doing what I pride myself on being able to do with actors. I don’t want to replace actors, I love working with actors.”Cameron, who is a director ofUK-based company Stability AI, said that artificial intelligence’s creative benefits are limited. “What generative AI can’t do is create something new that’s never been seen. The models … are trained on everything that’s ever been done before; it can’t be trained on that which has never been done. So you will innately see, essentially, all of human art and human experience put into a blender, and you’ll get something that is kind of an average of that. So what you can’t have is that individual screenwriter’s unique lived experience and their quirks. You won’t find the idiosyncrasies of a particular actor.”He added: “It also causes us to have to set our bar to a very disciplined level, and to continue to be out-of-the-box imaginative. The act of performance, the act of actually seeing an artist creating in real time, will become sacred.”Explore more on these topicsJames CameronArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingAvatarnewsShareReuse this content"

Deciding to wait a day before handing over my money changed everythingTam PatachakoMon 1 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTShareOne day at work two years ago, a notification hit my phone: my paycheck had come through. It was a fair amount for someone still at university, so I did what I always did when payday arrived: I opened every shopping app on my phone. Amazon, Vinted, Etsy, Depop, Zara, you name it. Within the space of an hour, I had spent £90 on clothes, decorative items and a completely useless weighted blanket I never touched.A few days later, I went online again and bought a hairdryer. I already owned one, but thought another couldn’t hurt. Then I added LED strip lights and two pairs of shoes that weren’t even my size. This wasn’t new behaviour. In fact, I’d been notorious for it ever since I could afford to buy my own things.Whenever I felt stressed, tired or bored, I would doomscroll until it inevitably ended in an impulsive shopping binge. My justification was always: “Oh well, it’s just £5.” But £5 became £10, then £20, and so on.I was never entirely sure why I did this. Maybe it was because I grew up in a poor family, where we’d go months without buying new clothes or anything to brighten up the house. So any time I had some disposable income, there was always a subconscious yearning for new and exciting things. Or maybe, and definitely more likely, I was just financially irresponsible and gave in easily to capitalism’s demands.Eventually, I decided to try something new. Before buying anything, I’d put it in my basket, wait 24 hours, then decide whether to check out. The best part of this method was that it gave me space to think – something I’d never done before. For the first time since I turned 18, I began asking myself: “Do I actually need this? Can I afford it?” More often than not, the answer was no.View image in fullscreenTam Patachako, browsing at Loris Parfum in Norwich.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianIf I opened Amazon, Depop or Zara and found items sitting in my basket, I’d clear them out and start fresh. Using this method, I stopped buying things that I knew deep down I would never use. I once wanted to buy three board games, but after waiting before going to the shop, I realised I never actually play board games.I also wanted to buy a disposable film camera for my first holiday in Croatia. After waiting I remembered I had a phone, like everybody else, that has a perfectly good camera, and therefore did not need to buy a separate camera.It also means I am more discerning about the things I do buy, and I can finally look at my bank statements without feeling shame or embarrassment.Of course, there have been times I’ve slipped back into old habits – it’s only natural. The difference now is that I can recognise the signs early, especially when I’m rushing into a purchase. I’ve realised boredom is a powerful trigger. It’s perhaps the biggest driver of my impulsive spending.Consumer culture preys on this boredom and our need for instant gratification. That’s why, in hindsight, forcing myself to pause before buying has felt strangely liberating. To be able to have control over my impulses and remind myself that I don’t need to spend my hard-earned money on unnecessary products feels as radical as it is simple.Explore more on these topicsOnline shoppingThe one change that workedConsumer spendingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You see, my family is mostly made up of pescatarians, so anything larger than a chicken or cockerel (my personal favourite) for the meat eaters is just excessive. So, alongside a lovingly cooked smaller bird, I also make something fishy – hopefully something with a bit of star-quality, but not too shouty. A dish that will be delicious, fancy, but stress-free all at the same time. These pan-fried monkfish fillets are this year’s solution. It’s the sort of dish that can be made in next to no time while everything else finishes off in the oven, but that still has all the glitz and glamour of Christmas.Fried monkfish in herby champagne butterPrep10 minCook40 minServes44 monkfish fillets4 tbsp plain flour1½ tsp ground white pepperSea salt and black pepperOlive oil3 tbsp small capers½ small bunch each fresh flat-leaf parsley and chives, finely chopped60g unsalted butter2 shallots,peeled and very finely chopped150ml champagne, or prosecco300ml fish stock150ml double creamZest of 1 unwaxed lemonPut the monkfish fillets on a sheet of kitchen paper to absorb any excess moisture. In a shallow bowl, toss the flour with a teaspoon of ground white pepper and a half-teaspoon of sea salt, then add some freshly ground black pepper and stir. Toss each fillet in the seasoned flour, until well coated, then put to one side.Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and drizzle in a few tablespoons of olive oil. Pat the capers dry, add them to the hot pan and fry for about five minutes, until crisp. Spoon the capers into a bowl, add the chopped parsley and chives and stir to combine. Keep the pan for later.Now make the sauce. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan or frying pan, add the chopped shallots, turn down the heat a little, then season with sea salt and the remaining half-teaspoon of ground white pepper. Cook the shallots for five minutes, until they start to soften, then pour in the champagne, turn up the heat and reduce by half.Add the stock, bring back to a boil, and keep on a rolling boil for about five minutes to reduce a little further. Stir in the cream, bring to a boil for a couple of minutes, then taste and tweak the seasoning.Meanwhile, pour enough oil into the large frying pan just to coat the bottom, return it to a medium-high heat and fry the seasoned monkish fillets for three to four minutes on each side, until golden all over and cooked through.To serve, spoon the hot sauce over a serving platter, ideally one with a lip. Arrange the fried monkfish on top, then scatter over the crisp capers and herbs. Finely grate over the lemon zest and serve straight away withgratin boulangere, caramelised carrots and shredded sprouts.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkFishFoodSeafoodMain courseChristmasWinerecipesShareReuse this content"

She was persuaded to switch to BritishGaswith the promise of “preferential rates” whereupon the meter stopped working.Because she can no longer monitor her credit or consumption, her electricity supply keeps cutting out. And since there is no gas supply to the house, that leaves her with no heating. She can’t pay on the app because that informs her that her account is locked.“She gets different advice every time she rings,” says KM. One agent wants the pensioner to climb a ladder to photograph the meter number already on its records (she’s recently returned from a hospital stay).Another tells her to use her old top-up card from her previous supplier. She does, after putting more money on it. Unsurprisingly it has no effect and she now faces clawing the money back from a supplier she no longer has an account with.Eighteen days after the switch she can’t check what she’s paid for and she can’t keep warm.View image in fullscreenBritish Gas admitted an unexplained ‘delay’ in transferring a customer account.Photograph: Tommy  (Louth)/AlamyBritish Gas’s conscience is always tenderised by a headline. It admits an unexplained “delay” in transferring her account which left her without heating three times in one chilly week.It also admits a shortfall in customer service when she complained. It is now switching her to a credit meter, addressing the app issue and paying her goodwill for the “inconvenience”.Act IIUp in Glasgow,RWhas spent seven years telling his supplier that there is something wrong with his bills.Ever since a new meter was fitted in 2018 they have been enormous. So enormous that he has been left with a four-figure debit several years on the trot because his ever-increasing direct debits can’t keep up. In vain, he has sent photos of his meter first to Bulb, then when it collapsed,Octopus Energy.Both agreed there was something amiss, but since they couldn’t work out what they kept on helping themselves to RW’s money and RW kept getting into debt.View image in fullscreenA meter incorrectly recording energy use in cubic feet rather than cubic metres led to astronomical bills and debt.Photograph: Maureen McLean/REX/ShutterstockIt was when he tried to switch supplier this year that the new company spotted the hitch: his meter readings had been recorded in cubic feet rather than cubic metres, which means he has potentially been billed about 35 times what he should have been.Octopus promised to sort it out but the only contact RW has received in the weeks since has been more huge bills.“I feel financially at the mercy of a company that really doesn’t care about me,” he laments.Enter Guardian Money, and Octopus leaps into action.The never-ending drama of dealing with errant energy companiesRead moreIt explains that the switch from an imperial meter to a metric one in 2018 was not recorded in the energy database, so his bills continued to be calculated in cubic feet. This has now been corrected and RW’s account has been reviewed and backdated.The result? It was discovered he had overpaid more than £8,000. He’s since been refunded this plus interest calculated at 8% and compensation worth 10% – a total just short of £12,000.Act IIIWe’re in Dorset where a teenage schoolgirl is being threatened with a trashed credit rating by Ovo. The utilities company has decided that she owes it £20.The fact that the charges are for a rental property her family left a year ago and cover a period after they’d moved out is of no interest to Ovo. Its debt collectors inform her that she faces legal action if she doesn’t pay up.This plot is spookily similar tomy previous dramain which Ovo billed a teenage boy for a supply at an address he’d long since left.View image in fullscreenDebt collectors told one school girl she faces legal action for a £20 energy bill debt.Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/AlamyOvo won’t talk to the girl’s mother,GS, who was the account holder during the tenancy because of GDPR. It doesn’t think it’s odd that GS has a paid-up Ovo account for the family’s current home which was opened when they moved.“How did our society get to the point where big businesses can threaten children over debts that aren’t theirs?” she asks. Ovo blames tracing agents, who match debts with creditors, who somehow got hold of the student’s details and matched them to a debt accrued between tenancies.It has now cancelled the debt, deleted her details and dispatched a box of White Company lotions in contrition.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

The tussocks under my boots cover the Maiden Way, perhaps the highest Roman road in Britain, but the sense of being close to the sky – today a simmering grey – remains as palpable as it would have been 2,000 years ago. Looking north, a rainbow arcs across the horizon, the full reach of it clearly visible from this high ground. Buffeted by the squall with every step, it feels as though I’m striding across the top of the world, which is apt, since I’m following the newRoof of England Walk.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This 188-mile, multi-day trail was developed by the North Pennines national landscape team, and launched in September. Taking in lofty footpaths and some of the best-loved elements of the North Pennines – among them High Force, Cross Fell, High Cup Nick, the Nine Standards andEngland’s highest pub, the Tan Hill Inn– the aim is to showcase this sometimes overlooked corner of the country.View image in fullscreen“It’s a blank on the map for a lot of people, a huge area between Hadrian’s Wall and the Yorkshire Dales that they don’t really know,” says Shane Harris, the project’s lead, when I meet him after my walk for a bowl of cauliflower soup at Stanhope’sRoot and Branch community cafe. “The North Pennines is a historic, vibrant landscape and a Unesco Global Geopark. This walk is about introducing more people to it.”Starting and ending in Appleby-in-Westmorland, the walk loops through the moors, meadows and riverbanks of County Durham, Cumbria and Northumberland – the three counties of the North Pennines national landscape – plus a corner of the Yorkshire Dales national park. Its 14 legs have been designed to work as day walks or as a longer trail, and to link up with public transport. And most run between a town or village, so there’s somewhere to stay at the end of a day’s fairly remote walking.View image in fullscreenWalkers cross high moorland in the North Pennines.Photograph: Carl JoyceI’m hiking a 50-mile section in just over three days, from Alston, in Cumbria, to Edmundbyers, in County Durham, via Haltwhistle, Allendale and Blanchland, all in Northumberland. Alston, touted as England’s highest market town, is also one of its prettiest, bustling with independent shops, cafes and (as of this month) a pint-size wine bar,Walter’s. It’s also home to the recently spruced-upAlston Hostel(dorm beds from £30, private rooms from £40pp), where I’m staying. Taken over two years ago by Mat Austin and his partner Claire, they aim to provide a homely experience, hence home-cooked meals and a welcome from Poppy the puppy.Allen Banks woodland is spectacular in autumn, its deep river gorge shimmering with bronze, copper and goldThe Pennine Way passes right behind the building – one of several long-distance paths the Roof of England Walk merges with along its course – and it’s this I follow the next morning. I leave the shelter of Alston’s coppery, tousle-headed trees and head up onto Langley Common. A bank of rain blows in, muting the landscape to monochrome, and I scurry on to Gilderdale Burn, crossing from Cumbria into Northumberland.A little further on the embankments ofEpiacum, a former Roman fort, loom out of the drizzle. I detour hurriedly to nearbyNook Farm Shopfor a hot coffee. The rain ebbs as I leave and soon I’m into my stride, following drystone walls and burns down to Slaggyford via a long, broad sweep of whisky-coloured river.View image in fullscreenAlston in Cumbria is said to be Britain’s highest market town.Photograph: Carl JoyceThe Kirkstyle Inngastropub is nearby, but my route leads in the other direction, over hay meadows and moorland down to the banks of the South Tyne, whereFeatherstone Castle’s gothic bulk sits draped in mist. Following the river into Haltwhistle, I’m so soaked when I arrive that I look like I’ve been swimming in it.“Ooh, bedraggled!” declares the owner of theOld School House B&B(twins from £120 B&B), whisking my waterproofs to the drying room and my sodden boots to the boot dryer. “As well as this new walk, we’re on thePennine Way,Hadrian’s Wall Pathand Land’s End to John o’Groats, so we’re used to walkers,” Kate says.I open my flask of tea and watch rabbits bounding through the dew. I realise I’m completely alone, and relish itThe following morning, at a breakfast table laid with bone china and his own-recipe granola, her husband Ian serves me a winning shakshuka. Outside it’s bright and most of the morning’s route is on country lanes. Beyond Haltwhistle, I pass elegant stone farmhouses, cottage gardens brimming with flowers and glimpses of rickety Unthank Hall. On a ridge beyond it, I open my flask of tea and watch rabbits bounding through the dew. I realise I’m completely alone, and relish it.Past Willimoteswick Castle, I arrive at pretty Beltingham. Following one of the walk’s purple lapwing signposts, I dip down intoAllen Banks. Cared for by the National Trust since 1942, this woodland is spectacular in autumn, its river gorge shimmering with bronze, copper and gold.View image in fullscreenThe River Allen.Photograph: Clearview/AlamyClimbing out of the woods, I’m met with a huge upland meadow, its peachy grasses rippling in the wind. It’s another few miles to Allendale. This former lead mining settlement switched to tourism in Edwardian times, after the last mines closed. I’m staying atthe Lion House, a pub in the market square with two newly renovated guest rooms (en suites from £120 room-only). Each New Year, local guisers parade through the square carrying flaming tar barrels on their heads, but it’s quiet this evening. Landlord Dave welcomes me in, and his partner Maureen brings me a bowl of warming vegetable soup.With smoke curling from chimneys and doors painted a regulation plum, Blanchland feels like a mirageThe following morning I open the shutters on to a sweeping view of the square … and more dark clouds. A storm is forecast and I need to be quick if I’m going to beat it. Scrambling on to moorland above the town, I startle grouse after grouse, their bark-quacks echoing in my ears as I drop down into the hamlet of Whitley Mill and on into Slaley Forest. It’s a long climb here, past thick tracts of Scots pine and blue spruce that are home to red squirrels. At the top the trail spits me out into the wind-scrubbed heather of Blanchland Moor. The view reaches all the way to Derwent reservoir but the sky is glowering, heavy and low, so I press on.The clouds don’t burst and I’m still dry as I walk into Blanchland, a huddle of dainty stone buildings in the crook of a small valley. The village was created in the 18th century from the remains of a medieval abbey, and with smoke curling from chimneys and doors painted a regulation plum, it feels like a mirage. What was once the guesthouse for the abbey is now a hotel, theLord Crewe Arms(doubles from £205 B&B), and as I click the latch on its ancient door, there’s a sense of entering another world.View image in fullscreenThe Lord Crewe Arms occupies a former abbey guesthouseIn my room, there’s homemade shortbread in a jar and fresh milk by the kettle; downstairs is a vast open fire. After dinner in the restaurant – meltingly soft roast venison with homegrown kale – I peek out at the storm-cleared skies and am rewarded with a swathe of bright stars: there are no street lights in Blanchland, and it has some of the darkest skies in the country.From here, it’s just over five miles to Edmundbyers. There’s a savage wind as I follow the trail up Buckshott Fell, but the sunrise has flushed the colour back into the land. From a ridge on the moor I look out over 360 degrees of purple, gorse and slate, and realise I’ve been approaching the North Pennines all wrong. There may be history and wild beauty along its path, but this is a walk for looking up, rather than down – to the ever-changing skyscape of rainbows, storm clouds, sunrises and stars on the roof of England.The walk was organised byNorth Penninesnationallandscape.

She said something and I felt misunderstood, criticised – and that she was wrong. I wanted an apology. As we worked through this, as she listened to me and I listened to her, I gradually realised that she hadn’t meant exactly what I thought, and that I was the one who had misunderstood, who was being so critical. But why couldn’t she have made it easier for me to understand, phrased it like I would have done? She responded: “That isn’t what I thought.”In that moment, something clicked. I felt the rush and the relief of sudden emotional clarity. I think this came from seeing that my psychoanalyst, by not apologising to appease my anger, by not taking an easy way out of the conflict, by persisting in offering me her honest thoughts about what was going on in my mind and by bearing my struggle to take them in, was giving me an extremely rare and precious experience. I felt an overwhelming and surprising surge of gratitude.Years ago, for this newspaper, I wrote about the latest psychology research into gratitude, which had found it to be a self-help superfood, like a goji berry for emotional wellbeing. I experimented with keeping a gratitude diary, writing down what I felt grateful for each evening. It was an interesting exercise. What I discovered then – and what I’ve learned through experience since – is that if you try to “game” gratitude or any emotion in this way, treating it like an asset to be accumulated, it can only ever be a “nice feeling” – and a fleeting one.Nice feelings have their place. But I don’t believe they help to build a better life. They are one part of the outcome of a fulfilling and meaningful life (along with lots of not-so-nice feelings). On their own they are not sufficient for precipitating internal change. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: what we all want is to feel better – but what we really need is to get better at feeling.Because, as the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein realised, if we are lucky, gratitude can be more than a nice feeling. It can be part of a powerful, nourishing, developmental process, which helps us hold on to good experiences and relationships. In my sessions as a patient in psychoanalysis, and as a psychotherapist to patients, I have seen it be both a trigger for and an outcome of psychological growth. But it is not easy to get there – not as simple as writing a list. Before you can feel truly grateful you may have to feel envious, in need, and vulnerable, just as I did in my psychoanalysis session. You may need to develop the capacity to tolerate your hate and rage and despair and all sorts of feelings that are not nice. And of course, you have to have something to feel grateful for. For it to be a transformative experience, gratitude has to be spontaneous, it has to be real, and it has to grow inside a relationship with another person. That’s why I felt it so strongly when my psychoanalyst used her mind to help me understand mine: gratitude grows out of a link between minds.I have been thinking about this over the last 20 months while writing this column for you every fortnight, because it has been an experience of making links. Making links within my own mind, from feelings to thoughts to theories I’ve learned in my psychotherapy training and experiences I’ve had both with patients, and as a patient. It has been a time for me of finding profound meaning in our everyday losses and loves, as well as in a jumper that shrank in the wash, in potty training, and in a perfectly cooked jacket potato.And it has also been an experience of making links between our minds: I have felt so hopeful and heartened by the connections we’ve made through your messages, week after week, letting me know that my column has touched you or been useful. You’ve told me you’ve shared my work with family after the loss of a parent, after the loss of a child: this took the wind out of me. You’ve told me you’ve read my work and decided to go into therapy, to go travelling, to read more books. And some of you have sent me your own creative work – I’ve listened to your songs, looked at your art, read your articles and bought your books that have had me enthralled or in floods of tears (in a good way). I’ve also made friends. Every one of these links has felt like a gift, connections forged in a time in our society where it is so much easier, and there is so much opportunity and encouragement, to break them.Are you stuck in ordinary - but devastating - narcissism? There is a way outRead moreAn important part of my treatment as a patient, and the treatment I offer to my patients, is somehow trying to find a home in our minds for the parts of us that seek to make links, to create and feel and come alive, and the parts of us that seek to break links, to destroy, to kill off feelings and ourselves. I wish it could be otherwise but I know a better life can only be built when we can each integrate all of these parts of ourselves.Now this column is coming to an end – the next will be my last – and I am so grateful to have had this chance to make these connections with you all. I hope that we can all hold on to them. Research shows that the outcomes of psychodynamic psychotherapy improve over time after treatment has ended – patients feel more helped as more time passes, because the unconscious changes grow bigger and bigger, like ripples in a pond. I hope that the links we have made together can take root in our minds and, over time, continue to grow and nourish us, helping us to build better lives, not only for ourselves.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodExplore more on these topicsLife and styleHow to build a better lifeMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t want people thinking they can eat badly every day and balance it out with a glass of wineThey show that wine can help reduce “bad” cholesterol – which may lower the risk of heart disease, kidney problems and stroke. That’s thanks to compounds that have vasorelaxant and anti-inflammatory effects, helping blood vessels stay open and flexible. Red wine also contains antioxidants such as resveratrol, found in the skin of grapes, which may further support heart health.Still, there are major caveats. The World Health Organisationpublished a statement in 2023reporting that no level of alcohol consumption is safe; the benefits of wine for the heart are outweighed by it being a group 1 carcinogen, alongside asbestos and tobacco. Other foods – such as berries and grapes – offer similar benefits to wine without those negative effects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But he also says it’s unrealistic to expect everyone who currently drinks to go teetotal, adding: “Moderation is key. Keep it sensible. Alcohol, especially beer or spirits, is high in sugar and calories and can damage the liver.”He recommends consuming no more than 20 small glasses of wine a month.

Typical terrible TV idea. Won’t work.”Eleven million live viewers later, we can now have a look at the filled version of Glyph’s remarkable grid. Or rather, grids. Solvers are told:Entrants must pick a side. The majority of down clues must have a letter removed before solving. These letters, taken in clue order, inform the solver of one who may not pick a side.The extra letters gave us CLAUDIA WINKLEMAN and four clues were ambiguous, giving equally valid answers such as these …BEARS or BARESPATER or PRIORFAT orOATGOLFBALLor GOLFBAGS… meaning that the central entry T __ E __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ could equally well be THE FAITHFUL or THE TRAITORS.View image in fullscreenGenius puzzle no 269There is even more to it than that and the puzzle as a whole plays the same mind games as its subject; I wonder what Glyph will have for us next?December’s Genius awaitsand in our cluing conference, thank you for your clues for SCALES.

Not only had Hernández helped turn Honduras into a major transit point for South American cocaine heading to the US, but Vigil said he had also transformed it intoa cocaine producing hubwhich was nowhome to coca plantations and makeshift labs for processing coca leaves.“When you take a look at Pablo Escobar and [Joaquín] ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán, they were big drug traffickers – but they were never presidents of a country,” Vigil added.“So ifDonald Trumpis giving this guy a pardon, why is he not giving [the also incarcerated Mexican cartel boss] Chapo Guzmán a pardon? El ​Chapo Guzmán is less of a figure in the drug world than Juan Orlando Hernández was.”Ioan Grillo, the author of a trio of books on Latin America’s narco underworld, was also puzzled byTrump’s “jaw-dropping” offer. “It’s crazy … it really undermines his hard-line ‘war on drugs’ position,” Grillo said, wondering if Trump might rethink his move given the outcry.US prosecutors alleged that even before taking power Hernández had started conspiring with Latin American narco bosses who have long used the Central American country as a trampoline to smuggle drugs into the US. Jurors agreed and, in July 2024, Hernández was sentenced to more than four decades in prison “for cocaine importation and related weapons offenses”. His younger brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández,was sentenced to life in prisonin 2021. Among his crimes was accepting $1m from El Chapo “to support Juan Orlando Hernández’s presidential campaign”.Vigil believed Hernández was responsible for helping move billions of dollars worth of cocaine into the US – far more than the fast boats Trump’s “kinetic strikes” have destroyed in the Caribbean and Pacific since September.“He’s killed approximately 80 people, destroyed approximately 20 boats, and he has not provided any concrete evidence that they were carrying drugs,” said Vigil, who believed many of those killed on the fast boats were impoverished fishers who, in some cases, might have earned $200-a-month for transporting drugs.Meanwhile, despite Trump’s claims that Maduro is the leader of a narco organization called the “Cartel of the Suns”, many experts doubt such a group even exists.“Maduro is not a saint,” said Vigil, noting how he and several allies were indicted for trafficking cocaine in the US in 2020. “[But] they’re not a cartel, they don’t have an infrastructure,” he added, calling such allegations a “nonsense”.Orlando Pérez, a Latin America expert from the University of North Texas at Dallas, said Trump’s double standards on which drug smuggling presidents to pursue revealed there was no consistent strategy to fight the region’s drug traffickers. “It’s all ad hoc and based on political considerations,” he said.“One [Hernández] is a right-wing supporter of the US – and the other [Maduro] is not,” Pérez added. “It is ideological. It is political. It is self-interested in terms of advancing an ideological agenda – and it has nothing to do with effective anti-drug policies.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Christian pilgrims spilled out of buses, while observant Jewish worshippers gathered outside the gate to the Western Wall.New flags now fly a few metres from Rajabi’s home. Blue and white and bearing the Star of David, they mark where residentswere evicted recentlyfrom their homes by Israeli police. After more than 20 years of activism, Rajabi knows his days in Batn al-Hawa, a predominantly Palestinian neighbourhood less than a mile south of the Old City, are almost certainly numbered.View image in fullscreenZohair Rajabi and one of his grandchildren, sitting in their home in Batn al-Hawa.Photograph: Amnon Gutman/The Guardian“Yes I have lost. I have been defeated. I am not only waiting for my home to be taken but for every home here to be taken,” the 55-year-old said.Rajabi has lived in Batn al-Hawa all his life. His home is a rambling four-storey house built on land bought by his grandfather in 1965. His brothers and mother live on different floors, with many children. Two of his relatives are severely disabled. All will have to move if Rajabi’s request to make a final legal appeal to Israeli courts is rejected, as all in Batn al-Hawa expect.“We know what the decision will be … but we are going to fight anyway. I think within the month all 52 of us will have to find somewhere else to live,” he said.View image in fullscreenA view of the street outside the Rajabi family home.Photograph: Amnon Gutman/The GuardianBatn al-Hawa has long been the target of rightwing Israeli organisations working to consolidate Israeli control of parts of Jerusalem seized after the defeat of Jordan in the 1967 war.One such organisation isAteret Cohanim, which describes itself as “the leading urban land reclamation organisation in Jerusalem … working for over 40 years to restore Jewish life in the heart of ancient Jerusalem”.The group argues that much of Batn al-Hawa lies on the site of a village constructed by a philanthropic trust under Ottoman rule in the late 19th century to house poor Yemeni Jews. The community was evacuated by British authorities when tensions rose between Arabs and Jews inPalestinein the 1930s and its inhabitants were told they would be able to return when calm was restored, but never did.View image in fullscreenAn overview of Batn al-Hawa.Photograph: Amnon Gutman/The GuardianLawyers acting for the trust, which was reactivated almost 20 years ago, have successfully argued in Israeli courts that its prior ownership of the properties in Batn al-Hawa should take precedence over any later purchases made by current inhabitants or their parents or grandparents. A 1970 law gives Jewish people the right to reclaim property in East Jerusalem.Possession by the trust of some buildings has also been obtained through deals with their owners, though the circumstances of these remains controversial.Daniel Luria, a spokesperson for Ateret Cohanim, said the organisation, which has placed almost 40 Jewish families in Batn al-Hawa, was independent of the trust but had ties with it.View image in fullscreenPalestinian young people playing at the Madaa Creative Centre in Batn al-Hawa.Photograph: Amnon Gutman/The GuardianIn recent months, a sudden spate of evictions has followed a series of decisions by Israeli judges.Ir Amim, a Jerusalem-based NGO active in Batn al-Hawa, said Rajabi and his family were among 34 families, numbering some 175 people, who face “imminent displacement and settler takeover of their homes.”Map of Jerusalem and surrounding areaIf carried out, this could lead to “the largest expulsion and coordinated state and settler takeover of a Palestinian neighbourhood in occupied East Jerusalem since 1967,” said Amy Cohen, a spokesperson for Ir Amim.Luria compared the current resistance to eviction of residents in Batn al-Hawa, which he calls Shiloah, to “Custer’s last stand”.“I sympathise but … they are illegal squatters in properties from which Jews were driven out in the 1930s,” he said.Rajabi blames the recent spate of evictions on the war in Gaza. “The war is a big factor. If there was no war, maybe you would see only one eviction every 10 years instead of five in 15 months. The war has created an atmosphere where you can push this through …. An atmosphere of hate,” he said.View image in fullscreenZohair Rajabi looks down over Jerusalem from his roof.Photograph: Amnon Gutman/The GuardianIsrael’s ruling coalition, the most rightwing government in its history, includes extremist ministers deeply committed to the project of expanding Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem, which Israel has unilaterally annexed, as well as in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.About 40% of Jerusalem’s population ofroughly 1 millionis Palestinian. Maintaining a Jewish majority in the city has been an aim of successive Israeli governments.In September, Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s finance minister, said Israel should annex 82% of the occupied West Bank.Luria said he supported Smotrich’s proposal “one thousand percent”. “When the Jews came back in 1948, it didn’t stop there, or in 1967 … the Zionist dream is not over,” he said.Rajabi is unsure where he and his family will go if evicted. Three of his four children are teenagers and finding a home for them all will be difficult, he said, adding: “The government and the settlers want us out of Jerusalem.”On the walls of Rajabi’s house is a painting of al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in Islam and located on the Haram al-Sharif compound, which is known as the Temple Mount to Jews and is the most sacred currently accessible prayer site in Judaism.Dahreen, Rajabi’s 15-year-old daughter, said the prospect of leaving her home saddened her: “Every stone here is a memory for me. I am very worried that we will be split up as a family and I will be away from my friends. But I’m taking my cat with me whatever happens.”Explore more on these topicsPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Three suspects were arrested at the airport on Friday and another on Saturday.A police statement said: “The arrests emanate from a tipoff from OR Tambo SAPS [South African police service] regarding three males en route toRussiavia the United Arab Emirates who were removed from the boarding gate as suspicious and referred to the Hawks’ [the directorate for priority crime investigation] crimes against the state section.“Preliminary investigation revealed that a South African female had been facilitating the travel and recruitment of these individuals into the Russian Federation military.”The five suspects who appeared at a brief hearing and were remanded in custody were Nonkululeko Mantula, 39, a national radio presenter; Thulani Mazibuko, 24; Xolani Ntuli, 47; Siphamandla Tshabalala, 23; and Sfiso Mabena, 21. Proceedings were postponed until a bail hearing on 8 December.The arrests come after competing police affidavits filed by two daughters of the former South African presidentJacob Zuma. It is illegal for South Africans to fight for or help foreign militaries without government authorisation.On 6 November, the office of South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said it wasinvestigating how the menbecame trapped in eastern Ukraine and was working to bring them home.On 22 November, Nkosazana Zuma-Mncubefiled a police reportalleging that her sister Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla and two others, Siphokazi Xuma and Blessing Khoza, had recruited 17 men, including eight Zuma relatives, by telling them they would be training as bodyguards for the Zumas’ uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party.Zuma-Sambudla claimed she was deceived by Khoza into recruiting for what she thought was a legitimate course, after she attended the training for a month in Russia. The 43-year-oldresigned as an MK MP last week.Russia’s embassy in South Africa did not reply immediately to a request for comment.South Africans’ attention was also piqued by the allegations against Mantula, who hosted the Morning Bliss, a 3-5am show on SAfm, a radio station owned by the national South African Broadcasting Corporation.Posts on her Instagramaccount on 9 November showed her speaking at events in Moscow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Zimbabwe, Aids-related deaths have risen for the first time in five years. In Ethiopia and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo(DRC), patients with suspected HIV went undiagnosed due to test-kit stocks running out.Stories of the devastating impact of US, British and wider European aid cuts on the fight against HIV – particularly in sub-SaharanAfrica– continue to mount as 2025 comes to an end, and are set out in a series of reports released in the past week.The Trump administrationabruptly cut all overseas aid spendingin January, with only piecemeal restorations to funding since then. Other countries,including the UK, have announced their own cuts. It has beenestimated that external health assistanceover 2025 will be between 30% and 40% lower than it was in 2023.View image in fullscreenA Congolese HIV patient in Lualaba receiving only a month’s worth of medication instead of enough for 90 days, after USAID’s cuts.Photograph: Arlette Bashizi/Washington Post/GettyWinnie Byanyima, the UNAids executive director, said: “The complex ecosystem that sustains HIV services in dozens of low- and middle-income countries was shaken to its core.”Without swift action to get services back on track, UNAids has predicted there will be 3.3m more new HIV infections by 2030 than expected. And while there are signs of recovery, including new domestic funding in some countries, access remains far from universal.TheUN agency’s reportfinds that services working to prevent HIV infections were particularly likely to be donor-funded and are among the hardest hit – with resources limited, treatment for existing patients has been prioritised. In Burundi, for example, the number of people receiving preventive HIV medicines fell by 64%.View image in fullscreenUNAids’ Winnie Byanyima. ‘What we need now is political courage,’ she said.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesA separate series ofcountry-level reports from the British charity Frontline Aids, covering Angola, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe, highlights similar issues.The full figures will take time to collate, but in some places there are already signs that new HIV cases, or Aids-related deaths, are rising after years of heading downwards.Many of the gains in the fight against HIV in recent years have come via the recognition that some groups of people are at higher risk of infection – known as “key populations”. They include men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, sex workers, transgender people, and prison inmates.In each case, offering services specifically designed around those groups’ needs has borne fruit – for example, LGBTQ+ friendly walk-in clinics can mean access to care for people who are stay away from public clinics due to the stigma around HIV.Many of those clinics and other outreach services have closed, along with swathes of community-led organisations, previously reliant on donor funding. One member of the LGBTQ+ community in Uganda, quoted in the Frontline Aids country report, said the loss of safe spaces had left them “isolated and exposed […] the mental strain is overwhelming”.View image in fullscreenAn HIV clinic in Kampala. The loss of community-led organisations in Uganda due to aid cuts has left many LGBTQ+ patients feeling ‘isolated and exposed’.Photograph: Hajarah Nalwadda/GettyIn sub-Saharan Africa, teenage girls and young women are disproportionately affected by HIV, but programmes designed specifically for them are another common casualty of the cuts.InKenya, activists report that people who can do so are hiding the fact they belong to a key population so as to access care in public clinics safely. They fear this will mean a loss of information on where and how the virus is spreading.John Plastow, executive director at Frontline Aids, said: “We are already seeing progress slip backwards.”Control of HIV, TB and malaria at risk after global health fund donations fallRead moreBut Plastow also saw the potential for a reset of health policies. “In several countries,” he said, “we are seeing the first signs of governments and communities working together to build more sustainable, homegrown HIV responses.”UNAids also pointed to signs of hope, with countries including Nigeria, Uganda, Côte d’Ivoire, South Africa and Tanzania all pledging to increase domestic investment.And, they said, innovations such asnew long-acting injectable drugsto prevent infection were “gaining momentum”.“We know what works – we have the science, tools and proven strategies,” said Byanyima. “What we need now is political courage: investing in communities, in prevention, in innovation and in protecting human rights as the path to end Aids.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal healthAid cutsAidAids and HIVUSAIDAfricaKenyaBurundianalysisShareReuse this content"

We do not want a slave’s peace, nor the peace of colonies!” Maduro said at a rally in Caracas.Despite the leaked claim that Trump had given Maduro an ultimatum, many observers are sceptical the US president intends to back his threats up with large-scale military action.“Maduro and most of his cohorts view the US military threats as a bluff,” a source with regular contact with top Venezuela officialstold the Wall Street Journallast month.Since his election in 2013, the Venezuelan leader has survived a succession of crises, including Trump’s first-term “maximum pressure” campaign, several rounds of mass protests, a historic economic meltdown,a 2018 assassination attemptand apparent defeat in last year’s presidential election, which Maduro is widely believed to have lost to the former diplomat Edmundo González.On Sunday, the Wall Street Journal urged Trump’s administration to continue ramping up the pressure on Venezuela and said it believed “deposing Maduro is in the US national interest”. Its editorial board said: “If Maduro refuses to leave, and Trump shrinks from acting to depose him, Trump and the credibility of the US will be the losers.”In an attempt to find a peaceful solution, Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, offered the Colombian city of Cartagena as a possible location for talks between Maduro’s regime and Venezuela’s opposition.In a letter to Opec published by Venezuelan state media on Sunday, Maduro accused the US of seeking to “appropriate Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – the largest on the planet – through the lethal use of military force”.Explore more on these topicsNicolás MaduroVenezuelaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, Mexican authorities raided multiple locations controlled by the duo and seized more than 1.65 tons of the drug – the largest seizure of fentanyl in the world.In May, the US Department of Justicecharged the father and sonwith narco-terrorism in connection with trafficking “massive” amounts of fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin into the US. They were also charged with money laundering.The indictment for narco-terrorism was “the first in the nation,” according to the US attorney’s office for the southern district of California.US authorities claimed that “together the father and son lead one of the largest and most sophisticated fentanyl production networks in the world,” and had “trafficked tens of thousands of kilograms of fentanyl into the United States.”Coronel and Noriega were key leaders of the Beltran Leyva Organization, a once powerful and violent faction of the Sinaloa Cartel that isnow believed defunct, although its splinter groups continue to operate across Mexico.According to Mexican media, Coronel was the righthand man of Fausto Isidro Meza Flores, alias “El Chapo Isidro”, leader of the Guasave Cartel, a splinter group of the Beltrán Leyva Organization. In February, Meza-Floreswas addedto the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitive List.During the operation on Sunday, Mexican authorities located several drug laboratories where they seized weapons, vehicles, drugs, and chemical precursors.Ronald Johnson, the US ambassador to Mexico, celebrated the operation and said in a post on X that Coronel was accused of multiple crimes, including “murders, kidnappings, torture, and violent debt collection for drug trafficking.”“These results reflect what our nations can achieve when they work together against those who pose a threat to our citizens,” Johnson wrote.Explore more on these topicsMexicoFentanylAmericasDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

Not only had Hernández helped turn Honduras into a major transit point for South American cocaine heading to the US, but Vigil said he had also transformed it intoa cocaine producing hubwhich was nowhome to coca plantations and makeshift labs for processing coca leaves.“When you take a look at Pablo Escobar and [Joaquín] ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán, they were big drug traffickers – but they were never presidents of a country,” Vigil added.“So ifDonald Trumpis giving this guy a pardon, why is he not giving [the also incarcerated Mexican cartel boss] Chapo Guzmán a pardon? El ​Chapo Guzmán is less of a figure in the drug world than Juan Orlando Hernández was.”Ioan Grillo, the author of a trio of books on Latin America’s narco underworld, was also puzzled byTrump’s “jaw-dropping” offer. “It’s crazy … it really undermines his hard-line ‘war on drugs’ position,” Grillo said, wondering if Trump might rethink his move given the outcry.US prosecutors alleged that even before taking power Hernández had started conspiring with Latin American narco bosses who have long used the Central American country as a trampoline to smuggle drugs into the US. Jurors agreed and, in July 2024, Hernández was sentenced to more than four decades in prison “for cocaine importation and related weapons offenses”. His younger brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández,was sentenced to life in prisonin 2021. Among his crimes was accepting $1m from El Chapo “to support Juan Orlando Hernández’s presidential campaign”.Vigil believed Hernández was responsible for helping move billions of dollars worth of cocaine into the US – far more than the fast boats Trump’s “kinetic strikes” have destroyed in the Caribbean and Pacific since September.“He’s killed approximately 80 people, destroyed approximately 20 boats, and he has not provided any concrete evidence that they were carrying drugs,” said Vigil, who believed many of those killed on the fast boats were impoverished fishers who, in some cases, might have earned $200-a-month for transporting drugs.Meanwhile, despite Trump’s claims that Maduro is the leader of a narco organization called the “Cartel of the Suns”, many experts doubt such a group even exists.“Maduro is not a saint,” said Vigil, noting how he and several allies were indicted for trafficking cocaine in the US in 2020. “[But] they’re not a cartel, they don’t have an infrastructure,” he added, calling such allegations a “nonsense”.Orlando Pérez, a Latin America expert from the University of North Texas at Dallas, said Trump’s double standards on which drug smuggling presidents to pursue revealed there was no consistent strategy to fight the region’s drug traffickers. “It’s all ad hoc and based on political considerations,” he said.“One [Hernández] is a right-wing supporter of the US – and the other [Maduro] is not,” Pérez added. “It is ideological. It is political. It is self-interested in terms of advancing an ideological agenda – and it has nothing to do with effective anti-drug policies.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I’m going to fight the gangs!” said Réné Charles, who survived the attack. “We’ve got to stand up and fight!”The crowd tried to break into the mayor’s office with one unidentified man telling the Associated Press that they weren’t going to rely on the government any longer: “We’re going to take justice into our own hands!”Charlesma Jean Marcos, a political activist, said the gang announced last week that they were going to invade the area, and that they alerted authorities to no avail.“For now, the only people really fighting (the gang) is the self-defense group,” he said. “A country cannot run like this.”Marcos urged all the survivors sleeping on the street and in public parks to instead sleep inside police stations and government offices until the government can take back Artibonite.“A lot of people are going to be hungry,” he warned. “We can support you today, we can support you tomorrow, but we won’t be able to support you forever.”More than half of Haiti’s population is already experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse, with gangs blocking main roads and the ongoing violence displacing a record 1.4 million people.The attacks in central Haiti began late Friday and late Saturday, with gang members broadcasting them live on social media.The attacks were blamed on the Gran Grif gang, which operates in the area and was responsible foran attack on Pont-Sondé in October 2024 that killed at least 100 people, one of the biggest massacres in Haiti’s recent history.“I heard heavy shooting, so much shooting,” said one man who said he was stuck inside his house all weekend. “Why don’t they send any drones to Artibonite? They just use the drones in Port-au-Prince. I feel this gang is special. They don’t want to destroy this gang.”A spokesperson for Haiti’s national police did not immediately return a message seeking comment.Gran Grif is considered one of Haiti’s cruelest gangs. Its leader, Luckson Elan, recently was sanctioned by the UN security council and the US government. Also sanctioned was Prophane Victor, a former legislator that the UN accused of arming young men in the Artibonite region.‘The ground shook’: drone attacks help Haitian government wrest control of capital from criminal gangsRead moreThe UN has said killings have risen dramatically in Haiti’s Artibonite and Centre departments this year, with 1,303 victims reported from January to August, compared with 419 during the same period in 2024.“These assaults underscore the capacity of gangs to consolidate control across a corridor from the Centre to the Artibonite amid limited law enforcement presence and logistical constraints,” a recent UN report stated.Explore more on these topicsHaitiAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Some shops and offices began to reopen, though the full extent of the damage remained unclear.In Ma Oya, north of the capital, Hasitha Wijewardena said he was struggling to clean up after the floods. “The water has gone down, but the house is now full of mud,” he told local reporters, appealing for military assistance.0:53'Everything is underwater': Sri Lanka floods displace families – videoSri Lanka’s president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who declared a state of emergency to deal with the disaster, vowed to build back. “We are facing the largest and most challenging natural disaster in our history,” he said in an address to the country. “Certainly, we will build a better nation than what existed before.”The losses and damage are the worst in Sri Lanka since the devastating 2004 Asian tsunami that killed about 31,000 people and left more than 1 million homeless.Rain had subsided across Sri Lanka but low-lying areas of the capital were flooded and authorities were bracing for a major relief operation.Military helicopters have been deployed to airlift stranded people and deliver food, though one crashed north of Colombo on Sunday evening.View image in fullscreenRescue personnel evacuate people on boats belonging to Sri Lanka’s army on a flooded street in Wellampitiya on the outskirts of Colombo on Sunday.Photograph: Ishara S Kodikara/AFP/Getty ImagesSelvi, 46, who lives in the Colombo suburb of Wennawatte, left her flooded home on Sunday carrying four bags of clothes and valuables. “My house is completely flooded.

Teaching had been postponed as some schools were being used as emergency shelters, it added.Human-caused climate breakdown has increased the occurrence of the most intense and destructive tropical cyclones, though the overall number of storms per year has not changed globally. This is because warming oceans provide more energy, producing stronger storms. Extreme rainfall from tropical cyclones has increased substantially, as warmer air holds more water vapour.Explore more on these topicsAsia PacificIndonesiaThailandSri LankaMalaysiaFloodingSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The death toll rose to 151 and is expected to rise further as the search continues. About 40 people are still missing.The estate, home to almost 5,000 people, had been undergoing extensive renovations that have been linked to the fire’s cause. In the aftermath,angerhas grown over alleged past safety violations by the construction company working at the site and lax enforcement of standards, fuelled by revelations that residents had been complaining about the renovations for a year.On Monday afternoon, officials said anti-corruption authorities had arrested 13 people over the disaster so far, including the directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company, and had “immediately begun comprehensive investigation along the lines of manslaughter”.View image in fullscreenMembers of the disaster victim identification unit work in an apartment at Wang Fuk Court.Photograph: APHong Kong’s chief secretary, Eric Chan, said seven of 20 tested samples of the mesh netting used in scaffolding around the towers did not meet fire-retardant standards. Initial testing found samples were up to code, but Chan said the cheaper, noncompliant netting had been put in areas difficult to access in order to evade detection, describing it as a “shameful act”.“They just wanted to make money at the expense of people’s lives,” he said.As allegations of safety violations grow, alongside revelations that government authorities had issued multiple apparently unenforced warnings, residents have asked why no officials have yet faced consequences. Instead, two civilians were reportedly arrested by national security police.Miles Kwan, a Hong Kong student, was arrested on Saturday over an online petition that made “four demands” for guaranteed support of the victims and accountability for those at fault, including any corrupt or culpable government officials.View image in fullscreenMiles Kwan is driven away from a police station following his detention on Monday.Photograph: Lam Yik/ReutersLocal media said Kwan was arrested for “seditious intention”. Police did not confirm the arrest, saying only that they “will take actions according to actual circumstances and in accordance with the law”.Kwan was seen leaving a police station on Monday afternoon, Agence France-Presse reported.Local media also reported the arrest of Kenneth Cheung, a former district councillor, on Sunday evening.Anger mounts in Hong Kong over apartment fires as Beijing warns against ‘anti-China disruptors’Read moreAsked on Monday about the arrests, the secretary of security, Chris Tang, said only there had been “inaccurate comments online” that were intended to threaten national security. “Therefore, we must take appropriate measures, including law enforcement measures,” Tang told the press conference. “Operational details cannot be disclosed as they involve national security.”On Hong Kong social media, people criticised the arrests of civilians. “National security must be prioritised even if the dead are still buried in the building,” said one.Some commenters drew comparisons to mainlandChina. “The mainland calls these crimes ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’,” said one commenter. “It’s usually punished with heavy sentences. Stability trumps everything.”Another said: “Now that we are aligning with mainland China’s approach, by dealing with the person who raises the question, no one will dare to ask questions, and thus Hong Kong’s governance will have no problems.”View image in fullscreenPosters for missing pets placed near the scene of the fire.Photograph: Lam Yik/ReutersThe arrests followed warnings by national security authorities that they would crack down on anyone deemed to be using the incident to incite “anti-China” sentiment.Before the arrests, authorities had already begun showing heightened sensitivity to the community response in Tai Po. Since the 2019 protests were quelled, civilian gatherings have been tightly controlled or prevented in Hong Kong. On Thursday and Fridaythe Guardian witnessedthe rapid establishment of volunteer supporters using skills not seen at this scale since the protests, with hundreds of people using cars and public transport to bring in mountains of clothes, food and other essentials for the victims. The Guardian did not see any sign of political activism.However, by evening, armed police were patrolling the area, and government officials soon took over from volunteer organisers.The petition over which Kwan was allegedly arrested was launched late on Friday. Its “four demands” echoed the language of the protest movement’s “five demands” for democratic progress, but did not call for political change.Kwan told media on Friday that he was only “proposing very basic demands”.“If these ideas are deemed seditious or ’crossing the line’, then I feel I can’t predict the consequences of anything any more, and I can only do what I truly believe,” he said.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang and agenciesExplore more on these topicsHong Kong apartment firesHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

New rules, if put forward, would limit that to 250 watts.Ebikes cluttering Sydney footpaths to be swept aside by new bill – but riders may bear brunt of levyRead more“We spent a lot of time on the road in my job, and we see some kids on bikes that are more like motorbikes,” the premier said. “They can go as fast as a car, and as a result, people can get hurt.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“It means the highest limit you can travel at is currently 50 to 60km an hour. That’ll be reduced [under proposed new rules] to 25 to 30km/h.”Minns said he expects the change could be done by regulation, not legislation, in the coming months.“We do need to make a change and we want to do it,” he said.An ebike rider died around 6am on Tuesday in Ultimo in innerSydneyafter a collision with a garbage truck, NSW police said.View image in fullscreenPolice and forensics officers photograph the garbage truck at the scene of the fatal ebike accident in Ultimo on Tuesday.Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAPThe rider, a man in his 30s, was treated by paramedics at the scene, but died.

Labor said it will prioritise expertise, diversity and probity in the new system.Commissioned by Labor after winning the 2022 election, Briggs found broad dissatisfaction with the processes used by government departments and ministers in making appointments to about 200 boards, warning of concern about the state of institutions, publicly owned businesses and agencies. The review’s terms of reference stopped Briggs from considering “current appointments or appointment processes related to specific individuals.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWhen the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, announced the review in February 2023 she said it would “be about putting an end to the jobs for mates culture”.Handed to Labor in August 2023, the report says politicisation and short-term decision making has reduced confidence in government and fed into a climate of public disquiet about the integrity of institutions.Briggs warned average people believe all direct appointments by ministers are politically motivated, stating that there are currently not enough checks and balances to enable ministers to balance autonomy with accountability.The report found frequent practice in recent years has been for governments to appoint “friends” to board positions, to reward loyalty or promote political priorities. She said “all too often these appointments have looked like forms of patronage and nepotism that should have no place in the modern Australian society”.The report recommends independent and competitive recruitment practices be put in place, with new legislation and consistent rules. It calls for wider pools of potential candidates with expertise, with thorough reviews for merit and public service-style practices to depoliticise decisions.Briggs said all board appointments should be for a standard four-year term, with individuals barred from serving on more than two paid boards at any time.Critically she recommended ex-politicians and staffers be barred from government board appointments for six months after leaving government, extending to 18 months for former ministers and their staff.Appointments should not be allowed for six months before the last possible date for a federal election, unless a strict process has been followed, stopping “last minute bequests”.Briggs said these appointments often see staffers, former politicians, their supporters and friends appointed immediately before elections, “with seemingly little regard for the consequences”.“Such bequests in the dying days of a government are shameless; are widely frowned upon by the public; and bring governments into disrepute,” the report said.But Labor won’t take up many of the recommendations, instead opting for a major overhaul of a government-wide framework for ensuring appropriate appointments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said it follows instances where people born with variations in sex characteristics have experienced harm and trauma through inappropriate and unnecessary medical interventions.“Every person deserves the right to make decisions about their own body, with respect, dignity and safety at the heart of the care they receive,” Thomas said.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“This is an important step forward for people born with variations in sex characteristics and their families – who for too long have not had the fair and proper legal recognition of their rights.”The legislation will not affect urgent interventions needed to save a life or prevent serious harm. But under the changes, all other procedures and treatments would be reviewed by a new independent oversight panel.‘I don’t want anyone to suffer like I did’: the intersex campaigners fighting to limit surgery on childrenRead moreIf the panel recommends treatment, parents must consent on behalf of a child who cannot, while children judged capable of making their own medical decisions can consent themselves.The process is designed to ensure families receive accurate information, understand treatment options, and have access to peer and psychosocial support when making decisions.The need for the reform was underscored by an Equality Australiareport released on Monday, which found infants and children were being subjected to irreversible procedures – including clitoral reduction and the removal of healthy gonads – for non-medical reasons.The report, compiled from more than 240 documents released by major public hospitals under freedom of information laws, was only able to scrutinise 83 cases due to redactions.Nearly half of the cases (47%), from Sydney and Brisbane between 2018 and 2023, involved cosmetic preferences, such as making genitals appear more “typical”. Other non-medical drivers included a desire to align the child with the gender assigned at birth (16.9%) and responding to parental distress or confusion (62.7%).The report warned such procedures can have long-term consequences, including loss of sexual or reproductive function, urinary tract issues, ongoing or repeat surgeries and negative self-image.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They join a few countries globally – such as Malta, Germany, Greece, Spain and Portugal – that have similar laws.Explore more on these topicsVictorian politicsVictoriaHealthSexual healthSexualityChild protectionGendernewsShareReuse this content"

The lack of an agreement caps the value of any weapons or parts that UK-based firms will be able to contribute to any given project at 35%.Keir Starmer told a press conference in London on Monday that “we do need to get closer” to the EU. The UK prime minister said: “It is clear from all of the analysis that the [Brexit] deal that we’ve got has hurt our economy. That’s why we’ve rebuilt relations and reset relations with the EU and I’m proud that we’ve done that. That is why we’re moving forward.”He said he was “crystal clear” there was no credible economic future for Britain that did not involve open trade. “So for economic renewal, we have to keep reducing frictions. We have to keep moving towards a closer relationship with the EU, and we have to be grown up about that, to accept that this will require trade-offs.”Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to the UK, said: “The EU is also seeking a closer relationship with the UK. In today’s challenging times forEurope, this is what our citizens expect. Europe’s prosperity, security and democracy are closely interlinked. Stronger relations between the EU and the UK will bring a stronger Europe.”UK officials say talks overa food standards deal, a joint carbon emissions scheme and the youth mobility scheme have been slow to get going in part because it took longer than expected for the EU to agree its mandate for negotiations.Talks on food standards and carbon emissions began in mid-November – six months later than planned – with Starmer’s foreign policy adviser, Michael Ellam, leading from the UK side. Talks on youth mobility began in September.UK officials believe agreements in these areas can be reached quickly, and will not be subject to the kind of impediments that scuppered recent talks on a shared defence fund, since they face less resistance from European corporations.One question on food standards will be whether France demands that the Labour government drops its promise toban the commercial import of foie gras.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It included granting Moscow territories in eastern Ukraine it did not yet control, while forcing Kyiv to cap the size of its army and abandon its ambition to join Nato. While the plan has since been changed, Ukraine’s European allies remain concerned about any plan that could enshrine the forced change of borders andfail to punish war crimes.The Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on a diplomatic push to rally support from European allies, on Monday said Russia must not be rewarded for its invasion. “We also need to ensure that Russia itself does not perceive anything it could consider as a reward for this war,” he said a joint press conference with the French president, Emmanuel Macron.The Ukrainian leader held calls with a dozen other leaders, including the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz.Zelenskyy said talks with the French president had lasted several hours and the main focus was on negotiations to end the war and on security guarantees. “Peace must become truly durable. The war must end as soon as possible,” he wrote on X.From Paris the pair also spoke to Witkoff and Rustem Umerov, the head of the Ukrainian delegation during talks with the US.Macron said that only Ukraine could decide on its territories in peace negotiations with Russia and that Europeans must be at the negotiating table to ensure security guarantees for Ukraine.Merz, speaking alongside the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, after his call with Zelenskyy, said there must be “no dictated peace” in Ukraine and that Kyiv and its European allies must be involved in any deal to end the war.“We have a clear course of action: no decision on Ukraine and Europe without Ukrainians and without Europeans,” he said.Kallas, who said the push to end the war in Ukraine could be entering a “pivotal week” warned that allowingRussiato change borders by force would set a dangerous precedent for the whole world.Earlier in the day she had describedweekend talksheld in Florida between the US and Ukraine as “difficult but productive”. Asked whether she trusted the US to find a good solution for Ukraine, she said: “Ukrainians are there alone. If they would be together with the Europeans, they would definitely be much stronger but I trust that Ukrainians stand up for themselves.”Zelenskyiy suggested that Ukrainian and US negotiators had not yet fully hammered out revisions to the proposed US plan. He said on Monday there were “some tough issues that still have to be worked through”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Putin’s spokesperson did not specify whether Kushner, who played an active role in negotiations over the Gaza peace deal, would also attend the meeting with the Russian president.The two trusted Trump envoys participated in the weekend talks between senior Ukrainian and US officials that took place in Florida at a private golf club developed by Witkoff’s company.After the meeting, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, expressed optimism for an end to the war. “There’s more work to be done. This is delicate,” Rubio said. “There are a lot of moving parts, and obviously there’s another party involved here … that will have to be a part of the equation, and that will continue later this week, when Mr Witkoff travels to Moscow.”Ukraine’s president is under pressure after thesudden resignation of his head of cabinet and closest adviser, Andriy Yermak, in response to a widening anti-corruption investigation that has become the most serious scandal of Zelenskyy’s presidency.The Ukrainian leader is meanwhile expected to make his first official visit to Ireland on Tuesday, while his defence minister, Denys Shmyhal, was in Brussels on Monday for talks with his EU counterparts.Shmyhal said he had informed defence ministers about “the most urgent needs of our soldiers” primarily in air defences. He welcomed an announcement from the Netherlands that it would contribute another €250m to the Nato initiative to buy weapons and ammunition for Ukraine from the United States.The flurry of diplomatic activity came as a studyshowed that Russia made its biggest advances in Ukraine for a yearin November. The Russian army captured 701 sq km (270 sq miles), the second-largest territorial advance of the war after November 2024 according to an AFP analysis ofdata from the US-based Institute for the Study of War. The study excluded the initial months of the war when the frontline was highly mobile.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropean UnionTrump administrationUS foreign policyJared KushnerVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

I was repeatedly kicked in the head, ribs, hips and thighs. They shouted insults at us in Arabic and told us we had no right to be there. They smashed the interior of the house and destroyed the solar batteries before leaving.”The woman, who did not want her name published for safety reasons, added: “This is not about us. We were beaten for 15 minutes. Palestinians here endure this violence every day, every hour, a thousand-fold.”The pace and intensity of attacks in Ein al-Duyuk have increased substantially over the past two months since the establishment of a settler outpost nearby and the arrival of young and aggressive settlers.Activists say that violent incidents have become an almost daily occurrence. Attacks have included settler mobs breaking into homes and beating villagers, stealing 200 sheep, two cars and destroying solar panels.While all settlements on occupied territory are illegal under international law, irregular outposts are illegal under Israeli law. Ein al-Duyuk is in Area A of theWest Bank, which means it is meant to be administered by the Palestinian Authority and illegal for Israelis to enter.‘They have total impunity’: West Bank settler violence surges after Gaza ceasefireRead moreThe Canadian foreign ministry said it “strongly condemns the violent acts committed by extremist settlers and opposes any actions or talk about annexation of the Palestinian territories”.The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told reporters: “We have had enough of this aggression. This is not the way [for the settlers] to assert their rights.”The Israeli authorities in the West Bank have been approached for comment. Villagers and activists say there has been no meaningful police intervention to stop the attacks or dismantle the outpost. Leading members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition actively support West Bank settlers.According to UN figures, Israeli settlers and security forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians, including 233 children, in the West Bank over the past two years, in what many Israeli and Palestinian observers believe is a concerted campaign of violence aimed at seizing territory.Manal Tamimi, a Palestinian activistin the organisation Faz3a, which recruits foreign volunteers to help protect Palestinian villages in the West Bank, said: “In the two months since they built a new outpost near the village, they have brought in far-right wing settlers, who are very violent and seem to belong to an organised group, because they attacked the volunteers in a really organised way.“The people there are very resilient and they refuse to leave the area. That’s why it’s very important to put international volunteers with them.”The Canadian volunteer said that, despite the attack and her injury, she felt the presence of volunteers in Ein al-Duyuk had been valuable.“The villagers stood taller while we were present,” she said. “The children played freely. People slept through the night. That alone made our presence worthwhile.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Temperatures will widely be 10C (18F)below normal across much of the midwest and eastern areas this week.The severe disruption to Thanksgiving travel in parts of the Great Lakes region has been due to “lake effect” snow, where cold air from Canada blows over the comparatively warmer Great Lakes, which results in the movement of moisture upwards through the atmosphere to produce bands of clouds that produce heavy snowfall downwind. The effect is most pronounced in states such as Ohio, New York, Illinois and Michigan.This article was amended on 1 December 2025.

Christian pilgrims spilled out of buses, while observant Jewish worshippers gathered outside the gate to the Western Wall.New flags now fly a few metres from Rajabi’s home. Blue and white and bearing the Star of David, they mark where residentswere evicted recentlyfrom their homes by Israeli police. After more than 20 years of activism, Rajabi knows his days in Batn al-Hawa, a predominantly Palestinian neighbourhood less than a mile south of the Old City, are almost certainly numbered.View image in fullscreenZohair Rajabi and one of his grandchildren, sitting in their home in Batn al-Hawa.Photograph: Amnon Gutman/The Guardian“Yes I have lost. I have been defeated. I am not only waiting for my home to be taken but for every home here to be taken,” the 55-year-old said.Rajabi has lived in Batn al-Hawa all his life. His home is a rambling four-storey house built on land bought by his grandfather in 1965. His brothers and mother live on different floors, with many children. Two of his relatives are severely disabled. All will have to move if Rajabi’s request to make a final legal appeal to Israeli courts is rejected, as all in Batn al-Hawa expect.“We know what the decision will be … but we are going to fight anyway. I think within the month all 52 of us will have to find somewhere else to live,” he said.View image in fullscreenA view of the street outside the Rajabi family home.Photograph: Amnon Gutman/The GuardianBatn al-Hawa has long been the target of rightwing Israeli organisations working to consolidate Israeli control of parts of Jerusalem seized after the defeat of Jordan in the 1967 war.One such organisation isAteret Cohanim, which describes itself as “the leading urban land reclamation organisation in Jerusalem … working for over 40 years to restore Jewish life in the heart of ancient Jerusalem”.The group argues that much of Batn al-Hawa lies on the site of a village constructed by a philanthropic trust under Ottoman rule in the late 19th century to house poor Yemeni Jews. The community was evacuated by British authorities when tensions rose between Arabs and Jews inPalestinein the 1930s and its inhabitants were told they would be able to return when calm was restored, but never did.View image in fullscreenAn overview of Batn al-Hawa.Photograph: Amnon Gutman/The GuardianLawyers acting for the trust, which was reactivated almost 20 years ago, have successfully argued in Israeli courts that its prior ownership of the properties in Batn al-Hawa should take precedence over any later purchases made by current inhabitants or their parents or grandparents. A 1970 law gives Jewish people the right to reclaim property in East Jerusalem.Possession by the trust of some buildings has also been obtained through deals with their owners, though the circumstances of these remains controversial.Daniel Luria, a spokesperson for Ateret Cohanim, said the organisation, which has placed almost 40 Jewish families in Batn al-Hawa, was independent of the trust but had ties with it.View image in fullscreenPalestinian young people playing at the Madaa Creative Centre in Batn al-Hawa.Photograph: Amnon Gutman/The GuardianIn recent months, a sudden spate of evictions has followed a series of decisions by Israeli judges.Ir Amim, a Jerusalem-based NGO active in Batn al-Hawa, said Rajabi and his family were among 34 families, numbering some 175 people, who face “imminent displacement and settler takeover of their homes.”Map of Jerusalem and surrounding areaIf carried out, this could lead to “the largest expulsion and coordinated state and settler takeover of a Palestinian neighbourhood in occupied East Jerusalem since 1967,” said Amy Cohen, a spokesperson for Ir Amim.Luria compared the current resistance to eviction of residents in Batn al-Hawa, which he calls Shiloah, to “Custer’s last stand”.“I sympathise but … they are illegal squatters in properties from which Jews were driven out in the 1930s,” he said.Rajabi blames the recent spate of evictions on the war in Gaza. “The war is a big factor. If there was no war, maybe you would see only one eviction every 10 years instead of five in 15 months. The war has created an atmosphere where you can push this through …. An atmosphere of hate,” he said.View image in fullscreenZohair Rajabi looks down over Jerusalem from his roof.Photograph: Amnon Gutman/The GuardianIsrael’s ruling coalition, the most rightwing government in its history, includes extremist ministers deeply committed to the project of expanding Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem, which Israel has unilaterally annexed, as well as in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.About 40% of Jerusalem’s population ofroughly 1 millionis Palestinian. Maintaining a Jewish majority in the city has been an aim of successive Israeli governments.In September, Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s finance minister, said Israel should annex 82% of the occupied West Bank.Luria said he supported Smotrich’s proposal “one thousand percent”. “When the Jews came back in 1948, it didn’t stop there, or in 1967 … the Zionist dream is not over,” he said.Rajabi is unsure where he and his family will go if evicted. Three of his four children are teenagers and finding a home for them all will be difficult, he said, adding: “The government and the settlers want us out of Jerusalem.”On the walls of Rajabi’s house is a painting of al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in Islam and located on the Haram al-Sharif compound, which is known as the Temple Mount to Jews and is the most sacred currently accessible prayer site in Judaism.Dahreen, Rajabi’s 15-year-old daughter, said the prospect of leaving her home saddened her: “Every stone here is a memory for me. I am very worried that we will be split up as a family and I will be away from my friends. But I’m taking my cat with me whatever happens.”Explore more on these topicsPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

India’s telecoms ministry also did not respond.A 14- to 17-digit number unique to each handset, the IMEI, or International Mobile Equipment Identity, is most commonly used to cut off network access for phones reported to have been stolen.The Sanchar Saathi app is mainly designed to help users block and track lost or stolen smartphones across all telecom networks, using a central registry. It also lets them identify, and disconnect, fraudulent mobile connections.With more than 5m downloads since its launch, the app has helped block more than 3.7m stolen or lost mobile phones, while more than 30m fraudulent connections have also been terminated.The government says the software helps prevent cyberthreats and assists tracking and blocking of lost or stolen phones, helping police to trace devices, while keeping counterfeits out of the black market.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The Labour party said it did not recognise the corruption judgment against Siddiq because she was denied the opportunity to a fair legal process in the case.Siddiq had denied the charges, claiming that much of the evidence being presented by prosecutors was forged. She had been put on trial as a Bangladeshi citizen, with a passport and tax ID, even though she said she had not held a Bangladeshi passport since childhood and had never paid taxes there.During the trial, the prosecutor, Khan Mohammed Mainul Hasan, alleged that Siddiq had called and messaged top aides in Hasina’s office and visited Dhaka personally to secure plots of land for members of her family in a suburb of the capital.The prosecutors did not present evidence of these messages but said the accounts of Siddiq’s communications had come from two witnesses who were officials working at the prime minister’s residence at the time.After the verdict, Siddiq told the Guardian she hoped it would be met with the “contempt it deserves”. She said: “This whole process has been flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end.“The outcome of this kangaroo court is as predictable as it is unjustified. I hope this so-called ‘verdict’ will be treated with the contempt it deserves. My focus has always been my constituents in Hampstead and Highgate and I refuse to be distracted by the dirty politics of Bangladesh.”Last week, agroup of leading Brtish lawyers, including a former Conservative justice secretary, told Bangladesh’s ambassador that the trial against Siddiq was “artificial, contrived and unfair”.Due to their absence, the accused in the case were denied access to defence lawyers and a lawyer who attempted to represent Siddiq and others alleged she was threatened and put under house arrest.Siddiq, a former treasury minister, claimed she had been caught up in a politically motivated attack on her aunt Hasina, whose 15-year rule of Bangladesh was marred with authoritarianism, corruption and human rights abuses.After Hasina was toppled from power in a popular uprising in August 2024, an interim government was appointed, led by the Nobel prize laureate Muhammad Yunus.A core mandate of the interim government was to bring Hasina and senior figures in her administration to justice for alleged corruption and human rights abuses that took place during her 15 years in power. There has been substantial public and political pressure for trials to proceed quickly.Last month, Bangladesh’s international crimes tribunal found Hasina guilty of crimes against humanity, for her role in the massacre of more than 1,000 people who took part in the anti-government protests last year that eventually led to her downfall. In a subsequent corruption trial last week, Hasina was given a further 21-year prison sentence on corruption charges.In a statement after Monday’s verdict, Hasina’s Awami League called the anti-corruption trials “a political mechanism used for political ends by desperate, unelected men”.Hasina has remained in exile in India since her fall from power last August and the country has yet to respond to extradition requests by Bangladesh for her to return to serve her sentence.During Hasina’s tenure, Siddiq was pictured several times with her aunt in Bangladesh though she later stated that all her visits were on a personal basis.In January, Siddiq stepped down as Treasury minister amid allegations that she had used properties linked to the Hasina regime. An inquiry later found she had broken no rules but stated it was “regrettable” Siddiq had not been more alert to the “potential reputational risks” of her ties to Hasina.After the verdict, a Labour spokesperson said: “The Labour party and all our elected representatives take the rule of law incredibly seriously and will always fulfil our legal responsibilities.“As has been reported, highly regarded senior legal professionals have highlighted that Tulip Siddiq has not had access to a fair legal process in this case and has never been informed of the details of the charges against her.“This is despite repeated requests made to the Bangladeshi authorities through her legal team.“Anyone facing any charge should always be afforded the right to make legal representations when allegations are made against them. Given that has not happened in this case, we cannot recognise this judgment.”Toby Cadman, a British barrister who has been advising the Bangladeshi authorities, said: “It is important to highlight that [Siddiq] was tried and convicted in accordance with Bangladesh law. The law was applied to her as it is to all persons who come before the Bangladesh courts without exception.“Allegations that her legal counsel was prevented from participating and was subjected to house arrest remain disputed and are not considered to be entirely accurate, particularly considering under Bangladesh law she was treated as a fugitive and not entitled to legal representation.“It would seem that it was her conscious decision to boycott the proceedings. Assertions that she was unaware of the charges against her are strongly contested, as she was afforded the opportunity to surrender to the court and address the allegations, with the right to appoint legal representation of her own choosing had she done so.”Redwan Ahmed contributed reporting from DhakaExplore more on these topicsTulip SiddiqBangladeshSouth and central AsiaLondonLabournewsShareReuse this content"

They will also be able to conduct searches inside someone’s mouth for a hidden sim card or small electronic device.Home Office sources confirmed that, if deemed clearly necessary and proportionate, children could also be subjected to these searches.Charities have raised concerns about the move and refugees have said they do not believe the Home Office will find any useful intelligence on the phones of new arrivals.One Syrian refugee said: “I never heard of any asylum seeker hiding a sim card in their mouth. When we crossed the Channel the smugglers told us to delete everything from our phones.“People with cheap phones just threw them in the sea while people who had decent phones left them with friends in northern France and asked them to mail them via DHL if they reached the UK safely. I think this is a show by Shabana [Mahmood].”Maddie Harris, of the Humans for Rights Network, which provides support to young asylum seekers, said: “People should be treated with dignity and respect, not as criminals subject to invasive searches and interrogatory questioning violating their privacy.“Most who arrive in small boats, particularly children, will be traumatised by horrific journeys characterised by violence. [The] Home Office should prioritise recovery over criminality.”Home Office officials say the mobile phone searches will enable them to collect intelligence on asylum seekers’ journeys and to arrest people-smugglers. Immigration, police and National Crime Agency (NCA) officers will be able to search migrants for phones at the border without arresting them, they said.The NCA and police investigators will also be able to use new interim serious crime prevention orders and take immediate action to ban suspects under investigation from using mobile phones, laptops and accessing social media.The new rules are part of the border security, asylum and immigration bill, which is expected to receive royal assent this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Officials said at the time that the purpose of the phone seizures was to obtain intelligence about smugglers.The minister for border security and asylum, Alex Norris, said: “Organised criminal networks rely on phone contacts and social media to recruit migrants for Channel crossings.“These new powers will allow law enforcement to seize illegal migrants’ phones before an arrest so we can gather intelligence and shut down these vile smuggling gangs before they attempt to risk more lives in these dangerous journeys.”Sile Reynolds, the head of asylum advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said: “Using invasive powers to search through the clothing – and even inside the mouths – of desperate and traumatised people when they have just survived a terrifying journey across the Channel is a dystopian act of brutality.“These new powers, which will be used indiscriminately against all those who arrive seeking safety by small boat, risk treating all refugees as a security threat.

Most of the heaviest snowfall is expected to end by Tuesday night, with conditions clearing by Wednesday.The heaviest snowfall is expected from the Poconos to easternMaine, which could receive five to 10in of snow between Monday night and Tuesday night. Areas of New England with higher elevation could see over a foot of snow.The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories inMassachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.It comes after many motorists and air travellers experienced significant disruption over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend from another winter storm over the midwest and Great Lakes region, with several large road crashes, hundreds of flights cancelled, and thousands more delayed.On Saturday, Chicago’s O’Hare airport recorded 8.4in of snow, setting a record for the city’s snowiest November day since records began. Dozens of flights remained cancelled or delayed there into Monday, and commuting conditions were expected to remain dangerous in some areas well into Monday night. There was also snow in parts of Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska.Meteorologist Andrew Orrison told the Associated Press that snow in the Great Lakes region was tapering off, but the new storm was heading to the mid-Atlantic and north-east, with “significant” snowfall by Tuesday.“It’s going to be the first snowfall of the season for many of these areas, and it’s going to be rather significant,” Orrison said. “The good news is that it does not look like the major cities at this point are going to be looking at any significant snowfall.”The warning for coastal Maine was issued for Tuesday morning until Wednesday morning, stating that residents “should delay all travel if possible” due to snow.Meanwhile, inNew Hampshire, the Department of Transportation on Sunday invited residents to submit names for its second annual name-a-plow competition.“Welcome to The Department of the Seven Snowplows, our winter twist on a classic tale. Hawthorne had gables. We have orange snowplows just waiting for the perfect name,” the department said on social media. Last winner’s top name was Ctrl-Salt-Delete.With plowable snow expected to coat large parts of Pennsylvania, crews began to treat lanes along the 565-mile Pennsylvania Turnpike system on Monday, the agency’s press secretary, Marissa Orbanek, told the AP. Vehicle restrictions on many interstates in the eastern half of the state would be imposed at 5am on Tuesday. “We really prepare for snow all year long,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherSnowNew YorkMaineNew HampshireMassachusettsVermontnewsShareReuse this content"

A new teaser released on Monday includes a clip of Combs from 10 September 2024, as the walls of his federal sex crimes case were closing in.“We’re losing,” he says in a hotel room, cell phone in hand, before he calls for “somebody that’ll work with us that has dealt in the dirtiest of dirty business”.Through a spokesperson, the disgraced music mogul now claims that footage, including “private moments, pre-indictment material from an unfinished project and conversations involving legal strategy”, was obtained unlawfully.“Today’s GMA teaser confirms that Netflix relied on stolen footage that was never authorized for release,” the statement reads. “As Netflix and CEO Ted Sarandos know, Mr Combs has been amassing footage since he was 19 to tell his own story, in his own way. It is fundamentally unfair, and illegal, for Netflix to misappropriate that work.“None of this was obtained from Sean Combs or his team, and its inclusion raises very serious questions about how this material was accessed and why Netflix chose to use it,” the statement added, claiming that Combs’s legal team had been in touch with Netflix.Combs’s response, in which he blamed the series on 50 Cent’s “personal vendetta” against him, comes hours after50 Centtouted the series on Good Morning America along with Alexandria Stapleton, the director. They did not discuss how they obtained the footage, though Stapleton assured the Hollywood Reporter that “the footage was obtained completely legally”.Asked if his involvement in the series stemmed from a longstanding, if formerly low-stakes, personal rivalry – 50 Cent released a diss track mocking Combs back in 2006 – the rapper demurred.“It’s not personal,” he said, offering a more noble intention: “If I didn’t say anything,” he said, the world might have thought “hip-hop is fine with his behaviors. There’s no one else being vocal.”In a statement announcing the series, Stapleton said the project offers “a mirror [reflecting us] as the public, and what we are saying when we put our celebrities on such a high pedestal. I hope [this documentary] is a wake up call for how we idolize people, and to understand that everybody is a human being.”After a frenzied federal trial over the summer that featured emotional testimony from Combs’s ex Cassie, detailing years of abuse, Combs was convicted on two lesser charges of transportation to engage in prostitution, for flying his girlfriends and male sex workers around the country to engage in drug-fueled sexual encounters. He was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have led to a life sentence.Combs was sentenced to four years and two months in prison in October. He is serving the sentence in New Jersey, and is set for release in May 2028, though he can earn sentence reductions through his participation in substance abuse treatment and other prison programs.

His behavior deteriorated so sharply that a community advocate reached out to a refugee organization for help, fearing he was becoming suicidal.They did not, however, see any indication that Lakanwal would commit violence against another person.Trump invites families of national guard members who were shot to White HouseRead moreSarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed in the shooting, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in critical condition. Lakanwal, 29, has been charged with first-degree murder. He was shot by another national guard member during the incident and is also hospitalized.In Afghanistan, Lakanwal worked in a special CIA-backed Afghan army unit known as a Zero Unit. He entered the US in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the chaotic US withdrawal. Many had worked alongside US troops and diplomats.He resettled in the US with his wife and their five sons, all under the age of 12, in Bellingham, Washington, but struggled to assimilate, according to the community member.The emails described a man who was unable to hold a steady job or commit to his English courses while he alternated between “periods of dark isolation and reckless travel”. Sometimes, he spent weeks in his “darkened room, not speaking to anyone, not even his wife or older kids”. At one point in 2023, the family faced eviction after months of not paying rent.In one email sent on 31 January 2024, a case worker said Lakanwal had “not been functional as a person, father and provider since March of last year, 03/2023”.The case worker, who supported many Afghan families and spoke to Lakanwal through an interpreter, described him as a very gracious host, chatty and charismatic to CBS News, adding that a severe turn in his personality was noticeable in 2024.A former Afghan commando told the outlet that Lakanwal was left deeply troubled by the death of a close friend and fellow Afghan commander in 2024, whom the former commando said had unsuccessfully sought asylum in the US.But then, there were also “interim” weeks where Lakanwal would try to make amends and “do the right things”, according to the emails, re-engaging with the Washington state department of social and health services as was mandated by the terms of his entry into the US.“But that has quickly evolved into ‘manic’ episodes for one or two weeks at a time, where he will take off in the family car, and drive nonstop,” the email stated. Once he went to Chicago, and another time to Arizona.DC to put national guard on joint patrols with local police after shootingsRead moreIn response to the two emails, the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) visited Bellingham a few weeks later in March 2024 and attempted to make contact with Lakanwal and his family, the AP reported.Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney in the District of Columbia, said last week that Lakanwal drove across the country from Bellingham, about 80 miles north of Seattle, to the country’s capital.“Rahmanullah was a man who was extremely proud and capable in the world he came from, who felt defeated in the world he came to,” the case worker told CBS News.Homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem, told NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday that Lakanwal was “radicalized since he’s been here in this country”.“We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we’re going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him,” she said, providing no further details.Explore more on these topicsWashington DCUS crimeGun crimeMental healthWest VirginiaUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

In addition to state-level charges, he faces a Manhattan federal court case.Thompson’s killing on the streets ofNew Yorktriggered an intense manhunt for the killer, but also sparked an outpouring of anger at the practices of the US for-profit healthcare industry. Since his arrest, Mangione has attracted some enthusiastic supporters, both online and at his court appearances.Luigi Mangione’s lawyers seek to bar possibility of death penalty in federal caseRead moreMangione entered the courtroom wearing a slate suit with awhite-and-red tattersall plaid shirt. When Mangione entered the room, he was cuffed, but the restraints were taken off shortly after he sat down.The Epstein commentary unfolded while an officer at the state correctional institution at Huntingdondescribed Mangione’s presence in lockup last December. Tomas Rivers, a British army veteran turned prison guard, said he was assigned to monitor Mangione.The superintendent of SCI Huntingdon had said Mangione was there, and not at a local jail, as a pre-trial arrestee would normally be held, “to ensure his security”, Rivers said.“I was told that the secretary of the Department of Corrections requested the move from Blair county jail to SCI Huntingdonbecause Huntingdonhas increased security capabilities,” he said. In the state prison, Mangione would be exposed to fewer inmates and fewer extortion threats – and there was less of a chance that staff might leak information to the media.“Luigi Mangione was under constant watch,” Rivers said. Asked what was the purpose of constant watch, Rivers said it was used for someone who is a threat to themselves. “There’s a paper trail of their behaviors and movements.”The corrections officer said he was told that Mangione had constant watch to prevent him from dying in custody like Epstein did.He and Mangione conversed at various times, including about their travels, including trips to Thailand and Vietnam. They also talked about books at some point.“We discussed Orwell, Huxley and Thoreau,” he said. Mangione told Rivers he liked those authors and recommended The Doors of Perception, Huxley’s work on psychedelics experimentation.Evidence presented during the proceeding alsoprovided insight into how Mangione attracted attention at the Pennsylvania McDonald’s where he was arrested. The revelation came during testimony from Emily States, a 911 coordinator in Blair county, Pennsylvania.Mangione’s legal team has repeatedly pushed for the exclusion of evidence gathered during his arrest at the Altoona McDonald’s on 9 December 2024. His lawyers have claimed that police, who came to the restaurant based on an anonymous tip, did not immediately apprise Mangione of his constitutional rights.States was asked about how emergency calls are recorded. The prosecution then played a call from the McDonald’s manager to 911.On the recording the manager told dispatch that there was a diner “some other customers were suspicious” of because, they said, he looked like the “CEO shooter”.“They’re just really upset,” the manager told 911. “I can’t approach him, ya know.”This manager said that he was sitting by the bathroom and was wearing a black jacket, tan beanie and blue medical mask.“I was like, I can’t really do anything,” the manager recounted of what she told patrons who flagged Mangione. The manager was pressed for a description but noted that he was wearing a medical mask.The manager said the only thing she could see was “his eyebrows” and provided otherwise general details on his appearance, saying he looked mid-weight but that it was hard to tell on account of his hoodie.The accused killer has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him. Mangione’s appearance comes just over two months after he landed a major legal victory in his state case.On 16 September judge Gregory Carro threw out the two top state charges against him – first-degree murder and second-degree murder, both of which prosecutors had contended were terrorism crimes. Carro said “the evidence put forth was legally insufficient” for those terrorism-related charges.Mangione still faces nine counts in his state case, including second-degree murder. The sentence for second-degree murder inNew Yorkspans from 25 years to life in prison.Mangione’s lawyers have argued that because he was not apprised of his rights, his statements to police should not be permitted in court. They also argue that evidence taken during his arrest should be barred, saying they conducted a “warrantless search” of Mangione’s backpack.More thantwo dozenwitnesses could testify at the proceedings that start this week, to answer questions about how his arrest unfolded and evidence collected. The potential witnesses include police involved in Mangione’s case.While there were fewer admirers in attendance than at past proceedings, and a seeming lack of date night-style attire that had become de rigueur among some supporters, they were as energized as ever.In the women’s restroom, Mangione’s supporters chatted among themselves about this proceeding. One, who sported a satiny sash emblazoned with “Luigi” in green, appeared to commiserate with another supporter about not being permitted to wear the prom-queen evoking accessory.Other accoutrements were more straightforward. One supporter wore a shirt stating: “11 minutes of missing body camera footage.”Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingUS crimeNew YorkGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

What will it leave of value once it pops?Mon 1 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 10.32 ESTShareThe California Gold Rush left an outsized imprint on America. Some 300,000 people flocked there from 1848 to 1855, from as far away as the Ottoman Empire. Prospectors massacred Indigenous people to take the gold from their lands in the Sierra Nevada mountains. And they boosted the economies of nearby states and faraway countries from whence they bought their supplies.Gold provided the motivation for California – a former Mexican territory then controlled by the US military – to become a state with laws of its own. And yet, few “49ers” as prospectors were known, struck it rich. It was the merchants selling prospectors food and shovels who made the money. One, a Bavarian immigrant named Levi Strauss who sold denim overalls to the gold bugs passing through San Francisco, may be the most remembered figure of his day.California is going through another investment rush these days. This time it’s centered in Silicon Valley. The pot of gold is more elusive but potentially much bigger: Artificial Intelligence. What this rush leaves in its wake will shape the long-term future of civilization – or maybe not?The question everyone seems to be asking is: is AI a bubble? Lots of peopleseem to think so, including Open AI’sSam Altmanand theBank of England. How else to explain Nvidia’s stock price, which more than doubled from April to November, based entirely on the expectation, nay hope, that AI will produce a super-intelligence that can do everything humans do but better.Nvidia– like Levi Strauss back in the day – is at least selling something: computer chips. The valuations of many of the other AI plays – likeOpen AIorAnthropic– are based largely on the dream.The big analytical challenge, however, is to figure out what kind of bubble this is. Is it the kind that will ravage the economy when it bursts? What will it leave of value once it pops?Bubbles all share one characteristic – besotted investors in pursuit of a dream. But they come in many flavors. Not 20 years ago, we suffered the housing bubble, when home prices rose to stratospheric heights and almost brought down the financial system as they crashed back to earth. Less than a decade earlier, it was the dot-com bubble that burst, when investors realized that Webvan, Pets.com and the like were not worth billions just because they used the Internet.A few years before that we witnessed the rise and collapse of the East Asian bubble – with ancillary bubblettes in Russia and Brazil – when money rushed into these emerging markets, freaked and rushed out. There was the Tequila Crisis, which pummeled the Mexican peso and its economy. And the Japanese bubble, when the value of the Nikkei 225 stock index tripled over four years before it fell by 60% over the next two and a half.Bubbles have plagued the world’s finances at least since the 17th century, when Dutch investors fell in and out of love with tulips. In the 18th century, French, Dutch and British investors produced what came to be known as the South Sea bubble by giving in to euphoria over the value of potential of new trade routes across the Atlantic.That bubble ended with an Act of the British Parliament “to Restrain the Extravagant and Unwarrantable Practice of Raising Money by Voluntary Subscription For Carrying on Projects Dangerous to the Trade and Subjects of the United Kingdom.” It came to be known as the Bubble Act.Virtually every new frontier opened up to investment has led to a speculative bubble. Investors have scrambled to tap into its promise only to overdo it and stampede in retreat. Economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff found that of the world’s 66 major economies, including developed nations and big developing countries, only Portugal, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands had avoided a banking crisis between 1945 and 2007. By the end of 2008 none of them were unscathed.So the most important question as one evaluates the frenzied AI investment landscape is not really whether it will pop or not, but what sort of legacy it will leave behind. Would the fallout include a hobbled financial system and an intractable, prolonged recession, as the bursting of the housing bubble left in its wake? Or is it more likely to look like the dot-com bubble, whose bursting produced a comparatively shallow economic downturn and ultimately gave the world the modern internet?As I pointed out inmy last columnabout AI, Gita Gopinath, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, calculated that a stock market crash equivalent to that which ended the dot-com boom would erase some $20tn in American household wealth and another $15tn abroad, enough to strangle consumer spending and induce a recession.But the economic pain would depend to a large extent on how the AI investment surge is being financed. One problem is that we don’t really know.The housing bubble was built from a boom in mortgage finance, as yield-seeking banks stuffed themselves with bonds built of bundles of mortgages to increasingly uncreditworthy borrowers. When the borrowers couldn’t pay, the boom left a forest of damaged balance sheets in its wake, from over-indebted households with no access to credit, to a banking system hobbled by worthless bonds. Financing froze. It took years for America’s credit-driven economy to recover.AI could produce a similar landscape. A critical determinant is how much debt is at stake. It wouldn’t be such a problem if the bubble were financed largely from the cash pile of Alphabet and Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. They might lose their shirt, but who cares. The worrying bit is that it seems they are increasingly relying on borrowing, which means the prospect of a bursting bubble would again put the financial system at risk.Big Tech has raised nearly $250bn in debt so far this year,according to Bloomberg, a record. Analysts atMorgan Stanley suggestthat debt will be needed to fill a $1.5tn funding gap to ramp up spending on data centers and hardware. Problematically, it is getting hard to follow the money, as Nvidia, Open AI and others in the ecosystem buy into each other, clouding who, in the end, will be left holding the bag.The other question is to what extent the AI that the Silicon Valley faithful are building will endure. Railways survived the 19th century railway bust. The Internet survived the dot-com implosion. Is there anything of sufficient value to justify the current moment of euphoria, even if it heads south for a time?Until a few weeks ago, I would have said sure: there must be something in Chat GPT or Claude that will raise business productivity. But to justify the vast quantities of money they are going to have to build something really impressive – as in superhuman general intelligence impressive. Over the last several weeks, a thought has bubbled up through the ecosystem that they won’t.It’s a thought built on the thoughts of techier minds than mine.Yann LeCun, until recently Meta’s chief scientist and a winner of the Turing Award, has been saying that the massive spend on Large Language Models that today define the AI space is misguided. Artificial General Intelligence – aka the Superhuman – can only come about by dropping LLMs – which are essentially massive correlation engines – and switching to something else called a world model architecture, where machines develop a “mental” model of the outside world.If he’s right, that would be one big oops for much of today’s AI spend. Nvidia and the rest of us may be about to learn, once again, that just because you sold a load of jeans and shovels, it doesn’t mean there is gold in them thar hills.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)US economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Patients stuck on crammed hospital corridors or unable to get an ambulance won’t forget it.”NHS leaders backed the government’s assessment that the “landmark” agreement will prove worthwhile because it will lead to tens of thousands of patients receiving groundbreaking new drugs.But they also warned that the NHS receives too little funding to absorb the costs involved and that budgets for care, services and treatment must not be raided.“It is not yet clear how it will be paid for. There is absolutely no slack in current published NHS spending plans for this major commitment and that is a real worry from trust leaders,” said Daniel Elkeles, the chief executive of hospitals group NHS Providers.Dr Andrew Hill, an expert on the drugs industry at the University of Liverpool, said the deal would see the NHS paying more money for the same amount of treatments. “Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has agreed to give drug companies 25% more for the same drugs we were already buying. NHS funding is limited, so if we have to pay higher drug prices, this means less money for doctors, nurses, ambulances [and] simple procedures which can save lives cheaply, using low-cost generic drugs,” he said.Ministers said the “milestone” deal would also help boost the pharmaceutical industry in the UK, which has recently paused or scrapped several major planned investments in protest at the government’s approach to drug pricing.They also hailed the fact that the £6.6bn a year of UK-made drugs exported to the US will now escape, at least for the next three years, the hugely punitive 100% tariffs Trump had threatened on medicines made outside America. He has pledged to lower the cost of drugs in America, which are the highest in the world, and force countries to pay more for US-made medicines.The deal will also see the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) increase the amount it is happy for the NHS to spend on potentially life-extending drugs, from £20,000 to £30,000 a year for every year of life gained to £25,000 to £35,000 – the first increase in the watchdog’s quality-adjusted life year formula since it was set up in 1999.The change should allow Nice to approve between three and five more drugs a year, on top of the 70 it usually deems good value for money. They are likely to include newly developed treatments for cancer and rare conditions that currently exceed spending thresholds.Whitehall sources disputed the Liberal Democrats’ claim that ministers had rolled over in the face of US pressure.“Unlike when the Lib Dems rolled over to Andrew Lansley [over the NHS reorganisation in 2010-12], we have protected the NHS. This will not be paid for out of budgets for NHS services,” an aide to Streeting said.Sources claimed that the NHS had received hundreds of millions of pounds in the comprehensive spending review earlier this year to cover the costs of the deal in its early years, meaning the service would not have to cut spending elsewhere to pay for innovative medicines.They conceded, however, that the costs will rise in the years ahead and the issue of who pays would need to be settled during the next spending review.“The deal is an important step towards ensuring patients can access innovative medicines needed to improve wider NHS health outcomes,” said Richard Torbett, the chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.Most pharmaceuticals have been exempt from trade tariffs under World Trade Organization rules since 1994, but Trump turned a blind eye to the agreement earlier this year as part of a bid to repatriate drug manufacturing and innovation to the US from countries such asIreland, which he said had stolen the US pharma sector.The deal will also bring changes to a longstanding drugs-purchasing agreement with the NHS, which industry leaders have argued is uncompetitive, discourages investment and needs reform.The deal comes six months after the original tariffdeal struck by Starmer and Trump, which promised“preferential treatment” for UK pharma.Pressure on the UK for NHS procurement reform has intensified in recent months, with drugmakers includingMerckandAstraZenecapausing or cancelling investment in the UK, citing the economic climate and lack of support for the life sciences industry.Last month the US ambassador to the UK, Warren Stephens, said further businesses would axe future investments if “there are not changes made and fast”.At the heart of the new UK-US deal is an agreement to lower a so-called “rebate” under the medicines payment arrangements between drug companies and the NHS.Under the current scheme, drug companies are required to pay the NHS between 23.5% and 35.6% of revenue from sales of branded medicines, if the amount the public health service uses is higher than an agreed rate.This will be reduced to 15% under a new rebate in the existing voluntary scheme for branded medicines pricing and access.This guarantees a continued suppressed price for branded drugs should demand exceed the annual cap.Similar schemes exist in other European countries, but the average rates are far lower, ranging from 9% for Ireland and 7% for Germany.Negotiations have been led by Varun Chandra, the prime minister’s chief business adviser, and Patrick Vallance, the science minister and former head of research and development at GSK.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryTrade policyTrump tariffsNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

And with price tags climbing and brand loyalty slipping, retailers this season must work harder to earn this generation’s dollar.Gen Z’s spending power is expected to near $12tn by 2030. But this year those aged 13 to 28 are expected to cut their holiday spending by a whopping 23% – a sharper decline compared to other generations – according to a recent PwCreport.“We have this consumer that is feeling budget constrained in several areas like credit card debt,” Kelly Pedersen, retail leader at PwC, said. “For these reasons, they are extremely value-oriented. It’s a real fundamental shift in how we think about the consumers in the industry.”Gen Z has the highest severe credit card delinquency rate out of any generation, currently over 10%, according to the quarterly household debt and creditreportby the New York Federal Reserve. Pedersen explained that these economic strains, including debt, inflation and student loans, have pushed members of gen Z to become far more selective with their spending as they weigh not only price but also the social and emotional value behind a purchase.How gen Z is rewriting money rules: ‘I thrift, I splurge, I save 25%’Read more“It’s not just about selling products,” Neil Saunders, retail analyst at GlobalData Retail, said. “It’s about selling emotions, which sounds really soft and woolly, but it is actually important for gen Z.”A hard sell, Saunders warns, does the opposite. A relentless “sell, sell, sell” approach can feel “soulless” and “inauthentic”, pushing young consumers toward brands, or even “dupes” – a replica of a product, often cheaper – that might feel more grounding, personal and valuable.“You lose gen Z’s trust very quickly if they perceive a lack of value from the company,”Pedersen said. “Losing trust just means losing sales. ”Brand loyalty is also on shaky ground, Pedersen added. Even though59% of gen Zcontinue to buy from true-and-tried brands, many are increasingly open to lesser-known companies and more affordable alternatives.“I feel like being brand-loyal is very close-minded,” Jonathan Singh, 19, a sophomore university student from Long Island, New York, said. “I wouldn’t find the best deal and I’m not going to be loyal to a brand for them to charge me $100 when I can find possibly a better-quality product for cheaper.”Despite criticizing brand loyalty, Singh admits he’s often drawn to department stores like Kohl’s – especially when rewards points are on the table. According to Saunders, membership programs can help feed gen Z’s hunger for community. Membership programs can offer perks such as exclusive sales and releases and, in some cases, invites to events.View image in fullscreenThe Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, on Black Friday 2025.Photograph: Adam Bettcher/AP“It’s actually a more thoughtful approach as to how retailers connect with the customer and make them feel part of something,” Saunders said. “When gen Z is much more [budget]-constrained, that connection does make a difference if you can get them to spend with you over another brand.”While gen Z may not be the easiest shoppers for retailers, they are giving a boost to theonce-dyingmall industry with approximately 58% frequently visiting malls,accordingto a global market research company Ipsos. In a throwback to earlier generations like gen X, gen Z views the mall as not just a shopping destination but also a place to socialize with friends, experience in-store events and have physical interaction with brands.“I think of going to the mall as a hobby,” Holly Paik, 21, a crochet business owner, said. “Even if I don’t buy anything, it’s fun to walk around with friends and window-shop or see whatever events they might have, like pop-ups.”Malls are capitalizing on gen Z’s search for experiences. The American Dream mall in New Jersey often brings in musicians like the Jonas Brothers and, more recently, K-pop stars including Hwasa and Taemin. Its sister establishment, Mall of America, also hosted a fan-meet with the popular K-pop girl group Katseye to celebrate a new store opening.“Shopping should be more and more an event,”Adam Petrick, chief marketing officer of the American Dream mall, said. “It should be an experience. It shouldn’t just be ‘I’m driving down to buy a pair of socks at the Gap.’ It should be more exciting than that, and it should be something that people are able to do together.”Recognizing gen Z’s sensitivity to price, Petrick explains how the mall “curates a collection of retailers that our consumer responds to”, ranging from luxury labels like Gucci to more affordable options such as Zara and Primark. He added that retailers have increasingly teamed up with mall management to launch more events designed to entice gen Z shoppers and promote discount sales.“Gen Z are going to stores but they’re not necessarily buying anything,” Pedersen said. “It’s now about brand connectivity and experiences that build those loyalties, earning gen Z’s purchase. Shopping now goes beyond transactions.”Before Singh even thinks about clicking “add to cart” or tapping his card, he jumps into a rabbit hole of research ranging from comparing brands with similar products, analyzing material quality, reading numerous reviews, hunting for coupons and even opening social media platforms. He doesn’t stop there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even with the research, I don’t trust the initial impression of it from just being online.”That pragmatic “hunt for the deal” has led to a dupe culture, where gen Zers unabashedly seek cheaper lookalikes rather than brand-name originals. According to thereport, about 82% plan to purchase dupes, which are not counterfeit goods, but rather products that mayresemble an expensive item at a more affordable price.“Dupes have become culturally a part of self-celebration,” Pedersen said. “This is a great treasure hunt for them, like ‘look what I found’, but they’re less enthusiastic about buying dupes for gifts.”Singh’s friend prided himself on snagging a pair of Chinese AirPod dupes that were not even a quarter of the original’s price. Both Singh and his friend, however, refused to ever gift a dupe.Even though gen Z cares deeply about the sustainability and social concerns behind a product, Pedersen explained: “They are not willing to pay more for it.”Spreadsheets and day trips to Egypt: how gen Z is ‘soft saving’ for the futureRead more“As much as I tell other people to shop with brands who are sustainable and from small businesses, I don’t have the means to do it myself,” Paik said. “If sustainable brands can make their products much more affordable, I would definitely consider shopping there more often.”Some are even planning to gift homemade items such as crocheted knickknacks and experiences for the sake of affordability.“A gift isn’t all about money but rather the love and care you put into it,” Nicholas Asiedu, 21, an office assistant, said. “Sometimes I love to gift a lasting memory, like I often take my girlfriend on a trip to a museum. Memories are worth more than a gift.”“I find that my friends are more appreciative of a gift that takes time,” Paik said. “When I crochet something for them, it’s much more personal to them and their interests. It’s also more affordable [for] me so that’s a plus.”Saunders notes gen Zers who gift homemade items or experiences are still a niche subgroup. He anticipates a majority of the generation to spend intentionally during the holiday season, balancing cost, value and emotional sentiment.“This is the future generation,” he said. “Retailers have to be focused on them for the here and now. If you don’t understand gen Z and you’re not capturing their loyalty or attention, you are storing up problems for the next 10 to 20 years.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryBlack FridayChristmasShops and shoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The rebrand was widely mocked.“From the people that brought you Accenture Song now come the ‘reinventors’, staff are going to cringe,” said Damon Collins, the co-founder of the marketing agency Joint. “If they think this move is going to win favour with many employees, or clients, they have another thing coming. It is a very unusual bit of corporate panic, they really have the wrong end of the Nvidia chip.”The new tag for the consultants is the latest in a long list of unusual jargon that big businesses have foisted on their staff; some tech workers are referred to as “ninjas”, “growth hackers” and “evangelists”.Curious job titles are also popular in the media and entertainment industries, including at Walt Disney, where technical experts who design and build its theme parks are referred to as “imagineers”.The WPP founder, Martin Sorrell,took on the moniker of “senior monk”when he engineered the takeover of the digital creative company MediaMonks, where staff are called “monks”.Apple’s expert in-store tech helpers are called “geniuses”, while the London-based ad agency Mother, which has clients including KFC, has the title “mother” for executives that oversee the running of projects between clients and staff.The “reinventor” push from Accenture comes as it moves to sharpen its focus on its AI capabilities. Sweet told investors in September that the consultancy would “exit” employees who were not getting the hang of using AI at work.TheNew-York based groupsaid it was training staff in generative AI fundamentals, but employees for whom “reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need” would be shown the door. As part of a restructure, it laid off 11,000 staff to leave a workforce of 791,000 staff.The consultancy has also reportedly built a version of its internal human resources website where the staff are called “reinventors” rather than “workers”, according to the Financial Times.Embarking on a rebrand in an effort to radically alter the perception of a traditional company can be fraught with risks.Jaguar discovered this when it announced its move into the electric car market with apolarising Miami Pink concept model last year, a marketing strategydreamed up by none other than Accenture Song.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And Disney’s imagineers do have the call to action to ‘make you dream’.“To be a real reinventor is really a name for just a few people. Maybe this is a cool thing when interviewing in the fight to find new talent. But then I see a pushback internally from employees maybe overpromised what it means to be one. The reality is everyone has different roles and very few will be true reinventors.”Accenture, which was spun out of Arthur Andersen, the now-defunct accountant, in 1989 and later rebranded, works with thousands of companies around the world, offering IT and business strategy consulting and outsourcing.The company benefited from huge demand for tech consulting in the aftermath of the pandemic but its shares, which are listed in New York, have suffered this year after Donald Trump ordered US government agencies to review their spending with large consultancies.The consultancy reported a 7% annual rise in revenue to $69.7bn (£52.7bn) for its financial year ended in August, but warned investors that US federal spending cuts will probably slow its growth next year. It has lost more than a quarter of its market value so far this year, which stands at $155bn.Accenture was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBusinessTechnology sectorArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

On Monday itsaidthe “vast majority” of those fixes were complete.“Airbus apologises for any challenges and delays caused to passengers and airlines by this event,” the company said.There are now fewer than 100 aircraft that still need the software update before they can return to service, Airbus said in a statement. Up to 15% of the planes may still require a hardware upgrade, analysts at Deutsche Bank have estimated.However, shares in Airbus fell by as much as 6% later on Monday after Reuters reported the company had identified a separate quality problem affecting a “limited number” of A320 metal panels.A spokesperson for Airbus said: “Airbus is taking a conservative approach and is inspecting all aircraft potentially impacted, knowing that only a portion of them will need further action to be taken.“The source of the issue has been identified, contained and all newly produced panels conform to all requirements.”For most of the A320 aircraft affected by the software problem, the fix is relatively simple, requiring the installation of an older version of the software. This process takes about two to three hours per aircraft.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is heartening this issue has been identified and will be addressed so swiftly, demonstrating the high aviation safety standards globally.”The London-listed airlines easyJet and Wizz Air told investors on Monday morning that they had completed the software updates over the weekend without cancelling any flights.However, the fix could be more complex for older planes. Aarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at the investment broker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “For some older aircraft, about 900 planes, the fix will require a hardware change before they can fly again, which could take several weeks due to limited supplies.”The American low-cost airline JetBlue said late on Sunday that it expected to be able to return 137 out of the 150 affected aircraft back to service by Monday and that it planned to cancel about 20 flights, according to Reuters.Shares in Airbus, which are listed in Paris, have fallen by about 4% over the past five days, although they are still up by about 20% so far this year.

It is the worst failure in the 15-year history of the OBR,” they said.It said the Treasury and the Cabinet Office should also shoulder some of the responsibility for maintaining IT systems that lacked the level of security needed to prevent unregulated access by outside bodies.The EFO document set out all the key announcements on taxes, growth and individual policy changes, leading to mockery and anger among some MPs in parliament.The investigation found: “Pressure on the small team involved to ensure that the full Economic and Fiscal Outlook– a substantial document – and many associated spreadsheets and other documents would be available immediately after the chancellor sat down had led to the use of a pre-publication facility, a commonly used device that however created a potential vulnerability if not configured properly.“The security of this brief phase in the production of theEFO had not, over the years, received the same amount of attention by the OBR as the ongoing necessity of ensuring security of communications with the Treasury during the long period of run-up to the budget.The terms of reference for the inquiry referred to a “publication error” and said its starting point would be that “the OBR inadvertently made it possible to access the November 2025 EFO too early on budget day”.Before the nature of the mistake became clear, the OBR chief, Richard Hughes, suggested in an interview with the BBC that “an external person” may have prematurely been able to access the link to its budget report.Hughes later wrote to the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, and the chair of the Treasury select committee, Meg Hillier, to apologise and said he was“mortified”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

UBS said: “We firmly reject the office of the attorney general’s conclusions and will vigorously defend our position.”The tuna bonds scandal arose from $2bn (£1.5bn) worth of loans that Credit Suisse arranged for the Republic of Mozambique between 2013 and 2016. The loans were said to be going to government-sponsored investment schemes including maritime security projects and a state tuna fishery, located in the south-east African country’s capital, Maputo.However, a portion of the funds went unaccounted for, with one of Mozambique’s contractors later found to have secretly arranged “significant kickbacks” worth at least $137m, including $50m for bankers at Credit Suisse, meant to secure more favourable deals on the loans,according to the Financial Conduct Authority.The scam snowballed and eventually caused the International Monetary Fund to suspend its assistance to Mozambique, leading to a crash in the country’s economy.Credit Suisse had alreadysettled the case with US and UK regulators in 2021, having paid $275m to American watchdogs and £147m to Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority.UBS also subsequently agreed to settle the case with Mozambique in October 2023, shortly before a trial was due to kick off in London courts. Mozambique had been pursuing $1.5bn in damages over economic losses after the IMF and international donors pulled their financial support.The Swiss attorney general’s office accused Credit Suisse and its owner of “not taking all the required and reasonable organisational measures in the relevant period in 2016 to prevent the money laundering that was allegedly committed”.Credit Suisse was sold to UBS in an emergency deal in March 2023, when customers started to pull money from the lender amid a mini-banking crisis that primarily affected US lenders but later spread to Zurich.Credit Suisse had for years been mired in scandals, but panic over its future grew after its largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, ruled out any extra funding for the Swiss lender despite the growing turmoil.The crisis of confidence eventually forced Swiss authorities tooffer emergency loansto Credit Suisse, before eventually orchestrating a shotgun takeover by Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, which bought the lender for a cut price of 3bn Swiss francs. It left UBS handling a raft of legacy scandals from its former rival.Explore more on these topicsCredit SuisseUBSBankingEuropean banksEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

With ­Piastri second and Norris only fourth, it has brought the Dutch driver right into the title fight for the last round. He is second behind Norris but ahead of Piastri, a position he ­considered unthinkable halfway through the season.“I’m excited, I’m happy to go there and have a go at it,” he said. “I go in there with just positive energy. I try everything I can but at the same time, if I don’t win it, I still know that I had an amazing season. So, it doesn’t really matter. It takes a lot of the ­pressure off. I’m just out there ­having a good time like I had on Sunday.“I know that when I sit in the car, I always try to maximise everything I can. And that’s what I’ll try to do in Abu Dhabi. A race like Qatar shows that when you think it’s going to be boring and straightforward, it’s not. So I’m hoping Abu Dhabi is going to be similar.”Verstappen goes into the decider with nothing to lose given he had no expectation of being a contender for most of this season. Afterthe Dutch GP– round 15 of the season – on 31 August, he was 104 points behind the then leader ­Piastri and was explicit that he believed the title was beyond him.Red Bull, ­however, brought a series of upgrades to thenext round in Monza, including changes to the floor and front wing, in an attempt to address the balance problems that had stymied their car at most tracks during the season. They proved enormously ­successful, with Verstappen finally feeling comfortable with his ride, and since then he has returned five wins and three podiums. He paid tribute to the team effort behind his success.“We’ve won races where maybe we shouldn’t have, like Sunday, by making the right call as a team,” he said. “Of course, it’s still up to me to execute it in the best way possible but that’s also a proper team effort.“The way I work with my race engineer, with GP, [Gianpiero Lambiase] and also the guys in the background – the whole team very close to me – I think we’re really well integrated and we know exactly what we need to ask of each other. That probably helps also when you’re in a battle like this, when you’re not the quickest, but you still pretty much maximise everything you’ve got.”Norris remains the favourite going into the race with a 12‑point lead but McLaren have managed to let themselves be put under immense pressure by Verstappen and Red Bull. At theprevious round in Las Vegas,both their cars were disqualified forexceeding the wear on the skid blockon the floor of the car, ­handing ­Verstappen a 25-point gain and ­moving him from 49 points back to 24, a deficit he reduced to 12 after McLaren’s blunder in Qatar.Norris will still take his first title if he finishes in front of both his rivals or claims third place or better. ­Verstappen would need to win and hope Norris finishes outside the podium places while Piastri, 16 points down, would need to win and have Norris finish sixth or lower.Last time Verstappen went into a decisive season-finale in Abu Dhabi was in 2021, when he was tied on points with Lewis Hamilton. He went on to claim his first title that year after therace ended in controversy,with the then race director Michael Masi improvising an interpretation of the rules to ensure the race did not finish behind a safety car. The FIA later described the decision as“human error”; the result stood.Explore more on these topicsMax VerstappenLando NorrisOscar PiastriFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

But with no great teams in the league this year, the playoffs are wide openMelissa JacobsMon 1 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 08.23 ESTShareThe 49ers’ season felt over afterWeek 6’s loss to Tampa Bay. Yes, they were 4-2. Yes, they were tied with the Seahawks and Rams and had already won head-to-head games against both. But that’s when they hit rock bottom. All Pro linebacker Fred Warnerwas the latest casualty, followingin the footstepsof All Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa with a season-ending injury. Brock Purdy had also struggled with injuries. George Kittle was hurt in Week 1. Both were not expected to return for several games. Brandon Aiyuk had no plans to play any time soon, at least not for San Francisco. By Week 7, the only big names in action were Christian McCaffrey and Trent Williams.Dire as the 49ers appeared on paper, they hung in. It helped that the Cardinals, Falcons, Giants, and Panthers featured in their upcoming schedule. They beat all four of them, losing only to the Texans and Rams in the next few weeks. None of the wins inspired much confidence, though. The Cardinals outgained the 49ers by 200 yards. Purdy threw three interceptions against the Panthers.NFL roundup: Panthers shock Rams as Allen sets TD record in Bills’ win over SteelersRead moreFinally, on a windy day in Cleveland, the 49ers looked like they belonged in the playoff conversation.Sunday’s 26-8 winwas the franchise’s first in Cleveland since 1984. There was nothing splashy stat-wise, just smart, mistake-free football against one of the league’s top defenses. Purdy was efficient, going 16-of-29 for 168 yards and one touchdown. He ran in another on a third-and-goal read-option.Purdy had solid protection and was sacked just once by Myles Garrett, a great accomplishment this season. Robert Saleh’s defense dominated as Clelin Ferrell and Keion White broke through with key sacks. And Skyy Moore’s66-yard punt returnin the first-quarter set the tone for the game.As 49ers beat reporterDavid Lombardi points out, the last 49ers win in Cleveland came the week after a four-interception game by Joe Montana. The 49ers would go on to win the Super Bowl that year.That outlook is a stretch for this group. Purdy is not Montana, and there is no healthy defender on the current 49ers roster at the same level as Ronnie Lott. That group was 15-1. This crew is 9-4 and sitting as the seventh seed in the playoff picture. There remains a lot of patchwork throughout the roster.But there is one stark advantage for the modern 49ers – there is no outstanding team in theNFLthis season. There is no longer certainty that Patrick Mahomes will lead the Chiefs to a dramatic comeback, no matter the odds. Or that Josh Allen can control a game with his legs. Or that Bo Nix and Drake Maye will be able to handle the pressure come playoff time. In the NFC, the once magical Lions have no identity and a bevy of issues on defense. The Rams are the NFL’s most complete team but don’t have a sure-thing offense. The Eagles were wildly outcoached by Ben Johnson and the Bears, the No 1 seed at the moment, are missing a lot of pieces.The only sure thing in the NFL in 2025 is the shrewdness of a handful of coaches. The 49ers’ Kyle Shanahan is, of course, among them. As are Johnson and Sean McVay. Mike Vrabel, Sean Payton, and Brian Schottenheimer are also coaches youdon’t want your team facing in the playoffs. That’s what so strange about this season. Some rosters are far more compelling than San Francisco’s. But there is no quarterback playing like Tom Brady, Peyton Manning or peak-era Mahomes. So the competitive advantage may ultimately lie in coaching. Factors like preparation, aggressiveness, and team chemistry probably mean a lot more this season.If that remains the case, don’t count out the 49ers.MVP of the weekBryce Young, QB, Carolina Panthers.In a wild back-and-forth victory for the Panthers over the Rams, Young reminded us why he was once the NFL’s No 1 overall pick. Young went toe-to-toe with Matthew Stafford and the Rams’ sensational offense as well as the team’s top-rated defense. In the 31-28 upset win, Young threw three touchdowns, no interceptions and was 15-of-20 for 206 yards. He brought the magic when it counted most, going 2-for-2 for 76 yards and two touchdowns on fourth down. His third touchdown was on third and eight. It doesn’t get more clutch.View image in fullscreenBryce Young leaves the field after  his team’s win over the Rams.Photograph: Rusty Jones/APYoung’s play has been inconsistent (see hisgame against San Francisco last week), and one lights-out performance won’t convince the skeptics. But against the Rams, Young showed Carolina all the intangibles he brings, especially heart. With the win, there is a plausible chance Young gets a taste of the postseason. The 7-6 Panthers are half a game behind the NFC South-leading Bucs, and the two teams face off twice before the end of the season.Stat of the week76. Thank goodness for Josh Allen’s legs because his arm wasn’t getting it done Sunday. Allen’s eight-yard rushing touchdown in the fourth-quarter not only cemented the Bills’ 26-7 win over the Steelers, it gave him sole possession of the NFL record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback, with 76. He had previously been tied with Cam Newton.View image in fullscreenJosh Allen has been a menace on the ground throughout his career.Photograph: Brent Gudenschwager/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThe game’s star quarterbacks, Allen and Aaron Rodgers, struggled to get their offenses going. Allen ended the first half with just 51 passing yards and an interception. A head-butting altercation with Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward seemed to fuel Allen and the Bills to a much cleaner and efficient second-half. Allen hit Keon Coleman for a score after a nice pump fake. But it was James Cook’s 144 rushing yards that sealed the Bills’ victory. With the win, the Bills keep pace as the seventh seed in the AFC. They face the Joe Burrow-led Bengals next.Video of the week“I know you guys are hungry for more, right? The city of Chicago is hungry too,” Bears head coach Ben Johnson proclaimed in the team’s raucous locker room after Friday’s win over the Eagles.Then he ripped his shirt off.Come for the@ChicagoBearsvictory speech, stay for Ben Johnson going tops off to fire up the squad 🤣#BlackFridayNFLpic.twitter.com/3mo7nHmUdf— NFL on Prime Video (@NFLonPrime)November 28, 2025The fired-up players encircling Johnson knew why. So too did Bears fans. Free hot dogs for all! The Wiener Circle, a hot dog stand that has become a Chicago institution, promised free hot dogs if Johnson took off his shirt after a Bears victory.To say Johnson has won over Chicago is an understatement. The Bears are 9-3, winners of five straight, NFC North leaders, AND currently the No 1 seed in the NFC after the Rams’ loss. The confidence instilled by Johnson was on full display in Philadelphia. Chicago bullied the Eagles, especially in the trenches. The Bears run game had its way thanks to a combination ofshrewd playcallingand elite blocking. D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai rushed for over 100 yards, the first time since 1985 the Bears had two 100-yard rushers in a game. The defense held its own, limiting Saquon Barkley to 56 yards on 13 carries. They also stopped a fourth-down tush push. The Bears were sharper, controlled the tempo, and simply seemed to want it more. That’s the Ben Johnson effect.Elsewhere around the leagueBucs tackle Tristan Wirfs – all 320lbs of him – provided a fun spark,hauling in his first-ever touchdownin his team’s 20-17 win over the Cardinals. The big guy touchdown came after two other “touchdowns” on the same drive were nullified by penalties.View image in fullscreenTristan Wirfs grabs his touchdown against the Cardinals.Photograph: Jefferee Woo/Tampa Bay Times/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockExtra-point drama in the Colts-Texans game! No, your eyes did not deceive you. Texans kicker Ka’imi Fairbairnclearly missed an extra-pointwide left but the refs called it good, and the play wasn’t reviewable. “Since the ball was above the upright it’s not reviewable,” referee Clay Martin said after the game. The touchdown was also aided by a phantom pass interference call on Colts cornerback Kenny Moore. The Texans went on to win the game between two teams battling for the AFC South title, and the contest did not need such substandard officiating.Northern Ireland’s Charlie Smyth, a graduate of the NFL’s International Pathways Program, had a pretty good start to his pro football career. The former Gaelic footballer drilled a 56-yarder with his first attempt in the NFL and also had an onside kick recovered, although his team lost 21-17 to the Dolphins. Smyth only learned he was playing at late notice and had to rush his family over the Atlantic to Miami to see the game. “If we had to wait another three or four hours longer, I don’t think it would have been possible,” Smyth said, revealing his parents and sisters had suffered delays on the way over. “It was so awesome to see them here.”Continuing our special teams debut special: Jaguars nose tackle DaVon Hamilton subbed in as his team’s long snapper after an injury to Ross Matiscik in the first quarter. He successfully snapped on a field goal, extra point and three punts. “That was very exciting,” Hamilton said. “Definitely not something I want to do on a day-to-day basis. I’m going to leave this to Ross. But it was fun.” Hamilton’s snaps helped the Jags to a 25-3 win over the Titans, which puts them top of a tight race in the AFC South over the Colts and Texans.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

Chants of “We want our Tottenham back” have resurfaced during times of struggle, while mounting fury at Daniel Levy finally grewtoo loud to ignore for the Lewis family over the summer.I remember well the chorus of boos that ultimately sounded thedeath knell for Nuno Espírito Santo, when he subbed off a lively Lucas Moura against Manchester United. And if you want a deeper cut, I was there in May 2007 to witness the visceral anger and disgust whenHossam Ghaly threw his shirt on the groundafter being substituted by Martin Jol, half an hour after coming on.‘Not true Tottenham fans’: boos for goalkeeper Vicario anger Thomas FrankRead moreThe game on Saturday night bore comparison with some of those moments.Guglielmo Vicario was subjected to boosseconds after his monumental error had handed Fulhama second, ultimately match-winning goal, six minutes into the match. The jeers came from a minority of fans, but the acoustics of booing mean the chorus does not have to be large to be audible. As the players and the manager have made clear, in social media posts, post-match interviews and, if reports are to be believed, to one another in the dressing room, they heard the boos loud and clear and did not appreciate it.I found the booing of Vicario utterly reprehensible for many reasons, not least given some of the saves he has made this season to keep us in games. Even if he didn’t have such displays under his belt – and Vicario is by no means the perfect keeper – I can think of very few circumstances that justify booing your own players for making a mistake. Not only is it likely to shatter their confidence, even affect their mental health, but it displays a total failure to understand what football support is about.You can groan, you can even boo a team performance – although I’m generally against that, too – but you are supposed to get behind the players, to be the 12th man, to have their backs when there is still hope of salvaging something.When the boos rained down, I found myself shouting, to nobody in particular, to shut up. Others reacted even more vocally, bitter arguments breaking out in the South Stand between complete strangers. At one point, I thought punches might be thrown.That is the crux of it really, the creeping toxicity of the atmosphere at Spurs and the danger of a vicious cycle taking hold, where it is no longer clear whether the atmosphere is holding the team back or vice versa.View image in fullscreenTottenham fans have had little to cheer about with their team winning four times in 22 home games.Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty ImagesEven before the game, something was off. There was a chunk of empty seats in front of me and the crowd felt subdued. The 8pm Saturday kick-off time is not necessarily convenient for everyone, but an afternoon on the beers ought to make for a rowdy reception for the visitors. You only need look at the recent home record to see why that did not materialise. In 2025, Spurs have won only three league games at home, a record that could charitably be called laughable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fulham were in on goal again moments later and could easily have scored a third. For all that talk of newfound defensive solidity under Thomas Frank’s pragmatic leadership, the feeling we had under Ange Postecoglou, that the opposition were only ever one smart ball away from being in on goal, has returned.Put more simply: it is cold, it is raining and you’ve deserted your friends or family to embark on a three-hour round trip that’s been ruined inside six minutes. That’s a recipe for frothing anger, even if it was wrong to make Vicario the whipping boy.There are fanbases who suffer worse, there always are. But they don’t do it with a squad full of top-level talent who, for some unfathomable reason, can barely muster a shot in anger in 180 minutes against their two biggest rivals. They don’t do it in a £1bn stadium, where tickets are more expensive than almost any in world football.The flipside of fans understanding that footballers are only human is that the players and coaching staff must be careful not to lose sight of what that fan experience is like. As the final whistle sounded on Saturday, the stadium DJ – who does this a lot – played the Editors song Munich, with its poignant lyric: “People are fragile things, you should know by now. Be careful what you put them through.”When the manager and fans question the fans’ loyalty, they should bear that refrain in mind.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurcommentShareReuse this content"

His Masters success was especially notable for the fact that it was Zoeller’s debut in the competition, making him the first golfer since 1935 (and still only the third) to win on his first appearance. He won the sudden-death playoff against Tom Watson and Ed Sneed with a par and a birdie, sinking a six-foot putt on the second extra hole and hurling his putterhigh into the airas the ball disappeared into the cup.Zoeller’s US Open victory at Winged Foot five years later was remembered for his light-hearted interaction with his play-off rival, Greg Norman. When Norman holed a lengthy putt on the last of the 72 holes, Zoeller, who was behind him on the fairway, mistakenly thought the Australian had gone into the lead, and waved a white towel inmock surrender. But Norman’s putt had only drawn him level, and Zoeller was able to secure a par on the last to maintain parity. During the subsequent 18-hole playoff, which Zoeller won by eight strokes, Norman returned the gesture byflappinghis own white towel at the 18th.As well as those two big wins, Zoeller picked up eight other PGA tour victories in the US. He was also runner-up at the 1981 USPGA tournament in Duluth, Georgia, third in the 1994 Open championship at Turnberry, and played in three Ryder Cups, in 1979, 1983 and 1985, although he had a terrible record in that competition, losing eight of his 10 matches, with just one win and one draw.Born Frank Urban Zoeller in New Albany,Indiana, to Frank Sr, an executive at a wood veneer business, and his wife, Alma (nee Cummings), he was known as Fuzzy from an early age, on account of his initials. He started playing golf at the age of three, and shone in the sport at New Albany high school, Edison Junior College in Florida, and Houston University in Texas, before turning professional in 1973.He earned his USPGA tour card the following year and after a modest first season improved vastly in his second with four top 10 finishes, two of which were in the runner-up slot. A quick player, he was easygoing on the fairways and could often be seen whistling and cracking jokes with the crowd.Considered long off the tee in those days, Zoeller subsequently put himself into a number of good positions to win, but had begun to gain a reputation as something of a choker until his first win came in 1979, at the San Diego Open. Ten weeks later he won the Masters at the age of 27, taking advantage of a collapse by Sneed, who had looked to be the winner before bogeying the last three holes. “I’ve never been to heaven, and, thinking back on my life, I probably won’t get a chance to go,” Zoeller joked. “But I guess winning the Masters is as close as I’m going to get.”At the 1984US Open, Zoeller had a three-stroke lead after nine holes of the final round, but Norman had drawn level by the 17th. On the 18th, Norman hit his approach shot into the stands, but after receiving relief without penalty chipped to 45ft from the flag and holed the par putt. It was then that Zoeller, standing in the group behind and believing Norman had just registered a birdie, waved his white towel. The playoff on the following day turned out to be heavily one-sided, with Zoeller leading by five shots after nine holes, and stretching the distance by a further three on the back half. The following year Zoeller was given the USPGA’s 1985 Bob Jones award for distinguished sportsmanship.After that second major there were expectations of more to come. But Zoeller’s momentum slowed, and his next tournament victory, at the Anheuser-Busch golf classic in Virginia in 1986, proved to be his last on the main US tour, at the age of 34 – although he did have five top 10 finishes in the majors between 1986 and 1994.In 1997, in the twilight of his career, Zoeller’s fondness for wisecracking embroiled him in controversy asTiger Woodsbecame the first black player to win a major – at the Masters. Relaxing with a drink in the Augusta clubhouse, Zoeller was collared by a CNN journalist looking for some off-the-cuff thoughts about Woods’ imminent victory. While he praised Woods’ performance, he also jokingly referred to the 21-year-old as “a little boy” and said he hoped that he would not be choosing fried chicken and collard greens for the celebratory champions dinner.Although he swiftly apologised for the racial stereotyping – and Woods later brushed aside the incident – Zoeller found it difficult to repair the damage to his reputation, which led to the loss of lucrative sponsorship deals and caused him anguish for years.In 2002 he joined the over-50s Champions Tour in the US, winning the Senior PGA Championship in Ohio in 2002 and the Mastercard Championship in Hawaii in 2004 before playing his last event in 2017. He also designed golf courses, and enjoyed hunting and fishing.Zoeller’s wife, Diane (nee Thornton), whom he married in 1976, died in 2021. He is survived by their children, Sunnye, Heidi, Gretchen and Miles.Frank (Fuzzy) Urban Zoeller, golfer, born 11 November 1951; died 27 November 2025Explore more on these topicsGolfTiger WoodsUS sportsUS OpenIndianaobituariesShareReuse this content"

Arsenal have now played two of their three toughest away games of the season. They’ve come through a potentially extremely tricky week with reputation enhanced, despite being without one of their starting centre-backs for all three games and both for one of them. If there is any sense of disappointment, it is only that theyfailed to beat Chelsea, whom they have become accustomed to getting the better of, despite having a man advantage from the 38th minute on Sunday.But really there shouldn’t be any disappointment. Coming out of the international break, havingconceded a late equaliserto Sunderland in their previous game, Arsenal looked potentially vulnerable. Despite having been by far the most impressive side this season, their lead over Manchester City was only four points. They were without Gabriel, who probably ranks alongside Declan Rice as their most important player. They faced Tottenham, Bayern and Chelsea over the course of eight days, and Manchester City appeared to be beginning to gather momentum.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s footballRead moreSince then they have outplayed Tottenham and Bayern, winning both games comfortably, and drawn away against Chelsea who had risen to second and may turn out to be their most serious title challenger. And that’s despite losing William Saliba for the game at Stamford Bridge. At the same time, City have suddenly lost momentum,losing at Newcastle last weekand beingbeaten at homein the Champions League by Bayer Leverkusen, before Saturday’s unconvincing performance against Leeds, when they let a two-goal lead slip beforeburgling a late winner. Although Liverpool won at West Ham on Sunday, having finally dropped Mohamed Salah, defeats to Nottingham Forest and PSV Eindhoven in the previous week give no indication of a side gearing up to mount a charge.It’s not just thatArsenalare playing well; it’s that their rivals really are not.Chelsea, like Sunderland, showed that Arsenal can perhaps be unsettled by physical opponents, but it’s not a glaring weakness. It’s true that three of the past four goals Arsenal have conceded in the Premier League have been the result of balls played into the box and won by an enormous centre-back, but this is nothing likeArsène Wenger’s side of old going to Stoke: this version of Arsenal are more than happy to mix it up when necessary.In that sense, Sunday’s game felt like a throwback: partly to the days when Didier Drogba would bully whichever centre-back he was up against (not that Arsenal’s duo of Cristhian Mosquera or Piero Hincapié wilted in the way some of their predecessors had), and in part to something far more distant, to the early years of thePremier Leaguewhen every big clash was a brutal battle of muscle.The one remaining question about Arsenal is how they respond to adversity. Perhaps their most consistent fault under Mikel Arteta has been their tendency to be knocked off course by a freak occurrence, an injury, a red card or a surprise equaliser. That’s perhaps why there is such a focus at this early stage of the season on their lead, as though they need clear water ahead. But this last week has suggested they do now have the resilience of champions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Arsenal of the past three seasons might have been deflated by that – as, indeed, hadhappened against Bayern Munichin the quarter-final in 2023-24. This week, with admittedly lower stakes, Arsenal reset and quickly reasserted their supremacy to win 3-1.Conceding early in the second half against Chelsea, similarly, might easily have derailed them. As it was, though, Arsenal didn’t panic. They kept going. Bukayo Saka finally got the better of Marc Cucurella – who, having marked Lamine Yamal out of the game on Chelsea’s win over Barcelona on Tuesday, did a fine job on the England wide man as well – and crossed for Mikel Merino to level.Arsenal will have to get used to opponents trying to test them from set-plays – the corner from which Trevoh Chalobah scored came from David Raya saving a João Pedro header from a free-kick. But Mosquera and Hincapié have proved able deputies of Gabriel and Saliba and there is still Christian Norgaard in reserve. The squad is deep and coherent. Other rivals will also try to impose themselves physically on Arsenal, but they have shown themselves just about able to stand up to that.The only slight concern is that the gap remains only five points despite Arsenal’s seeming superiority, but that is still a healthy lead and, after Aston Villa next weekend, the fixtures between now and Christmas would suggest that could soon increase.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Lionel Messi carefully places a soccer ball on a field, ready to take a free kick. He is flanked by Lionel Messi and Lionel Messi. On the sideline, manager Lionel Messi, assisted by Lionel Messi, gesticulates. Lionel Messi lays off the ball for Lionel Messi, who crosses it to Lionel Messi. Lionel Messi chests and volleys it into the net and is mobbed by another half dozen Lionel Messis (or is it Lionels Messi?).Facing Inter Miami in the ongoing MLS playoffs must feel more or less like living inside this ad. Before Saturday’s Eastern Conference final against New York City FC, Messi had either scored or assisted on all 12 goals Miami had scored in the postseason. Messi hassmashed up the leaguethis year, but he has saved the real savagery for the playoffs.On Saturday, Inter finally got over their own case ofMessipendencia– the Argentinian contributed just one assist in a rollicking 5-1 win over NYC FC.They are so much fun, this Miami team. Seeing Messi in his pomp, chasing yet another trophy and dragging his club along until it developed enough velocity of its own, has been fun. TheseMLSplayoffs, even as favorites have excelled, have been fun.There have only been four upsets – and just one among teams seeded more than one place apart, when fifth-seeded NYC FC beat top-seeded Philadelphia – but the bracket has been packed with drama and reversals in fortune and cinematic climaxes.Would a few more rounds of regular season games have extracted the same performances from Messi, or ignited the fireworks we’ve seen in MLS over the last few weeks? There is no placebo group here, but it’s doubtful.The Vancouver Whitecaps-LAFC Western Conference semi-final was an epic, a ding-dong affair tied up with a 95th-minute Heung-min Son free kick.The Whitecaps finished extra-time down to nine men because of a red card to defender Tristan Blackmon and an injury. But they survived LAFC hitting both posts and the crossbar on a single sequence and prevailed on penalties.Playoffs!They are fun, and they care not about the genre of soccer being played. Over in the NWSL, Gotham FC upset the Washington Spirit in the Championship final, courtesy of asplendid Rose Lavelle finishfrom the edge of the box. That was only after Juan Carlos Amorós’s side had already upset the No 1 and No 4 seeds. Gotham were the lowest-seeded team (No 8) to ever win the title, breaking their own record from two years ago, when they were seeded sixth.You could quibble that Gotham being seeded so low was fluky, given their continental title in the Concacaf W Champions Cup just six months earlier, injuries to key players, and a four-game winless run to close out the regular season that sent them tumbling down the standings. But then, in the dying seconds of extra-time in the quarter-final, they squeaked by a Kansas City Current team that had pulverised the league during the regular season. Gotham, a team who won just nine of their 26 regular season matches beat the club that set a record points total. And then they only went and knocked out the defending champion Orlando Pride with a 97th-minute winner on their only shot on goal in the whole game, advancing to the championship game.Playoffs!View image in fullscreenThe Washington Spirit made the NWSL Championship on the back of penalty kick heroics by Aubrey Kingsbury.Photograph: Hannah Foslien/NWSL/Getty ImagesWas all of this, or any of it, fair?

So long as you aren’t partial to any of the other teams, yeah, absolutely.And in the end, the point of pro sports is entertainment; fairness comes second to that.In dissecting what, exactly, makes sporting competition attractive, the Twenty First Group consultancy once identified “quality, jeopardy and connection” as the key ingredients to appealing contests. Pound for pound, playoff games will deliver more of those than a regular season game will. This is partly a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course. As Gotham demonstrated, the league table can start to feel like a pass-fail entry exam into the real thing, reducing most of the season to a qualifying event. But this achieves a service to all but the hardcore fan: it concentrates the action – the jeopardy – into far fewer games. Into better games.Purists recoil at the erosion of the straight league table – the type used to determine the champions of most of the best soccer leagues in the world since they were founded.But there’s something of an inconsistency that is overlooked here: some of the most popular competitions in soccer – the World Cup; the Uefa Champions League and its lesser step-siblings the Europa League and the Conference League; the Euros; Copa América – derive much of their appeal from the fact that they, too, are mostly playoffs. In the games that matter they are, at any rate. That’s where all the good stuff happens, the theater and the elation and the anguish.After Vancouver’s 3-1 win over 10-man San Diego in Saturday’s other conference final, we’ll get a Thomas Müller-Lionel Messi final to redeem this sordid year of our lord, 2025.Playoffs forever.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

Did this represent a Game You Just Have to Win Because Chelsea’s Moisés Caicedo Was Sent Off? Yes and no. The hosts will naturally be more pleased with a point in the context of the first-half red card, while Arsenal perhaps looked a little jaded and below their best overall. But Enzo Maresca’s side were excellent throughout, despite having to play so much of the match with 10 men, and they deserved something from it. Compared with some Chelsea v Arsenal encountersfrom the olden days(when more overtly physical iterations of the Blues traditionally used to crush the fragile Gunners) there were no signs of weakness, mental or otherwise, from Arteta’s Premier League leaders in a fierce and physical derby. They will experience few harder tests than this, and a point was fair.Luke McLaughlinMatch report: Chelsea 1-1 ArsenalView image in fullscreenMikel Merino (left) heads the equalising goal for Arsenal against Chelsea.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian2Amorim happy to ‘steal’ from othersRuben Amorim was not afraid to admit that Manchester United’s newfound prowess from set pieces has taken inspiration from other teams after another two against Crystal Palace sealed a comeback victory at Selhurst Park. Joshua Zirkzee’s clever finish from a Bruno Fernandes free-kick and Mason Mount’s pile-driver made it 10 goals from set pieces so far this season – the same as much-heralded Arsenal. Amorim acknowledged that having more time to work with his players during the week is starting to pay dividends, even if some of their routines may have a familiar feel about them. “We work a lot and we learn a lot in England,” he said. “I think you are used to seeing [a lot of set piece goals]. You learn a lot with other teams how to do it and we are stealing a lot of things to score goals.”Ed AaronsMatch report:Crystal Palace 1-2 Manchester United3Paquetá owes West Ham after seeing redWith seven minutes remaining at West Ham, an uneasy Liverpool led 1-0 and there were signs that the home side might mount a late charge. Then Liverpool were awarded a free-kick on halfway. A furious Lucas Paquetá was booked for dissent. That was silly enough but what followed was far worse. As Milos Kerkez went down with cramp, Paquetá protested to the referee Darren England, who asked him to back away. Paquetá kept going. England gave him another warning. Alphonse Areola charged in to drag Paquetá away, but the Brazilian wouldn’t leave it. The referee had little option but to issue a second yellow and then a red. In effect it let Liverpool off the hook and ended West Ham’s hopes of an equaliser, a shameful loss of self-control that felt all the more egregious given how the club backed him before Paquetá wascleared of spot-fixingafter a two-year investigation by the Football Association.Jonathan WilsonMatch report:West Ham 0-2 LiverpoolView image in fullscreenWest Ham’s Lucas Paquetá shows his displeasure after being sent off against Liverpool.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock4Hutchinson has earned his chanceOmari Hutchinson will be wondering what he has to do in order to get a Premier League start at Nottingham Forest. The club-record signing made his seventh substitute appearance on Sunday, bringing much-needed energy and creativity to a team that was unable to compete for much of the first half. Playing on the right wing, Hutchinson was immediately dangerous, beating his man and putting crosses into the box. Despite costing £37.5m, the former Ipswich man is not registered for the Europa League, leaving him limited opportunities to get up to speed at his new club. In the previous home gameagainst Leeds, Hutchinson came on and changed the match in Forest’s favour, assisting a goal for Morgan Gibbs-White to earn the lead. It could be time to play Hutchinson from the start.Will UnwinMatch report:Nottingham Forest 0-2 Brighton5Emery sets new goals for VillaAston Villa have remedied several of their early-season problems to rack up seven wins in their past eight league matches, the latest coming at home to Wolves. The winning goal, a peach courtesy of Boubacar Kamara, again came from outside the box, where 56% of Villa’s league goals have originated this season. Villa are the Premier League’s form team, but Unai Emery acknowledged he has discussed the importance of boosting the goals-scored column; they have 16 in 13 matches, the lowest tally in the top half. On the final day of last season Villa missed out on a place in the Champions League on goal difference and Emery is keen to avoid a repeat. “We are analysing everything deeply,” said the Villa manager. “I am always worried about something or something we need to improve. We want to score goals and individually get numbers.”Ben FisherMatch report:Aston Villa 1-0 WolvesView image in fullscreenAston Villa’s Boubacar Kamara shows his joy after scoring against Wolves.Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/Shutterstock6Foden central to City plansPep Guardiola broadly concurs with the England manager, Thomas Tuchel, that Phil Foden is most potent centrally. “I agree with Thomas. I like Phil behind the striker, close to the box. The guys who have this sense of goal have to be close to the goal. But he can play as a winger.” Foden said of his two goals in victory a week after defeat at St James’ Park: “I was frustrated after Newcastle because I missed a few chances – it was eating me up. I wanted to put it right and I’m really thankful that it came off. I managed to score two crucial goals to help us win. That’s the kind of player I want to be. Deciding games and trying to be the player that people look to, to try and make a difference.”Jamie Jacksonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Saturday was the teenager’s 60th outing for the club, substitute appearances included, which is some accomplishment given the calibre of midfielders at Eddie Howe’s disposal. The Newcastle manager believes Miley can establish himself permanently. Howe said: “Lewis doesn’t get flustered about anything, he’s so calm, not your usual teenager. He’s always had athleticism but technically he is getting better. He’s got a challenge to get more game time with the midfield we have but I back him to do it.”Andy HunterMatch report:Everton 1-4 Newcastle8It’s just like watching BrentfordBrazil are blessed with wingers and wide forwards – Vinícius Júnior, Raphinha, Estêvão, Rodrygo, Savinho, Gabriel Martinelli – but do not have a reliable No 9. This year, Carlo Ancelotti has tried João Pedro, Richarlison, Marseille’s Luiz Henrique, Cruzeiro’s Kaio Jorge, Palmeiras’s Vitor Roque, Matheus Cunha (one goal in 15 appearances for club and country this season), Endrick (11 minutes for Real Madrid) and Forest’s Igor Jesus (no league goals) in that role, but no central strikers have scored any of Brazil’s 17 goals in 2025. Could theSeleçãoreally start next year’s World Cup with aBrentfordplayer up top? Keith Andrews hopes so, after Igor Thiago scored two against Burnley to bring his season total to 11 goals. “He is the top-scoring Brazilian in all of the major divisions, so it is pretty impressive really, isn’t it?” said the Bees’ manager. “[Playing for Brazil] is a big dream of his.”Michael ButlerMatch report:Brentford 3-1 BurnleyView image in fullscreenIgor Thiago scores Brentford’s first goal against Burnley from the penalty spot.Photograph: Tony O Brien/Reuters9Tottenham riddle testing FrankThomas Frank is in trouble at Tottenham: the paying public unconvinced at best, many minds already made up. His bedding-in period lasted no longer than theopening-day win over Burnley. Scaling up from the comforts of Brentford has so far looked beyond Frank. Spurs are a riddle he cannot solve, though the same was true of Ange Postecoglou, Antonio Conte, Nuno Espírito Santo and late-period Mauricio Pochettino. On Saturday, Frank hit out at those fans who jeered Guglielmo Vicario after the goalkeeper’s rush of blood led to Harry Wilson scoring Fulham’s second goal. “They can’t be true Tottenham fans,” was a provocative statement for customers paying high prices to see three home league wins this year. “I’m fine with them booing after the match, no problem,” was Frank’s attempt to clarify but the damage was done. This Saturday’s home game, against Brentford, takes on considerable importance.John BrewinMatch report:Tottenham 1-2 Fulham10Le Fée’s form hints at higher honoursEnzo Le Fée has often impressed in a largely left-wing role for Sunderland but the Frenchman always craved relocation to his preferred No 8 brief. That was the position Régis Le Bris envisaged his former Lorient protege filling when he signed Le Fée from Roma but, early this season, he struggled centrally, looking lightweight. AgainstBournemouthLe Bris brought the 25-year-old in from the left and he did not disappoint. It was not his fault Sunderland swiftly found themselves two goals down against a strong, rapidly counterattacking Bournemouth. But his stellar penalty execution dragged them back into things and he was involved in the preamble to Bertrand Traoré’s equaliser before supplying the corner that prefaced Brian Brobbey’s winner. Throw in numerous incisive, bravely creative passes, some important tackles and much selfless industry off the ball and Le Bris’s delight was understandable. “This was always my belief about Enzo,” said the Sunderland manager. “I think Enzo can be really strong in the middle of the pitch in this league so I’m very happy. If you play with three creative[central] midfielders like Enzo, Granit [Xhaka] and Noah [Sadiki] it’s really tough for opponents to manage that part of the pitch.” The “Le Fée for France” campaign starts here.Louise TaylorMatch report:Sunderland 3-2 BournemouthPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal1318302Man City1315253Chelsea1312244Aston Villa135245Brighton135226Sunderland134227Man Utd131218Liverpool130219Crystal Palace1362010Brentford1311911AFC Bournemouth13-21912Tottenham Hotspur1351813Newcastle1311814Everton13-31815Fulham13-21716Nottm Forest13-91217West Ham13-121118Leeds13-121119Burnley13-121020Wolverhampton13-212Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballArsenalManchester CityChelseaCrystal PalaceSunderlandAston VillafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Carolina’s defense intercepted Stafford twice with Mike Jackson returning one for a 48-yard touchdown and ended the 37-year-old’sNFLrecord of 28 straight TD passes without an interception. Derrick Brown, who tipped a ball resulting in one of Stafford’s first pick, came up with a key strip-sack with 2:25 left in the game to preserve the win. Stafford completed 18 of 28 passes for 243 yards with two touchdown passes to Davante Adams, his 13th and 14th of the season.Buffalo Bills 26-7 Pittsburgh SteelersThe Buffalo Bills (8-4) bounced back from a loss at Houston by pushing around the Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6). Josh Allen threw for a touchdown and ran for another, and Joey Bosa sacked Aaron Rodgers to spring Christian Benford for a game-tilting, 17-yard scoop-and-score. James Cook ran for 144 yards as the Bills piled up 249 yards on the ground and controlled the clock for nearly 42 minutes. Allen threw for just 123 yards on a windy day at Acrisure Stadium. His eight-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter essentially put the game away. It was the 76th rushing touchdown of Allen’s career, breaking the NFL record for touchdown runs by a quarterback that he briefly shared with Cam Newton.Houston Texans 20–16 Indianapolis ColtsAll of a sudden, there is a race in the AFC South after the Houston Texans won their fourth consecutive game, this one against divisional rivals the Indianapolis Colts. With quarterback CJ Stroud back in the lineup, the two-time defending South champion Texans got back in the division race. The Texans are 7-5, haven’t lost a division game this season and are third in the division, one win behind the Colts and Jaguars (8-4).Treylon Burks’ one-handed miracle catch draws comparisons to Odell Beckham’s Giants grabRead moreStroud completed 22 of 35 passes for 276 yards and one interception and Nico Collins caught five passes for 98 yards and ran for a score. Stroud was 9-of-13 passing in the second half, including 3 of 3 on third down. Houston’s defense held the NFL’s No 1 scoring offense to under 20 points for the first time this season and kept Colts running back Jonathan Taylor out of the end zone. Taylor had 85 rushing yards and 36 yards receiving. The Colts were stopped on seven of 10 third-down attempts.Denver Broncos 27-26 Washington Commanders (OT)The Denver Broncos moved to 10-2 on the season but they had to fight hard against the Washington Commanders (3-9), who pushed them into overtime. The Broncos held a 20-17 lead late in the fourth quarter until Marcus Mariota led a Commanders drive that ended in a game-tying field goal. RJ Harvey’s rushing touchdown in overtime put the Broncos up before the Commanders scored and then attempted a two-point conversion that would have won the game. However, Mariota’s pass was batted down as Denver celebrated their victory. Treylon Burks’ spectacular touchdown in regulationhad earlier lit up the game.San Francisco 49ers 26–8 Cleveland BrownsBrock Purdy rushed for a touchdown and passed for another score in the second half, and the San Francisco 49ers (9-4) spoiled Shedeur Sanders’ first home start for the Cleveland Browns (3-9). San Francisco scored 19 unanswered points after trailing in the second quarter. All three of their touchdowns come from short fields, capitalizing on turnovers and a long punt return. Purdy completed 16 of 29 passes for 168 yards. San Francisco star Christian McCaffrey added 74 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. Sanders passed for 149 yards and a touchdown for Cleveland.Minnesota Vikings 0-26 Seattle SeahawksThe Seattle Seahawks (9-3) shut out an opponent for the first time in more than a decade in their win over the Minnesota Vikings (4-8). Ernest Jones IV had the first of five takeaways by the Seahawks’ dominant defense. Jones returned an interception 84 yards for a touchdown. Seattle’s most recent shutout win was 26-0 over Chicago in September 2015. This one was a mismatch, with the Seahawks going against an undrafted rookie quarterback in Max Brosmer. Seattle moved into a first-place tie with the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC West, while Minnesota lost their fourth straight.Arizona Cardinals 17–20 Tampa Bay BuccaneersBaker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-5) have snapped a three-game skid with victory over the Arizona Cardinals (3-9). Mayfield tossed a two-yard touchdown pass to All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs and Tampa Bay’s defense held in the final two minutes. Mayfield started after sitting out the second half of a 34-7 loss to the Rams because of a left shoulder injury. He threw for 194 yards and ran for 27 to help the Bucs remain first in the NFC South. Arizona have lost four straight and nine of 10.Las Vegas Raiders 14–31 Los Angeles ChargersJustin Herbert threw two touchdown passes while playing through an injury to his non-throwing hand, and Kimani Vidal made a 59-yard scoring run during the Los Angeles Chargers’ victory over the spiraling Las Vegas Raiders (2-10). Quentin Johnston and Ladd McConkey made TD catches and Vidal rushed for a career-high 126 yards as the Chargers (8-4) beat their longtime AFC West rivals for the fourth straight time. Geno Smith passed for 165 yards and threw two touchdown passes to Brock Bowers in the sixth consecutive loss by the Raiders, who have just one victory since Week 1.Jacksonville Jaguars 25–3 Tennessee TitansTrevor Lawrence threw for 229 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Jacksonville Jaguars to a 25-3 win over the Tennessee Titans. The win moves Jacksonville (8-4) into a tie with the Indianapolis Colts atop the AFC South heading into the first of two matchups between the teams next week. The Jaguars outgained the Titans (1-11) 272-188. Tennessee were 2-for-12 on third downs and 1-for-4 on fourth downs.

But Frank, who will face his former side Brentford at home on Saturday, said he is very confident he retains the long-term backing of the new Spurs management group led by Vinai Venkatesham, the chief executive, afterDaniel Levy’s surprise departure in September.“It seems like they’re good guys, intelligent people,” Frank said. “They know how to run businesses and are learning about football, learning more now they’ve become owners.“When we’re dealing with intelligent people they can see every successful dynasty, every successful club has taken time. Yes, you have one where you maybe win one year or the second year, but you can’t sustain it if you don’t build something sustainable.”Frank also rejected suggestions he has already lost the support of a section of the Spurs fanbase and called on all supporters to get behind his team. “I’m pretty sure every fan wants to win and wants to support,” he said.“If you’re not going to plan, then maybe some get more frustrated than others.

The prospect of a lifetime ban hung over the 28-year-old, who wascleared of the Football Association charges in July, and the incident against Liverpool has left West Ham looking for ways to improve the player’s frame of mind.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s footballRead moreWest Ham do not view Paquetá’s anger with the authorities as an excuse for him collecting two yellow cards, both for dissent, within seconds of one another during the2-0 defeat against the Premier League champions. There has been internal criticism of Paquetá, whose dismissal came with Liverpool only leading 1-0. It is felt at West Ham that he let down his teammates.However the club, who stood by Paquetá while he was under investigation by the FA, feel the situation is nuanced. One figure said Paquetá has been left “bitter and let down” by the investigation, argued that the pressure got to him and added that the former Lyon midfielder would find it easier to move on from the ordeal if he is provided with psychological support. West Ham, only out of the bottom three on goal difference, will discuss this week how to help the Brazilian regain his focus on the pitch.Paquetá, who came close to being sent off for dissent whenWest Ham lost against Leeds in October, has made no secret of his unhappiness. The South American, who will be suspended when Nuno Espírito Santo’s struggling side visit Manchester United on Thursday,posted on social mediaafter the Liverpool game to hit out at football’s authorities for failing to provide him with psychological support. The FA has been approached for comment.Writing in Portuguese, Paquetá said: “I understand that now I have to come across as the villain; it’s hard to live with everything that’s been caused in my life and in my psyche! I’ll keep trying to ensure they don’t affect me even more. This doesn’t justify my expulsion, and for that I apologise to the fans and my teammates!”This was followed by a reply to a post from the Sky Sports Premier League account, which featured a clip where Robert Green, the former West Ham goalkeeper on punditry duty for the broadcaster, referring to his red card as “ridiculous behaviour”. This time writing in English, Paquetá posted: “It’s ridiculous to have your life and career affected for two years without any psychological support from the federation. Perhaps this ridiculous behaviour is just a reflection of everything I’ve had to endure and, it seems, have to continue enduring! I’m sorry if I’m not perfect.”West Ham have taken note of the posts and are not underestimating their significance. At this stage there is little indication of them looking to discipline Paquetá for his red card. There is, however, a point when their sympathy will run out. They are in a relegation battle and are looking to Paquetá, who is one of their most influential players, to lead them to safety. However the playmaker’s form remains inconsistent and there are some who feel that West Ham should look to raise funds for new signings by selling him in January.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Paquetá has four goals in all competitions this season and has not provided an assist since March 2024. His disciplinary record is also a concern; he has already served a one-match ban for accumulating five bookings this season.Another worry for West Ham is why Paquetá’s teammates did not do more to prevent him from confronting the referee Darren England over his decision to award a free-kick for a foul by Niclas Füllkrug. It has not gone unnoticed that the Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker made the biggest effort to drag Paquetá away.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

If the 26-year-old is cautioned in City’s next six games he will become the first goalkeeper to receive a one-match ban for accumulating five Premier League bookings.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s footballRead moreAlthough 12 goalkeepers have received five or more cautions in a Premier League season, none did so quickly enough to be banned – the mark is five yellows in the first 19 league matches.Guardiola was asked whether he would speak to Donnarumma,a summer signing from Paris Saint-Germain. “No, he is adult enough,” the manager said. “For sure, we will step-by-step understand things in the league and new behaviours.”The contract ofPhil Foden, who scored twice against Leeds, including the winner, expires in summer 2027 and Guardiolasaid: “Hopefully he can stay all his career here. He is a special player, a Man City fan from the academy.”Foden has three goals in 11 league appearances this season, second at City to Erling Haaland, who has scored 14 times in 13 games. Guardiola believes Foden’s goal tally can end in the high teens, as it did two seasons ago when he got 19.“The years where we’ve been successful, not just the strikers [but] especially wingers, attacking midfielders [score many],” Guardiola said. “So we need that. ”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mostly, in truth, it hadn’t been, but it was in the moment when he had illuminated everything, taking Batista Mendy, César Azpilicueta and Kike Salas out for a walk – first this way, then that – and it was now, the 144th Seville derby finally ending 20 minutes behind schedule and with aReal Betiswin.“You dream of playing games like this, just playing them,” Fornals said as high in the south-east corner of the Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán Stadium, 600 supporters in green sang, adding: “so to score and win, well, me, my teammates, all those lunatics up there and back home, you can imagine how happy we are”.European football: Olmo double takes Barca top; Díaz fires up Bayern’s late rallyRead moreImagine it? You could hear it, celebrations just getting started on the pitch and in the stands. You could see it on their faces too, all except Antony who was wearing civvies, a blue cap on backwards and a cut-out Isco mask. The Brazilian and the brother he had “become”, had missed the game that consumes the city, the end of the world every time. One suspended, one injured, two wild swipes had done it: two moments so silly it was hard not to laugh and Antony actually cried, live on TV, while everyone else feared the worse. Now though, he too was happy, cameras on him again as he headed down to the pitch to piggy-back teammates and wrap a flag around Fornals, whose outrageous opening goal had set up a 2-0 win.On a Sunday afternoon when the game was stopped after objects were thrown, the two teams taken off for 15 minutes and brought back out again for just two more, Betis won a Sevilla derby at the Sánchez-Pizjuán for the first time sincethat“Kings Night” 5-3 in 2018. It was also the first time they ever had with Manuel Pellegrini in charge. At 72, here was something new: two days after the engineer who never wanted to be a coach in the first place and became the best they have ever had – the best Málaga and Villarreal have too – had extended his contract for two more years.View image in fullscreenReal Betis’s fans have had to wait a good few years to see their team prevail at the Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán Stadium.Photograph: Jose Luis Contreras/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“There is no A team and no B team,” Pellegrini said, but he does so love it when a plan comes together and here it had. Well, sort of. This didn’t quite play out the way he expected. Three days before, Isco had been accidentally booted by Sofyan Amrabat, his own teammate, ruling them both out just as Isco had returned from a four-month absence. The same night, Antony discovered his appeal against a red card for an acrobatic overhead kick on Joel Roca’s face had been turned down. And the next morning, Giovani Lo Celso had left a clinic saying there was still hope, yet that had gone too. In 24 hours, perhaps three of Betis’s four best players found out they couldn’t play. The good news was that one could, and can he play.When Antony found out about the ban after Betis’s Europa League win over Utrecht, his voice cracked, his head shook slowly, his eyes started to sting, and silence fell. “It’s a sad moment; there was no bad intention,” he said, eventually. “It’s the most important game of the year. I’m sad and angry because I wanted to be there with my teammates.” Which in the end he was, if not quite as he wanted: having watched Betis win from a glass fronted box, a shield against the gestures he threw at the fans and the things they threw back, he joined celebrations. Isco meanwhile was at home watching on telly, seven stitches in his foot.They hadn’t exactly seen a classic, which in truth the derbies rarely are. The first half wasn’t so much bad as just nothing at all, 45 minutes that might as well not have been played. The second half took over an hour after objects were thrown, Azpilicueta sweeping up the lighters from the pitch and appealing for fans to stop, both teams and their managers gathered in a huddle in the middle of the pitch before the referee took them off. By the time they came back 15 minutes later, police climbing into the stands, the place was half empty. There were only two minutes left and, 2-0 down to Fornals’ opener and Sergi Altimira’s superbly taken second,still without a win since battering Barcelona, many didn’t see the point in hanging round any longer and couldn’t take much more.View image in fullscreenSergi Altimira scored Betis’s second goal after the ball deflected into his path in the box following a set piece.Photograph: José Manuel Vidal/EPADiario deSevillasaid José ÁngelCarmona played as if he was “driving around London”. Whatever they meant, and you would like to think it was that he just sat there, never actually moving and getting increasingly angry, it probably wasn’t a good thing. They also asked if Akor Adams and Fornals were playing the same sport. Just about the only time Isaac Romero made proper contact, it was with Valentín Gómez’s legs. At times, Azpilicueta seemed to be trying to hold together the defence on his own. And if there is an obvious pun to use when it comes to Odysseas Vlachodimos, there’s an even more obvious one in Spanish: said out loud, the Sevilla goalkeeper’s surname basically means “we fucked it up”.“Every time we made a big mistake, we had to kick off again,” the Sevilla coach, Matías Almeyda said, and there was something in that. There was even more in his admission that his thoughts were not for sharing – “I can’t and shouldn’t express them” – and that he had reached the point where he was no longer sure what the solution is. A long, largely aimless punt from keeper Álvaro Valles and a horrible error from Mendy started it all, leading to the first goal. “After that mistake, everything changes,” Almeyda said. “When you make a mistake in a derby, anyone can collapse. There’s a desperation to show passion without thinking.”And yet for all the absentees, for all the passion, the noise and the nerves, all that usual stuff about there being no favourites and no league positions, the form book defenestrated, in the end the analysis is very basic: Betis are just better, Sunday’s rivalry revealing an inescapable reality. Sevilla have the lowest salary limit inLa Ligaand spent zero euros in the summer. Almeyda is the seventh coach Pellegrini has faced in this fixture and his players are not as good. On Sunday, perhaps the best of them, Rubén Vargas and Gabriel Suazo, were missing. And if Betis’s best were missing too, Antony and Isco out, there is a strength in depth, other footballers on the bench.Fornals first among them. While Mendy’s error had been catastrophic, it still took something special to make the opening goal of it and Fornals delivered. Dispossessing Mendy, he went left, taking three players with him, then cut back right again leaving two of them on the floor, Azpilicueta and Salas sliding by like cartoon characters off a cliff, before beating Vlachodimos.Quick GuideLa Liga  resultsShowReal Sociedad 2-3 Villarreal, Sevilla 0-2 Real Betis, Celta Vigo 0-1 Espanyol, Girona 1-1 Real Madrid, Mallorca 2-2 Osasuna, Barcelona 3-1 Alavés, Levante 0-2 Athletic Club, Atlético Madrid 2-0 Real Oviedo, Getafe 1-0 ElcheWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I’ve watched it back a few times,” Fornals said later. “Because I remembered robbing the ball but not the cut backs and all that stuff.” Everyone else did. There was a reason Antony looked for Fornals when he came on at the end: funny, likable, the perfect teammate and a superb footballer. When he was 16 and playing in Málaga’s academy, Fornals would go to watch Isco play in the first team; now, 12 years later, Isco, watching from home, posted a message to the former West Ham midfielder putting himself “at your feet”. This was a good time, Isco insisted, for Fornals to ask for anything he wanted, your wish my command. “What a way to play football,” he wrote.Nor was it just the goal, Fornals’ third of the season. Luis Milla is the only non Madrid or Barcelona player with more assists. From deep midfield – a new role found for him as Pellegrini squeezes as many technical ball-players in as he can – or further forward, he has become vital, as good a midfielder as any Spain has in La Liga right now.When the Betis president said last week that they had to fight the pessimism as the players fell, Amrabat injuring Isco and himself, standing there with a guilty look, and Antony’s appeal falling on death ears, he could do so with some confidence. And so it was, the Sánchez-Pizjuán becoming Betis’s place. “New King,” one cover went for, Fornals crowned.“The goal was nice, but what I hold on to is that we have been able to take that weight off our shoulders: that’s really important for the recent history of the derbies,” he said. “This is a real high. I don’t know if my kids saw it, but tomorrow, I’ll tell them all about the battle.”PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona1423342Real Madrid1416333Villarreal1416324Atletico Madrid1416315Real Betis148246Espanyol142247Getafe14-2208Athletic Bilbao14-3209Real Sociedad14-21610Elche14-21611Rayo Vallecano13-21612Celta Vigo14-31613Sevilla14-41614Alaves14-31515Mallorca14-71316Valencia13-91317Osasuna14-61218Girona14-131219Levante14-10920Oviedo14-159Explore more on these topicsLa LigaReal BetisSevillaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If the owner, 49ers Enterprises, is to make a change it wants a new manager in charge in time to have input over January transfers.Multiple sources at Leeds have conceded that Farke’s fate is in the balance, although there is sympathy for him in some quarters owing to a belief that results have not reflected some positive performances.The 49ers also have a stake in the ownership group at Rangers, wholast week sackedthe chief executive, Patrick Stewart, and sporting director, Kevin Thelwell, havingremoved Russell Martinas head coach after 17 games in October. The Leeds chair, Paraag Marathe, is the vice-chair at Rangers.Leeds will have money to spend in January, with the 49ers ­desperate to keep the club in the Premier League, not least because they have committed tens of millions of pounds to redeveloping the ground, with architects BDP appointed to oversee a ­project that will increase the capacity to more than 53,000.Farke came close to being sackeddays afterleading the club to promotionlast season owing to doubts about his ability to keep the club in the Premier League, but after talks with the Marathe he wasbacked to start the season. Significantly, Farke was not given a new contract, indicating that to some extent he remained on trial.Farke was backed with significant transfer money, with Leeds spending more than £100m on 10 players.The manager has bemoaned the failure to sign more attacking options, with the striker Patrick Bamford released at the end of August without being replaced. Some at the club have raised questions about the quality of the players he brought in with accusations he favoured physicality over technical quality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, senior officers believe clubs and not the taxpayer should pay the £71m per season it costs to maintain law and order in surrounding areas as well as in stadiums on matchdays. Football League games, international rugby and cricket matches and the London Marathon could all be affected if the plans go ahead, along with events such as the Notting Hill carnival and Pride.The costs in some cases could be steep, with policing for the recent Europa League match between Aston Villa and Maccabi Tel Aviv reported to have cost £2m. Another source said that if Millwall were to face Leeds, the home club would be expected to foot a bill of more than £100,000 for policing if costs for outside the ground were also included.News that the government was considering such plans emerged in March when the Times reported that Cheshire police chief ­constable, Mark Roberts, head of the UK ­Football Policing Unit, revealed he had been lobbying ministers on the issue. According to figures provided by the UKFPU, the total bill for police services for football in England and Wales for the 2023-24 season was £71.69m, of which clubs paid £14.87m – 20.7%.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Roberts argued that removing the remaining £56.82m burden from the taxpayer would mean that 1,200 additional officers could be deployed on Britain’s streets. He also suggested it was unfair thattop football clubscould spend close to £400m in a single transfer window but pay a fraction of that to police games and expressed his frustration that the government was moving at a “glacial pace” on the issue.In response, the Football Association, Rugby Football Union, England & Wales Cricket Board, Jockey Club, Silverstone and Boat Race sent a joint letter to Keir Starmer via the Major Event Organisers Association in April, ­warning that the “ill-thought-out change would damage a crucial ­sector of the economy”. The group added: “We are gravely concerned at the approach Mr Roberts has chosen to take. All our members would be impacted by the change in the law which he is advocating. This is simply not just a Premier League football issue.”However it now appears the Home Office is determined to scrutinise the issue more closely. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Policing major events costs forces tens of millions each year and strains frontline resources. Our priority will always be keeping the public safe.That is why we’re adding 3,000 neighbourhood officers on the beat as part of our Plan for Change.“We are exploring ways to recover more of these costs. Our consultation will listen to all evidence to ensure any changes strike the right balance – also recognising the importance of these events to our economy and culture.”Explore more on these topicsFootball politicsPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Wednesday were handed a12-point deduction in October after being placed into administrationby former owner Dejphon Chansiri, who has also been banned for being an owner or director of an EFL club for a period of three years.“Following earlier media reports, the EFL can confirm that Sheffield Wednesday FC are to be deducted six points with immediate effect for multiple breaches of EFL Regulations relating to payment obligations, with Mr Dejphon Chansiri prohibited from being an owner or director of any EFL Club for a period of three years,” the EFL said in a statement. “While matters remain ongoing in respect of the issues being considered by the independent Club Financial Reporting Unit, for alleged breaches in the 2025-26 season prior to the Club entering administration, the League can confirm that it is not seeking any further points deductions from the Club.“Separately, the EFL and Sheffield Wednesday remain in discussions regarding its appeal against the fee restriction, which is currently set to run until the end of the winter 2027 transfer window. This is likely to be resolved as part of the Club’s exit from administration.”Wednesday have won one game all season – a 2-0 victory at Portsmouth on 20 September – and have lost their last four matches, which including a3-0 defeat to Sheffield United at Hillsborough last month.Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdaynewsShareReuse this content"

The verdict is likely to be announced on Wednesday.As South Africa closed in ona record 73-0 win in Cardiff, Etzebeth clashed with the Welsh back-row Alex Mann, appearing to make contact with his opponent’s left eye in a fracas involving several players from both sides.With two minutes left at the ­Principality Stadium, the 34‑year‑old was shown a red card by the referee, Luc Ramos, after a review with the television match official, Eric Gauzins. “You have a clear ­finger in the eyes, so for me, it’s a ­permanent red card,” Ramos said during the review.A ban would be a blow to ­Etzebeth’s club, the Sharks, who begin their Champions Cup campaign in Toulouse on Sunday before hosting ­Saracens in Durban six days later. The maximum ban for making intentional contact with an opponent’s eyes is four years, while an offence at the lowest end of the scale may result in a four-week suspension.A mid-range offence could involve an eight-week ban and a top-end offence 12 weeks, with any ban’s length potentially reduced in light of his previously good disciplinary record, and other submissions made by Etzebeth’s team.A number of factors will be con­sidered, including the fact that ­Etzebeth reportedly apologised to Mann after the match. Should the panel find that Etzebeth intentionally eye-gouged his opponent, however, a long ban seems guaranteed.“I don’t know what I can say now that won’t be controversial,” Rassie Erasmus, South Africa’s head coach, said on Saturday. “It didn’t look good, I think it was a justified red card. How it happened and why it happened, and if he was provoked, I’m not sure. But that’s definitely not the way we would have liked to end the game.”In January, the South Africa wing and Etzebeth’s clubmate, Makazole Mapimpi, was banned for three matches having admitted making contact with the eye area of an opponent in a United Rugby Championship encounter against Cardiff. Mapimpi had previously been banned for two weeks for a similar incident involving Maxime Lucu, of Bordeaux, in 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That gap means Norris can finish third rather than second at the title-deciding finale in Abu Dhabi this weekend and still claim the championship from Verstappen, who is in second place.Norris and Piastri voice frustration at McLaren’s strategy as title race goes to finaleRead moreAt the end of the race the Dutch driver’s engineer Gianpiero Lambiase told him over the radio that it looked like Antonelli had “just pulled over and let Norris through”. Those comments were then exacerbated by the Red Bull motorsport adviser, Helmut Marko, who said Antonelli had “waved” Norris past.The 19-year-old, who is very friendly with Verstappen, received a swathe of online abuse. He turned his profile picture on Instagram black, while Mercedes identified what they describe as “more than 1,100 severe or suspect” comments, “several of which were death threats” on Antonelli’s social media. The team identified another 330 “severe or suspect” comments on their own social media. The team have reported the incidents to the FIA’s United Against Online Abuse campaign.After the race the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, called the comments “brainless” and “total utter nonsense”. He said he had confronted Lambiase, who had apologised, and on Monday Red Bull issued a statement offering their apologies for provoking the abuse.“Comments made before the end of and immediately after the Qatar GP suggesting that Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli had deliberately allowedLando Norristo overtake him are clearly incorrect,” Red Bull said. “Replay footage shows Antonelli momentarily losing control of his car, thus allowing Norris to pass him. We sincerely regret that this has led to Kimi receiving online abuse.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Mercedes GPRed BullLando NorrisMcLarenMotor sportFormula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

The Wallabies are already locked into Group A as hosts, and will be paired with one of the world’s top six from band one – South Africa, New Zealand, England, Ireland, France or Argentina.View image in fullscreenMax Jorgensen runs to score a try against France last month.Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty ImagesThe other two teams in Australia’s pool will come from emerging rugby nations. One possible group would be Argentina, Australia, USA and Samoa; another is England, Australia, Uruguay and Hong Kong.The top two in each group will progress to the 16-team knockout round, which also includes the four third-placed teams with the most points.One of those teams will meet the winner of Australia’s pool, but even if the Wallabies finish second – in line with their current ranking – they will only meet a runner-up from another group, thereby avoiding a likely top seed in the round of 16.It’s a decided advantage for the hosts, given runners-up in pool B and pool D face other group winners.While stadiums for some matches are locked in, including the first match at Perth’s Optus Stadium and the final at Accor Stadium in Sydney, there is uncertainty around others.There is still a possibility Victoria’s two last-16 and seven pool matches include a fixture at the MCG. However, the state government’s multi-year deal with the NFL has left organisers in limbo.The tournament runs between the start of October and mid-November, overlapping the early weeks of the 2027-28 NFL season.

The workers flow the other way into San Francisco for OpenAI and Anthropic, AI startups worth a combined half a trillion dollars – as long as the much-predicted AI bubble doesn’t explode.Breakthroughs come at an accelerating pace with every week bringing the release of a significant new AI development.Every time we reach the summit of bullshit mountain, we discover there’s worse to come.Alex Hanna, co-author of The AI ConAnthropic’s co-founder Dario Amodei predicts AGIcould be reached by 2026 or 2027. OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, reckons progress is so fast that he could soon be able to make an AI to replace him as boss.“Everyone is working all the time,” said Madhavi Sewak, a senior leader at Google DeepMind, in a recent talk. “It’s extremely intense. There doesn’t seem to be any kind of natural stopping point, and everyone is really kind of getting ground down. Even the folks who are very wealthy now … all they do is work. I see no change in anyone’s lifestyle. No one’s taking a holiday. People don’t have time for their friends, for their hobbies, for … the people they love.”These are the companies racing to shape, control and profit from AGI – what Amodei describes as “a country of geniuses in a datacentre”. They are tearing towards a technology that could, in theory, sweep away millions of white-collar jobs and pose serious risks in bioweapons and cybersecurity.$2.8tnForecast for spending on AI datacentres by the end of the decadeOr it could usher in a new era of abundance, health and wealth. Nobody is sure but we will soon find out. For now, the uncertainty energises and terrifies the Bay Area.It is all being backed by huge new bets from the Valley’s venture capitalists, whichmore than doubledin the last year, leading to talk of a dangerous bubble. The Wall Street brokerage Citigroup in September uprated its forecast for spending on AI datacentres by the end of the decade to $2.8tn – more than the entire annual economic outputs of Canada, Italy or Brazil.Yet amid all the money and the optimism, there are other voices that do not swallow the hype. As Alex Hanna, a co-author of the dissenting bookThe AI Con, put it: “Every time we reach the summit of bullshit mountain, we discover there’s worse to come.”View image in fullscreenRows of servers  at Facebook’s Fort Worth datacentre in Texas.Photograph: Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNSArriving atSanta ClaraThe brute force of the ‘screamers’“This is where AI comes to life,” yelled Chris Sharp.Racks of multimillion-dollar microprocessors in black steel cages roared like jet engines inside a windowless industrial shed in Santa Clara, at the southern end of the Caltrain commuter line.The 120-decibel din made it almost impossible to hear Digital Realty’s chief technology officer showing off his “screamers”.To hear it is to feel in your skull the brute force involved in the the development of AI technology. Five minutes’ exposure left ears ringing for hours. It is the noise of air coolers chilling sensitive supercomputers rented out to AI companies to train their models and answer billions of daily prompts – from how to bake a brownie to how to target lethal military drones.Nearby were more AI datacentres, operated by Amazon, Google, the Chinese company Alibaba, Meta and Microsoft. Santa Clara is also home to Nvidia, the quartermaster to the AI revolution, which through the sale of its market-leading technology has seen a 30-fold increase in its value since 2020 and is worth $4.3tn. Even larger datacentres are being built not only across the US but in China, India and Europe. The next frontier is launching datacentres into space.View image in fullscreenThe Stargate AI datacentre under construction in Abilene, Texas.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesMeta isbuilding a facilityin Louisianalarge enough to cover much of Manhattan. Google is reported to be planning a $6bn centre in India and is investing £1bn in an AI datacentre just north of London. Even a relatively modest Google AI factory planned in Essex is expected to emit theequivalent carbon footprintof 500 short-haul flights a week.Powered by a local gas-fired power station, the stacks of circuits in one room at the Digital Realty datacentre in Santa Clara devoured the same energy as 60 houses. A long white corridor opening on to room after room of more “screamers” stretched into the distance.Sometimes the on-duty engineers notice the roar drops to a steadier growl when demand from the tech companies drops. It is never long until the scream resumes.View image in fullscreenMountain View train station.Photograph: Christie Hemm Klok/The GuardianArriving atMountain View‘If it’s all gas, no brakes, that’s a terrible outcome’Ride the train three stops north from Santa Clara to Mountain View and the roar fades. The computer scientists who actually rely on the screamers work in more peaceful surroundings.On a sprawling campus set among rustling pines, Google DeepMind’s US headquarters looks more like a circus tent than a laboratory. Staff glide up in driverless Waymo taxis, powered by Google’s AI. Others pedal in on Google-branded yellow, red, blue and green bicycles.View image in fullscreenGoogle’s headquarters in Mountain View, California.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesGoogle DeepMind is in the leading pack of US AI companies jockeying for first place in a race reaching new levels of competitive intensity.This has been the year of sports-star salaries for twentysomething AI specialists and the emergence of boisterous new competitors, such as Elon Musk’s xAI, Zuckerberg’s superintelligence project and DeepSeek in China.There has also been a widening openness about the double-edged promise of AGI, which can leave the impression of AI companies accelerating and braking at the same time. For example, 30 of Google DeepMind’s brightest mindswrote this springthat AGI posed risks of “incidents consequential enough to significantly harm humanity”.By September, the company was alsoexplaininghow it would handle “AI models with powerful manipulative capabilities that could be misused to systematically and substantially change beliefs and behaviours … reasonably resulting in additional expected harm at severe scale”.Such grave warnings feel dissonant among the interior of the headquarters’ playful bubbly tangerine sofas, Fatboy beanbags and colour-coded work zones with names such as Coral Cove and Archipelago.View image in fullscreenTom Lue of Google DeepMind.Photograph: Ben Peter Catchpole/PR Image“The most interesting, yet challenging aspect of my job is [working out] how we get that balance between being really bold, moving at velocity, tremendous pace and innovation, and at the same time doing it responsibly, safely, ethically,” said Tom Lue, a Google DeepMind vice-president with responsibility for policy, legal, safety and governance, who stopped work for 30 minutes to talk to the Guardian.Donald Trump’s White House takes a permissive approach to AI regulation and there is no comprehensive nationwide legislation in the US or the UK. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist known as a godfather of AI, saidin a Ted Talkthis summer: “A sandwich has more regulation than AI.”The competitors have therefore found they bear responsibility for setting the limits of what AIs should be allowed to do.“Our calculus is not so much looking over our shoulders at what [the other] companies are doing, but how do we make sure that we are the ones in the lead, so that we have influence in impacting how this technology is developed and setting the norms across society,” said Lue. “You have to be in a position of strength and leadership to set that.”The question of whose AGI will dominate is never far away. Will it be that of people like Lue, a former Obama administration lawyer, and his boss, the Nobel prize-winning DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis? Will it be Musk’s or Zuckerberg’s? Altman’s or Amodei’s at Anthropic? Or, as the White House fears, will it be China’s?“If it’s just a race and all gas, no brakes and it’s basically a race to the bottom, that’s a terrible outcome for society,” said Lue, who is pushing for coordinated action between the racers and governments.But strict state regulation may not be the answer either. “We support regulation that’s going to help AI be delivered to the world in a way that’s positive,” said Helen King, Google DeepMind’s vice-president for responsibility. “The tricky part is always how do you regulate in a way that doesn’t actually slow down the good guys and give the bad guys loopholes.”‘Scheming’ and sabotageThe frontier AI companies know they are playing with fire as they make more powerful systems that approach AGI.OpenAI hasrecently been suedby the family of a 16-year-old who killed himself with encouragement from ChatGPT – and in November seven more suitswere filedalleging the firm rushed out an update to ChatGPT without proper testing, which, in some cases, acted as a “suicide coach”.View image in fullscreenAdam Raine.Photograph: Courtesy of the Raine familyOpen AI called the situation “heartbreaking” and said it was taking action.The company has also described how it hasdetectedthe way models can provide misleading information. This could mean something as simple as pretending to have completed an unfinished task. But the fear at OpenAI is that in the future, the AIs could “suddenly ‘flip a switch’ and begin engaging in significantly harmful scheming”.Anthropicrevealedin November that its Claude Code AI, widely seen as the best system for automating computer programming, was used by a Chinese state-sponsored group in “the first documented case of a cyber-attack largely executed without human intervention at scale”.Wake the f up. This is going to destroy us – sooner than we think”US senator on XIt sent shivers through some. “Wake the f up,” said one US senator on X. “This is going to destroy us – sooner than we think”. By contrast, Prof Yann LeCun, who is about to step down after 12 years as Meta’s chief AI scientist, said Anthropic was “scaring everyone” to encourage regulation that might hinder rivals.Tests of other state-of-the-art modelsfoundthey sometimes sabotaged programming intended to ensure humans can interrupt them, a worrying trait called “shutdown resistance”.But with nearly$2bn a weekin new venture capital investment pouring into generative AI in the first half of 2025, the pressure to realise profits will quickly rise. Tech companies realised they could make fortunes from monetising human attention on social media platforms that caused serious social problems. The fear is that profit maximisation in the age of AGI could result in far greater adverse consequences.View image in fullscreenPalo Alto Caltrain station.Photograph: Christie Hemm Klok/The GuardianArriving atPalo Alto‘It’s really hard to opt out now’Three stops north, the Caltrain hums into Palo Alto station. It is a short walk to Stanford University’s grand campus where donations from Silicon Valley billionaires lubricate a fast flow of young AI talent into the research divisions of Google DeepMind, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta.Elite Stanford graduates rise fast in the Bay Area tech companies, meaning people in their 20s or early 30s are often in powerful positions in the race to AGI. Past Stanford students include Altman, Open AI’s chair, Bret Taylor, and Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai. More recent Stanford alumni include Isa Fulford, who at just 26 is already one of OpenAI’s research leads. She works on ChatGPT’s ability to take actions on humans’ behalf – so-called “agentic” AI.View image in fullscreenIsa Fulford, a researcher at OpenAI.Photograph: Winni Wintermeyer/The Guardian“One of the strange moments is reading in the news about things that you’re experiencing,” she told the Guardian.After growing up in London, Fulford studied computer science at Stanford and quickly joined OpenAI where she is now at the centre of one of the most important aspects of the AGI race – creating models that can direct themselves towards goals, learn and adapt.She is involved in setting decision boundaries for these increasingly autonomous AI agents so they know how to respond if asked to carry out tasks that could trigger cyber or biological risks and to avoid unintended consequences. It is a big responsibility, but she is undaunted.“It does feel like a really special moment in time,” she said. “I feel very lucky to be working on this.”Such youth is not uncommon. One stop north, at Meta’s Menlo Park campus, the head of Zuckerberg’s push for “superintelligence” is 28-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) dropout Alexandr Wang. One of his lead safety researchers is 31. OpenAI’s vice-president of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, is 30.Silicon Valley has always run on youth, and if experience is needed more can be found in the highest ranks of the AI companies. But most senior leaders of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, X and Meta are much younger than the chief executives of the largest US public companies, whose median age is57.“The fact that they have very little life experience is probably contributing to a lot of their narrow and, I think, destructive thinking,” said Catherine Bracy, a former Obama campaign operative who runs the TechEquity campaign organisation.One senior researcher, employed recently at a big AI company, added: “The [young staff] are doing their best to do what they think is right, but if they have to go toe-to-toe and challenge executives they are just less experienced in the ways of corporate politics.”Another factor is that the sharpest AI researchers who used to spend years in university labs are snapped up faster than ever by private companies chasing AGI. This brain drain concentrates power in the hands of profit-motivated owners and their venture capitalist backers.You have to make sure that the benefits are spread through society, rather than benefiting Elon Musk.”John Etchemendy, co-director, Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial IntelligenceJohn Etchemendy, a 73-year-old former provost of Stanford who is now a co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, has warned of a growing capability gap between the public and private sectors.“It is imbalanced because it’s such a costly technology,” he said. “Early on, the companies working on AI were very open about the techniques they were using. They published, and it was quasi-academic. But then [they] started cracking down and saying, ‘No, we don’t want to talk about … the technology under the hood, because it’s too important to us – it’s proprietary’.”Etchemendy, an eminent philosopher and logician, first started working on AI in the 1980s to translate instruction manuals for Japanese consumer electronics.From his office in the Gates computer science building on Stanford’s campus, he now calls on governments to create a counterweight to the huge AI firms by investing in a facility for independent, academic research. It would have a similar function to the state-funded Cern organisation for high-energy physics on the France-Switzerland border. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, hascalledfor something similar andadvocates believeit could steer the technology towards trustworthy, public interest outcomes.“These are technologies that are going to produce the greatest boost in productivity ever seen,” Etchemendy said. “You have to make sure that the benefits are spread through society, rather than benefiting Elon Musk.”But such a body feels a world away from the gold-rush fervour of the race towards AGI.24The median age of entrepreneurs now being funded by the startup incubator Y CombinatorOne evening over burrata salad and pinot noir at an upmarket Italian restaurant, a group of twentysomething AI startup founders were encouraged to give their “hot takes” on the state of the race by their venture capitalist host.They were part of a rapidly growing community of entrepreneurs hustling to apply AI to real world money-making ideas and there was zero support for any brakes on progress towards AGI to allow for its social impacts to be checked. “We don’t do that in Silicon Valley,” said one. “If everyone here stops, it still keeps going,” said another. “It’s really hard to opt out now.”At times, their statements were startling. One founder matter-of-factly said they intended to sell their fledgling company, which would generate AI characters to exist autonomously on social media, for more than $1bn.Another declared: “Morality is best thought of as a machine-learning problem.” Their neighbour said AI meant every cancer would be cured in 10 years.This community of entrepreneurs is getting younger. The median age of those being funded by the San Francisco startup incubator Y Combinator has dropped from 30 in 2022 to 24, it was recentlyreported.Perhaps the venture capitalists, who are almost always years if not decades older, should take responsibility for how the technology will affect the world? No, again. It was a “paternalistic view to say that VCs have any more responsibility than pursuing their investment goals”, they said.Aggressive, clever and hyped up – the young talent driving the AI boom wants it all and fast.View image in fullscreen1455 and 1515 Third St, which house Uber Technologies Inc headquarters and OpenAI offices, in the Mission Bay neighbourhood of San Francisco.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesArriving atSan Francisco‘Like the scientists watching the Manhattan Project’Alight from the Caltrain at San Francisco’s 4th Street terminus, cross Mission Creek and you arrive at the headquarters of OpenAI, which is on track to become the first trillion-dollar AI company.High-energy electronic dance music pumps out across the reception area, as some of the 2,000 staff arrive for work. There are easy chairs, scatter cushions and cheese plants – an architect was briefed to capture the ambience of a comfortable country house rather than a “corporate sci-fi castle”, Altman has said.View image in fullscreenThe library inside the San Francisco office of OpenAI.Photograph: Christie Hemm Klok/New York Times/Redux/eyevineBut this belies the urgency of the race to AGI. On upper floors, engineers beaver away in soundproofed cubicles. The coffee bar is slammed with orders and there are sleep pods for the truly exhausted.Staff here are in a daily race with rivals to release AI products that can make money today. It is “very, very competitive”, said one senior executive. In one recent week, OpenAI launched “instant checkout” shopping through ChatGPT, Anthropic launched an AI that can autonomously write code for 30 hours to build entirely new pieces of software, and Meta launched a tool, Vibes, to let users fill social media feeds with AI-generated videos, to which OpenAI responded with its own version, Sora.Amodei, the chief executive of the rival AI company Anthropic, which was founded by several people who quit OpenAI citing safety concerns, has predicted AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. The closer the technology moves towards AGI, the greater its potential to reshape the world and the more uncertain the outcomes. All this appears to weigh on leaders. In one interview this summer, Altman said a lot of people working on AI felt like the scientists watching the Manhattan Project atom bomb tests in 1945.View image in fullscreenA ‘Stop AI’ protest in July outside the offices of OpenAI in San Francisco.Photograph: Robert Booth/The Guardian“With most standard product development jobs, you know exactly what you just built,” said ChatGPT’s Turley. “You know how it’s going to behave. With this job, it’s the first time I’ve worked in a technology where you have to go out and talk to people to understand what it can actually do. Is it useful in practice? Does it fall short? Is it fun? Is it harmful in practice?”Turley, who was still an undergraduate when Altman and Musk founded OpenAI in 2015, tries to take weekends off to disconnect and reflect as “this is quite a profound thing to be working on”. When he joined OpenAI, AGI was “a very abstract, mythical concept – almost like a rallying cry for me”, he said. Now it is coming close.View image in fullscreenNick Turley, the head of ChatGPT.Photograph: Winni Wintermeyer/The Guardian“There is a shared sense of responsibility that the stakes are very high, and that the technology that we’re building is not just the usual software,” added his colleague Giancarlo Lionetti, OpenAI’s chief commercial officer.The sharpest reality check yet for OpenAI came in August when it was sued by the family of Adam Raine, 16, a Californian who killed himself after encouragement in months-long conversations with ChatGPT. OpenAI has been scrambling to change its technology to prevent a repeat of this case of tragic AI misalignment. The chatbot gave the teenager practical advice on his method of suicide and offered to help him write a farewell note.Frequently you hear AI researchers say they want the push to AGI to “go well”. It is a vague phrase suggesting a wish the technology should not cause harm, but its woolliness masks trepidation.Altman has talked about “crazy sci-fi technology becoming reality” and having “extremely deep worries about what technology is doing to kids”. He admitted: “No one knows what happens next. It’s like, we’re gonna figure this out. It’s this weird emergent thing.”“There’s clearly real risks,” he said in an interview with the comedian Theo Von, which was short on laughs. “It kind of feels like you should be able to say something more than that, but in truth, I think all we know right now is that we have discovered … something extraordinary that is going to reshape the course of our history.”And yet, despite the uncertainty, OpenAI is investing dizzying sums in ever more powerful datacentres in the final dash towards AGI. Its under-construction datacentre in Abilene, Texas, is a flagship part of its $500bn “Stargate” programme and is so vast that it looks like an attempt to turn the Earth’s surface into a circuit board.Periodically, researchers quit OpenAI and speak out. Steven Adler, who worked on safety evaluations related to bioweapons, left in November 2024 and has criticised the thoroughness of its testing. I met him near his home in San Francisco.There are people who work at the frontier AI companies who earnestly believe there is a chance their company will contribute to the end of the world.”Steven Adler, former OpenAI researcher“I feel very nervous about each company having its own bespoke safety processes and different personalities doing their best to muddle through, as opposed to there being like a common standard across the industry,” he said. “There are people who work at the frontier AI companies who earnestly believe there is a chance their company will contribute to the end of the world, or some slightly smaller but still terrible catastrophe. Often they feel individually powerless to do anything about it, and so are doing what they think is best to try to make it go a bit better.”There are few obstacles so far for the racers. In September, hundreds of prominent figurescalledfor internationally agreed “red lines” to prevent “universally unacceptable risks” from AIs by the end of 2026. The warning voices included two of the “godfathers of AI” – Geoffrey Hinton and Bengio – Yuval Noah Harari, the bestselling author of Sapiens, Nobel laureates and figures such as Daniel Kokotajlo, who quit OpenAI last year and helped draw up a terrifyingdoomsday scenarioin which AIs kill all humans within a few years.But Trump shows no signs of binding the AI companies’ with red tape and is piling pressure on the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, to follow suit.Public fears grow into the vacuum. One drizzly Friday afternoon, a small group of about 30 protesters gathered outside OpenAI offices. There were teachers, students, computer scientists and union organisers and their “Stop AI” placards depicted Altman as an alien, warned “AI steals your work to steal your job” and “AI = climate collapse”. One protester donned a homespun robot outfit and marched around.View image in fullscreenA ‘Stop AI’ protest in July outside the offices of OpenAI in San Francisco.Photograph: Robert Booth/The Guardian“I have heard about superintelligence,” said Andy Lipson, 59, aschoolteacher from Oakland. “There’s a 20% chance it can kill us. There’s a 100% chance the rich are going to get richer and the poor are going to get poorer.”Joseph Shipman, 64, a computer programmer who first studied AI at MIT in 1978, said: “An entity which is superhuman in its general intelligence, unless it wants exactly what we want, represents a terrible risk to us.“If there weren’t the commercial incentives to rush to market and the billions of dollars at stake, then maybe in 15 years we could develop something that we could be confident was controllable and safe. But it’s going much too fast for that.”This article was amended on 1 December 2025. Nvidia is worth about $4.3tn, not $3.4tn as stated in an earlier version."

She has never found out who made the malicious deepfake, but knew immediately she had to try to stop this happening to other womenAnna MooreMon 1 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareWhen Cara Hunter, the Irish politician, looks back on the moment she found out she had been deepfaked, she says it is “like watching a horror movie”. The setting is her grandmother’s rural home in the west of Tyrone on her 90th birthday, April 2022. “Everyone was there,” she says. “I was sitting with all my closest family members and family friends when I got a notification through Facebook Messenger.” It was from a stranger. “Is that you in the video … the one going round on WhatsApp?” he asked.Hunter made videos all the time, especially then, less than three weeks before elections for theNorthern Irelandassembly. She was defending her East Londonderry seat, campaigning, canvassing, debating. Yet, as a woman, this message from a man she didn’t know was enough to put her on alert. “I replied that I wasn’t sure which video he was talking about,” Hunter says. “So he asked, did I want to see it?” Then he sent it over.“It was extremely pornographic,” she says. “I won’t go into detail but I want you to understand what I had to compute. Even as I’m sitting here talking about it now, I suddenly feel roasting hot. It’s a clip of a blue-walled bedroom, and it has American plugs. There’s this woman – a woman who seemed to have my face – who is doing a handstand and having mutual oral sex with a man. And I’m looking at this, sitting surrounded by family, in the middle of a very heated election campaign.” At the same time, Hunter’s phone was blowing up with message after message from strangers who had seen the video. “All of them were just really vitriolic,” she says. “Those messages were from people who hate women.”View image in fullscreenCara Hunter delivering her acceptance speech after being elected to the Northern Ireland assembly.Photograph: Liam McBurney/PAIt’s hard to fathom how unknown and “niche” deepfake pornography still was when this happened, only three years ago. “The only ‘altered images’ I really knew about at that time were Snapchat filters,” says Hunter. “My initial reaction was: ‘Is this a woman who looks similar to me?’ Then a friend asked if this could be one of those things where they put your face on to someone else’s body. We were Googling it, trying to see what it was called.” Since that time, this tech has come a frighteningly long way. “Now I have girls calling me, telling me this has happened to them and ruined their lives. Just recently, one young woman told me it had happened to her and 14 others, all when they were under 18,” she says. “Teachers tell me that they’ve seen a spike in nudification apps in schools. The affordability and accessibility has increased tenfold.”In England and Wales, legislation is finally grappling with the issue – the Online Safety Act and the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 have made the sharing, creation and requesting of deepfake intimate image abuse illegal. In Northern Ireland, too, there are plans to criminalise it – the consultation process closed in October.Yet it seems the public has been slow to grasp its harms.New police research, released last week, suggests one in four people still think there is nothing wrong with creating and sharing sexual deepfakes, or feel neutral about it. “I was shocked by that,” says Hunter. “This is a world where falsified, highly sexualised images can ruin your life, ruin your relationships, your reputation and career, and there are people who think: ‘It’s a bit of fun, it’s a bit of craic.’” She takes a long sigh. “I was shocked – but at the same time, not surprised. The normalisation of violence against women and girls cannot be overstated.”I’d like to think I have a right for my life not to be ruinedFor Hunter, who has just turned 30, the weeks after the video’s release were “horrific”. “I didn’t know what to do. Should I do a press release? Should I put a Facebook status out? You’re a young woman, 27 years old, and it was so hard to be taken seriously politically anyway.” Her party, the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP), advised her to ignore it. “Even recalling it now, I can’t believe this happened, but they said: ‘We’re two and a half weeks from an election. If you do a press release, your name will be right up there with words like ‘pornography’ – and people will see you through a sexual lens and also go looking for it.’ They said: ‘If 10,000 people know about that video now, 100,000 will know after you’ve drawn attention to it.’ Those numbers are burnt into my brain.”Hunter then turned to the police, who informed her (apologetically) that no crime had been committed, and they didn’t have the technology or expertise to investigate anyway. It was Hunter who found the original video, with the original woman’s face, by using screenshots from it in reverse image search engines. When it came to identifying who had released the deepfake video on WhatsApp, she learned it was an encrypted platform whose users had the right to privacy. “I’d like to think I have a right for my life not to be ruined,” she says. “You’re one person up against the massive system of tech and coding.”View image in fullscreenHunter with the DUP’s Gregory Campbell, right, at the count for the Northern Ireland assembly in May 2022.Photograph: Liam McBurney/PAMany memories from that period still feel mortifying. Hunter’s uncle hammering at the door, having been shown the video by his friend. She had to invite him in, sit him down and explain that it wasn’t real. Then later, she had to explain it all again to her father.“Everywhere I went, people I used to speak to would cross the road to avoid me,” she says. “I live in a beautiful coastal town that I’m lucky to represent. A mile from my house is a bar and, a couple of days after this happened, there was a party for a staff member’s birthday. I thought: ‘I can’t let it consume me. I’m going to go there and have a drink.’ On the way, a man approached me and asked me for oral sex. I kept going, reached the bar and there was complete silence when I walked in. I realised it was a mistake.”Despite Hunter’s fear that silence would be viewed as evidence that the video was genuine, she followed the party’s advice and attempted to campaign as normal. “I remember saying to my boyfriend, who is now my husband: ‘I don’t care if I’m elected or not. I just want this to be over.’” As it turned out, Hunter won by just 14 votes – making her seat the most marginal in Northern Ireland.Afterwards, she did go public with her experience and has become a key campaigning voice for legislation on deepfake intimate image abuse. It is striking that she is still one of very few. Although many public figures, including MPs, will have their own experiences of this, almost none speak out on it.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the US congresswoman, is perhaps the notable exception in politics. Hunter can understand why. “Few women in public life will be a stranger to being objectified and when a deepfake happens, you really don’t want to draw more attention to it,” she says.But Hunter says she already felt such shame and embarrassment. “I couldn’t let all this cortisol shooting through my veins be for nothing. It was like an ethical duty. This had happened to me and I was in a position where I could help shape policies. I had a voice and a platform, so I had to go 100%.”It certainly wasn’t the issue Hunter had planned to become known for. Though she grew up in Northern Ireland, when she was 10 she spent a year in the US city of Boston after her mother, a professor of nursing, moved for work. Then, at 16, her family won the green card lottery and relocated to California for a number of years. “I could never have done my job without that time,” she says. “When I went there, I was shy. In America, in class, you have to write and deliver speeches and persuasive PowerPoints. It definitely helped build my sense of self.”Her first career plan had been journalism, but when her oldest, closest friend took his own life, she began investigating mental health and suicides in the ceasefire generation for her final university paper. “I was interviewing politicians, and one said: ‘If you’re this passionate about it, you should be in local government.’” At 24, she was invited by the SDLP to stand in the local council elections. She became the youngest woman deputy mayor of Derry City and Strabane. Two years later, after the death of the politician John Dallat, she was co-opted to the Northern Ireland assembly, where she was also mental health spokesperson.On the morning Hunter took her seat, she learned that she had a brain tumour. “I was getting ready to go to Stormont when my GP called,” she says. “It’s apituitary tumour, I’m blessed, it’s not malignant and it isn’t large enough to need radiotherapy, thank God. But it can impact fertility and sight so people out there should know about this condition.” Her initial symptoms had been sore breasts and no menstrual cycle, which had eventually led to a blood test to measure prolactin levels, the hormone made in excess by pituitary tumours. Treatment is daily medication – and Hunter was also told to avoid stress. “Your prolactin levels can spike when you’re under stress,” she says, and then laughs. The following year, she was deepfaked.What I’d really like to see is a mandatory marking which shows on every AI video so everyone understands what they’re seeingShe fears experiences like hers will deter young women from entering politics. “I have these very capable young girls on work experience in my office and I don’t want them to think this is part and parcel of the political experience,” she says. “Any time I ask a woman to consider standing, I have to ask three or four times. With men, nine out of 10 times, they’ll say yes straight away.”There’s little doubt that the deepfake of Hunter directly affected the democratic process. How could it not have lost her votes? Women have been the first victims of this technology –a 2023 studyfound that 98% of online deepfakes are pornographic and that 99% of the targets are women. However, in this era Hunter terms “the AI Olympics”, the potential for future harms goes far beyond this.The deepfake of Joe Biden’s voiceurging voters not to vote in the New Hampshire primary, orthe video ofVolodymyr Zelenskyy telling his troops to surrender are early examples. While the UK government has begun to tackle deepfake pornography, Danishauthorities are attemptingto go much further by changing copyright law. The proposed changes guarantee everyone’s right to their own body, facial features and voice. (Though the law would allow expressions of satire and parody.) “If we could bring that in here, I’d say ‘Hallelujah!’” says Hunter. “What we could also do – and what I’d really like to see – is a mandatory marking which shows on every AI video so everyone understands what they’re seeing.”View image in fullscreen‘Any time I ask a woman to consider standing, I have to ask three or four times’ … Cara Hunter.Photograph: Polly Garnett/The GuardianBeyond politics, Hunter still thinks about that video clip, that blue-walled bedroom, that upside-down woman, almost every day.“Even now, I’m thinking: ‘Should I offer £500 to anyone with information on who did this?’” she says. “I need to understand. Is it personal? Is it that they hate me or is it that they hate women and don’t like to see a woman in power? Is it sectarian, because I’m a Catholic nationalist woman? Is it just that people maybe see me up there and think: ‘I’ll take her down a few pegs’?”She really isn’t sure about her future in politics. At the moment, she’s still on a high from her wedding in September. “I get my wedding album back in December and I’m counting down the days.” Her husband, Peter Eastwood, isn’t in politics himself, but he is the brother of Colum Eastwood, the former SDLP leader. “I always say at least politics found me my husband,” she says.“We have an election in May 2027 and to be honest, there is an anxiety,” she says. “I’m in the most marginal seat in the north and in the last election, I was a porn star, so what the hell is coming next?” Her parents want her to get out, especially given her pituitary tumour. “They’ve said again and again that nothing is worth my health,” she says. “They tell me that the level of abuse is unfathomable, I’m running on cortisol and it’s not safe, it’s not stable.“But I love my job,” she continues. “I love the fact that I can wake up, listen to an issue on Monday morning and take it to the minister on Monday afternoon. To have that level of access on issues I genuinely care about is such a gift.” There’s a pause and another long sigh. “But there is always anxiety at the back of my mind. I just don’t know, is the honest answer.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After praising motion-capture performance as “a celebration of the actor-director moment”, Cameron expressed his disdain for artificial intelligence. “Go to the other end of the spectrum [from motion capture] and you’ve got generative AI, where they can make up a character. They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It’s like, no. That’s horrifying to me. That’s the opposite. That’s exactly what we’renotdoing.”He added: “I don’t want a computer doing what I pride myself on being able to do with actors. I don’t want to replace actors, I love working with actors.”Cameron, who is a director ofUK-based company Stability AI, said that artificial intelligence’s creative benefits are limited. “What generative AI can’t do is create something new that’s never been seen. The models … are trained on everything that’s ever been done before; it can’t be trained on that which has never been done. So you will innately see, essentially, all of human art and human experience put into a blender, and you’ll get something that is kind of an average of that. So what you can’t have is that individual screenwriter’s unique lived experience and their quirks. You won’t find the idiosyncrasies of a particular actor.”He added: “It also causes us to have to set our bar to a very disciplined level, and to continue to be out-of-the-box imaginative. The act of performance, the act of actually seeing an artist creating in real time, will become sacred.”Explore more on these topicsJames CameronArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingAvatarnewsShareReuse this content"

The GMPXA-18 from Gorilla Ladders is the perfect example of a ladder that can do it all. It has a maximum extension of 18ft, meaning it can easily reach the top of most garages and first-floor eaves.

The ZD201 has a ton of features that make it a huge crowd pleaser.

It’s the perfect countertop handheld vacuum because it can sit upright in its charging base, so it’s always at hand to grab for spot cleanings without taking up too much space. Use the crevice tip to suction up crumbs or switch to the built-in dusting tool for finer debris.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonCottonelle Ultra Clean Toilet PaperNow $29.46, originally $34.79 at Amazon“As the great Taro Gomi once wrote, ‘everyone poops’.

These bulbs are great at setting the exact ambiance you want and for conserving energy – not only on the energy bill, but also your own energy, because you can turn them on and off with your phone.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonBedsure Gentlesoft Queen-Sized Cotton BlanketNow $39.99, originally $59.99 at Amazon“You hear about fabric that’s warm in the winter and cool in the summer. How is that possible? The answer is pure cotton. When something is made from 100% cotton, it can retain heat, but also wicks away moisture to help create an effect known as evaporative cooling. This is an excellent blanket for the couch or a supplementary blanket.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazoniRobot Roomba 105 Combo Robot Vacuum & MopNow $169, originally $319.99 at Amazon“Right now, the iRobot Roomba 105 Combo is at the lowest price on record, meaning its price-to-feature ratio is off the charts.

Using a more modern wash plate allows your laundry to circulate more freely, allowing for a gentler clean. This Whirlpool is the perfect compromise.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonLevoit Classic 300S 6L HumidifierNow $60.79, originally $79.99 at Amazon“In my test of this model, a full tank allowed it run for about 16 hours at full bore.

And I like the fact that it’s a cool mister that can accommodate essential oils.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonDr Infrared Heater Portable Space HeaterNow $108.99, originally $129.99 at Amazon“When I tested the Dr Infrared space heater, I appreciated the fact the sides remain perfectly cool to the touch during operation, a great safety plus if you have small kids or pets.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonWinix 5510 Air Purifier (New Generation of 5500-2 with App Support)Now $128, originally $179.99 at Amazon“Winix has a cult following because its air purifiers cover all the major bases.

GE’s PFQ97HSPVDS is a major step forward. When I spent hands-on time with this unit, I was impressed by the washer’s ability to remove stains, and the ventless heat-pump dryer’s ability to get moisture out.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Home DepotLG LF24Z6530S Counter Depth French Door RefrigeratorNow $1,999, originally $3,899 at Home Depot“This fridge offers a fingerprint-resistant finish, the ability to make fist-sized spherical ice (I’ve experienced these, and they have a wow factor), and a built-in air filtration system to cut down on odors.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Home DepotOne+ 18V Cordless 6-Tool Combo Kit with 1.5 Ah Battery, 4.0 Ah battery, andchargerNow $199, originally $299 at Home Depot“If you’re looking to get into DIY carpentry or want to round out your workshop, this six-tool combo from Ryobi is a great place to start.

It’s the definition of a timeless piece: stylish, simple and incredibly functional. The Plum color is sold out, but you can still choose between Stone and Jade. My favorite part of its design? It can fit my 16-inch laptop, which, as a freelance writer, I never travel without.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AwayAway Featherlight CrossbodyNow $43, originally $58 at AwayThis is, hands down, one of my favorite luggage items of 2025. The crossbody, which is part of Away’s sitewide sale, is one of those pieces that just make travel easier. I first brought it with me on a trip to Alaska, and it fit everything I needed for daily excursions: snacks, a water bottle, sunscreen, a book and even an extra layer.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AntlerAntler Lightest Expandable Carry-On LuggageNow $220, originally $275 at AntlerI’m Team Hardside, but I still understand the appeal of softside luggage. A softside suitcase is often lighter and can be expanded when you require extra space. If I were going to invest in this type of bag, I’d definitely go with the Antler Lightest Expandable Carry-On Luggage – a top-rated style that’s compact, durable and designed for convenience (the front pocket is ideal for the items you need easy access to).View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonEtronik Overnight Duffel BagNow $19.99, originally $36.99 at AmazonQuick overnight or weekend trips don’t always require a suitcase. Most of the time, you really only need a change of clothes, some pajamas and a small toiletry bag, all of which can fit in the Etronik Overnight Duffel Bag. The weekender has received more than 1,500 five-star reviews, with shoppers praising its pockets, spaciousness and durability. Inside, there’s even a zippered wet bag to hold anything you may want to keep separate (a wet bathing suit, makeup, etc).View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsonite Freeform 2-Piece Luggage SetNow $196.34, originally $359.95 at AmazonEven if you’re a self-proclaimed carry-on-only type, it’s still a good idea to have a checked bag at the ready. This luggage set from Samsonite – a carry-on and a large spinner suitcase – covers all your bases. It comes in a variety of colors that will stand out at baggage claim, so you’ll never have to second-guess which luggage is yours. And at 45% off? This is truly one of the bestCyber Mondaytravel deals.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of LeatherologyLeatherologyTransit Travel ToteNow $348.75, was $465 at LeatherologyWith the entire Leatherology site currently up to 25% off with code HOLIDAY25, I took the liberty of finding the most useful, marked-down item. You can carry Transit Travel Tote with the long straps or the short straps, and there’s even a hidden trolley pocket that allows you to slide it over your suitcase’s extended handle. What’s more, you can personalize with up to five letters.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of CalpakCalpak Terra 26L Laptop Duffel BackpackNow $138.60, originally $198 at CalpakI started using the Calpak Terra 26L Laptop Duffel Backpack last winter and was immediately blown away by the sheer amount it can comfortably carry. I’d even say it holds as much as my suitcase – and it will still fit underneath the airplane seat. The clamshell opening to a spacious main compartment makes packing a breeze, and the interior compression strap ensures everything stays secure. Part backpack, part duffel – you’re basically getting two bags for one.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AwayAway Packing Pro BundleNow $257, originally $343 at AwayI travel 200,000 miles a year. This is the best travel backpack I can’t leave home withoutRead moreAway is my go-to brand for luggage. I’ve used the Bigger Carry-On for years, and I firmly believe (after trying at least 10 other suitcases) that it holds more than any other carry-on out there. The bundle comes with a set of packing cubes – which are helpful with suitcase organization – so it’s a great starter pack for anyone just beginning their travel journey or those who tend to overpack.Away’s Cyber Monday sale means everything from the luggage brand is 25% off, but you’ll want to stay focused on the items with the best cost-per-use. For the everyday traveler, that is the Away Packing Pro Bundle. The set includes the Bigger Carry-On and the Insider Packing Cubes (set of four), two travel essentials that can be used together or separately. Bonus: you can opt to get both in the same color or mix and match.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of RoamRoam Check-In ExpandableNow $545, originally $725 at RoamMake no mistake, high-quality checked suitcases are expensive, so I always recommend waiting to purchase one until it’s on sale. While the Roam Check-In Expandable suitcase is still on the pricier side, it’s the kind of suitcase you only need to buy once. Designed with an expandable feature (a 2in zipper expansion) and compression boards, it’ll comfortably hold between 10 and 13 outfits.The best travel tech and gear dealsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJUST ADDED: Cadence Travel Containers Full Skincare SetNow $107.20, originally $134 at AmazonI’ve been a Cadence Capsule convert for a few years now. They make packing my toiletries, particularly my skincare, a breeze. Instead of hauling every single full-sized bottle in my skincare lineup on every trip, I put just the right amount of my moisturizer, serums and cleansers into these leak-proof, TSA-compliant capsules. Their magnetic design ensures they stay nicely together in my toiletry bag, and the helpful labels keep me organized.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonEpicka Universal Travel AdapterNow $17.99, originally $24.99 at AmazonInternational travel requires all sorts of preparation: passports, visas, currency exchange and adapters. I can’t help you too much with the first few, but I can assist with the travel-adapter situation. I’d recommend picking up something like the Epicka Universal Travel Adapter, which ensures you’re covered in 200-plus countries and regions – and it can even charge up to six devices at once.EOS R100 BodyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of CanonNow $459.99, originally $559.99 at CanonThe Cyber Monday sale period is one of the best times to find deals on pricier travel pieces – like a nice camera you can bring on a safari or a long-awaited family trip to Europe. The EOS R100 Body is a great option for beginners or amateur photographers; it’s definitely an upgrade from your smartphone, but it’s not the type of technology that will overwhelm you with all of its features.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Filter USFree weekly newsletterA guide to buying fewer, better products.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While wearing them, you can use transparency mode or choose to go full noise canceling, focusing instead on just your music. These are also great for a long flight; a single charge gets you 10 hours of listening, with the use of the charging case, that extends to 45 hours.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAnker 633 Magnetic BatteryNow $35.99, originally $59.99 at AmazonCarrying a portable charger is a non-negotiable for me when I travel. I never know when the charging port on the airplane or in the airport will be defective, and I refuse to arrive at my destination without a fully charged phone. That’s where the Anker 633 Magnetic Battery comes into play. It can recharge your phone about two times, and it’s small enough to be carried in a purse or handbag. Plus, it’s highly rated and marked down by 40% – now’s the time to snag one.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonTrtl Neck PillowNow $41.99, originally $64.99 at AmazonI’m not a fan of the classic bulky travel pillows. In my eyes, they’re simply not worth the hassle of hauling them around the airport. But I still believe in comfort, particularly on red-eye flights. That’s why I’ll frequently tuck this Trtl neck pillow in my personal item bag. It’s light and compact while still providing the proper neck support to get some sleep on the plane. I also love that it’s machine-washable, and I’ll toss it in the laundry after most trips.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonTravel Inspira Luggage ScaleNow $7.80, originally $12.99 at AmazonSearching for a stocking stuffer? The Travel Inspira Luggage Scale is the type of item most people don’t realize is missing in their life until they experience the reassurance that comes with weighing a suitcase before arriving at the airport. You simply loop the weighing belt through your luggage handle and hold it up to get a read. Yes, the sale price saves you a few dollars, but you’ll also never pay an overweight luggage fee again.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJBL Tune 720BT Wireless Over-Ear HeadphonesNow $44.95, originally $89.95 at AmazonAs someone who has lost too many AirPods while in transit, I’m a full headphones convert. This pair from JBL is 50% off and highly rated by thousands of shoppers. If you’re not totally sold on larger headphones but want to give them a try (without splurging on a pricier version), this is the way to go. Not to mention, it comes in a handful of colorways, including purple and blue.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonApple AirTag Four-PackI’m a digital nomad who works on the road. These seven travel gadgets go with me everywhereRead moreNow $62.99, originally at $99 at AmazonThere are certain things you can’t control at the airport – ahem, lost luggage – but you can arm yourself with tech that can track your belongings. Keeping an Apple AirTag in both my checked bag and carry-on gives me peace of mind when I’m making a tight connection or using a transfer service. If you haven’t invested in your own set of AirTags, now is the time.If you went to Apple.com to purchase a four-pack of AirTags right now, you would pay full price. But on Amazon, the nifty tracking devices are under $65. While they’re definitely useful while traveling, AirTags can also do wonders in your daily life: attach one to your keys, throw one in your purse, or slip one in your wallet.The best travel clothing dealsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJUST ADDED: Columbia Women’s Newton Ridge Plus Waterproof Amped Hiking BootNow $74.98, originally $100 at AmazonFor any avid traveler, there are some excursions where basic sneakers don’t quite cut it. I’ve been wearing this pair of hiking boots from Columbia for several years now, taking them everywhere from Wyoming to Switzerland. They’re comfortable, relatively lightweight and have never given me blisters. Right now, they’re a steal at just over $70.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of LululemonLululemon Men’s Soft Jersey Tapered Pant RegularNow $49, originally $98 at LululemonWinter is the time to make sure your wardrobe has an appropriate amount of comfortable basics, whether you’re wearing them for travel or relaxing days at home. Lululemon’s Cyber Monday sale includes tons of styles, such as the Soft Jersey Tapered Pant, that fit the bill. These are lightweight, stretchy and sweat-wicking, while still having a streamlined, elevated silhouette – AKA the perfect plane pant.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Garnet HillGarnet Hill Washable-Cashmere HoodieNow $119.40, originally $199 at Garnet HillI firmly believe that anyone who travels frequently should have a go-to cozy set they can wear on a long-haul or red-eye flight – and Garnet Hill is a great place to start your search. Right now, the brand is offering 40% off cashmere and flannel using code STAYCOZY (plus 30% off everything else), which means you can pick up the incredibly soft Washable-Cashmere Hoodie andmatching joggerswhile they’re marked down.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AyrAYR The Deep End ShirtNow $132, originally $165 at AYRMy personal favorite travel-day uniform nearly always includes a plain white, slightly oversized button-down, like this one from AYR. The brand rarely marks down its evergreen styles. Made of 100% cotton, it can be thrown in the wash without losing its shape, and you can wear it with anything. I usually pair mine with breezy linen pants if I’m headed somewhere warm, or straight-leg jeans for a more everyday look.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of SpanxScuba Micro Flare LeggingNow $35.40, originally $119 at SpanxIf I’m boarding a flight longer than a couple of hours, I’ll typically opt to wear leggings. But while I love my athletic leggings as much as the next person, I like to feel a bit more put-together while traveling, so I look for something like the Spanx Scuba Micro Flare Legging (currently $80 off). The scuba fabric is a bit more elevated than your classic polyester blend, and the shaping waistband gives just the right amount of support without being constrictive.Allbirds Tree Runner NZView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AllbirdsMen’s:Now $66, originally $110 at AllbirdsWomen’s:Now $66, originally $110 at AllbirdsAllbirds’ Cyber Monday sale, up to 50% off select styles, is your chance to grab a new pair of travel sneakers. The Tree Runner NZ – available in bothmen’sandwomen’s sizes– is made of a light, breathable knit, and the cushioned memory foam will keep your feet happy, even when you’re sprinting through the airport. The shoes are also machine washable, which means you’ll have these in your rotation for many trips to come.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonFitrell Compression Socks, Pack of ThreeNow $12.99, originally $26.99 at AmazonCompression socks are the type of travel essentials that you don’t want to knock until you try them for yourself. They might not be the most fashionable, but they are extremely functional. This type of footwear is designed to help with joint and muscle stiffness and avoid any blood pooling in your feet – all of which can happen if you sit still for too long on a plane.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonWomen’s Pioneer Camp Packable PufferNow $47.59, originally $55.99 at AmazonChoosing outerwear is always one of the hardest parts of packing. The general rule of thumb is to wear your jacket or coat while in transit (so you don’t have to fit it in your suitcase), but sometimes you want to bring an extra layer. In that case, I’ll go with something like the Pioneer Camp Women’s Packable Puffer – a lightweight, water-repellent style that can be packed down into its carrying bag. The timing of the sale is perfect, too; this is the type of piece you need for most winter travel.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AthletaWomen’s Forever Fleece Relaxed Crew SweatshirtNow $53.40, originally $89 at AthletaI’m a firm believer that travel outfits should be both comfortable and presentable. I tend to stick with sweats and loungewear in solid, neutral colors, like the Forever Fleece Relaxed Crew Sweatshirt from Athleta. Not only will it never go out of style, but the dark navy also masks any inevitable travel stains.The Athleta holiday sale – 30% off everything – is incredibly tempting for those who live inathleisure, but don’t go crazy just yet. Instead, only invest in the pieces that deserve a coveted spot in your suitcase. This cotton crewneck sweatshirt is machine-washable (a crucial trait for travel clothing) and comes in a ton of solid, neutral colors. Read: it will work for most, if not all, of the trips you have on your calendar.Lydia Mansel is a travel writer and founder of the travel newsletter Just Packed.

The California-based brand offers easygoing staples that lean toward menswear while staying wholeheartedly feminine. I already can’t walk a block without getting a compliment on myFelted Wool Chore Coat. I got this lightweight knit in almost-black dark navy, and it falls the perfect length for high-waisted pants. I can dress it up with a skirt and a statement necklace, or throw it on with a pair of jeans for brunch.Tobey Grumet Segal, product writer and editorView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of BirkenstockBirkenstock Zermatt Shearling Wool Slippers$99.95 at BirkenstockHere in New York, my family is well into slipper season, which a footwear-collecting puppy has complicated. Long story short, I suddenly found myself in need of a new pair of slippers. Since I spend all the other seasons walking around in my Birks, I figured I’d make it a year-round thing. Built around the brand’s patented footbed, these winter-forward Birkenstock Zermatt’s are a little stiffer than your average slipper but incredibly easy on your feet. And the shearling makes them warm and comfy.Tim Stevens, tech writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of MoonstarMoonstar Gym Classic Shoes$167 at Moonstar$187 at Redcast HeritageI’ve been a fan of Moonstar’s subtle style for years. Since my last few pairs of Converse Chucks fell apart in a depressingly short time, I thought I’d see what the quirky brand from Kurume, Japan, could do. I was lucky to visit a flagship store on a recent visit to Jiyugaoka, and picked up this pair of Gym Classics in navy for the equivalent of about $60. That’s less than half what they cost here in the US. Time will tell, but they feel far higher quality than what Converse is putting out these days, and the design is stellar.Tim Stevens, tech writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Land’s EndLands’ End Men’s Calf-Length Turkish Terry Robe$43.98 at Land’s EndI love fluffy white hotel robes. It’s a weakness. My awesome girlfriend got me a highly rated Parachute robe a couple of years ago, but it showed stray threads among tenacious coffee stains within months. I looked a wreck. So she got me a Lands’ End replacement and it’s been like wearing a cloud ever since.The Lands’ End white Turkish terrycloth robe has held up better over 12 months than the Parachute robe did. The loops are still tight, the seams don’t rip, and the collar actually cradles your neck without sagging after multiple washes. The faux cuffs give a finished look without the bulk that makes real cuffs impractical. Lands’ End backs this with its famous lifetime guarantee, which increasingly feels like a fever dream from a lost economic era.Chris Allbritton, freelance journalistView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of CasetifyTakashi Murakami x Casetify Flowers Bloom Phone Case$78 at CasetifyCasetify’s smartphone cases are both durable and stylish, so I was thrilled when the Hong Kong-based company again partnered withTakashi Murakamifor anew collectionfor iPhone, Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel phones. No, I wasn’t about to drop thousands on the artist’sLouis Vuitton re-edition, but I snapped up the pink Flowers Bloom MagSafe Impact Case for my iPhone 17 Pro Max, and sometimes I find myself just staring at its colorful, groovy pattern. Plus, I get mad cool points from my teenage sons and their friends. Always a nice bonus.Tobey Grumet Segal, product writer and editorWhat our writers love to travel withTravel essentials: eight items to pack for your next trip – and what to leave at homeRead moreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AlohaAloha Collection Keep It Light Weekender Bag$74 at AlohaBecause Itravelso frequently for work, I’ve been on a mission to find theperfect carry-onduffel to fit under my seat. Recently, on a trip to visit family in Hawaii, I was browsing the popular Aloha Collection bags in Honolulu international airport – a recentHello Kitty collaborationsaw people lining up outside stores in the middle of the night. This time, I decided to nab the Keep It Light Weekender. Dressed in waterproof, ripstop nylon and available in different colors and fun patterns, it’s got everything I need, including generous pockets; comfy, padded shoulder straps; and a simple trolley sleeve to keep it tightly strapped to my suitcase when I’m wheeling it around. It’s also easy to wipe clean and can even double as the perfect beach bag. But most importantly, it’s a stylish way to keep me from waiting for the dreaded baggage claim after a long trip.Kiki Aranita, food writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonDmyond Handheld Metal Detector$25.99 at AmazonIf you’ve ever watched treasure get unearthed, as they are on the show The Curse of Oak Island, you know how thrilling the high-pitched whine of a metal detector can be. But the magical moment doesn’t arrive until a handheld probe helps pinpoint that top-pocket find.While I no longer own a full-sized detector, I couldn’t resist this small, waterproof model that’s easy to tuck into a jacket or bag for impromptu scans at the beach or along a trail. If I drop my keys in deep grass, a brook or the snow, this is the tool I reach for. Held sideways, Dmyond probe scans wider and deeper, while the tip performs a targeted, narrow scan. In side-scan, it even doubles as a stud finder and costs about the same, a little over $20.Alan Truly, tech writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Yarn and WhiskeyYarn & Whiskey Project Pouch$55 at Yarn & WhiskeyAs an avid crocheter, I’ve long used Yarn & Whiskey’s project bags, intended for toting around yarn and embroidery projects – mainly because they fit perfectly on my lap forlong car rides. Recently, I added this mini pop-up pouch to my collection for smaller crochet projects, but I found that it also works just as well as a regular purse. The handy strap fits nicely around my wrist, and its unique silhouette folds up completely flat, which is perfect for packing in a carry-on. Yarn & Whiskey’s founder started the company by sourcing her incredible African textiles, but as a recent graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology, she is adding her own designs in her next project.Kiki Aranita, food writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonDJI Neo Mini Drone$289 at AmazonSometimes I just need to see more. What’s down there, over the rise, around the corner or across the stream? And it’s not just the path I didn’t take – it’s the inaccessible spaces among the leaves, across the ravine or over the waves. That’s what a drone is for, but we all know those have costly barriers to entry.That’s what makes the DJI Neo so special. It takes off from my palm, and I can pilot it without a controller, just using my phone. It also tracks movement, so I can use it like a flying selfie camera to take photos from the air or record videos as I walk along a trail. It’s kind of like having a professional videographer following my adventures (and no, it’s not creepy at all). Starting at just $200, it’s priced more like a toy drone, yet it offers the first-rate video stabilization and camera quality DJI is known for.Alan Truly, tech writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of MophieMophie Portable Charging PackThe 29+ best US Black Friday and Cyber Monday travel deals on luggage, backpacks, travel adapters and moreRead more$49.95 at Lenovo$49.99 at MophieThis designer tech brand’s Powerstation Plus Mini 5K Power Bank is small, easy to tote and just right for that coveted extra charge. Its integrated USB-C cable works for most Android phones and more recent iPhones, and because it’s half an inch thick, it’s perfect to take on the go. The USB-C port and the built-in cable are bi-directional, which means you can simultaneously charge with both.Adam Doud, tech writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAirhood Induction Cooktop$129.99 at Amazon$149.99 at AirhoodAs a kitchen and dining editor, I’ve tested countless induction burners. And as a chef who frequently runs pop-up events out of kitchens other than my own, I’ve lugged these devices all over town – and even across state lines. So I’m happy to report that the surprisingly slim Airhood induction cooktop has completely changed my life. It heats up super quickly, and at less than 5lbs, it’s unbelievably lightweight. In fact, it weighs less than my laptop and takes up about as much space. I am shocked at how evenly this cooktop distributes heat for such a small device, and I’ve even carried it to potlucks when I’m not up for jockeying for time with fellow cooks. Best of all, I can quickly turn any location, even an outdoor picnic table, into a stove (hello, tailgating!).Kiki Aranita, food writerWhat our writers love for self-careView image in fullscreenNulastin Brow Shape Altering SerumPhotograph: Courtesy of NulastinNulastin Brow Shape Altering Serum$84 at NulastinFormer professional mountain biker and ESPN sideline reporter Leah Garcia founded Nulastin to help women harness elastin protein as they age. I was drawn to the brand’s serum, which claims to help grow thicker, stronger eyebrows. Because, guess what? Nobody mentioned that after plucking, waxing and threading my thick, unruly brows for over 30 years, they would suddenly start thinning when I turned 40. I started using the Shape Altering Serum about six weeks ago, and though the instructions say full results show after 12 weeks, I am already amazed at how much fuller my brows look. Plus, the tiny little brush makes it simple to swipe on twice a day.Tobey Grumet Segal, product writer and editorThe best facial cleansers for every skin type in the US, recommended by dermatologistsRead moreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Boreal FolkBoreal Folk Yarrow Face Oil Cleanser$30 at Boreal FolkAnyone with combination skin knows how challenging it can be. And in my quest to seek out a gentle cleanser that helps balance my skin rather than strip it, I found that this luscious blue oil does the trick. There’s a lot to love in this bottle: the herbal scent, how soft it makes my skin feel, and the fabulous indigo color. Bonus: when I travel, this doubles as a face oil, so I can leave one product at home.Julia Skinner, food writer and culinary instructorView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Scent SplitChapel Factory Hermit Coat perfume$110 at ZGO Perfumery$110 at Scent SplitHermit Coat was an impulse buy on one of my first visits to Cork Niche Fragrances in Ireland. The instant I smelled it, I just knew it had to come home with me. I’m not a fan of most smokey perfumes, which smell like I’ve been slapped in the face with a campfire or lean too heavily on the spice, like a too-strong aftershave. But Hermit Coat does neither. The subtle scent feels more like burning incense with a floral base, and it’s never overpowering. I’m also fond of how it lingers, even after a full day, maintaining its subtle complexity.Julia Skinner, food writer and culinary instructorskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Filter USFree weekly newsletterA guide to buying fewer, better products.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It can also cause headaches and mess with my productivity. Over the years, I’ve learned a massage can make a huge difference, but getting into the trapezius and shoulders, where tension often lives, can be challenging.That’s why a trigger point massage tool is one of my favorite personal care products. The hook shape helps take the effort out of applying pressure in just the right spot. No batteries required – I just grab and pull, using the ball-shaped ends to press. At a little over $20, it’s a must-have massager for anyone who occasionally needs relief from tight muscles in the back, shoulders or neck.Alan Truly, tech writerWhat our writers love for a home upgradeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonLevoit Dual 150 Ultrasonic Humidifier$35.79 at Levoit$43.99 at AmazonAs the seasons shift, heating takes a toll on indoor air quality. Both processes reduce relative humidity, which tends to dry our eyes, nose and lips. The best solution? A humidifier offers a steady stream of vapor to provide quick relief in small areas. I turn to the Levoit Dual 150 humidifier, which is one of my favorite low-cost devices for the home. Its 3-liter reservoir is big enough to ease my sinuses for hours yet small enough for quick refills or moving from room to room. As an ultrasonic humidifier, it’s barely audible, requires minimal maintenance and is easy to clean.For under $50, I highly recommend it to anyone looking for relief from the dry heating during winter. If you live somewhere warm and dry, the Levoit Dual 150 humidifier would also help air quality if (when?) you have to blast the air conditioner during a heatwave.Alan Truly, tech writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonTapo C113 2K 3MP Indoor/Outdoor Security Camera$19.99 at AmazonA few years ago, I invested in a couple of Wyze cameras to cover my home and property and keep an eye on things. Over the years, I kept adding more and more cameras, while Wyze kept pulling more and more features into premium tiers. Sick of monthly fees, I’ve been switching over to TP-Link’s Tapo cameras. They’re dirt-cheap but still do AI detection without a monthly fee.Tim Stevens, tech writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonLock in a year of cheap TV with the best US Black Friday streaming dealsRead moreXGIMI Halo+ Portable Projector$499 at Amazon$499 at XgimiIf you like to bring the big screen with you – on vacation or to a friend’s house, for instance – or if you need a quick way to present in multiple conference rooms, this one is tough to top. It has no loose panels or janky flaps that feel flimsy. The picture is bright, big and comes with a number of enhancements such as auto keystone, auto focus and auto adjustments to screens and obstacles to ensure the picture is straight and tight. It projects in 1080p at 700 lumens, which isn’t the brightest in the world, so don’t use it in fully lit rooms, but it presents sharp, vibrant images with shades drawn and lights turned down. The sound is also kicking, with two 5WHarman Kardon speakersthat can pump it out, and its built-in battery will give you 2.5 hours of screen time.And it comes with the latest version of Google TV and Google Play, though you can also use the multitude of connection options on the back to play your own media if you’re nowhere near wifi.Chris Allbritton, freelance journalistView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of JLabJLab Pop Party$18.99 at Walmart$19.99 at JLabThe JLab Pop Party speaker quickly became a favorite in my house – my daughter kept stealing it to listen to music on her bike. So, I ended up getting a second one. The Pop Party was still loud enough to hear when we were going 28mph on an electric bike, and it comes with a nice, detachable silicone strap that fits around a handlebar. The battery lasts a good long time, too, which means I only have to charge it about once a week. Most importantly, the sound quality is excellent for such a tiny, low-cost speaker; the only tones I miss are the deep bass.Adam Doud, tech writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonLogitech Signature Slim Wireless Keyboard$94.99 at Amazon$94.99 at Best BuyAs a longtime reviewer of keyboards, I can tell you with confidence that Logitech is one of my all-time favorite brands. The Signature Slim is outstanding if, like me, you prefer chiclet-style keyboards (mechanical keyboard lovers need not apply).It’s the Signature Slim’s key built-in solar array that has caught my attention. Splayed across the top of the keyboard, it keeps the device charged even in artificial light – and it has remained at 100% for the full 45 days I’ve been using it in my basement office (far from windows). The pitch and travel of the keys is lovely, and it’s also a full-sized keyboard that includes a number pad, which is always a nice bonus.Adam Doud, tech writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of BoseBose QuietComfort Ultra 2$399 at Amazon$399 at BoseI work from home where the distraction level is very high. My basement office also houses my washing machine, dryer, HVAC system and, as if that wasn’t enough, a 3D printer. When all of them are running, I’m sitting in a smorgasbord of audio annoyances. That’s why I wear the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones: all that noise just disappears. The active noise cancellation (ANC) is so good that my wife routinely gets upset when I don’t hear her calling me from upstairs. Also, as a frequent traveler, these are my go-to headphones for drowning out airplane noise. I can’t prove that Bose employs actual ANC wizards, but I have my suspicions.Adam Doud, tech writerWhat our writers love for a deep cleanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonWolfbox MF200 Compressed Air Duster$85.49 at AmazonI seem to go through one or two cans of compressed air a year. I guess I’m a stickler for a clean keyboard. Anyhow, with the stuff costing nearly $10 a can, I’ve been trying to find a better way to get this done. I’ve tried a few handheld air dusters in the past, all way too weak for a true cleanse. But this MF200 from Wolfbox is impressively powerful, enough to launch itself out of your hand if you’re not holding on tight. It charges quickly over USB-C, has a swappable battery, and comes with four nozzles and a little storage bag. The thing is painfully loud, so you’ll want some hearing protection if you’re going full-speed for long, but otherwise it’s finally ended my pricey canned-air habit.Tim Stevens, tech writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Sheets Laundry ClubNine eco-minded gifts for Americans that actually make a differenceRead moreSheets Laundry Club Detergent Sheets$21.29 at Sheets Laundry ClubHere’s the math: humans ship 3.4bn lbs of liquid detergent in plastic jugs every year. Only 30% get recycled, while the rest – 700m jugs – end up in landfills where they will sit for centuries. And, thanks to impossible-to-read measuring caps, a jug advertising 64 loads usually only delivers 42.That rankled me, so my girlfriend introduced me to Sheets Laundry Club ($21.29 for 50 sheets, $15.97 a box if you subscribe). Founded by a military veteran couple who saw first-hand the plastic waste crisis overseas, Sheets Laundry Club is not just a greenwash of the same broken system. The sheets arrive in a recycled cardboard box the size of a beefy paperback, with the option for carbon-free shipping. Each sheet weighs about 0.09oz, compared with 1.4oz of liquid or powder a load. That’s a 94% reduction in weight being trucked around the country.Chris Allbritton, freelance journalistView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonO-Cedar ProMist Max Microfiber Spray Mop$24.98 at Amazon$24.98 at WalmartWith three cats, mopping has become a staple chore in my weekly cleaning regimen. (It’s not that bad, really.) What I love about this mop: being able to put whatever cleaning product I like in the reservoir instead of relying on proprietary products, as you must with other companies (cough, cough, Swiffer). And though the company says the microfiber mop head can be washed 100 times, we have washed it more than that, and it’s still going strong. You can also use it as a dry mop if you just need to clean up some stray dust or hair in the nooks and crannies. Plus it needs no batteries, so nothing goes into the landfill every six to eight months. For light mopping, this is the one to beat.Chris Allbritton, freelance journalistWhat our writers love to eat and drinkView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Origami SakiThousand Cranes Origami Sake$24.99 at Origami SakeThe holidays mean there will certainly be an uptick in my alcohol consumption. To combat the effects of the many drinks that will inevitably be placed in my hand, I lean into low-ABV cocktails. I ordered this lovely, dry sake because it’s organic, gluten-free and brewed in the US using Arkansas-grown rice (no tariff worries here). I like to serve it chilled and straight up instead of wine at meals, but it’s also an excellent substitute for stronger spirits in mules, martinis (hello, saketini!) and even a classic negroni. If you are going for the full 0% ABV, Thousand Cranes also sellsZero, a tasty non-alcoholic version.Tobey Grumet Segal, product writer and editorView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Cabi FoodsCabi Mini Mayonnaise Keychain$36 at CabiAs danglingLabubushave taken the world’s purses by storm, I have but one question: can any of them squirt mayonnaise? If you’re like me and would prefer easy access to three tasty condiments rather than a trendy plush toy, Cabi’s purse dongle is a worthwhile investment. In the last few weeks, I’ve been switching this quirky mayo keychain between my work bag and a smaller handbag so that if I encounter a dry fry, I have a quick and easy solution.I’m a huge fan of Cabi’s condiments, especially thesweet yuzu vinaigrette, but I also adore its Japanese mayos, which in this set include miso, wasabi and spicy yuzu flavors. Of course, it only makes sense that these mayos need refrigeration, and the silicone gripper on the keychain allows you to pop off each mini bottle to keep cool before the next squirt.Kiki Aranita, food writerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Portrait CoffeePortrait Coffee Stankonia Limited Edition Coffee$24 at Portrait CoffeeI find every coffee from Atlanta-based Portrait to be delicious, but this one is my new favorite. A round, rich, full flavor that’s fruity but not too sweet, this blend makes me look forward to my morning coffee more than usual. And it’s not just a distinct flavor profile. I also dig that it was specially created to honor recent Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees (and Atlanta natives)OutKastand the 25th anniversary of their iconic album Stankonia. If you’re an Atlanta hip-hop fan or looking for a unique holiday gift for someone who is, you may want to add this limited-edition blend to your cart before it’s gone.Julia Skinner, food writer and culinary instructorExplore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Filter USShopping tripsShops and shoppingMen's shoesWomen's shoesGadgetsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With 70 watts of output, it can handle charging many laptops (check the label on yours) with capacity to spare for a phone on the additional USB outlets. Six styles of retractable prongs work in 200 different countries, and it works as a pass-through plug converter, too.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAmazon Fire HD 10 tabletNow $69.99, originally $139.99 at Best BuyWhether I’m reading or watching a movie, the Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet has a beautiful screen and just the right amount of power to stream content: you don’t need much computing muscle to turn pages of a book or play back a video. It’s also very durable, so it’s great for coffee table reading. While a Fire tablet isn’t as useful as a full Android tablet, at 50% off it’s still a great deal, even if it only ends up as your Netflix screen to go.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonBlink Outdoor 4 Wireless smart security camera$51.99, originally $129.99 at AmazonSmart cameras typically come with a big trade-off: you need to either run an ugly wire to them or change the battery every couple months. But the Blink Outdoor 4 Wireless camera sidesteps both with a battery that can last up to two years. I’ve had one for about a year so far, and the battery shows no signs of stopping. You can put this camera anywhere it has access to wifi and basically forget it exists, except when you want to see what’s going on in your yard. At 60% off, it’s worth grabbing a few for different parts of the house and yard.The 11 best US Black Friday and Cyber Monday travel deals already taking offRead moreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus$24.99, originally $49.99 at AmazonThe Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K plus remains the single easiest way to turn a regular TV into a smart TV. Just plug it into your TV and a power source, and just like that you have access to streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu, Amazon and Blink camera feeds, and of course Alexa. The ultra-simple remote makes for easy navigation, and has a built-in mic for voice commands (“Hey Alexa, play The Office.”) At 50% off, you can grab one for every TV in the house, or even one to travel with – it’s tiny.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJBL Live Pro 2$89.95, originally $169.95 at AmazonJBL is an iconic name in sound, and the JBL Live Pro 2 are some of my favorite earbuds. They have excellent Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which makes it easier to listen to your music at a lower volume to avoid hearing damage. You also get excellent battery life, at up to 10 hours on a single charge, so these can be a great musical companion for the vibe-coders in your life to blot out the world for hours while they crack on the next big thing. I’d heartily recommend them at full price, so at half-off they’re a no brainer.Home entertainmentView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonNex PlaygroundNow $199, originally $249.99 at AmazonThe Nex Playground is like a game console where you’re the controller. A front-facing camera tracks your motion allowing you to interact with elements on the screen, for instance, waving your hands to slash at on-screen targets. After trying it at a trade show, I quickly got one for my own entertainment center. It comes preloaded with five games – my favorite is Starri, a sort of Beat Saber clone that will get your heart rate up.Lock in a year of cheap TV with the best US Black Friday streaming dealsRead moreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonRoku Streaming Stick HDNow $15, originally $29.99 at AmazonIn a world of algorithms competing to serve you content in increasingly convoluted ways, the Roku interface is refreshingly simple: it’s just a list of apps. That’s it. Even as a technologically literate Gen Xer, I dig that. If you already have a streaming system that works for you, this could still be a good gift for older or less tech-savvy folks in your life. Just set it up with their account logins for Netflix, Hulu, Disney and the like, and they’ll learn the nice, clean interface in no time.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of WalmartHisense 75” Class H5 Series QLEDNow $378, originally $499 at WalmartWe live in an amazing time when you can buy a 75in 4K TV for under $400. This model even uses QLED technology for better color accuracy, which used to be a premium feature just a few years ago. Since it’s a Roku TV, all of your streaming services are at your fingertips right out of the box. This is a one-off model that appears to be exclusive to Walmart, so you won’t find reviews on it, but Hisense is a reputable brand and TVs have matured so much that even budget models hold their own to most eyeballs.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of SamsungSamsung OLED S90F 4K TV$1,399.99, originally $2,499.99 at Samsung (44% off)For color fidelity and contrast, most home theater enthusiasts still turn to OLED screens, but they seldom come cheap. This is a great deal on a high-end example, just one rung below Samsung’s flagship S95F. Gamers will appreciate the 144Hz refresh rate for smoother action, and the AI processor for 4K upscaling means that even older shows and movies will make use of every pixel.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonMeta Quest 3SNow $329, originally $399.99 at AmazonMeta has been leading the way in theVRspace for a decade, and the Meta Quest 3S is the most accessible headset on the market today. My favorite game isHell Horde,a first-person shooter in which demons come running at you through a hole in your living room wall. It’s wild, and there are games for all interests includingThe Climb,Beat Saber,Star Wars: Beyond Victoryand more.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonHoverAir X1 Drone$259, originally $439 at AmazonThe HoverAir X1 is less of a drone and more of a flying camera that keeps you the center of its focus. It can fly preprogramed routes to capture the scenery around you or follow you around, dodging obstacles along the way. When I tested this drone, I rode an electric bike for five miles under and around trees, and it kept up beautifully. It’s foldable and fits neatly in a jacket pocket.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSony Bravia Theater Bar 6$498, originally 699.99 at AmazonFew flat-screen TVs come with sufficient built-in sound, and even if yours seems OK, a soundbar takes things to another level. This Bravia Theater Bar 6 comes with a separate subwoofer and two rear-channel speakers to fill your room with sound, and the rear channels are wireless for easier installation. Once you hear it, you will never want to watch TV again without it.How do Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 compare against hearing aids?

Now, I can’t imagine not wearing it. The band simply will not fall off, and the magnets give it amazing adjustability. While its Apple Watch bands are my favorite products, Moft makes a lot of other lovely accessories worth checking out during its sitewide Cyber Monday sale.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AsusJUST ADDED: Asus Zenbook DuoNow $1,499.99, originally $1,699.99 at AsusI work remotely all the time, and my workflow usually requires at least two monitors. This used to mean carrying a second portable monitor with me, but then I got the Asus Zenbook Duo. It has two 3K screens and a portable keyboard that sandwiches in between the screens when the laptop closes, so it’s like just carrying a thicker laptop. It even has a built-in kickstand for propping itself up. For on-the-go workers like me, this laptop is sublime.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of LogitechJUST ADDED: Logitech Keys to Go 2Now $59.99, originally $79.99 at LogitechIf you’re traveling with a tablet or a phone and you want a keyboard to go with it, this is one of the best you can buy. It’s slim and compact, making it great for air travel, and the coin battery powering it lasts for up to two years. It can also pair with up to three devices via Bluetooth, so you can share it between devices. I’m something of a keyboard aficionado, and the Logitech Keys to Go 2 keyboard is among my favorites.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AppleApple Watch SE (2nd Gen)Now $129, originally $169.99 at WalmartApplemakes the best smartwatches you can buy, and this is coming from someone who has tested nearly all of them. Just keep in mind that they only work with iPhones – so check out the Samsung below if you’re on Android. I love the app support in particular, which means I can arm my home security system, order a pizza and get directions all from my wrist. You’ll need to charge it every day, but you’re probably already doing that with your phone. At 22% off, this watch is a steal.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonMeta Ray-Bans (Gen 1), WayfarerNow $262.99, originally $329 at AmazonHaving a camera on your face may sound weird, but it allows you to capture images and video and still enjoy the moment. The speakers are also pretty good for listening on the go without blocking out the world as earbuds do. I use them on bike rides to get that pseudo-GoPro experience, and at trade shows so I don’t miss notifications arriving on my phone while it’s in my pocket.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSeagate Portable 4TB External Hard Driveskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Filter USFree weekly newsletterA guide to buying fewer, better products.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s great long-term storage, and it’s accessible just by plugging it in. Seagate is a name known for reliable storage space, and while this hard drive isn’t the fastest, when you’re storing backup files, you don’t necessarily need speed. Just don’t use this drive for installing games or editing video files – it’s not built for that, but it’s priced right for cheap bulk storage.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsung Galaxy Watch 8Now $249.99, originally $349.99 at AmazonSamsung’s latest smartwatch brings a ton of improvements to your wrist, including totally redesigned software that makes it easier to use. Like most smart watches, it can track your sleep and monitor your heart rate during exercise, but it also performs some unique feats such as measuring antioxidants to help suggest dietary changes, and tracking blood-oxygen levels to flag potential health issues. It all comes wrapped in an attractive package that lasts for almost two days on a charge.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAmazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Plus Standing Cover Bundle$79.98, originally $132.98 at AmazonThe Amazon Fire HD 8 is a slightly smaller version of the aforementioned Amazon Fire Tablet that is better suited totravel. This particular bundle also includes a case with an origami-style leg to prop up the tablet up for watching shows on the go. Like the larger model, it’s mainly a media machine, so imagine it more like a portable TV than a full-fledged tablet. At this price, it’s still well worth it.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra$1,019.99, originally $1,419.99 at AmazonI review phones year-round, and this is the one I go back to when I’m not reviewing anything else. It’s simply one of the best Android smartphones. It has an amazing camera setup great for ultrawide snaps and zooming in to a crazy degree, onboard AI including Gemini Live, epic battery life (easily a day and a half), and a built-in stylus for those times you want precision in your tapping and swiping. This price tag may not seem like much of a discount since the S25 Ultra usually starts at about $1,200, but this is the upgraded model with 512GB storage, which you’re going to want.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsung Galaxy S25 FE$534.99, originally $709.99 at Amazon (25%)Samsung’s “fan edition” (FE) devices are designed for buyers who want a flagship phone experience at a lower price point. That means the S25 FE phone has most of the same chops as its larger siblings, including all the same AI tricks, and an impressive triple-camera setup that’s no joke. It’s a great value even at full price, and at 27% off one of the best phone deals out there for Black Friday.Personal audioView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of TechnicsJUST ADDED: Technics EAH-AZ100 earbudsNow $224.99, originally $299.99 at TechnicsWhile I haven’t used these exact earbuds, I’ve tested the previous two generations and adored them. You can control the earbuds with an app on your phone to tune the sound profile for your tastes, and you can customize controls however you want. They sound great, from the deepest dubstep to the highest-pitched guitar solos, and have awesome active noise cancellation.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSHOKZ New OpenRun Pro 2Now $124.95, originally $179.95 at AmazonBone-conduction headphones don’t go in your ears – they sit above the ear and transit crisp, clear audio with a full range of tones by simply vibrating against your head. That means you can still hear everything going on around you, making them ideal for runners. But they’re great for non-runners too – like me! I use them often on bike rides.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonBose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones$179, originally $349 at AmazonBose has been a leader in noise-cancelling headphones for decades, and the QuietComfort series of headphones carry on the legacy. These headphones are great for frequent travelers as they can cancel out the drone of planes, trains, or automobiles, while you enjoy the film Planes, Trains and Automobiles. You don’t often see these headphones at this price, so these would be a great pickup.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonBose QuietComfort Earbuds$129, originally $179 at AmazonIf the traveler in your life doesn’t want to carry a bulky set of over-the-ear headphones (like me), earbuds like these are a great solution. Like their bigger brothers, these offer outstanding active noise cancellation to drown out airplane noise, but they’re also compact and still have good battery life. Since they’re earbuds, they form a great seal in your ear canal, which passively seals out noise even when ANC isn’t active. At this price, these earbuds are hard to resist, especially when compared to their peers at $130.The best Black Friday and Cyber Monday home deals in the US – so farRead moreView image in fullscreenA pair of black Sony WF-1000XM5 EarbudsPhotograph: Courtesy of SonyWF-1000XM5 Earbuds$229.99, originally $329.99 at SonySony headphones are a cut above the rest in terms of sound quality: when I tested the WF-1000XM5, I heard tones in music that I had never heard before. I believe they’re the best-sounding earbuds you can buy, and the Guardian’s reviewerloved them too. Their popularity means Sony seldom needs to discount them, so 30% off is hard to ignore. If you know someone who loves music but still listens with cheap headphones, this will open a whole new world.Smart homeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of WalmartJUST ADDED: Olight ArcPro FlashlightNow $69.99, originally $99.99 at WalmartIf you only have pocket space for one flashlight, should it be a spot light or a flood light? The Olight ArcPro fits both into one flashlight, plus a UV light and a green laser. I’ve owned one for a few weeks and it’s been as versatile as you can imagine. The belt clip can even work in reverse to clip to the brim of your hat and turn the ArcPro into a head lamp. It’s extremely bright, and charges with the same USB-C cable as your phone, so it’s also great for travel.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of SwitchbotJUST ADDED: Switchbot AI Art FrameNow $120, originally $149.99 at SwitchbotOne of the problems with digital picture frames is the need to plug them in with an unsightly cable. The Switchbot AI art frame solves that with an E Ink Spectra display, which only uses electricity when the picture changes, like a Kindle. An internal battery means you can hang it on your wall wire-free for up to two years. You can upload photos to display through the app, or use AI to generate new artworks to display. I received an early sample that I’ve had on my wall for two weeks. Note that this is a preorder: The small version ships in early December.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of SegwaySegway Navimow X315 Robot LawnmowerNow $1,999, originally $2,299 at SegwayThis past summer, I tested nine different robot lawnmowers, including the Navimow X350 – a version of this with a slightly larger battery. I set it up and I never had to mow my lawn for the entire summer. Neither did my elderly neighbor – I set it up to mow his lawn too. The mower uses GPS and a beacon for centimeter-level accuracy to efficiently mow your lawn as often as you want; I set mine to mow three times per week. I named it Ziggy.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSkylight 15in Digital CalendarNow $249.99, originally $319.99 at AmazonI never thought I needed a digital calendar until I got one, and now I can’t live without it. Yes, I can always open my phone or laptop to see my Google Calendar, but having it up on my wall is a game changer. The Skylight now occupies a prominent spot in my kitchen, and my whole family has quickly adopted using it. It syncs with most major calendar services, and can also serve as a large photo frame if you want. As someone who lives and dies by his calendar, I leave mine on the calendar view all the time.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonDwarf 3 Smart TelescopeNow $494.10, originally $549 at AmazonI wouldn’t go so far as to call myself an amateur astronomer, but I love gazing at the stars. The Dwarf Telescope 3 pairs with your phone to track the skye and follow astronomical phenomena, taking long exposures to give you amazing photos. It comes with its own carrying case and it’s so small, I was able to include it in my suitcase on a trip to Hawaii. It can also work during the day as a telephoto camera for wildlife photography.Ignore all the smart home gimmicks.

What will it leave of value once it pops?Mon 1 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 10.32 ESTShareThe California Gold Rush left an outsized imprint on America. Some 300,000 people flocked there from 1848 to 1855, from as far away as the Ottoman Empire. Prospectors massacred Indigenous people to take the gold from their lands in the Sierra Nevada mountains. And they boosted the economies of nearby states and faraway countries from whence they bought their supplies.Gold provided the motivation for California – a former Mexican territory then controlled by the US military – to become a state with laws of its own. And yet, few “49ers” as prospectors were known, struck it rich. It was the merchants selling prospectors food and shovels who made the money. One, a Bavarian immigrant named Levi Strauss who sold denim overalls to the gold bugs passing through San Francisco, may be the most remembered figure of his day.California is going through another investment rush these days. This time it’s centered in Silicon Valley. The pot of gold is more elusive but potentially much bigger: Artificial Intelligence. What this rush leaves in its wake will shape the long-term future of civilization – or maybe not?The question everyone seems to be asking is: is AI a bubble? Lots of peopleseem to think so, including Open AI’sSam Altmanand theBank of England. How else to explain Nvidia’s stock price, which more than doubled from April to November, based entirely on the expectation, nay hope, that AI will produce a super-intelligence that can do everything humans do but better.Nvidia– like Levi Strauss back in the day – is at least selling something: computer chips. The valuations of many of the other AI plays – likeOpen AIorAnthropic– are based largely on the dream.The big analytical challenge, however, is to figure out what kind of bubble this is. Is it the kind that will ravage the economy when it bursts? What will it leave of value once it pops?Bubbles all share one characteristic – besotted investors in pursuit of a dream. But they come in many flavors. Not 20 years ago, we suffered the housing bubble, when home prices rose to stratospheric heights and almost brought down the financial system as they crashed back to earth. Less than a decade earlier, it was the dot-com bubble that burst, when investors realized that Webvan, Pets.com and the like were not worth billions just because they used the Internet.A few years before that we witnessed the rise and collapse of the East Asian bubble – with ancillary bubblettes in Russia and Brazil – when money rushed into these emerging markets, freaked and rushed out. There was the Tequila Crisis, which pummeled the Mexican peso and its economy. And the Japanese bubble, when the value of the Nikkei 225 stock index tripled over four years before it fell by 60% over the next two and a half.Bubbles have plagued the world’s finances at least since the 17th century, when Dutch investors fell in and out of love with tulips. In the 18th century, French, Dutch and British investors produced what came to be known as the South Sea bubble by giving in to euphoria over the value of potential of new trade routes across the Atlantic.That bubble ended with an Act of the British Parliament “to Restrain the Extravagant and Unwarrantable Practice of Raising Money by Voluntary Subscription For Carrying on Projects Dangerous to the Trade and Subjects of the United Kingdom.” It came to be known as the Bubble Act.Virtually every new frontier opened up to investment has led to a speculative bubble. Investors have scrambled to tap into its promise only to overdo it and stampede in retreat. Economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff found that of the world’s 66 major economies, including developed nations and big developing countries, only Portugal, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands had avoided a banking crisis between 1945 and 2007. By the end of 2008 none of them were unscathed.So the most important question as one evaluates the frenzied AI investment landscape is not really whether it will pop or not, but what sort of legacy it will leave behind. Would the fallout include a hobbled financial system and an intractable, prolonged recession, as the bursting of the housing bubble left in its wake? Or is it more likely to look like the dot-com bubble, whose bursting produced a comparatively shallow economic downturn and ultimately gave the world the modern internet?As I pointed out inmy last columnabout AI, Gita Gopinath, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, calculated that a stock market crash equivalent to that which ended the dot-com boom would erase some $20tn in American household wealth and another $15tn abroad, enough to strangle consumer spending and induce a recession.But the economic pain would depend to a large extent on how the AI investment surge is being financed. One problem is that we don’t really know.The housing bubble was built from a boom in mortgage finance, as yield-seeking banks stuffed themselves with bonds built of bundles of mortgages to increasingly uncreditworthy borrowers. When the borrowers couldn’t pay, the boom left a forest of damaged balance sheets in its wake, from over-indebted households with no access to credit, to a banking system hobbled by worthless bonds. Financing froze. It took years for America’s credit-driven economy to recover.AI could produce a similar landscape. A critical determinant is how much debt is at stake. It wouldn’t be such a problem if the bubble were financed largely from the cash pile of Alphabet and Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. They might lose their shirt, but who cares. The worrying bit is that it seems they are increasingly relying on borrowing, which means the prospect of a bursting bubble would again put the financial system at risk.Big Tech has raised nearly $250bn in debt so far this year,according to Bloomberg, a record. Analysts atMorgan Stanley suggestthat debt will be needed to fill a $1.5tn funding gap to ramp up spending on data centers and hardware. Problematically, it is getting hard to follow the money, as Nvidia, Open AI and others in the ecosystem buy into each other, clouding who, in the end, will be left holding the bag.The other question is to what extent the AI that the Silicon Valley faithful are building will endure. Railways survived the 19th century railway bust. The Internet survived the dot-com implosion. Is there anything of sufficient value to justify the current moment of euphoria, even if it heads south for a time?Until a few weeks ago, I would have said sure: there must be something in Chat GPT or Claude that will raise business productivity. But to justify the vast quantities of money they are going to have to build something really impressive – as in superhuman general intelligence impressive. Over the last several weeks, a thought has bubbled up through the ecosystem that they won’t.It’s a thought built on the thoughts of techier minds than mine.Yann LeCun, until recently Meta’s chief scientist and a winner of the Turing Award, has been saying that the massive spend on Large Language Models that today define the AI space is misguided. Artificial General Intelligence – aka the Superhuman – can only come about by dropping LLMs – which are essentially massive correlation engines – and switching to something else called a world model architecture, where machines develop a “mental” model of the outside world.If he’s right, that would be one big oops for much of today’s AI spend. Nvidia and the rest of us may be about to learn, once again, that just because you sold a load of jeans and shovels, it doesn’t mean there is gold in them thar hills.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)US economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

In the US, it could make a comebackDavid KirpBans on the dangerous practice, condemned by national mental health organizations, could soon be struck downMon 1 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 06.12 ESTShareHomosexuality is an illness that therapists can and should cure: that’s the rationale for “conversion therapy”, a practice promoted as a way to change an individual’s sexual orientation from gay to straight.But a host of studies conclude that such counseling doesn’t work – small wonder, since sexual orientation is a core part of an individual’s identity. It’s also potentially harmful, especially for minors. Research shows that youth subjected to conversion practices, often at the insistence of misguided parents, are prone to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness and suicide.Until recently, this medieval practice seemed destined for the dustbin of discredited psychological theories. National mental health associations have recommended that the practice be prohibited, because it’s based on the homophobic “assumption that diverse sexual orientations and gender identities are mental illnesses”, as theAmerican Psychiatric Associationputs it.Twenty-three stateshave banned it for minors, according to the Movement Advancement Project.Now, however, it is making a comeback.This term, the US supreme court will decide whether a law prohibiting conversion practices infringes on constitutionally protected free speech. During last month’s oral argument in that case, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned whether the regulation wasn’t “just the functional equivalent” of another recent supreme court case. In June, the court upheld a ban on a different treatment – puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans youth. “It just seems odd to me that we might have a different result here,” she said. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, meanwhile,likened conversion therapyto a dietitian telling a client to do something physically harmful, saying: “I don’t think the state has to provide a study to show that the advice is not sound.”Nonetheless, comments from the bench during that argument indicate that the rightwing majority will strike down these laws. Anguished survivors fear the disastrous consequences of such a ruling. They’re speaking out on social media.“I was sent to conversion therapy against my will. I endured it for six months. I was a shell of a person after, and almost took my own life … I feel compelled to plead that we cannot accept this,” one survivor wrote,according to Cosmopolitan. “Seeing what’s coming from the supreme court really terrifies me,” said another. “I’m fearful for younger generations that could be subjected to this.”By attempting to brainwash gay youth into becoming “normal”, conversion practices promotes Donald Trump’s war on the LGBTQ+ community. That explains why, relying on junk science, a Department of Health and Human Services report issued last springappeared to supportthe practice.During his New York City days, the presidentvoiced support for LGBTQ+ rights. Since then, however, he has become the arch-antagonist. Attacking trans people has proven a surefire winner for the Maga crowd. An executive order, issued only hours after he was sworn in, mandates thatpassports recognize only two sexes, male and female. That edict upends the lives of an estimated 1.3 million adults who identify as trans or gender non-conforming.Trump has also brought his gay-bashing campaign to the schoolhouse. “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,” an executive order issued his second day in the White House, prohibits federal funding for schools that introduce “gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology” in the classroom. That vague language has made teachers petrified to say anything about trans individuals.Trump’s yes men are doing their best to drive gay people into the closet. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, hasbanned trans individualsfrom serving in the military, and that’s likely to be just the start of his witch-hunt.Hegseth has suggestedthat allowing gay people to serve openly in the armed forces prioritizes social justice over unit cohesion and military readiness – a claim for which there isn’t a scintilla of evidence. Herenamed the USNS Harvey Milk, which honored the gay rights icon and navy veteran, timing the move –intentionally, according to a military.com report– during Pride month.At the FBI, a longtime employeesays he was firedfor having had a rainbow flag on his desk. . The administration has moved tocut more than $800min research grants including on LGBTQ+ health, claiming that the studies led to “unscientific” results that ignore “biological realities”. The federally-funded 988 suicide and crisis hotlineended its servicesfor LGBTQ+ youth, apparently because it promotes “radical gender ideology”. How heartless can you get?There’s no end of targets for the bully in the White House to slap around. You can include the LGBTQ+ community on the roster of groups – immigrants, religious and ethnic minorities, African Americans, women, disabled and low-income individuals – that are already feeling the lash of a president who seemshellbent on turning the nation into an autocracy. Doubtlessly, there’s more and worse to come.Ben Franklin nailed it: “We must all hang together or we will all hang separately.” Although resisting the Trump juggernaut is an uphill battle, these groups need to join forces in a groundswell of protest – No Kings indeed.David Kirp is professor emeritus at the University of California-Berkeley and a frequent Guardian contributor.In the US, you can call or text the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifelineat 988 or chat at988lifeline.org.

Lionel Messi carefully places a soccer ball on a field, ready to take a free kick. He is flanked by Lionel Messi and Lionel Messi. On the sideline, manager Lionel Messi, assisted by Lionel Messi, gesticulates. Lionel Messi lays off the ball for Lionel Messi, who crosses it to Lionel Messi. Lionel Messi chests and volleys it into the net and is mobbed by another half dozen Lionel Messis (or is it Lionels Messi?).Facing Inter Miami in the ongoing MLS playoffs must feel more or less like living inside this ad. Before Saturday’s Eastern Conference final against New York City FC, Messi had either scored or assisted on all 12 goals Miami had scored in the postseason. Messi hassmashed up the leaguethis year, but he has saved the real savagery for the playoffs.On Saturday, Inter finally got over their own case ofMessipendencia– the Argentinian contributed just one assist in a rollicking 5-1 win over NYC FC.They are so much fun, this Miami team. Seeing Messi in his pomp, chasing yet another trophy and dragging his club along until it developed enough velocity of its own, has been fun. TheseMLSplayoffs, even as favorites have excelled, have been fun.There have only been four upsets – and just one among teams seeded more than one place apart, when fifth-seeded NYC FC beat top-seeded Philadelphia – but the bracket has been packed with drama and reversals in fortune and cinematic climaxes.Would a few more rounds of regular season games have extracted the same performances from Messi, or ignited the fireworks we’ve seen in MLS over the last few weeks? There is no placebo group here, but it’s doubtful.The Vancouver Whitecaps-LAFC Western Conference semi-final was an epic, a ding-dong affair tied up with a 95th-minute Heung-min Son free kick.The Whitecaps finished extra-time down to nine men because of a red card to defender Tristan Blackmon and an injury. But they survived LAFC hitting both posts and the crossbar on a single sequence and prevailed on penalties.Playoffs!They are fun, and they care not about the genre of soccer being played. Over in the NWSL, Gotham FC upset the Washington Spirit in the Championship final, courtesy of asplendid Rose Lavelle finishfrom the edge of the box. That was only after Juan Carlos Amorós’s side had already upset the No 1 and No 4 seeds. Gotham were the lowest-seeded team (No 8) to ever win the title, breaking their own record from two years ago, when they were seeded sixth.You could quibble that Gotham being seeded so low was fluky, given their continental title in the Concacaf W Champions Cup just six months earlier, injuries to key players, and a four-game winless run to close out the regular season that sent them tumbling down the standings. But then, in the dying seconds of extra-time in the quarter-final, they squeaked by a Kansas City Current team that had pulverised the league during the regular season. Gotham, a team who won just nine of their 26 regular season matches beat the club that set a record points total. And then they only went and knocked out the defending champion Orlando Pride with a 97th-minute winner on their only shot on goal in the whole game, advancing to the championship game.Playoffs!View image in fullscreenThe Washington Spirit made the NWSL Championship on the back of penalty kick heroics by Aubrey Kingsbury.Photograph: Hannah Foslien/NWSL/Getty ImagesWas all of this, or any of it, fair?

So long as you aren’t partial to any of the other teams, yeah, absolutely.And in the end, the point of pro sports is entertainment; fairness comes second to that.In dissecting what, exactly, makes sporting competition attractive, the Twenty First Group consultancy once identified “quality, jeopardy and connection” as the key ingredients to appealing contests. Pound for pound, playoff games will deliver more of those than a regular season game will. This is partly a self-fulfilling prophecy, of course. As Gotham demonstrated, the league table can start to feel like a pass-fail entry exam into the real thing, reducing most of the season to a qualifying event. But this achieves a service to all but the hardcore fan: it concentrates the action – the jeopardy – into far fewer games. Into better games.Purists recoil at the erosion of the straight league table – the type used to determine the champions of most of the best soccer leagues in the world since they were founded.But there’s something of an inconsistency that is overlooked here: some of the most popular competitions in soccer – the World Cup; the Uefa Champions League and its lesser step-siblings the Europa League and the Conference League; the Euros; Copa América – derive much of their appeal from the fact that they, too, are mostly playoffs. In the games that matter they are, at any rate. That’s where all the good stuff happens, the theater and the elation and the anguish.After Vancouver’s 3-1 win over 10-man San Diego in Saturday’s other conference final, we’ll get a Thomas Müller-Lionel Messi final to redeem this sordid year of our lord, 2025.Playoffs forever.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

I have so many questions,” another friend asked. Some people assumed I was some kind of paid operative for the Allan government, as if my enthusiasm was suspicious and not the obvious reaction to shiny new stations and efficient signage choices to direct people through them.The Metro Tunnel will finally open after years of chaos – so what is the payoff for the Melbourne commuter?Read moreWhat they didn’t know was that the public soft launch this past Sunday – a day I’d marked in my Google calendar weeks earlier – had been the culmination of years of curiosity, disruptions and breathless governmental updates I’d followed closely for what felt like forever.View image in fullscreen‘I’d lived so many lives while this thing was built!’ Brodie Lancaster at the opening of Melbourne’s Metro Tunnel.Photograph: Brodie LancasterWhen the Andrews government first broke ground on the Metro Tunnel, I was 27. By the time I hopped on to the train on Sunday, I was closer to 36. I’d lived so many lives while this thing was built! In 2019, when there was a public competition to name the machines that would dig all the dirt out of the tunnel’s route, I tried unsuccessfully to rally my Facebook friends (I still used Facebook then!) to submit my name, because I thought the words “boring machine” were funny and I wanted to be one.Those machines – eventually named after actual famous people – worked for years while we collectively hibernated during lockdowns. By the time we emerged into a city that had “opened up” on paper in 2021, so much of it was still closed off behind construction hoardings. The tram stop on Collins Street was closed, and my beloved Sticky Institute was turfed out of the spot in Campbell Arcade where it had sold zines for 21 years. So many things went out of commission over the past eight years to build this thing that I’d mostly forgotten Fed Square evenhada visitor centre. You don’t really care about functional, uncool, banal landmarks until they’re swallowed up for almost a decade.Melbourne might not have an airport train but now we’ve got really long escalators and gargantuan Patricia Piccinini artworks to call our ownAfter eight years, $15bn and endless disruptions, seeing people flooding the new platforms felt like a true reopening of the city.While some train enthusiasts reading this might be outraged to know I’d never heard the word “gunzel” until this past weekend, I joined them – and thousands more regular local stickybeaks – in riding along the new path. We took photos, some people clapped when doors opened and closed, I claimed as much free swag (namely a themed newspaper, cookie, lollipop and dinky little flag to wave) as I could carry. We come to this place for magic. And for merch.In regular life, people who try to shove their way on to public transport before waiting for people to disembark are my mortal enemies. On this day, we were all united. I understood their eagerness! (But, in future, let’s all try a bit harder to wait a sec, shall we?)View image in fullscreenPassengers have their photo taken on the opening day of the Metro Tunnel in Melbourne on Sunday.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockThe stations look pretty standard, unlike those on the stately old City Loop. Where Melbourne Central has shiny red tile and parliament is all 80s steel and Southern Cross is a sensory nightmare full of spontaneous wind storms, the new stations are aesthetically almost identical. I’ve looked enviously at theSydney Metro,with its towering mosaics and space-age ceilings. Melbourne might not have an airport train but now we’ve got really long escalators and gargantuan Patricia Piccinini artworks to call our own. And that’s something to celebrate.I didn’t live in Melbourne when the City Loop opened back in 1985. It would be five years before I was born, then another 18 before Melbourne became my adopted home. That first year living here, I took hours-long train trips from my northern suburbs home to Frankston, just to go op-shopping. I rode laps of the City Circle tram between uni classes to kill time and learn the CBD’s landmarks. Even today, I’ve been known to derail conversations with impassioned speeches about the best bus route in town. (The 246, for those of you wondering.) I’ve realised, this week, that there has been a gunzel hiding inside of me all this time. It just took five zippy new landmarks to bring her out.Brodie Lancaster is a critic and columnist from Melbourne. She is the author of the memoir No Way!

When Your Party – now itsofficial name– was launched at the end of July, 800,000 people registered their interest. That qualified as a political phenomenon, and spoke to an unprecedented opportunity for the left. Thanks to an economic model no longer able to offer a sustained rise in living standards or properly functioning public services, and a foreign policy defined by murderous calamities – culminating in Israel’s Gaza genocide – the radical left has its biggest ever receptive audience.But by the time of its founding conference in Liverpool at the weekend, Your Party had offered a masterclass in how the left can never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Members repelled by a Labour devoid of answers to Britain’s multiple crises were ready to listen to a credible, inspiring alternative. Instead, they have been subjected to a bitter public schism between Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, its two leading founders, as well as threats of legal action, public denunciations, unsavoury anonymous briefings to rightwing newspapers and anobsession with internal process. The politically disillusioned have accordingly transferred their attention to Zack Polanski’s Green party, which has clearly repositioned itself on the unapologetic left and been rewarded with a membership of 170,000 and some polling that isahead of Labour.Given all that,55,000 peoplesigning up to a new party – nearly as many as the membership of the Liberal Democrats – is impressive. Two and a half thousand conference delegates represented a dramatic scaling down of ambitions, but a sizeable number for an initial gathering. Attenders brimmed with idealism, positivity – and fear of the stakes. “This is the last throw of the dice, we know that,” one delegate told me. “We’ve heard for years, ‘it’s socialism or barbarism’ – and itissocialism or barbarism.” Given the surge of the far right, and questions over the survival of US democracy, Rosa Luxemburg’s famous maxim can no longer be so easily dismissed as hyperbole.But our present danger does not seem to have provoked a general concentrating of minds. Sultana unilaterally announced first the party’s launch, without the agreement of Corbyn,then a portalfor people to sign up as members. This was disavowed by her Your Party colleagues, but not before hundreds of thousands of pounds was raised, leading to mutual legal threats. Only some of this has been transferredto Your Party, with Sultana promising to transfer the rest as long as the liabilities of the company that holds the money are settled. Corbyn tells me, “We were worried that we’d be able to even pay for the conference two weeks ago.” Sultana’s camp feel they have been frozen out, that Corbyn’s longtime aides are control freaks and that there was too much dithering. But this unseemly drama has repelled most of those who are receptive to radical politics butwho aren’t activists and who are allergic to those traditional leftwing blights: in-fighting, posturing, sectarianism and an obsession with meetings.Those hoping the launch conference would end the drama were bitterly disappointed. When a few delegates – mostly belonging to the Socialist Workers party (SWP) – were banned from attending,Sultana boycottedthe first day. Was this conference not an opportunity to move on from toxic drama, I put it to her? “That’s what I thought until people were being expelled and there was a witch-hunt that took place. I think pretending that hasn’t happened is just not being honest.” The expulsions certainly did not go down well with other delegates. “If people wanted a central dictatorship, they’d join the Labour party and people don’t want that,” one young doctor told me. Conference voted decisively to reject a ban on dual membership, though which parties are allowed will be determined by an elected central executive committee.But watching the SWP pose as democratic tribunes sticks in the craw. This highly centralised sect bans permanent internal factions. It seems to me to have been ostracised by much of the wider left over ascandal involving alleged rapemore than a decade ago. Like other Trotskyist sects, it can be effective at organising – or indeed dominating – single-issue campaigns, but is incapable of securing mass support even in times of crisis and turmoil. It is not genuinely invested in Your Party’s success: it simply spies an opportunity to attract new recruits, most of whom it will burn out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its demand for collective leadership – a ruling body of 20 –narrowly passed. Its leading figure, an always thought-provoking activist called Max Shanly, argued that traditional parties reflect the evils of existing society “in their structures, practices and modes of behaviour”. A party seeking to democratise society must reflect on ultra-democratic principles. An experiment now beckons: will Your Party become the acorn of a newly liberated society, or a battleground dominated by revolutionary sects thanks to their organisational capacity, stamina and obsessive behaviour?Corbyn himself remains to represent the “spirit of 2017”: the year a Labour party led by him secured 40% of the vote, depriving the Tories of a majority, after offering a leftwing policy platform. His conference speech was infused with the from-the-heart, non-dogmatic, unpolished socialism that, at its best, attracted so much enthusiasm.But the diminished number remaining inYour Partyare more attracted to the much more militant and overtly ideological tack taken by Sultana. She has sought “wedge” issues to distinguish the party from the Greens. She criticises them for not demanding immediate withdrawal from Nato (Polanski favours seeking alternative security alliances first) and not committing to ending all diplomatic relations with Israel (the Greens support the demands of the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, and proscribing the Israel Defence Forces as a terrorist organisation). She emphasises the “need to nationalise the entire economy”.With the Greens thriving with a radical message and a new viral social-media strategy reminiscent of New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s quirky, sunny optimism, there is a question about how many voters this approach will appeal to. Some delegates put it to me that this will be a decades-long struggle, and that there are no short cuts to socialism. But in an age of resurgent fascism, economic and social turmoil, and looming climate catastrophe, some might ask if the left really has the luxury of time.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYour PartyOpinionJeremy CorbynZarah SultanaGreen partyZack PolanskicommentShareReuse this content"

A friend had shared that it was an experience all women should have because, regardless of age and body type, a supportive bra is always worthwhile; as is the firm yet kind guidance of a professional fitter who has seen it all.“It was her hand on my upper back to steady me,” my friend said. “It made me cry.”Despite my tendency to recoil from department stores, I went to level three seeking a small moment of guidance, with a supportive hand on my back.I breastfed four babies for eight years, wearing maternity bras for too many months after my youngest had weaned. The elastic had stretched and the stitching had frayed. These bras were not unlike me: tired, soft around the edges and a little threadbare.‘The friendship of the good’: how a community garden gave me a sense of something bigger than myselfRead moreNow as I enter perimenopause, I’m having a hard time articulating exactly how to define the change, even though the shift into a new life stage is overt. I heard that the first symptom is rather ambiguous – feeling not quite like yourself – and I nod and think:That’s precisely how I feel.I beeline for a woman who wears her glasses on the tip of her nose and threads straps on to coat hangers without looking. Her name is Debbie, she asks my name and what I want.“Nothing fussy,” I tell her. “Good basics.”She moves quickly from one display to another and points out my options, collects my preferences in one hand, describes the style of each, and how I can expect them to fit. She’s shown me exactly what I envisioned buying but I am aghast at the cup size. It’s a visual reminder of what’s most inevitable: we age and grow. It’s the humbling nature of getting older in a world that actively tries to suppress it.Within the intimate confines of the change room I try not to focus too much on the softness of my belly, my pale winter skin mottled under the lights, all the improvements that could be made but probably won’t be. Debbie speaks calmly, adjusts the straps, points out the separation between my breasts, comments on the fact that I’m filling the cups well. She asks me if I feel held.“Yes, I do.”I think about this word for the rest of the day:held. It’s what we all want, isn’t it? A bit of stability in this uncertain world, even if it’s momentary.Debbie smiles and remarks on how easy it was to find what I needed. I walk away with a few basics that will, ideally, last a few years, but it’s our fleeting interaction I’ll remember most. It reminded me of the bolstering nature of conversation with another human, amplifying the dull and lonely transactions of online shopping.In an increasingly convenient, AI-assisted world, we’re less and less likely to have these engagements with each other – planned or incidental – and with this loss we sidestep the opportunity to care, and be cared for. This is such a vital part of being human because it is an experience that feels meaningful in the moment, and reverberates within us for a long time afterwards.Loneliness has been proven to be as physically detrimental assmoking 15 cigarettes a day. Casual interactions are now recognised as early mental health intervention, particularly for vulnerable new mothers who are prone to isolation. The conversations we have with the bra-fitter, the barista at the local cafe and the person you wait with at the bus stop all give us a dose of optimism and encouragement. They provide a sense of connection, even in the middle of the city where we anonymously scuttle from one place to the next.The kindness of strangers: a woman paid for my groceries when I couldn’tRead moreI wonder if Debbie and her colleagues see women in the street wearing ill-fitting bras and wish they could usher them to a claimed corner of the department store and sort them out, lift them up, take away the weight that pulls on their shoulders; lift a little of their life heaviness.In a world as busy and distracted as ours, we all need small moments of tenderness, and we all need to feel the supportive and stabilising experience of being held.Jodi Wilson is a health journalist and author of four books, including A Brain That Breathes: Essential habits for an overwhelming world, which will be published in January.

Please come and sue the UK for billionsGeorge MonbiotThe case of a planned Cumbrian coalmine shows how governments around the world are being threatened by litigation in shadowy offshore courtsMon 1 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 08.17 ESTShareHow do you reckon our political system works? Perhaps something like this. We elect MPs. They vote on bills. If a majority is achieved, the bills becomes law. The law is upheld by the courts. End of story. Well, that’s how it used to work. No longer.Today, foreign corporations, or the oligarchs who own them,can sue governmentsfor the laws they pass, at offshore tribunals composed of corporate lawyers. The cases are held in secret. Unlike our courts, these tribunals allow no right of appeal or judicial review. You or I cannot take a case to them, nor can our government, or even businesses based in this country. They are open only to corporations based overseas.If a tribunal determines that a law or policy may compromise the corporation’s projected profits, it can award damages of hundreds of millions, even billions. These sums represent not actual losses, but money the arbitrators decide the companymight otherwisehave made. The government may have to abandon its policy. It will be discouraged from passing future laws along the same lines, for fear of being sued.Record numbers ofcases are being brought, as corporations learn from each other, andhedge funds finance suitsin return for a share of the takings. The result? Sovereignty and democracy are becoming unaffordable.The process is known as“investor-state dispute settlement” (ISDS). The reason it is allowed to override domestic law and the decisions made by parliaments is that this provision has been written – without public consent, and often in conditions of extreme secrecy – into trade treaties.A year ago,Friends of the Earth won a great victoryat the high court. The judge ruled that plans to dig the first deep coalmine in the UK for 30 years, at Whitehaven in Cumbria, had been unlawfully approved by the Conservative government, which had accepted the bizarre claim that the mine would have no impact on our carbon budgets. The Labour government then withdrew the permission the Tories had granted. Now this victory could be compromised by an offshore tribunal answering to no one but the corporations petitioning it.In August, a company whose ultimate ownersare based in the Cayman Islandslodged a claimagainst the UK government. Last week a tribunal in Washington DCwas set up to hear it.The company is suing the UK for the money it might have made if the mine had been allowed to go ahead. We have no idea how much this might be. Who is representing it against the British government? The MP for Torridge and Tavistock, and former attorney-general in the Conservative government, that great patriot Geoffrey Cox. The government makes a decision, the high court upholds it, then a foreign company challenges it through an undemocratic offshore tribunal, and a member of our parliament acts on its behalf.On the same day (18 November) that the tribunal on the coalmine case was appointed, we learned from a parliamentary answer that the UKis also being sued under ISDSby a Russian oligarch, Mikhail Fridman. We know nothing of the case so far, but it seems likely that he’ll use the tribunal to challenge the sanctions the UK levied against him after the invasion of Ukraine. He has already started suing Luxembourg for this reason,demanding $16bn(£12.1bn): half thatgovernment’s annual revenue. Amongthe lawyers representing him there? Cherie Blair, wife of the former British prime minister.Legal experts believe the EU’s delay inusing frozen Russian assets as collateralfor its loan to Ukraine arises from Belgium’s fear that it could besued in the offshore corporate courts, under the Belgium/Luxembourg-Russia bilateral investment treaty. This extraordinary, undemocratic power over elected governments could be blocking the money Ukraine desperately needs.We were assured that such things wouldn’t happen. In 2014, David Cameron,promoting the biggest and most dangerousof all such treaties, told us: “We’ve signed trade deal after trade deal and there has never been a problem in the past.” The House of Lords adviser on this issue, Prof Dennis Novy,accused campaigners of“scaremongering … in reality, ISDS does not affect the UK much”. The overall message seemed to be that only poorer nations needed to fear these lawsuits.I warned, to general mockery, that “as corporations begin to understand the power they’ve been granted, they will turn their attention from the weak nations to the strong ones”.That threat has now materialised. This year, fossil fuel and mining firms havelodged a record numberof suits against nations rich and poor, challenging – as in the case of the Cumbrian coalmine – government attempts to stop climate breakdown. Corporations have so far won$114bn (£86bn) through ISDS, of which fossil fuel companies have secured $84bn (£64bn). Thatequates to the combined GDPof the world’s 45 smallest economies. The average payout these companies have received is $1.2bn (£910m). In some cases they threaten to suck the poorest nations dry. This is climate finance in reverse: huge payments to fossil fuel corporations from governments with the temerity to try to stop an existential crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ameta-study in 2020 found that, when it comes to encouraging foreign investment, the “effect of international investment agreements is so small as to be considered zero”. A reportcommissioned by the UK governmentin 2013 found that ISDS was “highly unlikely to encourage investment” and was “likely to provide the UK with few or no benefits”.Yet Keir Starmer’s government shuts its ears. It has reportedly beentrying to push an ISDS mechanisminto the investment treaty it is negotiating with India, and into the other trade treaties it is working on. We cannot know for sure, because they’re beingnegotiated in total secrecy. You could almost believe there were things the government didn’t want us to see. It refuses to talk to campaigners or to offer more information.We have twice beaten attempts to extend ISDS, through vast popular movements against themultilateral agreement on investmentand theTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Now we will need to mobilise again: this time against our own government, which seems to care more for foreign corporations than it does for us.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLawOpinionEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

The onslaught continues. There are near-dailyattacks on the territory. On a single day at the end of October, almost 100 Palestinians were killed. On 19 November, 32 were killed. On 23 November, 21. And on it goes. Since the ceasefire, more than 300 have been killed and almost 1,000 injured. Those numbers will rise. The real shift is that the ceasefire has reduced global attention and scrutiny. Meanwhile, Israel’s emerging blueprint becomes clearer: bloody domination not only in Gaza, but across Palestine and the wider region.A “dangerous illusion that life in Gaza is returning to normal”, is how Amnesty International’s secretary general, Agnès Callamard,describedthis post-ceasefire period. Israeli authorities have reduced attacks and allowed some aid into Gaza, she said, but “the world must not be fooled. Israel’s genocide is not over.” Not a singlehospitalin Gaza has returned to being fully operational. The onset of rain and cooling weather has left thousands exposed in dilapidated tents. Since the ceasefire on 10 October, almost 6,500 tonnes of UN-coordinated relief materials have been denied entry into Gaza by Israeli authorities. According toOxfam, in the two weeks after the ceasefire alone, shipments of water, food, tents and medical supplies from 17 international NGOs were denied.The result is that a population whose homes, livelihoods and stable shelter have been eliminated still are not allowed to secure safer tents or adequate food. Israeli authorities hold people in Gaza in a painful purgatory, continuing collective punishment, preventing the conditions for a normal life from emerging and establishingIsraelas sole unaccountable overlord, with unlimited power over the people of the territory.Gaza is at the sharp end of an expansion of Israeli imperialism, one that stretches to the West Bank and beyond. In the occupied territories of the West Bank, a crackdown that has intensified since 7 October 2023 continues to escalate into a full military siege. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forced out of their homes this year in a pattern that Human Rights Watchsaidamounted to “war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing … that should be investigated and prosecuted”. Last week,footage emergedof two Palestinian men in Jenin being executed by Israeli soldiers after it appeared that they had surrendered. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, said that the forces involved in the killings have his “full backing”. They “acted exactly as expected of them – terrorists must die”.1:24Moment Israeli forces shoot dead surrendered Palestinians – video reportAnd this is only a small window, in a rare filmed moment, into the bloodshed. More than 1,000 people havebeen killedby Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank over the past two years. One in five of them are children. More than 300 cases were suspected “extrajudicial executions”. In October of this year, the UNregisteredmore than 260 settler attacks, the highest level since its records began 20 years ago. More than 93% of investigations into these attacks endwith no chargesfiled. Scores of Palestinian prisoners arereportedto die in Israeli prisons of physical violence or medical neglect, and those who do make it out aliverecounta hellscape of torture and abuse.And still, the parameters of Israel’s mandate to assault, kill and land grab continue to widen. Last week, Israeli forceslauncheda ground incursion in southern Syria, killing 13 Syrians, among them children. The Israeli military refused to provide information on the group it claimed to be targeting in the raid. It was simply reserving its right to reach into Syrian territory, as it has several times since it invaded and occupied the buffer zone between the two countries, and other parts of southern Syria. Since it has done so, Israeli forces have beenaccusedby Human Rights Watch of applying the colonial playbook seen in Palestinian territories: forced displacements, home seizures, demolitions, cutting of livelihoods and unlawful transfer of Syrian detainees to Israel. Israel intends to maintain its presence indefinitely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite a peace deal negotiationlast November, Israel has launched almostdaily bombingsin Lebanese territory. The latest was only last week. It continues to occupy five vantage points from which it launches attacks on targets it claims are linked to Hezbollah. According to a UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Israel is guilty of more than 10,000 air and ground violations of the ceasefire, during which hundreds of people have been killed. In the melee, civilians are, once again, ejected from their lands, vulnerable to Israeli military assaults and essentially subjects of a sort of Israeli super-sovereignty. According to a recent New York Timesreport, “the situation in Lebanon offers a compelling example of a new Middle East where Israel’s reach is near ubiquitous”.What sort of ceasefires are these? What sort of status quo is this? A volatile and unsustainable one, is the answer, one during which no reasonable mind can expect any sort of peace to materialise, either inPalestineor in the wider Middle East. Brokers and stakeholders and diplomats may repeat the language of phased ceasefires and reconstruction schemes, but the reality is that these are plans for a future that is never going to emerge unless Israel’s unlawful acts across territories that it has no legal rights over come to an end. The dangerous illusion that life is returning to normal applies not only in Gaza, but across Palestine and the wider region. It will soon shatter.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Days later, I experienced that power first-hand.I was covering Sunday’s Put Australia First Rally in Melbourne. The area had just become a“designated area” for six months mere hours earlier. The protest had just begun. Stephanie Convery, my colleague, had stepped away, and so I was alone and away from protesters, standing just inside Flinders Street station with my video gear.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThen two officers, both women, approached. They asked me if I knew that they were allowed to search me without a warrant. “Oh yes, I certainly do,” I said. As our reporting covered, the “designated area” means police and protective service officers (PSOs) can randomly stop and search or pat down anyone without a warrant or reasonable grounds, something that human rights and legal groups have described as a“vast overreach”.They appeared to sense my guardedness. One of the officers explained the new powers to me, like she was reciting a script, continuing even after I interjected a few times to say that I knew what was going on.View image in fullscreenMultimedia journalist Lisa Favazzo moments after police searched her without a warrant at the Put Australia First rally on Sunday.Photograph: Stephanie Convery/The GuardianI asked one of the officers to hold the large video camera and monopod I was carrying, and I lifted my arms.

There were only about 200 protesters there and easily as many officers.A big patch of rain had just come through. Soaked officers formed a boundary around the mostly empty intersection in front of Flinders Street station. The protesters huddled together under the cover outside the station, wearing soggy Australian flags, including one with a boxing Kangaroo. “Are you with them?” asked the officer.

The search ended very quickly after that.I offered to show the officers the rest of my bags’ contents, but they weren’t interested. They handed us a print-out explaining the powers and then walked away.

Here, he remembers their heated rehearsals, the night they stayed up watching Jaws – and the last four cigarettes they smoked togetherPatrick MarberMon 1 Dec 2025 11.16 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 12.57 ESTShareTom was my hero from the night I first saw Travesties in 1979. I was 15. The older kids at school did a production of it and I was spellbound; it was glamorous, sensual and completely incomprehensible. I wanted to know everything about this cool, obscure playwright. I started in the school library with the Encyclopedia Britannica. Then I read Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (incomprehensible) and then I read a third of Jumpers before giving up (totally incomprehensible).As an English Lit student in the mid 1980s, I studied Stoppard and found his work slightly less incomprehensible. But in 1993, I saw the original production of Arcadia and felt that same spell I’d felt as a child. Let’s call it art. And beauty. And words spoken from a stage like no one else. A couple of years later, my first play, Dealer’s Choice, had just opened at the NationalTheatreand Tom was on the board. Someone told me: “Stoppard saw your play and mentioned it in some speech to donors as a good example of new writing at the NT.” A week or so later, I met him at a drinks do. He approached me.Heapproachedme. All hair and suit and cigs and warmth. He gave me a hug and told me I was a proper young playwright.‘He’d say, “Patrick, to be a playwright is to have one’s heart broken every day”’He was the rarest of men. Very few can carry off polite English gent and Jewish mensch simultaneously. Over the next 20 years, he saw all my work and I saw all of his. We corresponded by mail, had lunches, mutually commiserated our failures: “Patrick, to be a playwright is to have one’s heart broken every day.” Said with a grin, always. He made me lunch (pasta) at his big flat in Chelsea and then gave me notes on my new play, Howard Katz: “I don’t think you should kill him off at the end. Condemn him to life. Much better.”And then in 2015 everything changed. Or so it seemed. One night my mobile flashed: “Tom Stoppard.” It must be important. I was at the time “about my toilet” – but a call from Tom had to be answered and I calculated that even a man as clever as him would not divine my whereabouts.View image in fullscreen‘Glamorous and sensual’ … Tom Hollander and Clare Foster in Marber’s 2016 production of Travesties.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian“Patrick, it’s Tom.” “Hello Tom.” “Do you by any chance know my play Travesties?” “Yes I do. It’s marvellous.” “Oh, do you think so? Well, thank you. Now, the thing is that theMenier Chocolate Factorywould like to revive it next year.” “Great!” “Yes, it’s exciting. May I ask you something?” “Of course.” “Do you think Sam West would be a good director for it?”Pause. “He’s terrific, Tom. He did me very proud withhis revivalof Dealer’s Choice.” “Oh good! Thank you!”Before he rang off, I managed to blurt: “If for some reason Sam can’t do it, please will you consider my hat in the ring?”Two weeks later I was offered the job. I said a grateful “Yes” and then re-read the play for the first time in 36 years. It was incomprehensible. But I was doing it.Now we were working colleagues the relationship became more complicated. We had long, smoky meetings. I soon realised that to work closely with Tom, I should resume smoking. He smoked from dawn to bedtime and it seemed to me bad manners not to join in. We compared different drafts of Travesties, about a consular official’s adventures in 1917 Zurich. He was a serial “re-publisher”: he liked tinkering with each revival. Something to do with exerting authorial control over what were now set texts and established modern classics. He wrote some new lines forthis revivaland came to rehearsals almost every day.My wife, Debra, and I were often at the house in Dorset during the Travesties years. Tom and his beloved wife Sabrina were great hosts. Their garden was perfect. The sun shone. We often stayed up late watching TV. One night Jaws was on. Tom insisted we watch it. He declared it one of his favourite films. He knew it shot by shot: “Here comes the floating head.” Every morning, the newspapers arrived. He read them all day. He was possibly the last man in England to do this. He spoke with love of his early days in Bristol as a journalist.‘We’d be working on a scene and out of nowhere he’d shout, “I hate this, I hate it!”’Tom had famously good manners and was extremely generous. It took me years of accepting his hospitality before he let me pay for a meal. And there were many. But there was one place where he didn’t always have good manners – the rehearsal room. I had been warned by others who had directed his work. And so it proved, startlingly at times. We’d be working a scene, stumbling, trying things out and out of nowhere he’d shout: “I hate this, I hate it!” The whole room would fall silent. I’d go over to his table, whisper: “We’re just exploring an idea. It probably won’t make it into the show.” He’d look up, longsuffering: “Please let it not.” And then he’d be completely charming for the rest of the day.Over the following years of working together, we never discussed his outbursts. I think it was the only thing we never discussed. But once he trusted that I cared about the play as much as he did, he became angelic. I loved him for baring his teeth. I loved his passion for the work and his tough love for getting it right. There was a preview of a show in which an actor had struggled a bit with their performance – lines, blocking and so on. At the interval, Tom whispered in my ear: “He’s like a dormouse in a hurricane.” I loved discovering that he wasn’t always nice. His occasional acts of contempt made me feel like a proper collaborator. Inside the tent.View image in fullscreen‘He smoked from dawn to bedtime’ … breaking the rules, in a moment captured by Marber.Photograph: Patrick MarberAnyway. Travesties was a hit and Tom was thrilled and perhaps slightly surprised. I think he thought my production was a bit “out there” but he was delighted it had worked. Some time after we opened, he phoned and asked if I was at home. He said he had a delivery for me. An hour later, he arrived with a big antique corner chair which he carted into our flat. The chair had belonged toPeter Wood, the original director of Travesties; it was the chair Tom had always sat in when Peter was giving him notes. And now it was mine. My children thought of Tom as the chair delivery man thereafter.Travesties transferred to the West End and thenBroadway. In spring of 2018, Tom and I were standing smoking on West 42nd Street. Travesties was in preview and it was intermission. He quietly mentioned that he was jabbing in the dark with a new play. The humility was typical. A new Stoppard play was headline news and had been so since the late 1960s. Yet here was the globally acknowledged magician suggesting that he was “having a go” like some novice.Ever since I’d begun preparing Travesties (back in the summer of 2016) Tom had been desperate to write a new play. He often exclaimed so with considerable frustration. At one point during that period, he said that if he couldn’t write a new one, he might as well be dead. I took it that he meant it in a writerly sense. Tom was a natural born playwright. He didn’t really regard his screenplays, lectures or talks as proper writing. They were just distractions from the real thing.In April 2019, the new play – later titledLeopoldstadt– arrived; old-style, hard copy in the post. A note from his long-term secretary: “Tom asked me to send you this.” I sat down and read the new one. And then I sat in silence for an hour, overwhelmed. Elated for him that he’d written it, and elated that he and his producer Sonia Friedman were asking me to direct it.The first read-through of the new play occurred that summer. Tom, me, Sabrina, Sonia and Debra round a table in Dorset. Tom played the leading role of Hermann. We did the others. It was jovial and merry despite the material. All of us happy that Tom had pulled this late great play out of the bag. (Sidebar: I am using cliches like the above in tribute to him. I once queried his use of a tired old phrase somewhere and he said: “I like cliches! I use them often. With my work it helps for the audience to know where they are now and then.”)So we read the play and it was going quite well, but then in the last scene I broke down in tears as I tried to read one particular line about the decimation of Jewish life in Vienna. The women comforted me with tissues and hugs. Tom not a bit. I thought he’d be pleased that his director was so moved by his play. Not at all. I was stopping the flow. He allowed me a moment to mop up and then plunged back in, taking over my role.And this is the thing: it does Tom a disservice if his generosity of spirit, his kindness, his charm are the only story. In truth, he could be tough as an old boot. Tomáš Sträussler. Czech refugee. A fatherless Jewish boy who came to England aged eight and encountered rife antisemitism in his new home. A man whose stepfather, Major Stoppard, never bothered to see a single one of his plays and then wanted Tom to lose the name “Stoppard” as soon as his beloved mother had passed away. At the time, Tom was a globally revered playwright. He told the major that losing the name “might be somewhat inconvenient”.View image in fullscreen‘He told me he was jabbing in the dark with a new play’… Stoppard and, right, Marber at the Broadway opening of Leopoldstadt.Photograph: Bruce Glikas/WireImageThere was rage and pain and iron in Tom. It’s in the plays, it was in the man too. His famous remark about having lived “a charmed life” has always struck me as double-edged. “Charmed” is a lovely word for it. The implications are of luck and magic, but also something haunting, as if the life lived was not entirely his own. Leo, the character in Leopoldstadt based on Tom, uses the phrase too. But Tom told me that the key line in the play, the motor for him of the whole thing, is said by the tortured Holocaust survivor, Nathan. A line spoken in accusatory scorn to Leo: “No one is born eight years old …” And then: “But you live as if without history, as if you throw no shadow behind you.” This brave, painful play, the last Tom wrote, was him looking at his own dark shadow. It’s all there in an article he wrote for Talk magazine in 1999. He had the play in prototype two decades before he wrote it. He turned facts into poetry.Anyway. Leopoldstadt began rehearsals in December 2019, opened in London the following February thenclosed seven weeks later for lockdown. Tom made some cuts, did a few rewrites and we reopened in August 2021. We finally opened in New York in October 2022.When we’d done Travesties he was still pretty vigorous, but Tom was 85 now and stairs were a menace. He would sometimes take my arm in the street. I no longer let him get a cab without putting him in it. But we had fun. There was smoking and drinking and eating. There was gossip and his incredible stories of times gone by. There were old pals to see and a company of actors young and old who adored him. But he was also having nightmares and talking about his own death. Regularly. As if he saw it on the horizon. We talked about the next play. He had ideas but none that were ready to be written. He won hisfifth, record-breaking Tonyin the summer of 2023 and I found myself thinking maybe he’s made of some other stuff and he’ll simply live for ever. But he got ill in early 2024 and the slow descent commenced.View image in fullscreen‘It travels beautifully through time’… Ramsay Robertson and Faye Castelow in Leopoldstadt.Photograph: Marc BrennerAbout a year ago, I was at the flat in London. He’d stopped smoking – a very worrying sign. Said he just didn’t feel like it. He said he occasionally had the odd puff but couldn’t finish them. He was thin. Very thin. But all there. In his gown and slippers. Something Chekhovian about him. Anyway. Sabrina had gone out leaving us to ourselves. He told me it was fine to smoke, would welcome the old reek of it, so I did. He eyed my packet and asked if he could have one. I hesitated. I really didn’t want to be responsible for killing the greatest living playwright. He insisted. We smoked four fags each, back to back. He was chuckling away. Guilty schoolboy. Then he said he was very tired now and would I help him to bed. I walked him to the bedroom and tucked him in. I gave him a hug. Told him I loved him. He said the same. I saw him many times again after this, but it was the last time I saw him alone.Since Tom died, so many actors we worked with on these two plays have texted and emailed to express their love for him, their admiration, their sense of joy to have worked with him. I feel all this too. It was the greatest honour and luck of my life to spend these years directing and redirecting two staggering plays by Tom Stoppard.Travesties and Leopoldstadt travel beautifully through time; the young become old, people love and kill, the world keeps flipping its coin; war and peace. All this life from plays set in one room in a middle European city in the first half of the 20th century.Well, of course. The playwright was born in former Czechoslovakia in the summer of 1937. A part of him was always there. No one escapes their childhood. Not even a genius can do that. Rest in peace, Tom.Explore more on these topicsTom StoppardTheatrePatrick MarberWest EndMenier Chocolate FactorySonia FriedmanBroadwayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Below, though you hardly dare to look down, lies the Hudson River, the sprawling cityscape of New York and the US itself, rolling out on to the far horizon. If you fell from this rarefied spot, it would take about 11 seconds to hit the ground.Captured by photographer Lewis Hine, The Sky Boy, as the image became known, encapsulated the daring and vigour of the men who built the Empire State Building, then the world’s tallest structure at 102 storeys and 1,250ft (381m) high. Like astronauts, they were going to places no man had gone before, testing the limits of human endurance, giving physical form to ideals of American puissance, “a land which reached for the sky with its feet on the ground”, according to John Jakob Raskob, then one of the country’s richest men, who helped bankroll the building.Like astronauts, they were going to places no man had gone beforeKnown for his empathic studies of workers, artisans and immigrants, Hine was hired to document the development of the Empire State Building during its breakneck 13-month construction period from 1930-31. Along with formal portraits of individual workers, he recorded men animatedly performing their jobs: drilling foundations, wrestling with pipes and cables, laying bricks and navigating precipitous steel beams as the colossal skyscraper took shape above Manhattan.Today, visitors to the Empire State can take selfies with bronze sculptures of old-timey construction fellows, wreathed in a confected soundscape of “ironworkers and masons shouting over the din of machinery, moving steel beams into position, and tossing hot rivets into place”. This genuinely heroic feat of construction has long been commodified into a yet another visitor experience.View image in fullscreenDeath-defying … the 1931 image that became known as The Sky Boy – although Hine called it Icarus, High Up on Empire State.Photograph: Lewis W Hine/George Eastman HouseHistory valorises the ambitious, affluent men who commissioned the Empire State, including Alfred Smith, a former governor of New York and Democratic presidential candidate. It also valorises its architects, Messrs Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, who alighted on a distinctive art deco style, with prefabricated parts designed to be duplicated accurately in quantity and then brought to site and put together in a similar manner to a car assembly line.The men in dungarees raised the steel frame as others – carpenters, glaziers, stonemasons – followedYet the men who assembled those parts – 3,000 workers toiled on site each day – are largely unknown and unsung. Even The Sky Boy – for all his romantic allure “lifted like Lindbergh in ecstatic solitude”, as one commentator rhapsodised – remains unidentified. The man in dungarees was simply part of a gang of structural ironworkers, who raised the building’s steel frame, leading the way upward as other tradesmen – carpenters, glaziers, tilers and stonemasons – followed in their wake.A tight-knit fraternity of Scandinavians, Irish-Americans and Kahnawà:ke Mohawks, the ironworkers were self-proclaimed “roughnecks”, undisputed kings of constructional derring-do. As the New York Times writer CG Poore put it at the time, they spent their days “strolling on the thin edge of nothingness”.View image in fullscreenNonchalant … Victor ‘Frenchy’ Gosselin in an image that was used on stamps.Photograph: Lewis W HineFleshing out the men behind the myth, a new book called Men at Work throws light on the lives and opinions of a small fraction of this forgotten workforce. “My father’s office was in the Empire State Building, so I grew up visiting it,” says the author Glenn Kurtz. Familiar with Hine’s images, his interest was further piqued by a small plaque tucked into a corner of the opulent main lobby, bearing the names of 32 men who had been singled out for “craftsmanship awards” for their work on the building.“Hine’s portraits play such an important role in the mythology surrounding not only the Empire State Building, but also 1930s America in general,” says Kurtz. “I was astonished to learn that no one had ever inquired about the men pictured.”Bringing them into focus was no easy task. Construction workers frequently led itinerant lives, to escape “the coarse grain of official attention”. Employment records from the era were rarely preserved, and the private lives of ordinary people remained largely undocumented. This made it hard to properly record the number of people who died during the building’s creation. Although the official figure is five, Kurtz believes at least eight people perished: seven construction workers (one of which was judged a suicide) and one passerby, Elizabeth Eager, who was hit by a falling plank.Delving into census data, immigration and union records, contemporary newspaper accounts and the personal recollections of their descendants, Kurtz illuminates Hine’s images in new ways, conjuring backstories of men who, as he puts it, “until now, have been used solely as the embodiments of generalities and abstract ideals”.View image in fullscreenPride of New York … the finished item lit in rainbow colours to celebrate Pride Day last year.Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty ImagesTake Victor “Frenchy” Gosselin, whose specialist skill was as a “connector”, catching a suspended beam and moving it into place to be attached to the building’s steel frame. A rare conjunction of personal details and exhilarating photos elevated Gosselin beyond the usual anonymity of the “devil-may-care cowboy of the skies”. Hine shot him nonchalantly straddling a hoisting ball in shorts and work boots, à la Miley Cyrus, an image that featured on a US Postal Service stamp in 2013.Kurtz elaborates on the trajectory of Gosselin’s life and sudden death aged 46 in a car accident, leaving a widow and two young sons. “Distinguishing Victor Gosselin, the man, from the figure in Hine’s iconic photograph does not make him any less heroic,” he argues. “Instead, it allows us to see the photograph more fully, and it roots Gosselin’s genuine heroism in a real life, tragically short and mostly unknown, rather than in a fantasy.”View image in fullscreenHonoured … the plaque in the main lobby, bearing the names of 32 men who received ‘craftsmanship awards’.Photograph: Lewis W HineThere are other no less compelling histories. Vladimir Kozloff, born in Russia, who throughout the 1930s served as secretary for the House Wreckers Union, and was active in winning protections for workers in this highly perilous profession. Or Matthew McKean, a carpenter who emigrated from Scotland, leaving behind his wife and two children. Or terrazzo craftsman Ferruccio Mariutto, who at the time of his stint on the Empire State had been in the US only two years. Like many workers, he died relatively young, just before his 64th birthday, probably of mesothelioma related to asbestos exposure.Kurtz saves his most controversial speculation until last: that the unknown Sky Boy was a man called Dick McCarthy, a second-generation American, grandson of Irish immigrants, living in Brooklyn, who died in 1983. Although Hine never left any clues in his notes, comparison of images of McCarthy and the Sky Boy point up a tantalising physical resemblance.“Considering the worldwide fame of this photo, it’s astonishing we do not know the name of the man,” says Kurtz. “His use as a symbol almost precludes attention to him as an actual person. We may never know the truth, but I’d say I have 50% confidence in my conjecture.”Narratives of architecture tend to disregard the human cost of construction. History is made by the few, not the many. “The lives and experience of actual workers are marginalised,” says Kurtz. “They are too ‘ordinary’ to be interesting. Yet their skill, their training, and the specific conditions of their workplaces, are all profoundly important to architectural history. They are how every building gets built.”Men at Work: The Untold Story of the Empire State Building and the Craftsmen Who Built It by Glenn Kurtz (Seven Stories Press, £25).

They said they’d just written this film whose lead character was a guy called Marty McFly, and whose favourite band would be Huey Lewis and the News. They asked: “How about writing a song for the film?” I said: “I’m flattered but I don’t know how to write for film necessarily. And frankly, I don’t fancy writing a song called Back to the Future.” They said: “No problem. We just want one of your songs.” I said: “Tell you what, we’ll send you the next one we work on.”Chris Hayes, our guitarist and songwriter, had already written a chord progression, which he’d recorded on to a tape, and he gave it to me. I was going through a jogging phase and was out running one day when the song’s lyric just came to me. We sent them the demo but when Zemeckis heard it, he said it wasn’t upbeat enough. So I went back to the guys and we worked on it.Get the film out there – the song is killing it!Johnny Colla, our saxophonist, got involved with the arrangement. On the original demo, the bridge chords happened twice and the song started on a verse in a minor key. Johnny had the idea of minimising it to just one bridge, and also came up with that big positive, three-chord major-key intro. I did my lead vocal in a couple of takes.View image in fullscreenNo 1 beckons … Huey Lewis and Michael J Fox in Back to the Future.Photograph: Album/AlamyWhen we released The Power of Love, it was the most added track on radio in its first week and on heavy rotation. The interesting thing is that the film holds the record for the shortest amount of time between the end of principal photography and the release of the film: nine weeks. As The Power of Love raced up the charts, the studio kept yelling at Zemeckis: “Get the film out there; the song is killing it!” And so the release date was brought forward.People forget that at the time we actually had a higher profile than Michael J Fox and Bob Zemeckis because we had hit records. The advantage to us was that this was our first really big international hit because the movie was so successful everywhere. It enabled us to tour Europe and other places.Chris Hayes, songwriter, guitaristLike all my writing, The Power of Love was done pretty casually. I had a real basic recording setup at my house, and I just sat down on the couch in my pyjamas one night, noodled around on the guitar, and came up with the chord progression. It was based around a really simple guitar riff and something that was as poppy and accessible as I could make it.It was just all about using the right guitar parts and getting something kind of catchy. In the bridge section, it’s kind of gospel-inspired. I threw in a couple of chords that were a little bit different to the usual ones you’d put in a song like that. That was me going back to my music theory classes and jazz/gospel roots. When it came to the guitar solo, it was kind of inspired by Stevie Ray Vaughan.When I wrote it, I had no idea what was going to happen or how popular it was going to be. It ended up being an integral part of the whole Back to the Future franchise, the biggest song in our career, and gave us our first No 1, which was exciting. What’s weird about it, though, is that the song really has nothing to do with the film whatsoever. We were given a synopsis of the screenplay of the movie, and I read through the whole thing and I remember thinking to myself: “This doesn’t sound plausible or like it’s going to be good.” And boy was I wrong!Explore more on these topicsPop and rockHow we madefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a marathon sprint of gonzo calamities and uproar, a sociopath-screwball nightmare like something by Mel Brooks – only in place of gags, there are detonations of bad taste, cinephile allusions, alpha cameos, frantic deal-making, racism and antisemitism, sentimental yearning and erotic adventures. It’s a farcical race against time where no one needs to eat or sleep.Timothée Chalamet plays Marty Mauser, a spindly motormouth with the glasses of an intellectual, the moustache of a movie star and the physique of a tiny cartoon character. He’s loosely inspired by Marty “The Needle” Reisman, a real-life US table tennis champ from the 1950s who was given toBobby Riggs-type shenanigans: betting, hustling and showmanship stunts. The movie probably earns the price of admission simply with one gasp-inducing setpiece involving whippet-thin Chalamet, a dog, a bathtub, cult directorAbel Ferrarain a walk-on role and a scuzzy New York hotel room. Talk about not being on firm ground. Similarly disorientating is the climactic revelation of Chalamet’s naked buttocks prior to one of the most upsetting displays of corporal punishment since Lindsay Anderson’s If….Marty is a young Jewish guy working in a New York shoe shop in 1952, dreaming of world-conquering success in the up-and-coming sport of table tennis and patenting his own brand of ball called the Marty Supreme. He’s having an affair with married childhood sweetheart Rachel (Odessa A’zion) and saving up his earnings to travel to Britain for the table tennis championships at Wembley. (There is a stirring shot of the old stadium’s twin towers, which American audiences may think is a reference to Tolkien.)Getting his promised cash is the first of many bizarre uproars, but once in Blighty, brash Marty deliberately shocks British sports journalists with crass jokes about his pal and fellow player, a Hungarian-Jewish camp survivor called Béla, played by Géza Röhrig (from László Nemes’s Holocaust movieSon of Saul.)View image in fullscreen‘Amusing and sensual’ … Gwyneth Paltrow in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyHaving hustled and blustered his way into a free room at the Ritz, Marty conceives an erotic obsession with a fellow guest, retired movie star Kay Stone – for which roleGwyneth Paltrowhas very stylishly come out of retirement – and Kay’s later Broadway debut is wonderfully realised with a stunned Marty in the audience. Marty’s table tennis face-off with Japan’s ping pong superstar Koto Endo (Koto Kawaguchi) ends in disaster, and Kay’s husband and Marty’s possible sponsor Milton (Kevin O’Leary) shows himself to be bigoted to both Marty and Béla. Back in the US, pure chaos reigns, a nonstop hellzapoppin’ meltdown as Marty frantically tries to claw together the cash for a rematch with his Japanese nemesis, and with the charismatic Kay.The film’s comic and absurdist effect resides in the slowly dawning realisation that it’s not actually about table tennis. Marty Supreme doesn’t behave like a sports movie: there are no training montage sequences, no scenes in which Marty explains his technique in voiceover, no scenes in which he either listens humbly to some ping pong mentor or Oedipally rejects him. And unlike Forrest Gump, who becomes a patriotic celebrity through his table tennis gift, Marty is always a reprehensible character whom no one really trusts – although it is arguably his pioneering 1950s work popularising the sport which made possible Forrest’s ping pong pre-eminence in the 1960s.View image in fullscreen‘A poignant kind of maturity’ … Marty Supreme.Photograph: No creditIt is rather that the film is itself ping pong; the rhythm and spirit of table tennis is in every scene and the mesmeric effect of the spectacular, clattering, dizzying back-and-forth. Marty Supreme is on its own spectrum of determination and emotional woundedness, and Chalamet hilariously enacts an unstoppable live-wire twitch, powered by indignation and self-pity. And Paltrow gives us a clever and wittily conceived counterweight to Marty’s thrumming narcissism; she is amusing and sensual, she sees what Marty is up to and understands him better than he does himself.By the end of this movie my head was oscillating from side to side as if it had been hit with cymbals. The catastrophes, the stunts, the shocks, the jabbering desperation and Marty’s supercharged neediness, with everything important in his life poised to be thrown away, like the box of Marty’s patented table tennis balls that goes out of the window. And yet somehow our pint-sized hero always comes back and even achieves a poignant kind of maturity in the final shot. The pure craziness is a marvel.Marty Supreme is out on 25 December in the US, 26 December in the UK and on 22 January in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmTimothée ChalametGwyneth PaltrowreviewsShareReuse this content"

What I saw was a truly groundbreaking artist, and a life marked by independence, courage and kindness’Pam Hogg, fashion designer with a rock’n’roll spirit, dies at 66 – newsPam Hogg – obituaryIrvine WelshMon 1 Dec 2025 08.32 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 10.23 ESTShareThere are people who live life to the full, then there’s Pamela Hogg. Pam’s tenure on this earth is a trawl through just about every significant cultural and creative moment in the UK over the last 30-odd years. One of our most groundbreaking artists, Pam was a colourist of Warholian proportions, creating art to be hung on the body rather than the walls of a gallery. She was a punk who provocatively mashed up gender and sexual stereotypes. Fashion was the art form that freed her imagination, and her success was due to her talent and drive being greater than her disdain of the conformist industry and the gatekeepers surrounding it.I sat in St Joseph’s hospice in London by her unconscious but serenely beautiful figure – as if she’d made her exit into another work of art – telling her that her jam-packed life was characterised by creativity, independence, courage and kindness. “Hoggy, you left absolutely nothing on the table.”Though I’m twice her size, I’d inevitably be greeted with, ‘Irvine … ma wee darlin’ …’Born in Paisley into a close-knit family, the young Pam was a feisty ingredient added to a soup already brimming with fabric, colour and design. Often seeming on the verge of being swallowed up by Glasgow, Paisley retains its fierce independent spirit; shaped by textiles, political activism, a strong civic culture and aesthetic sensibility. “There was no art in our house, but there was always a sense of adventure, imagination, and an openness to be ourselves,” Pam told me. “My father taught me to be unafraid to be different.”View image in fullscreenHogg DJing in 2006.Photograph: Richard Young/ShutterstockGlasgow School of Art was a revelation. “It seemed crazy that there was an institution where you would go to do what I loved best. It drew me in like a life force.” London then called, but the Royal College of Art was secondary to her development.The Blitz club, with its Steve Strange-policed door policy – dress fabulously and outrageously – proved the real catalyst for Pam’s fashion future. “London club life seized my imagination. That’s when I started designing with a purpose. I may not have chosen fashion … but fashion had chosen me.”She possessed a photogenic beauty and wild charisma that few of her models could matchI first ran into her on a wet 1980s Soho night. My girlfriend (stylish) and I (less so) were fretting about getting into the Wag Club. I was completely unknown to her, but Pam – whose collections were by now stocked at Harrods, Harvey Nichols and stores in Paris, Milan, Rome and Tokyo – clocked my accent and said, “Come in with us …” So, through those doors we accompanied that glamorous London “face” with the weedgie accent.View image in fullscreenHogg with her Spring Summer runway show at London Fashion Week, 2019.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/ShutterstockAs I struggled through ill-suited jobs (all of them), Pam went stellar. The years between 1985 and 1989 saw six collections, culminating in her iconic i-D magazine cover. Opening her own Soho boutique cemented her status as a fashion pioneer, with Debbie Harry, Siouxsie Sioux, Björk and Kylie all becoming ambassadors for those skin-tight designs. In 1990, with Terry Wogan introducing her on his show, Pam had moved from cult to mainstream.Or not.View image in fullscreenHogg with Siouxsie Sioux at the Q awards in 2011.Photograph: Richard Young/ShutterstockThe fashion world was at her feet, but her punk antennae were agitated. A raunchy guitarist and singer who loved rock’n’roll, she stepped away from it all, forming the band Doll and taking them on the road. We became close friends in the 90s – touring together, clubbing and partying in the way those times demanded. Possessing a photogenic beauty and wild charisma that few of her models could match, she also had a hunger to perform. I loved how her sass was complemented with a deep humility and capacity for genuine engagement with people. From a Hackney squat to a Manhattan rooftop, it thankfully seemed no party or club on the planet was safe from Hoggy rocking up.View image in fullscreenHogg at a Primal Scream gig in 2008.Photograph: Richard Young/ShutterstockHer nose for a phoney unparalleled, Pam never wanted an infrastructure of staff, administrators and financiers, and self-funded many shows to retain creative control. Those principles cost, heaping stress on her as she operated her sewing machine in her Hackney workshop, literally until her fingers bled and stiffened with arthritis.Life now seemed to be mainly about bands and DJing, but the art world hadn’t forgotten her. Her work featured in the 2006 exhibition Switch on the Power, alongside that of Yoko Ono, Andy Warhol, Leigh Bowery and Kraftwerk. ThenKylie Minogue’s 2010 appearancein Pam’s metal-studded catsuit shoehorned her back to the top table she’d always sat ambivalently at. I largely missed this comeback, having moved overseas and only intermittently hooked up with her on return visits home. Though I’m twice her size, I’d inevitably be greeted with, “Irvine … ma wee darlin’ …”She sailed through the 2010s on a flotilla of hit shows and awards, using her talents topay tribute to Pussy Riotduring the Russian Olympics, and followed other elite artists like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin in designing Brit Award statuettes. Then her hometown museum commissioned the large-scale printPaisley Poodlefor installation as a permanent exhibit.Just before Covid, I returned to the UK. Immediately after lockdown, the first social event was Terry Hall’s curation of a city of culture gig in Coventry. Pam and I headed to the Midlands along with Pete Doherty and the Fat White Family. It was a fabulous occasion: none of us were great at being locked up.Fashion designer Pam Hogg: ‘Just don’t call me normal’Read moreI attended her last show,Of Gods and Monsters, which was exhibited in London and described by Keyi magazine as, “a profound reflection on humanity, resilience, and the necessity for change … Pam Hogg’s exhibition reminds us that fashion can be both beautiful and deeply political, a tool for activism as much as aesthetic expression.” That year, 2024, she fittingly received the Icon award for services to fashion and philanthropy. “To accept this award is to highlight and aid in the unacceptable struggles of all children here and around the globe,” Pamsaid when accepting it. “This has to end.” Devastated by the mass murder of children in Palestine, Pam posted prolifically about this, when personal survival might have been her main concern, as it was now obvious that she was struggling with her health.View image in fullscreenWireless festival at Hyde Park in London in 2008.Photograph: Joanne Davidson/ShutterstockOn a canal walk in east London, she told me her situation. Though I was stunned, she remained positive. Even when her condition hospitalised her, and she weighed less than the tracksuit she wore, she asked me to bring in some weights in order to build up her muscle tone. Pam’s massive heart was spared the ache of knowing thatour mutual friend Manidied less than 48 hours before her. We’d both attended the funeral of his wife, the wonderful Imelda, just two years ago. Like Mani, Pam had time for absolutely everyone. The Paisley Princess occasionally enjoyed swaggering through the doors her fame opened but never, ever, wanted them slammed in anybody else’s face. Not even a daft young guy from Leith, skulking outside a club with his bird on a drizzly Soho night.Explore more on these topicsCultureClubbingIrvine WelshArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mac Barnett’s 2023 picture book of the same name appeals to inquisitive young readers by offering a festive selection of breaking-and-entering techniques. Does he find the key under the flower pot, post himself through the letterbox, even swim in through the taps? Jon Klassen’s illustrations feature a pack of reindeer, with inscrutable expressions, watching Santa’s increasingly wacky antics.Directing his own adaptation for the Unicorn’s co-production with Told By an Idiot, Paul Hunter follows the book’s rhythm of a child’s racing imagination, with each far-fetched idea mooted, discarded, then swiftly replaced by another. He turns the book into a sort of variety show, with volunteers from the audience occasionally cast as Santa’s little helpers.Designer Sonya Smullen has created a roof with a huge cutaway section that leaves the stage flanked by two snow-covered slides for the performers to slip down. In an exuberant opening number of a show that mixes rap, jazz, easy listening and folksy Danish songs, the entire set is transformed into a sleigh for Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town. Smullen’s costumes are a jumble-sale mix of culottes, trapper hats and cosy dressing gowns, all evoking reindeer.A cast of four (Giulia Innocenti, Nathan Queeley-Dennis, composer Frida Cæcilia Rødbroe and choreographer Mikey Ureta) divvy up the roles and take turns suggesting methods while the others act them out as skits, sometimes using puppetry. As you’d expect from Told By an Idiot, there are plenty of eccentric visual and sonic touches. Sound effects are visibly provided, Foley-style, and a giant snow boot is lowered from above like Monty Python’s giant foot.View image in fullscreenReindeer games … the show’s composer Frida Cæcilia Rødbroe.Photograph: Manuel HarlanBy embracing a madcap, scattershot approach of styles, the adaptation loses some of the picture book’s gentler charm, and there is an inevitable hit-and-miss quality to the routines. They range from tired, including a section mimicking a razzle-dazzle gameshow, to inspired, as Santa straddles the photocopier to create a Flat Stanley-style version of himself. An interlude with a bonneted baby is more creepy than comical and there is a throwback music-hall vibe that sits a little oddly alongside additions such as Santa climbing into a Deliveroo driver’s giant bag.If Barnett’s occasional rhymes and wordplay aren’t extended, then there is plenty of physical tomfoolery to entertain the audience of over-twos, including Santa being bashed down the chimney with tubes of wrapping paper to the tune of jingle bells. The biggest laughs come from the panto perennial “he’s behind you”, deafeningly delivered by today’s young audience.

He looksjustlike Timothée Chalamet.Are you suggesting that EsDeeKid is actually Timothée Chalamet in disguise?I couldn’t possibly comment on such unverified hearsay. Butthe entire internet could. And it is. Relentlessly.Something must be fuelling this conspiracy.Plenty: first and foremost is the fact that EsDeeKid’s identity is top secret, and he has only ever been photographed in disguise. But the parts of him that aren’t disguised – his eyes and the top of his nose – look exactly like Chalamet’s.Interesting.Also, remember that Chalamet loves to rap. Not only has he rapped onSaturday Night Live, but he also rapped in schoolunder the moniker Lil Timmy Tim.That’s hardly anything to go by.How about the fact that Chalamet has been spotted at a London show of noted EsDeeKid collaborator Fakemink? How about the fact that, according to amateur TikTok investigators, they both own the same scarf?View image in fullscreen‘Undeniable’ … Timothée Chalamet (left) and EsDeeKid.Composite: Instagram/esdeekid; Marilla Sicilia/Getty ImagesI’ve changed my mind. This is undeniable. Well now, hang on a minute. GQ recently did someserious investigative journalismon the matter and discovered that, on 9 October, EsDeeKid was playing a show in Milan while Chalamet was attending a screening of his upcoming film,Marty Supreme, in New York.He couldn’t have leapedoffstage, raced to the airport and flown to New York?Unless he crossed the Atlantic on a fighter jet, it’s impossible. Although let’s not forget that Chalamet once arrived at a premiere on a Lime bike, so commandeering an F-22 Raptor just to add fire to an obscure internet conspiracy theory wouldn’t be completely out of character.Or what if Chalamet hired a body double to perform in Milan?Oh, stop. Have you ever considered the possibility that the internet might occasionally be wrong about things?I find that hard to believe.And anyway, EsDeeKid isn’t even the first musical act to find themselves at the centre of a conspiracy like this. Remember Klaatu?Who?They were a Canadian band from the 1970s. After people heard their first album, a rumour started that it had actually been made by the Beatles.I bet that boosted their reputation.Sort of. On one hand, it made them so famous that the Carpenters ended up covering their song Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft. On the other, once word got out that they were just a regular band from Toronto, everyone lost interest.So EsDeeKid definitely isn’t Timothée Chalamet?Probably not. Unless he is, in which case, you heard it here first.Do say:“You never see EsDeeKid and Timothée Chalamet in the same room together.”Don’t say:“I’m EsDeeKid.”Explore more on these topicsTimothée ChalametPass notesRapSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they were objecting to what the film actuallywas.”In the film, Squibb plays a retired Jewish widow who inadvertently joins aHolocaustsurvivors group, and subsequently plays along with the imposture after realising her mistake. Johansson said: “[The film] had to be about what happens when someone gets caught in the worst lie imaginable; if not the Holocaust, then what could it be? They offered no alternative. It was just: ‘This is an issue.’”Johansson said she refused to make the required changes and the backer dropped out, meaning the budget was no longer covered. “It was really shocking, and I was so disappointed.” However, Johansson said distributor Sony Pictures Classics stepped in at the last minute and filming went ahead.View image in fullscreenJune Squibb in Eleanor the GreatIn the same interview Johansson reiterated her support for Woody Allen, for whom she starred in Match Point, Scoop and Vicky Cristina Barcelona between 2005 and 2008, saying: “My mom always encouraged me to be myself, [to see] that it’s important to have integrity, and stand up for what you believe in.” Allen has been ostracised by much of the film industry in the wake of allegations by his daughter Dylan Farrow that the film-maker sexually assaulted her in 1992. Allen has been the subject of investigations in respect of these allegations but has never been charged. The New York Department of Social Services said at the time of its investigation “that there was no credible evidence” to support the allegation. The interview follows her commentsin 2019, when she said:“I love Woody. I believe him, and I would work with him any time.”Eleanor the Great review – June Squibb takes on Holocaust survivor trauma in Scarlett Johansson’s iffy directing debutRead moreJohansson also commented on her decision tosue Disney over breach of contractover the studio released superhero film Black Widow simultaneously in cinemas and on streaming platform Disney+, which was settled with a rumoured payout of $40m (£29.7m). Johansson said she would have welcomed more support for her contest with Disney. She said: “As we moved from the model of theatrical box office bonuses to understanding how that translated to streaming, it had just become this nebulous thing, with no guidelines around it. So to be able to impact that moves everything in the right direction.

A video appeared to show Offset of Migos playing the song during his set at Boiler Room New York, which led many fans to believe it was an unreleased Smith song – footage that itself turned out to be fake.The apparently female vocals on the song were uncredited, and in fact belonged to the band’s Harrison Walker, processed through Suno’s genAI. “It shouldn’t be any secret that I used AI-assisted processing to transform solely my voice for I Run,” Walker told Billboard. “As a songwriter and producer I enjoy using new tools, techniques and staying on the cutting edge of what’s happening.”Sony Music, Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group have previously filed lawsuits against Suno over claims that the company trained its model on the labels’ works. Suno has claimed that it did so under fair use laws.Warner has since agreed a deal with Suno; Sony and Universal remain in litigation.In a statement posted on Instagram, Smith’s label Famm claimed that once I Ran originally went viral, Haven’s team asked Smith to feature on a remix of the song. Famm alleged that “they did so as they needed to legitimise the track as the public had been led to believe that they were listening to Jorja Smith’s vocals.“At no point did they mention to us that AI had been used to manipulate the existing vocals but we already had a suspicion that this was the case. We could have cut a cheque in a backroom deal and gotten paid but we ignored the request.”The Guardian has contacted Haven for comment.I Run has since been re-recorded with new vocals by Kaitlin Aragon, and last week charted at No 37 in the UK. But Famm believes the new top line was still made using AI models trained on Smith’s catalogue.“Haven and his team have now replaced the AI vocal with a real human vocal, although we still believe both versions of the track infringe on Jorja’s rights and unfairly take advantage of the work of all the songwriters with whom she collaborates,” Famm wrote in a statement posted to Instagram.It said that if it was successful in establishing that AI was involved in the track’s creation and won a share of the song, they would “seek to allocate each of Jorja’s cowriters with a pro-rata share. This allocation would be based on the percentage of Jorja’s catalogue that they have contributed to, as, ultimately, if AI helped to write I Run, it would have been trained on Jorja’s catalogue of songs.”Famm alleged that the song initially persisted on streaming and social media platforms as a result of it having four separate distributors who “aggressively” marketed the song, “circumventing usual takedown procedures”.Spotify stated that it detected the impersonation, removed the song and had not paid out any royalties. Billboard also said that it reserved the right to remove titles known to be involved in active legal disputes related to copyright infringements.Famm accused Haven and their label counterparts of relying on “public confusion as a key part of the marketing strategy … They could have made the public aware that Jorja’s vocals did not feature on I Run but instead appeared to revel in the confusion that had been created.“A second layer of public confusion arose once doubt had been cast over whether these were, in fact, Jorja Smith vocals – is this an AI track? Are these AI vocals? Again, rather than clear up the confusion immediately, they allowed the storm to brew.”There is further confusion in that a young female musician who has made music under the name Haven for years has been targeted by commenters accusing her of being AI as a result of sharing a name with the newer AI act. “Story time of how I got caught up in this AI mess,” shewrote in an Instagram video caption– and released her own “Human Haven” cover version of I Run. Whether the 90s Cornish band Haven will weigh in remains to be seen.“This isn’t about Jorja,” Famm said. “It’s bigger than one artist or one song.”Famm called for AI-generated music to be “clearly labelled as such so that the public may choose whether they consume AI material or not. And creators who are happy for their protected works to be used to train AI should be credited and compensated accordingly.”It highlighted the plight of creators as “collateral damage in the race by governments and corporations towards AI dominance … I Run seems to be a clear example of why we all need to step up and push for some guardrails before the moment is completely lost.”In mid-November,three AI-generated songs topped charts around the world. Walk My Walk and Livin’ on Borrowed Time by the outfit Breaking Rust topped Spotify’s US Viral 50 songs. A Dutch song, We Say No, No, No to an Asylum Seekers’ Centre, an anti-migrant anthem by JW “Broken Veteran”, also topped Spotify’s global viral chart. In July, the Velvet Sundown went viral, amassing more than 1m Spotify plays in a matter of weeks,only to be revealed as an entirely AI confection.Explore more on these topicsJorja SmithArtificial intelligence (AI)Pop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

And if it does, then I’ll deal with that moment. But having been a friend of Trump before he was president, I know a different guy.”Brolin met Trump while making the Oliver Stone filmWall Street: Money Never Sleeps, in which Brolin played stock trader Bretton James. Trump spent a day on set filming a cameo,which ultimately did not make the final cut.Saying Trump now has “power unmitigated, it’s unregulated”, Brolin added: “There is no greater genius than him in marketing – he takes the weakness of the general population and fills it.“And that’s why I think a lot of people feel that they have a mascot in him.

After praising motion-capture performance as “a celebration of the actor-director moment”, Cameron expressed his disdain for artificial intelligence. “Go to the other end of the spectrum [from motion capture] and you’ve got generative AI, where they can make up a character. They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It’s like, no. That’s horrifying to me. That’s the opposite. That’s exactly what we’renotdoing.”He added: “I don’t want a computer doing what I pride myself on being able to do with actors. I don’t want to replace actors, I love working with actors.”Cameron, who is a director ofUK-based company Stability AI, said that artificial intelligence’s creative benefits are limited. “What generative AI can’t do is create something new that’s never been seen. The models … are trained on everything that’s ever been done before; it can’t be trained on that which has never been done. So you will innately see, essentially, all of human art and human experience put into a blender, and you’ll get something that is kind of an average of that. So what you can’t have is that individual screenwriter’s unique lived experience and their quirks. You won’t find the idiosyncrasies of a particular actor.”He added: “It also causes us to have to set our bar to a very disciplined level, and to continue to be out-of-the-box imaginative. The act of performance, the act of actually seeing an artist creating in real time, will become sacred.”Explore more on these topicsJames CameronArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingAvatarnewsShareReuse this content"

Later historians described this engraving and, despite having never seen the painting, catalogued its existence.It was bought by a 19th-century French academic painter, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and passed down through his family, according to the auction house. The painting was authenticated by German art historian Nils Büttner, known for his research on the master of the Flemish baroque, Osenat said.Büttner said before the auction that Rubens often painted crucifixions but rarely depicted “the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross”.“So this is the one and only painting showing blood and water coming out of the side wound of Christ, and this is something that Rubens only painted once.”Osenat said its provenance was certified through methods including X-ray imaging and pigment analysis.“It’s the very beginning of baroque painting, depicting a crucified Christ, isolated, luminous and standing out vividly against a dark and threatening sky,” Osenat said.Rubens produced many worksfor the Church but the painting – measuring 105.5 by 72.5cm (42 by 29 inches) – was likely to have been created for a private collector.With the Associated PressExplore more on these topicsArtFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Let the weeping commenceLucy ManganMon 1 Dec 2025 09.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 12.57 ESTShareThere are two ways of looking at The Marvellous Miniature Workshop, in which artists who specialise in making (marvellous) miniatures of things recreate buildings and places that hold great meaning for ordinary people, who have stories to tell presenter Sara Cox about them. One is to consider that it sounds … a bit weird? A bit of a reach? Are miniatures really a thing? Do therapists ever recommend recreating your happy place at 1:24 scale? And does this new BBC commission have the faintest whiff of desperation about it, as the powers that be scour the creative industries for something that is not baking, pottery, sewing, knitting or Kirstie Allsopp festooned with festive ribbons and pine cones?The other is to look at the premise and shout: “Making models of rooms and buildings that look like the originals butteeny-weeny?! Everlastingly charming! Endlessly fascinating! This is all my Christmasses come at once! Count me in! Sign me up! Inject the titchiness into my veins!”To those who look at it the first way – I get it. I do. To those who look at it the second way – especially all those who read Rumer Godden’s The Doll’s House or watched the 1984 stop-motion adaptation by Oliver Postgate and have known no greater happiness since (blotting paper wallpaper. A tie for Mr Plantagenet out of red silk ribbon) – Ifeelya.View image in fullscreenInject the titchiness into my veins! … one of the interiors from the show.Photograph: BBC/UAMG Content, LLC/Tim WrenIt is for all those of us in the second group that the workshop exists but we, the already converted, extend the hand of friendship to everyone. Just give the first episode a try. It’s only half an hour, and Hannah Lemon is going to recreate the reading room of Manchester’s Crumpsall library in the mid-1950s for retired social worker Leah, who met her future husband, Neil, there when they were schoolchildren. She was 14 and knew after 20 minutes of speaking to him that she would marry him. They were together for more than 60 years, until he died in 2022.Crumpsall library lent its last book in 1974. It then became a community centre but has been unoccupied for the last 17 years and is now derelict. Photos of the library in better times are gathered, local historians consulted, Leah’s memories of the colours and furniture she and Neil knew are filleted and Lemon sets to work. The stained-glass window that illuminated the world of knowledge offered to the working-class readers for whom the library was built in 1911 is reborn via fragile polystyrene rods, tinted resins and Lemon’s skill at drawing Lancashire roses the size of seeds. Real wood veneer crisscrossed with a craft knife becomes Edwardian parquet flooring.View image in fullscreenOh you’re not crying yet? … Hannah Lemon with the miniature stained glass window she made for Crumpsall library.Photograph: BBC/UAMG Content, LLC/Clara Bhugra SchmidAnd then, of course, there are the books. Three thousand little blocks of wood, individually wrapped in specially printed bindings and glued on to bookcases or scattered on desks – alongside tiny rumpled newspapers – and piled by tiny chairs upholstered in period-specific fabric. Oh, you’re not crying yet? That’s OK. Here comes Lemon’s final touch: a minute replica of the school cap Neil had stuffed in his back pocket when he and Leah first spoke, left on one of the chairs as if he had just disappeared behind a stack for a moment. Let the weeping commence.If you survive that, I assure you the episode in which Abi Trotman recreates the maths classroom remembered by then-new immigrant from Bangladesh Kareem as a safe haven from the violent racism that pursued him and his family on the streets of 1980s east London, and meets again the teacher – “Mr Carter!” – who turned it into a sanctuary, will get you.Or the one in which Lee Robinson builds a replica of the Silverwood Colliery pit head for Reg, the fourth and last generation of his family to work in the mine – known as “a widow-maker” – but, Reg says, “I’d go back in a heartbeat.” He once helped to bring an injured friend up to the surface as he begged to see the sun again. “He died just as he got out.”Lee laser-cuts winding wheels, builds maintenance ladders and constructs pulley systems that tower over miniature buildings, brickwork sooted by a wash of thinned black oil paint. He adds the pit banner, minutely fringed with gold thread with the motto that kept the miners going through the strike against Thatcher’s closures: “All for each and each for all.” “I’m really back home,” says Reg, gazing at it. “Where I belong.”You can fit a lot of grace into a tiny model, a half-hour programme, a glimpse of a life.The Marvellous Miniature Workshop aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

That film was so successful that a sequel was always bound to happen, and here we are. Troll 2 is the largest production of all time in the Nordic countries, and it shows. Epic troll-on-troll action, a troll named Megatroll and a higher focus on humour – witness the scene where influencers grab selfies with a troll before it attacks them – should ensure that the sequel is even more successful.Stuart HeritageParade (Jacques Tati, 1974),1.20am, Talking Pictures TVView image in fullscreenCurate’s egg … Jacques Tati in Parade.Photograph: AlamyWhile magnificent, Mubi’s recent Jacques Tati showcase had one intriguing omission, and it’s perhaps his most interesting film.

His final film was this curate’s egg, shot on video and made for Swedish television, of all places.

Join the conversation in the commentsGeoff Dyer, Marcia Hutchinson, Andrew Michael Hurley and Guardian readersMon 1 Dec 2025 11.55 ESTShareGeoff Dyer, authorI finally got round toThoreau’s Journal. It is determinedly down-to-earth and soaring, lyrical and belligerent, humane and cantankerous. Walt Whitman thought Thoreau suffered from “a very aggravated case of superciliousness”, but as Walt also said (of himself) the Journal of this brooding, solitary figure is great; it “contains multitudes.”I’ve also been reading Xiaolou Guo’sMy Battle of Hastings. Having moved to Britain and switched to writing in English, the Chinese writer and film-maker makes an impulsive decision to buy a flat by the sea in Hastings. Very funny, as she always is, but also a serious look at Britain and Brexit. It might even be a study of how the historical roots of that decision extend back to 1066.And Meghan Daum’sThe Catastrophe Hour: all credit to UK-based Notting Hill Editions for publishing this latest instalment of pieces by one of American’s finest, wittiest and most scathing essayists.Homework by Geoff Dyer is published by Canongate (£20). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.Sarah, Guardian readerI absolutely devoured Lily King’s new novelHeart the Lover. It’s a classic girl-meets-boy love story but feels totally fresh and the story is told in an engrossing way. It is smart, romantic and literary – three things that are hard to do well at the same time, but King totally succeeds and this is up there with my top reads of the year.My enjoyment of Heart the Lover sent me off in search of more literary campus-set coming of age novels in which romance is central to the plot, so I also read (and loved)My Last Innocent Yearby Daisy Alpert Florin, a story centred on an affair between a final-year student and a married professor at a New England college in the late 90s.My final recommendation from this genre isThe Marriage Plotby Jeffrey Eugenides. I’m still reading this one but it’s excellent: clever, deftly drawn characters and witty dialogue. I’m convinced Eugenides can do no wrong, as his novel Middlesex is one of my all-time favourites as well.Marcia Hutchinson, authorView image in fullscreenMarcia Hutchinson.Photograph: Rik JundiAct Normalis not so much a memoir as the butterfly musings of the genius Peter Kalu. Chronology be damned, Peter writes as if possessed by the ghosts of his past. The reader will encounter an almost Dickensian roll call of characters for whom the word “eccentric” barely scratches the surface.The Best of Everythingis Kit de Waal’s exquisite third novel about found rather than inherited family. I practically queued up to buy this one on publication day as I adored her debut, My Name Is Leon. In The Best of Everything, love comes from an unexpected direction for middle-aged hospital worker Paulette: an unsung hero and the kind of stolid Windrush woman who has been all but forgotten.Jamaica Roadis a wonderful debut novel by Lisa Smith. Daphne, the only Black girl in her class in south London is content enough trying to blend in when new classmate Connie Small arrives “fresh off the boat” from Jamaica. His refusal to bow to the ascendancy of the white kids awakens something in her and eventually upends both their lives. The racism of the 1980s and in particularthe Deptford fireform a poignant backdrop which is only too familiar now.It’s a long time since I finished a book in one sitting, but Kate Griffin’s dark and twisted gothic taleFyneshade, about a governess gone bad, really got to me. A gripping page-turner, ideal for cold winter evenings.The Mercy Step by Marcia Hutchinson is published by Cassava Republic. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may applyJim, Guardian readerI’ve been readingThe Art of Losingby Alice Zeniter. A young woman of Algerian descent tries to piece together the history of her family. As she conjures up the memory of her grandfather Ali and her father Hamid, she traces the outbreak of the Algerian war of independence.It is a story told simply and elegantly and with great humanity, as it unpicks the struggles and the compromises that people have to make in order to survive. At the same time it is unsparing in its critique of colonialism and racism. The writing is hypnotic and I find myself rationing the chapters to prolong the pleasure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Maybe it’s something to do with my own background as a gay man, originally from Northern Ireland, who grew up at the height of the Troubles.Andrew Michael Hurley, author‘She wrote the best first line – and the most chilling stories’: Stephen King on the dark brilliance of Daphne du MaurierRead moreIdeal for winter evenings isAfter Midnight, a new Virago anthology of Daphne du Maurier’s short fiction. Another “after hours” book I’ve enjoyed recently is Bora Chung’sMidnight Timetable:a novel formed of various stories connected with the strange and sinister Institute – a maze-like place in which cursed objects are kept for research. South Korean folklore, urban horror stories and surrealism are fused into something truly nightmarish.An older novel that I often return to is John McGahern’sThe Leavetaking,in whicha Catholic schoolteacher reflects on his life after being sacked for marrying a divorcee.Here, the past is half-remembered, half-imagined – as the past always is – and McGahern’s exquisite sentences capture every nuance of elegy, regret, yearning and hope.And finally,Helm,by Sarah Hall, tells the story of our relationship with the elements and the elementals. Narrated by the titular Pennine wind, the novel moves along humanity’s timeline, documenting all our wonder, creativity, ignorance and folly. It’s a joy to read something so profound and playful. In every line, there is a new insight or a wonderful surprise.Saltwash by Andrew Michael Hurley is published by John Murray. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.comTim, Guardian readerThis month I read three very different books that somehow spoke to each other:Lost Horizonby James Hilton,The Crying of Lot 49by Thomas Pynchon, andFeeding the MachinebyJames Muldoon, Mark Graham, and Callum Cant.Lost Horizon is getting on for a century old yet it feels startlingly fresh – a perfectly paced novel that balances adventure and quiet philosophy. Hilton’s prose is lean but luminous, and his idea of Shangri-La still feels like a metaphor for the human wish to withdraw from chaos without fully escaping it.Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 offered the opposite experience: a dizzying, paranoid web of symbols and coincidences that mirrors our own algorithmic age. It’s absurd, funny, and somehow comforting in its refusal to make sense.And Feeding the Machine grounded both worlds – a sharp, lucid analysis of how digital labour and AI infrastructures shape our daily lives. Reading it after Hilton and Pynchon felt like closing the loop between the dream of utopia, the breakdown of meaning, and the real machinery behind both.Explore more on these topicsBooksWhat we're readingGeoff DyerAndrew Michael HurleyXiaolu GuoDaphne du MaurierJeffrey EugenidesThomas PynchonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bursting out of a cell in full Weapon X gear, massacring half a bunker, then vanishing,in 2016’s otherwise pretty forgettable X-Men: Apocalypse. Telling potential recruitment team Magneto and Professor X to, er, go fuck themselves while propping up a barin 2011’s X-Men: First Class. Even popping up via archived footage from X-Men Origins: Wolverinein 2018’s Deadpool 2. These were cameos we could accept: quick, self-contained sideshows that understood the sacred rule that such things ought to be fun and brief. They also arrived at a time when Jackman didn’t yet carry the weight of 25 years of audience investment.Last week, in an appearanceon the BBC’s Graham Norton Show, Jackman revealed that he has banned himself from saying no to future appearances as the surly mutant. “I am never saying ‘never’ ever again,” he said. “But I did mean it when I said ‘never’, until the day when I changed my mind. But I really did for quite a few years, I meant it.” There are suggestions that he could make a brief appearance in the forthcoming Avengers: Doomsday, in order to capitalise on the success of Marvel’s recent $1bn megahit Deadpool & Wolverine, even though he wasn’t mentioned inan interminable name-on-chair live stream from earlier this year, in which most of the main cast members were revealed.This would, of course, be a terrible idea. Cameo Wolverine has been done to death, and the only reason for him to make an appearance in Marvel’s next major episode would be if he was somehow pivotal to its events. Perhaps he could be responsible for the multiversal fender-bender that leads Doctor Doom out of the retro universe we encountered in Fantastic Four: First Steps, and into the main continuum. Maybe he’s the reluctant hinge, the weary hero whose only narrative purpose now is to slam one universe shut so another can creak open.Others have suggested Jackman’s future role in the Marvel universe could be to act as a sort of nostalgic mascot to the next generation ofX-Men, the more youthful variants the studio is expected to parachute in from other realities (or elsewhere) during the events of the next two Avengers movies. But when the young mutants emerge, will they feel instantly second-tier standing next to the definitive Wolverine? Marvel needs its new mutants to carry the franchise – does having the guy who’s done this for a quarter of a century undermine the point of the reboot before it’s even launched?There’s no doubting that Jackman-as-Wolverine can be box office gold. Fox wouldn’t have allowed him three deeply mercurial solo outings if he wasn’t dynamite in the suit. But there’s only so many times you can wheel out different variants of the same perpetually exhausted claw-gremlin before even diehard fans start feeling as if they’ve been locked in franchise Groundhog Day. And Fox already did its old manLoganriff in 2017.There’s an argument that the more Marvel leans on Jackman for cheap dopamine hits, the less power he has left. Each new appearance devalues the last. But if it does have to happen, make it a solo outing in which Jackman is front and centre. Deliver a storyline that doesn’t end with him sacrificing himself for the greater good, or somebody else’s character build, but still allows him to wander off into the half-feral hinterland where all good Wolverines eventually retire.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperhero moviesHugh JackmanX-MenLogancommentShareReuse this content"

Star Razaaq Adoti can’t blame his agent, as it was the actor himself who scripted this Nigeria-set revenge thriller, in which his former special forces soldier makes a Jack Carter-like return to wreak havoc on the mean streets of Lagos.Zion (Adoti) has made the US his home after being dishonourably discharged and doing a stretch in the slammer. But he makes a beeline for Lagos when he receives an SOS message from his sister Ronke (Sharon Rotimi), a hotel chambermaid who stumbles on respectable medical professional cum evil drug kingpin Dr Baptiste (Philip Asaya) as he murders a sex worker. Zion is too late: Ronke is a goner, framed as another victim of the fentanyl cocktail Matrix that’s doing the rounds, courtesy of the bad doctor. Time for Zion to dust off his particular set of skills.These turn out in large part to be him walking obliviously into ill-advised locales and getting an absolute beating. But despite Zion’s boneheaded brand of heroism, a lot of plot-facilitating character choices and outbreaks of ripe Nollywood acting, British-Chinese director Chee Keong Cheung delivers a pretty satisfying and fleet-footed ride here. All the more so for going fairly skimpy on the characterisation in the manner of 80s action flicks: Zion gets a cute street urchin sidekick (Ijelu Folajimi), just so we know he’s on the side of the angels.Even Zion’s inexplicably haphazard street smarts line up somehow with the shambolic, brutal world he infiltrates: an impressive selection of immolations, bludgeonings and machete-gougings is meted out once he teams up with albino ganglord Jagunlabi (Damilola Ogunsi). Cheung’s direction matches it with gusto, recalling City of God in a colourful handheld blitz – though his fondness forthe Dutch anglegets a bit annoying. He uses it so often they’ll have to rename it the Nigerian angle, but his film has got an undeniable gangsta lean.Son of the Soil is in UK cinemas from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersAction and adventure filmsNigeriaAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Minimal in its camera movements, the film looks at glimmering golden temples, waterfalls cascading down silver rocks, and processions of monks moving through lush landscapes. It also shows what is absent from glossy brochures, namely the intrusion of tourists. The disruption to the local rhythm of life is at once visual and aural: we see throngs of wandering visitors, their casual clothes of shorts and T-shirts a stark contrast to the ancient architecture. Their occasionally rowdy leisure activities are intercut with more mundane moments from the locals’ everyday lives, like schoolchildren heading to class or laywomen offering alms to monks by the roadside.There’s a sense of tension between the static camera and the movements that occur within the frame. Scenes of tourists being loaded on to buses bring to mind Jacques Tati’s 1967 classic Playtime, which gently pokes fun at the idea of an authentic cultural experience attained via consumerist means. The point of view in Takesue’s film, however, is on shakier grounds. Some of the visual juxtapositions veer towards reiterating well-worn binaries between the east and west, the regional and the global. For instance, most of the tourists seen in Onlookers are white; in truth, visitors to Laos largely come from neighbouring Asian countries. Likewise, the Laotian population is also far from homogeneous: one sequence shows middle-aged men playing a game of catch, with the caption telling us they are “arguing in Lao” – yet some of them are speaking Vietnamese.Onlookers does provoke some interesting questions about the relationship between tourism and cinema, even if it has little new or profound insight into either topic.Onlookers is on True Story from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLaosAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the interim it slowly dawned on me that not all jobs were like that. He was one of the most intelligent people you could ever meet but the extraordinary thing was that you’d walk away from conversations with him feeling like you were not unintelligent or unwitty yourself. That’s not always the case with incredibly brilliant writers and funny people. That generosity of spirit marked my time with him. He was incredibly good company, very sweet, and you felt encouraged to put forward your own ideas, make your own jokes.That feeling, that he had loaned his magnificent intellect to you, was the same in his work. You’d see a play imparting all these competing ideas and you would leave abuzz and pretty confident you could explain it to your friends but you had to make sure that you’d worked out exactly how to do so before you reached Hammersmith because that was when it would start to evaporate. You would feel the benefit of his genius probably about as far as Barons Court.View image in fullscreen‘If something felt even remotely page-bound he was bothered by it’ … Brian Cox and Rufus Sewell in Rock’n’Roll at the Royal Court, London, in 2006.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianI was doing another play when I had the rather frightening audition for Arcadia coming up. The night before my audition there was a knock at my dressing room. I didn’t have my clothes on and said who is it? A very particular voice answered: “It’sTom Stoppard.” I grabbed a towel to put over myself and opened the door. He said it was the second time he’d seen the play, that it was a good production and that he knew I was coming in tomorrow and he wanted me to know “I’m on your side”. The process was still long and arduous – it wasn’t like I was immediately given the part – but it gave me confidence that, in the corner, there was this figure and I had his approval.When we were doing Arcadia he’d be there festooned with scarves and cigarette smoke and in my peripheral vision I’d try to detect any shift signifying approval or disapproval – a leg being crossed or uncrossed, a scarf being rearranged, a puff of smoke. In his writing there was a blokiness that really counteracted the kind of heavy intellectual quality. He knew the difference in language between a “dick” and a “prick”. I was aware in rehearsals of him changing a line because he felt it was too writerly, that it needed something to take the edge off. So, despite this brilliance he was famous for, if something felt even remotely page-bound he was bothered by it.Christine Baranski: ‘How do I measure up to that level of dazzling wit?’View image in fullscreen‘On a higher plane’ … Christine Baranski and Tom Stoppard at the 2020 PEN America literary awards in New York.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty ImagesYou shouldn’t wait until someone’s memorial to tell them how much they meant to you. So I’m happy to say that a few years ago I had Tom and some of the cast from The Real Thing, which we did in New York in 1984, over to my apartment. We toasted him and told him it remained the most special theatre experience of our careers.We were all a bit concerned about Tom’s smoking but I knew he’d want to smoke. I had an ashtray I’d kept from the Brasserie Lipp in Paris years earlier when I was there with my 16-year-old daughter and, at the table right next to us had been Tom and Mick Jagger. I gave it to Tom, opened the bay window for him, and he had a couple of American Spirits. The ashtray with its two butts is still on my bookshelf.The Real Thing was an enormousBroadwayhit – we won Tonys – but I’d go home at night thinking: I’m not smart enough to be in this play. I’m going to have to fake it. For one thing I was an American actor being terribly English but the challenge, like with Stephen Sondheim, was how do I measure up to that level of dazzling wit? The whole experience was elevated. We were swimming in the mind pool of Tom Stoppard – a very privileged place to be. As you do with Shakespeare, you feel like you’re on a higher plane.With his restless imagination, Tom Stoppard showed us a mind on the moveRead moreAnyone will talk rapturously of him. I remember him coming to rehearsals in these soft, buttery suede jackets, with that tousled hair and those voluptuous lips. We all had a crush on Tom. He was very stylish, the closest we’ll ever come to knowing a Wildean character. Later, when I was filming Mamma Mia! for many weeks in England, we were trying to meet but were both very busy. On my last day in London he took me to tea and said: “I’m rather ashamed of myself. You’ve been a guest in my country all this time and I’ve not taken care of you.” Such a gentlemanly thing to say.He could be extraordinarily astute. What struck me most was that he could have directed his rapier wit to cruel effect, but I never saw any kind of mean-spiritedness in him. He enjoyed being Tom Stoppard – and was sort of an invention. It was as Tomáš Sträussler that he had come to England and he loved his English upbringing.One of the first plays I ever did was The Real Inspector Hound in Baltimore. That was such fun. I particularly loved doing Stoppard because of his great ability with language. You could just send a sentence over with a certain degree of top spin and it would delight an audience.Susan Wokoma: ‘He was always a WhatsApp message away’View image in fullscreen‘Everything I imagined him to be’ … Susan Wokoma next to Tom Stoppard with the cast and crew of The Real Thing at the Old Vic last autumnYou cannot be cast in a major Tom Stoppard production without Tom Stoppard’s approval so the fact I got to be in The Real Thing in Tom’s lifetime is something I will cherish for ever. We were told he was seriously ill as we started rehearsals – nevertheless he was always a WhatsApp message away with answers to our many questions that arose from such a tremendous and terrifyingly adored text. We could hear and feel Tom’s yearning – this was the first time such a production was being mounted without him in the rehearsal room. As a company we wanted nothing more than to make Tom proud.Then, the Saturday before press night, our company stage manager, Rebecca, tells us that, despite being warned against travelling, Tom has come to see the show. I’ve known the fearless James McArdle – our resplendent Henry – since we were 18 and 19 years old and I’ve never seen him so terrified.We were instructed to return to the auditorium to meet Tom once the audience had left. There we had an intimate “audience with …” that I will remember for the rest of my life. And most importantly he loved the production, the first major revival for which he had been completely outside the rehearsal process. Generous, thoughtful, funny and kind – he was everything I imagined him to be.“This is the last time I’ll see this play,” he said. The enormity of the words hung in the air. “But I’ll outlive all of you.” How right he was.Toby Jones: ‘The plays are full of cracking gags’View image in fullscreen‘An openness to experiment’ … Toby Jones in Every Good Boy Deserves Favour at the National Theatre in 2009.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianEveryone talks about Tom’s genius but inEvery Good Boy Deserves Favouryou also had this other side to him as it is such a brilliant conceptual piece of stagecraft. The idea of having an orchestra live on stage and making the audience complicit with the actuality of the orchestra and thereby with a person who is supposed to be hallucinating. You might not associate that visual stagecraft with him although there are the acrobats in Jumpers and the River Styx in The Invention of Love. His openness to the experiment of the National production, which brought dancers among the orchestra in a deviation from the original play, was really striking.My father shared a house with Tom when he was writing scripts for Mrs Dale’s Diary and he had strong memories of the cigarette smoke as Tom pounded out episodes. He was a big figure in my life from those stories and then at school I remember studying Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead for A-level. Like Pinter, he was one of the giants of theatre that our generation grew up with. So when I finally met him it was a thrill to find him so personable.When Tom and I went on a coach trip together to the Calais Jungle it gave me a prolonged time to hear him talking about the precariousness of these refugees and his personal connection with that situation. We crisscrossed a bit after Every Good Boy and he always had this wonderful warmth – the opposite of someone being too brainy to chat with you. The plays are full of cracking gags and there’s an appreciation of the different registers of drama, that on the one hand it’s a collision of ideas but also the theatre is a place of the gut and of guffawing.Harriet Walter: ‘No one gives the skivvy a book token but Tom did’View image in fullscreenCausing chaos … Harriet Walter in Arcadia at the National Theatre in 1993.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyEveryone on this page has been unbelievably lucky. We all knew Tom Stoppard. We lived at the same time as him and basked in his brilliance up close. When I was 18 and not yet even a drama student I was a skivvy in charge of the props for the world premiere of Tom’s After Magritte. He was a very romantic, fleeting visitor to the rehearsal room. I treasured a £5 book token he gave me for the opening performance. No one gives the skivvy a book token! Tom did.Cut to much later and I am playing Lady Croom, the flighty over-sexed mother of Thomasina in the first production of Arcadia. We all learned a bit about chaos theory among many other subjects that Tom had brilliantly tied together in the play. Luckily, Lady Croom didn’t have to understand chaos theory, only to cause chaos with her rampant sexual appetite, that rogue ingredient that can’t be controlled, explained or predicted. I had lines that were so funny I often couldn’t get to the end of them before the audience drowned me out with laughter. What ecstasy. What a gift from Tom.Every other line in Arcadia dazzles, but Tom didn’t intend to show off. He was genuinely delighted by asking questions and sharing everything he discovered. And he managed to infiltrate some of the most profound messages about life, art and the physical universe into the comic weave. In Arcadia he puts an end to the art v science division. He brings them together, illustrating the imaginative beauty of science and the calculated order within art.Thomasina Coverly, the 13-year-old genius in the 19th-century part of the play, can grasp mathematical concepts that fly over most of our heads. She can spot the physical principle at work in the stirring of jam into her rice pudding. Hers is the first line in the play and it is a question. She is endlessly curious and deep-thinking while still being childish and playful.She is cerebral but also passionate – she is moved to tears by the destruction of the great library of Alexandria, and when the play moves forward three years she matures into a romantic young woman in love with her tutor, and although she dies in a fire on her 16th birthday, her calculations live on for future generations to interpret with wonder. I believe all this to be true of her near namesake Tomáš Stoppard.Explore more on these topicsTom StoppardTheatreBroadwayHarriet WalterToby JonesRufus SewellfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But this is in fact exactly how we have seen him before: initially alone in Paddington station with marmalade sandwiches under his felt hat and a pleading look in his eye for strangers to be kind to outsiders such as him.This is not new fare, even ifPaddingtonis brought to life with state-of-the-art animatronics: James Hameed is his voice and remote puppeteer, while Arti Shah is under his furry skin on stage (puppet design by Tahra Zafar). The Brown family are recognisable from the star-studded film: risk-averse dad (Adrian Der Gregorian), arty mum (Amy Ellen Richardson), adolescent Judy (Delilah Bennett-Cardy) and encyclopaedia-chomping wee Jonathan (Jasper Rowse on the night of attendance), along with houseguest Mrs Bird (Bonnie Langford, in national treasure mode).So why do we needthisPaddington in our lives?Well, because it simply comes together so well. Splendiferously well, in fact. This is the new Mary Poppins: a well-known story imaginatively staged, immaculately performed and utterly winning.View image in fullscreenPaddington gives a hard stare.Photograph: Johan PerssonTom Fletcher’s songs are marvellous, Jessica Swale’s book earnest, Ellen Kane’s choreography vigorous. Directed by Luke Sheppard, it is really very beautiful in its set design (by Tom Pye), beginning in Mr Gruber’s shop of curiosities and featuring sweeping immersive effects (with next-level projections designed by Ash J Woodward). There are confetti, “lost bear” leaflet drops, and surprise water jets fired at the audience.The family experience their tensions, though not enough to dampen our spirits, while puppet Paddington is adorable: pensive and childlike by turns. Hameed’s singing voice is astounding, and when he wanders on for some solo numbers as a human shadow, it is strangely moving. There is fabulous ensemble song and dance, polished to a gleam, with nods to musical theatre across the board, from vaudevillian slapstick to chorus numbers (Hard Stare is great fun) and big show tunes (Marmalade is an absolute blast).But it is Victoria Hamilton-Barritt who steals the show as Paddington’s nemesis, the taxidermist Millicent Clyde. Her song Pretty Little Dead Things is the best of the lot. Add to that Hamilton-Barritt’s extraordinary vocals, her sultry, comic performance, and a shoulder-padded foxtail look reminiscent of wartime Marlene Dietrich, and you have a magnetic villain with serious daddy issues.View image in fullscreenThe kindness of strangers … the Brown family in Paddington: The Musical.Photograph: Johan PerssonSure it is full of schmaltz and cliched Englishness – Beefeaters, church bells, men with umbrellas, and dustbin men who look like Dick Van Dyke’s chimney sweep. But it is self-consciously done and knowingly verges on parody – Geographers’ Guild members march on to speak of empire and the Elgin marbles, as one example.The plot follows that of the film without being parasitic, with some added strands and characters, such as Judy’s boyfriend Tony (Timi Akinyosade) and his British Caribbean mother (Brenda Edwards), who bring a too-smiley multiculturalism but also some great calypso undertones to songs such as The Rhythm of London.0:51Paddington the Musical bear revealed – videoSome characters do seem derivative, such as Mr Curry (Tom Edden), the lanyard-wearing taxi driver who here channels Alan Carr with a jingoistic twist. Messages about the importance of kindness and acceptance are laid on with a trowel. Paddington, it is clear, is the foreign outsider being othered. Ideas around offering refuge work better in the subtle reference to Mr Gruber’sKindertransport journey. It chimes importantly in today’s landscape of anti-immigrant fear and loathing.It is evident that the production is not driven by cynicism to cash in on a very British brand – although it will likely bring in tourists in their hordes. The final few scenes feel extraneous and it is slightly over-long, but you would have to be a cynic yourself to find fault in this gorgeous world of bearish adventure.At theSavoy theatre, London, booking to 25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreWest EndPaddingtonChildren and teenagersreviewsShareReuse this content"

With nature at its heart, the programme journeyed from the frozen wastes of Finland to the sun-kissed woodlands of Bohemia and beyond.En Saga, a last-minute substitute for Falla’s Love the Magician, was Sibelius’s first tone poem, poorly received in 1893 but successfully revised nine years later. The composer refused to furnish any specific literary explanations, yet the colourful score is redolent with imagery, from patriotic pageantry to dusky forests and midnight sleigh rides. It proved meat and drink to fellow Finn Santtu-Matias Rouvali. Plunging into its shadowy dramas, the conductor sustained the musical momentum effortlessly across its substantial arc while striking some fantastical podium attitudes of his own to tease out its more theatrical effects.According to the composer, Say’s Mother Earth was conceived as “a dramatic wakeup call in the fight to avoid a climate crisis”. Framed by a prelude and a postlude, and including a midpoint interlude, its four remaining movements are labelled Earth, Forest, Sea and River. Where Sibelius evokes, Say prefers to depict. Thunderous percussion portrays earthquakes and landslips; handheld devices imitate birdcalls; and peas rolled on a drum suggest wind and waves. At its best, as in the seismic stomp of Earth, or in Forest, with its tropical, Latin-infused rhythms, the music was exhilarating, if a trifle obvious.View image in fullscreenComposer and pianist Fazil Say reaches in to manipulate the strings directly.Photograph: Marc Gascoigne/Philharmonia OrchestraThe piano part, played by Say himself, roamed from easygoing and slightly bluesy to angsty and fraught, the last calling for some virtuoso playing. Especially intriguing were haunting, zither-like passages that required the soloist to play with only his left hand while stretching his right hand inside the piano to manipulate the strings.If Say’s work sounds a warning, Dvořák’s melodious Eighth Symphony is almost entirely upbeat. The Philharmonia gave it a big-boned but elastically phrased workout, with meaty string tone – especially the cellos – and secure, full-bodied horns. Balancing Brahmsian classicism with piquant folk idioms, Rouvali’s sure-footed interpretation was amiable and urgent; often jaunty, but always elegant.Explore more on these topicsThe Philharmonia OrchestraClassical musicSouthbank CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Seriously? Sprüth Mager’snew group show of that titlemakes its case over four floors jammed with still and moving images of clowns, costumes, Star Wars figurines, dogs watching porn, a colourless cheeseburger, and artists running over a carton of milk.I’m absorbed by one of the most recent works in the show,Martine Syms’ She Mad: The Non-Hero, a conceptual TikTok tale inspired by Lil Nas X’s Life Story series from 2021. Borrowing the rapper’s structure and tropes, Syms performs convincingly as a rising star of the arts scene who shares her struggles with health, depression and loneliness. It’s a punchy satire of social media mores that debunks ideas about success.I’m jolted out of this thought by a shrieking noise. ButI haven’t stepped on a joke shop trigger, it’s Louise Lawler’s seven-minute 1972-81 audio work Birdcalls, in which she calls out art world sexism by screaming the names of 28 famous white male artists in the style of different bird calls. The idea is to present nature as artifice, the same way art history is merely a constructed form of power. It is also so silly you can’t help but smile.View image in fullscreenSpicy feminist humour … Seriously at Sprüth Magers, London.Photograph: Ben Westoby/Fine Art DocumentationLawler is part of a contingent of artists here associated with feminism and conceptualism in the 70s and 90s, a kind of confrontational, spicy humour that takes aim at feminine stereotypes in mass media and advertising. An androgynousSarah Lucaschomps down brazenly on a banana. A suite ofCindy Sherman’s works sharply satirise feminine stereotypes found in cinema and the media. A 2018 colour work shows four coiffed, heavily madeup characters wearing colourful tulle gowns, looking at the camera with something between a smile and a grimace. They seem to be sitting in the sea, a dissonance that makes the bizarre image even more awkward. In another picture Birgit Jürgenssen wears a ludicrous 3D “housewives’ apron” in the shape of an oven. Their visual puns are a revolt against stifling gender norms and they’re effective.View image in fullscreenNot too serious … Bruce Nauman, Studies for Holograms (a-e), 1970.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Sperone Westwater, New YorkIt’s great when artists don’t take themselves too seriously. The feminists were willing to make themselves look ridiculous to make the point that social codes and repressed sexual desires are farcical. Other artists adopt the strategy, too, depicting the body as a silly, plastic form that can be absurd and obscene.Bruce Naumanpulls and stretches his mouth into goofy, weird shapes. In L’Empereur series, German photographer Thomas Ruff throws himself around a room, dressed in brown and yellow to match the dour colour scheme. As he slumps and dives between the armchairs and the standing lamp, it’s a moment of slapstick for an artist not normally known for his cheer.A range of artists find humour in objects and assemblages, such as Thomas Demand with his witty photo of a slipper stuck under a door. One wall is packed with banal and bland pictures of a vacuum cleaner, a slice of bread or a bucket – humour is subjective, sure, but they’re about as fun as a root canal.The show starts to grate when it starts parodying other art – Ruff re-does Fischli/Weiss, Jonathan Monk nods to Lawler, John Waters sends up Gursky. But jokes don’t really work unless you get the art history references. Aneta Grzeszykowska’s recognisable parodies of Sherman – displayed in a room with Sherman – are easier to laugh at, caricatures of caricature, satire twisted into satire.Conceptual art is often ridiculous, so it doesn’t take much to turn its bombast and pompousness into a joke.William Wegman’s Experiment has the best punchline of the show: the first of two images is captioned “As an experiment he stood on his head”. The second says: “Everything looked upside down.” One of the famous works in the show is the late British artistKeith Arnatt’s influential 1969 performance photo Self-Burial, a sequence of nine images in which the artist slowly subsides into a hole he’s dug and eventually vanishes into the ground. The photos were broadcast on German TV in 1969 for a few seconds every evening without explanation, which must have been disturbing. If many viewers may have liked the idea of an artist disappearing, the last laugh is on us, since the ground is ultimately where we’re all heading.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In The Girl Chewing Gum, a voice shouts directions to the action taking place on a street in London, but the director is in fact a narrator, describing the movements of unwitting passersby with increasingly fantastical relish. It’s hilarious, but also eerily prescient in its anticipation of fake news and false narratives.This exhibition’s problem is that humour is subjective, cultural and temporal –and a lot of the gags here don’t raise a laugh today. There are a few inclusions I couldn’t figure out at all: howCarrie Mae Weems’s picture of a set of minstrel salt and pepper shakers fits in was beyond me.Paradoxically, Seriously is less about laughter and more about humour as a tool for challenging politics and values. With playfulness and wit, conceptual artists pushed photography past the documentary into a less stable, more experimental place. But can conceptual art make you belly laugh? Probably not.AtSprüth Magers, London, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArtPhotographyCindy ShermanSarah LucasBruce NaumanreviewsShareReuse this content"

The tussocks under my boots cover the Maiden Way, perhaps the highest Roman road in Britain, but the sense of being close to the sky – today a simmering grey – remains as palpable as it would have been 2,000 years ago. Looking north, a rainbow arcs across the horizon, the full reach of it clearly visible from this high ground. Buffeted by the squall with every step, it feels as though I’m striding across the top of the world, which is apt, since I’m following the newRoof of England Walk.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This 188-mile, multi-day trail was developed by the North Pennines national landscape team, and launched in September. Taking in lofty footpaths and some of the best-loved elements of the North Pennines – among them High Force, Cross Fell, High Cup Nick, the Nine Standards andEngland’s highest pub, the Tan Hill Inn– the aim is to showcase this sometimes overlooked corner of the country.View image in fullscreen“It’s a blank on the map for a lot of people, a huge area between Hadrian’s Wall and the Yorkshire Dales that they don’t really know,” says Shane Harris, the project’s lead, when I meet him after my walk for a bowl of cauliflower soup at Stanhope’sRoot and Branch community cafe. “The North Pennines is a historic, vibrant landscape and a Unesco Global Geopark. This walk is about introducing more people to it.”Starting and ending in Appleby-in-Westmorland, the walk loops through the moors, meadows and riverbanks of County Durham, Cumbria and Northumberland – the three counties of the North Pennines national landscape – plus a corner of the Yorkshire Dales national park. Its 14 legs have been designed to work as day walks or as a longer trail, and to link up with public transport. And most run between a town or village, so there’s somewhere to stay at the end of a day’s fairly remote walking.View image in fullscreenWalkers cross high moorland in the North Pennines.Photograph: Carl JoyceI’m hiking a 50-mile section in just over three days, from Alston, in Cumbria, to Edmundbyers, in County Durham, via Haltwhistle, Allendale and Blanchland, all in Northumberland. Alston, touted as England’s highest market town, is also one of its prettiest, bustling with independent shops, cafes and (as of this month) a pint-size wine bar,Walter’s. It’s also home to the recently spruced-upAlston Hostel(dorm beds from £30, private rooms from £40pp), where I’m staying. Taken over two years ago by Mat Austin and his partner Claire, they aim to provide a homely experience, hence home-cooked meals and a welcome from Poppy the puppy.Allen Banks woodland is spectacular in autumn, its deep river gorge shimmering with bronze, copper and goldThe Pennine Way passes right behind the building – one of several long-distance paths the Roof of England Walk merges with along its course – and it’s this I follow the next morning. I leave the shelter of Alston’s coppery, tousle-headed trees and head up onto Langley Common. A bank of rain blows in, muting the landscape to monochrome, and I scurry on to Gilderdale Burn, crossing from Cumbria into Northumberland.A little further on the embankments ofEpiacum, a former Roman fort, loom out of the drizzle. I detour hurriedly to nearbyNook Farm Shopfor a hot coffee. The rain ebbs as I leave and soon I’m into my stride, following drystone walls and burns down to Slaggyford via a long, broad sweep of whisky-coloured river.View image in fullscreenAlston in Cumbria is said to be Britain’s highest market town.Photograph: Carl JoyceThe Kirkstyle Inngastropub is nearby, but my route leads in the other direction, over hay meadows and moorland down to the banks of the South Tyne, whereFeatherstone Castle’s gothic bulk sits draped in mist. Following the river into Haltwhistle, I’m so soaked when I arrive that I look like I’ve been swimming in it.“Ooh, bedraggled!” declares the owner of theOld School House B&B(twins from £120 B&B), whisking my waterproofs to the drying room and my sodden boots to the boot dryer. “As well as this new walk, we’re on thePennine Way,Hadrian’s Wall Pathand Land’s End to John o’Groats, so we’re used to walkers,” Kate says.I open my flask of tea and watch rabbits bounding through the dew. I realise I’m completely alone, and relish itThe following morning, at a breakfast table laid with bone china and his own-recipe granola, her husband Ian serves me a winning shakshuka. Outside it’s bright and most of the morning’s route is on country lanes. Beyond Haltwhistle, I pass elegant stone farmhouses, cottage gardens brimming with flowers and glimpses of rickety Unthank Hall. On a ridge beyond it, I open my flask of tea and watch rabbits bounding through the dew. I realise I’m completely alone, and relish it.Past Willimoteswick Castle, I arrive at pretty Beltingham. Following one of the walk’s purple lapwing signposts, I dip down intoAllen Banks. Cared for by the National Trust since 1942, this woodland is spectacular in autumn, its river gorge shimmering with bronze, copper and gold.View image in fullscreenThe River Allen.Photograph: Clearview/AlamyClimbing out of the woods, I’m met with a huge upland meadow, its peachy grasses rippling in the wind. It’s another few miles to Allendale. This former lead mining settlement switched to tourism in Edwardian times, after the last mines closed. I’m staying atthe Lion House, a pub in the market square with two newly renovated guest rooms (en suites from £120 room-only). Each New Year, local guisers parade through the square carrying flaming tar barrels on their heads, but it’s quiet this evening. Landlord Dave welcomes me in, and his partner Maureen brings me a bowl of warming vegetable soup.With smoke curling from chimneys and doors painted a regulation plum, Blanchland feels like a mirageThe following morning I open the shutters on to a sweeping view of the square … and more dark clouds. A storm is forecast and I need to be quick if I’m going to beat it. Scrambling on to moorland above the town, I startle grouse after grouse, their bark-quacks echoing in my ears as I drop down into the hamlet of Whitley Mill and on into Slaley Forest. It’s a long climb here, past thick tracts of Scots pine and blue spruce that are home to red squirrels. At the top the trail spits me out into the wind-scrubbed heather of Blanchland Moor. The view reaches all the way to Derwent reservoir but the sky is glowering, heavy and low, so I press on.The clouds don’t burst and I’m still dry as I walk into Blanchland, a huddle of dainty stone buildings in the crook of a small valley. The village was created in the 18th century from the remains of a medieval abbey, and with smoke curling from chimneys and doors painted a regulation plum, it feels like a mirage. What was once the guesthouse for the abbey is now a hotel, theLord Crewe Arms(doubles from £205 B&B), and as I click the latch on its ancient door, there’s a sense of entering another world.View image in fullscreenThe Lord Crewe Arms occupies a former abbey guesthouseIn my room, there’s homemade shortbread in a jar and fresh milk by the kettle; downstairs is a vast open fire. After dinner in the restaurant – meltingly soft roast venison with homegrown kale – I peek out at the storm-cleared skies and am rewarded with a swathe of bright stars: there are no street lights in Blanchland, and it has some of the darkest skies in the country.From here, it’s just over five miles to Edmundbyers. There’s a savage wind as I follow the trail up Buckshott Fell, but the sunrise has flushed the colour back into the land. From a ridge on the moor I look out over 360 degrees of purple, gorse and slate, and realise I’ve been approaching the North Pennines all wrong. There may be history and wild beauty along its path, but this is a walk for looking up, rather than down – to the ever-changing skyscape of rainbows, storm clouds, sunrises and stars on the roof of England.The walk was organised byNorth Penninesnationallandscape.

You see, my family is mostly made up of pescatarians, so anything larger than a chicken or cockerel (my personal favourite) for the meat eaters is just excessive. So, alongside a lovingly cooked smaller bird, I also make something fishy – hopefully something with a bit of star-quality, but not too shouty. A dish that will be delicious, fancy, but stress-free all at the same time. These pan-fried monkfish fillets are this year’s solution. It’s the sort of dish that can be made in next to no time while everything else finishes off in the oven, but that still has all the glitz and glamour of Christmas.Fried monkfish in herby champagne butterPrep10 minCook40 minServes44 monkfish fillets4 tbsp plain flour1½ tsp ground white pepperSea salt and black pepperOlive oil3 tbsp small capers½ small bunch each fresh flat-leaf parsley and chives, finely chopped60g unsalted butter2 shallots,peeled and very finely chopped150ml champagne, or prosecco300ml fish stock150ml double creamZest of 1 unwaxed lemonPut the monkfish fillets on a sheet of kitchen paper to absorb any excess moisture. In a shallow bowl, toss the flour with a teaspoon of ground white pepper and a half-teaspoon of sea salt, then add some freshly ground black pepper and stir. Toss each fillet in the seasoned flour, until well coated, then put to one side.Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and drizzle in a few tablespoons of olive oil. Pat the capers dry, add them to the hot pan and fry for about five minutes, until crisp. Spoon the capers into a bowl, add the chopped parsley and chives and stir to combine. Keep the pan for later.Now make the sauce. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan or frying pan, add the chopped shallots, turn down the heat a little, then season with sea salt and the remaining half-teaspoon of ground white pepper. Cook the shallots for five minutes, until they start to soften, then pour in the champagne, turn up the heat and reduce by half.Add the stock, bring back to a boil, and keep on a rolling boil for about five minutes to reduce a little further. Stir in the cream, bring to a boil for a couple of minutes, then taste and tweak the seasoning.Meanwhile, pour enough oil into the large frying pan just to coat the bottom, return it to a medium-high heat and fry the seasoned monkish fillets for three to four minutes on each side, until golden all over and cooked through.To serve, spoon the hot sauce over a serving platter, ideally one with a lip. Arrange the fried monkfish on top, then scatter over the crisp capers and herbs. Finely grate over the lemon zest and serve straight away withgratin boulangere, caramelised carrots and shredded sprouts.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkFishFoodSeafoodMain courseChristmasWinerecipesShareReuse this content"

And it’s this sentiment that has carried through to the couple’s restaurant, Gina, which opened in Chingford, east London, earlier this year, a process they documented in their newsletter, Club Gina.Named after Taiano’s late mother, it is very much a neighbourhood joint, Gill points out, with the food – from pithiviers and vol au vents to Gina’s pasta with tomato sauce, half a roast chicken with little gems and aioli to share on Sundays, and slabs of “Ravi’s” chocolate cake – an extension of how the couple like to eat.“We’ve never not had people around,” says Gill, who grew up in an Indian family nearby. His is half Italian, half Jewish. “Our cultures are both very much about food and being around the table,” she says. “At home, it depended on the time of day but there was always something to eat: samosas and pakoras in the afternoon, and full-blown curries and rotis in the evening.”Entertaining together, though, happens more by accident than design. “We don’t do it deliberately,” explains Gill. “We just gather a group of friends through various conversations throughout the day, and they end up at our flat.” A definite perk of having chefs as friends.So, what can you expect from dinner at Gill and Taiano’s? “First, take your shoes off,” insists Gill. Bring a bottle: “We don’t drink.” If you also come armed with “deli things” that the couple can crack into after you’ve gone, then all the better. “We always make a nice table and get a playlist on,” adds Gill, but it’s very much food-focused, “so don’t be late because I will have made sure the food is ready for your arrival”.There will be crisps, of course, but otherwise think sharing bowls of pastas (“You’ve got to do it well, though,” warns Taiano) or a nice joint of meat to plonk in the middle of the table with some sort of potatoes, usually dauphinoise – “Just something slow cooked that you can put in the oven and sort of forget about,” says Taiano, with their braised lamb shoulder (see below) being a prime example.But who’s in charge when the two chefs cook at home? “I mostly do the food,” says Taiano, although it won’t exactly be a surprise to learn that Gill – who is also a judge on Junior Bake Off, taking over from Prue Leith in 2021, and former pastry chef at London institution St John – is always on dessert.This, she says, doesn’t need considerable planning, but don’t do anything daft like try a new recipe for the first time just hours before everyone turns up. “You just want a big sharing dessert,” she says, which in the winter months could be a choux tower (“They’re easy”); the giant of the crowd-pleasers, sticky toffee pudding; or even a toffee apple self-saucing pudding (“Everybody loves that”).That said, having people over all the time was “getting quite mental in the flat”, admits Gill, especially when the self-confessed cleaning obsessive was often faced with a three-day clean-up operation. “Mattie cooks these incredible feasts, but the kitchen is then turned upside-down,” she sighs. “He made a Thai meal and there was sticky fish sauce down and inside all the cupboards … I just couldn’t believe it.”The arrival of their son, Donnie, two years ago also changed things: “It’s difficult in a one-bed flat; we can’t have noisy guests because we don’t want them to wake our son – I can’t wait to get a house and have doors!”In the meantime, their entertaining itch is being scratched at Gina. “We thought, oh we’ll just have a restaurant, that will be easier,” laughs Gill. Their generosity has hit their profits, though. “We did get into trouble last month, because our comp bill was just too large – but it is in our nature to be hospitable.”It’s a statement her home fridge might disagree with right about now. “I was thinking yesterday that we haven’t cooked in our home since we started the restaurant ... If you open the fridge right now, there’s a box of Ferrero Rocher, some milk, rhubarb jam, a sourdough starter, and Pierre Marcolini chocolates,” adds Gill. “It’s really empty. Well, empty, but very clean, of course.”As told to Anna BerrillBraised lamb shoulderView image in fullscreenPrep10 minCook2 hr 30 min+Rest30 minServes4-52 tbspduck fat1.8kglamb shoulderon the bone (or ½ lamb shoulder), removed from the fridge an hour before cookingSaltand black pepper1 large onion, peeled and diced2 large carrots, peeled and cut into 5cm pieces2celery sticks, roughly chopped4garlic cloves, peeled and roughly choppedA few sprigs of rosemaryand thyme2plum tomatoes from a tin, crushed250ml white wine500ml fresh chicken stockEverything can be made two to three days before and reheated to serve. The dish will benefit from sitting in the fridge for a few days. If you do this, the fat will set on top of the liquid in the pan, making it easier to remove before reheating.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4. In a heavy-bottomed deep casserole dish or pan with a lid, heat the duck fat until smoking – be careful.Season the lamb all over with salt and pepper, then add the meat to the pan skin side down, placing it away from you to avoid splattering. Let it brown on one side before repeating on the other, then remove from the pan and set aside on a plate.In the same pan, add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic and herbs. Season, then stir over a medium heat until they turn golden. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, cook for two minutes, then add the white wine and bring to the boil. Pour in the stock and 200ml water, and bring back to the boil.Return the lamb to the pan and cover with parchment, followed by the lid. Place in the oven for two to three hours, until the meat is tender and soft when probed with a knife.Let the lamb rest for half an hour before removing from the pan, putting it on a plate. Skim the fat from the top of the braising liquid and discard, then ladle the juices over the lamb. Serve with the hot dauphinoise on the side. A bowl of buttery greens would be good, but optional.DauphinoiseView image in fullscreenPrep15 minCook1 hr 15 minServes4-51kg potatoes(we use king edwards), peeled and thinly sliced to 2mm thick300ml double cream300ml whole milk½ tbspchopped rosemaryand thyme3garlic cloves, peeled and roughly choppedSaltand black pepperHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas 6. Alternatively, you can bake the dauphinoise at the same temperature as the lamb, but you will need to add 10-15 minutes to the cooking time.Place the potatoes in a large bowl of water to wash off any excess starch, then drain. In a large, deep pan, combine the double cream, milk, herbs and garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Gently heat the mixture until it’s steaming, but not boiling.Add the sliced potatoes to the pan and stir to coat them in the cream mixture. Bring to a gentle boil, then pour the mixture into a gratin dish (we use a large, round, shallow 26cm Le Creuset pan). Cover with a piece of parchment, ensuring it touches the surface of the potatoes, then bake for 45 minutes to one hour, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife and show no resistance.Remove the parchment and return the dish to the oven for a further 10 minutes to get a nice golden colour on top. Let the dauphinoise rest for a few minutes before serving.Brown sugar meringues with coffee cream and cherriesView image in fullscreenStyling: Lucy Turnball and Rachel Vere.Photograph: Laura Edwards/The GuardianThese feel fantastically fancy, rich and decadent, but they are super-easyExplore more on these topicsChristmasWinter food 2025Christmas food and drinkFoodLambDessertSide dishesPotatoesfeaturesShareReuse this content"
