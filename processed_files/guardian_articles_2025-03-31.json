She was also ordered to pay a €100,000 (£84,000) fine.A furious Le Pen announced she would lodge an appeal against the ruling, as nationalist and populist figures from around the world rushed to support her.Donald Trump said the conviction was a “very big deal”.“I know all about it, and a lot of people thought she wasn’t going to be convicted of anything,” the US president told reporters at the White House. “But she was banned for running for five years, and she’s the leading candidate. That sounds like this country, that sounds very much like this country,” Trump said, in an apparent reference to legal cases that Trump himself faced before he took office.Elon Musk, Tesla’s billionaire owner, who has backed the far right in Germany and plays a major role in Trump’s administration, said thesentence against Le Pen would “backfire, like the legal attacks against president Trump”.The judges’ decision, backed by more than 150 pages of legal justifications after a nine-week trial, was necessary because nobody was entitled to “immunity in violation of the rule of law”, the head judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis,​ said.It was nonetheless considered a political earthquake in France as Le Pen had hoped to mount a fourth campaign to become president for her anti-immigrationNational Rally(RN) party.Speaking for the first time in public about the verdict, Le Pen told TF1 television on Monday night that she would “pursue whatever legal avenues” she could to prevent herself from being “eliminated”. “I’m not going to submit to a denial of democracy this easily,” she said.Le Pen, who was not found to have benefited personally from the embezzlement, insisted she had done nothing wrong. “I am going to appeal because I am innocent,” she said.“I’m not going to let myself be eliminated like this. I’m going to pursue whatever legal avenues I can,” she added.The RN, the single largest party in the French parliament, called the sentence a travesty.The president of the RN, Jordan Bardella, 29, who could be considered a replacement presidential candidate despite his relative inexperience, said: “Today it is not onlyMarine Le Penwho was unjustly condemned: French democracy was killed.”He urged party supporters to “mobilise” peacefully to show “that the will of the people is stronger”, starting a petition in support of Le Pen and a leafleting campaign across the country to take place this weekend.The ban on running for public office, to last five years, was ordered to kick in with immediate effect, meaning it will apply even though Le Pen, 56, is appealing against the verdict.Neither the prison penalty nor fine will be applied until her appeals are exhausted, a process that could take years.In the front row of the court, Le Pen showed no immediate reaction when the judge declared her guilty. But she grew more agitated and shook her head in disagreement as the judge said her party had illegally used European funds for its own benefit.At one point, Le Pen whispered: “Incredible.” She then abruptly left without warning, before her sentence had been handed down.Before Monday’s ruling, she had considered the 2027 presidential race as her best chance to gain more ground on an anti-immigration platform, while her opponents attacked her party’s policy platform as racist, xenophobic and anti-Islam.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Socialist president, François Hollande, said the judge’s decision was “based on law” for “serious” allegations. But Laurent Wauquiez, of the traditional right Les Républicains party, said it was a “very heavy and exceptional sentence” that was “not very healthy in democracy”.Mathieu Lefèvre, a member of parliament for Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party, told BFMTV: “Marine Le Pen isn’t the victim of a political or judicial conspiracy. She’s perhaps first the victim of herself and a system of embezzlement.”Le Pen and 24 party members, including nine former members of the European parliament and their 12 parliamentary assistants, were found guilty of a vast scheme over many years to embezzle European parliament funds, by using money earmarked for European parliament assistants to instead pay party workers inFrance.The so-called fake jobs system covered parliamentary assistant contracts between 2004 and 2016, and was unprecedented in scale and duration, causing losses of €4.5m (£3.8m) to European taxpayer funds. Assistants paid by the European parliament must work directly on Strasbourg parliamentary matters, which the judges found had not been the case.Le Pen will be able to retain her current post as a member of the French parliament for Pas-de-Calais, but will not be able to stand again in a future parliamentary election for the duration of her ban on running for office.Le Pen took over the leadership of the Front National from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2011 and began a drive to sanitise the party’s jackbooted, antisemitic image.Sherenamed the party National Rally in 2018, wanting it to be viewed as a potential governing force, not just a protest movement, and has run for president three times, twice making it to the final run-off against Emmanuel Macron.In 2022, Le Pen provided the far right with its highest-ever tally in a French presidential election,winning more than 13m votes.An Ifop poll published by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper this weekend found Le Pen could have won 34-37% in the first round of the next presidential election and her fate in the run-off second round would depend on whether all her opponents united to vote against her.The party will now have to decide who would take her place in the next French presidential race.Bardella, a member of the European parliament, is popular among voters but is seen as having little experience.Explore more on these topicsMarine Le PenFranceNational RallyEuropean UnionEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

And their story was markedly at odds with the narrative painted from the White House.Wilmore and Williams were speaking to reporters at a press conference in Houston, hours after ajoint appearance on Fox News, and reaffirmed that they never felt neglected or in need of the rescue the president insisted was necessary.Instead, they said, they calmly assumed duties as members of the space station crew – “planning for one thing, preparing for another”, Wilmore said – while a political firestorm over their status raged back on the ground.If anything, the pair of veteran space flyers appeared slightly bemused by, or largely ignorant of the furore that followed their enforced and protracted stay on the orbiting outpost 250 miles above Earth, caused by technical failures on board their pioneering Boeing Starliner spacecraft thatreturned in September without them.Dazzling planet, moon and stars tableau to usher in AprilRead moreAt the press conferenceNasahad called to discuss the science activities the astronauts performed during their time in space, Williams and Wilmore gave diplomatic answers to questions designed to elicit their thoughts.“The stuck and marooned narrative … yes, we heard about that,” Wilmore said, before reverting to a carefully worded explanation of how their training and preparations allowed them to pivot seamlessly from the roles of new spacecraft test pilots to routine ISS crew members who splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico on 18 March on a routine crew rotation flight.“The plan went way off for what we had planned. But because we’re in human spaceflight, we prepare for any number of contingencies. This is a curvy road. You never know where it’s going to go,” he continued.Earlier, in the Fox interview, he pushed back on Musk’s false claim,amplified by Trump, that the astronauts were “abandoned in space by the Biden administration”. Had they felt stuck, stranded or marooned, the interviewer, Bill Hemmer, wondered.“Any of those adjectives, they’re very broad in their definition,” Wilmore said.“So in certain respects we were stuck, in certain respects, maybe we were stranded, but based on how they were couching this, that we were left and forgotten in orbit, we were nowhere near any of that at all.“Stuck? OK, we didn’t get to come home the way we planned. But in the big scheme of things, we weren’t stuck. We planned and trained. Let me comment back on this other [claim], you know, ‘They failed you’. Who? Who’s they?”Williams, too, was reluctant to kick the political football. In orbit, she said, her focus was solely on the work she needed to do.“You sort of get maybe a little bit tunnel-visioned … you do your job type of thing, right, and so you’re not really aware of what else is going on down there,” she said.“I hate to say that maybe the world doesn’t revolve around us, but we revolve around the world, something like that. But I think we were just really focused on what we were doing and trying to be part of the team. Of course, we heard some things … ”The third US astronaut at the press conference, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, who returned to Earth with Williams and Wilmore, backed up his crewmate.“The politics, kind of, they don’t make it up there when we’re trying to make operational decisions,” he said. “As the commander [I’m] responsible for the safety of this crew and getting them back safely.”Musk, the founder of SpaceX, a key Nasa contractor, has continued to push the story,with no evidence, that the astronauts were effectively held hostage in space by Biden for political advantage. It was a SpaceX Dragon capsule that eventually brought them back to Earth, but it was a spacecraft that had been attached to the ISS for months, not one Trump said he directed Musk to “go get the two brave astronauts”.The billionaire became embroiled in aheated online disputewith Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen over the claims, and later attacked Mark and Scott Kelly, both retired astronauts and the former now Democratic senator for Arizona, for calling him out.As for the troubled Starliner, whose future is questionable as Boeing and Nasa engineers continue to evaluate the helium leaks and thruster control issues that brought its maiden crewed mission to a premature end, both Williams and Wilmore said they would be happy to fly on it again.Wilmore, as the Starliner mission commander, said there were questions he wished he’d asked during the flight that he believed might have brought a different outcome, and “some shortcomings in tests, shortcomings in preparation, that we did not foresee”. The astronauts will meet Boeing leadership on Wednesday to give first-hand testimony.The whole experience, he said, was a learning curve familiar to those in “the difficult job we all take part in”.“Could you point fingers? I don’t want to point fingers. I hope nobody wants to point fingers. We don’t want to look back and say, ‘shame, shame, shame’. We want to look forward and say, ‘Let’s make the future even more productive and better’.“That’s the way that I look at it. And what I think the way the nation should look at.”Explore more on these topicsNasaSpaceDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A Red Crescent official in Gaza said that there was evidence of at least one person being detained and killed, as the body of one of the dead had been found with his hands tied.The shootings happened on 23 March, one day into the renewed Israeli offensive in the area close to the Egyptian border. Another Red Crescent worker on the mission is reported missing.“Seven days ago, civil defence and PRCS ambulances arrived at the scene,” the head of Ocha in Palestine, Jonathan Whittall, said in a video statement. “One by one, [the paramedics and civil defense workers] were hit, they were struck. Their bodies were gathered and buried in this mass grave.“We’re digging them out in their uniforms, with their gloves on. They were here to save lives. Instead, they ended up in a mass grave,” Whittall said. “These ambulances have been buried in the sand. There’s a UN vehicle here, buried in the sand. A bulldozer – Israeli forces bulldozer – has buried them.”Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said that one of its employees was among the dead found in Rafah.“The body of our colleague killed in Rafah was retrieved yesterday, together with the aid workers from [the Palestinian Red Crescent] – all of them discarded in shallow graves – a profound violation of human dignity,” Lazzarini wrote in a social media post.View image in fullscreenRed Crescent staff digging in the area.Photograph: Red CrescentIsrael’s military said its “initial assessment” of the incident had found that its troops had opened fire on several vehicles “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”.It added that the movement of the vehicle had not been coordinated with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in advance, and that the area was an “active combat zone”. The Red Crescent said the Tel al-Sultan district had been considered safe, and movement there was normal, “requiring no coordination”.On Monday the IDF issued evacuation orders covering most of Rafah, indicating it could soon launch another major ground operation, eight days after the paramedics and rescue workers were killed.The IDF did not reply on Monday to a request for comment on the reports that the paramedics and rescue workers had been buried in a mass grave at the scene of the shooting. It earlier claimed to have killed nine militants from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad on 23 March, but its statement did not make clear whether it was alleging the militants had been in the Red Crescent ambulances, or had been hit by an airstrike on Rafah earlier in the night.According to the Red Crescent, an ambulance was dispatched to pick up the casualties from the airstrike in the early hours of 23 March and called for a support ambulance. The first ambulance arrived at hospital safely but contact was lost with the support ambulance at 3.30am. An initial report from the scene said it had been shot at and the two paramedics inside had been killed.A convoy of five vehicles, including ambulances, civil defence trucks and two cars from the health ministry, were sent to retrieve the bodies. That convoy then came under fire, and the Red Crescent said most of the dead were from that attack. Eight of the dead were from the Red Crescent, six from civil defence and one was a UN employee.Dr Bashar Murad, the Red Crescent’s director of health programmes, said one of the paramedics in the convoy had been on a call to his colleagues at the ambulance station when the attack took place.“He informed us that he was injured and requested assistance, and that another person was also injured,” Murad said. “A few minutes later, during the call, we heard the sound of Israeli soldiers arriving at the location, speaking in Hebrew. The conversation was about gathering the team, with statements like: ‘Gather them at the wall and bring some restraints to tie them.’ This indicated that a large number of the medical staff were still alive.”View image in fullscreen‘Healthcare workers should never be a target,’ said Jonathan Whittall.Photograph: Red CrescentThe Palestinian Red Crescent president, Younis al-Khatib, said the IDF had impeded the collection of the bodies for several days. The IDF said it had facilitated the evacuation of bodies as soon as “operational circumstances” allowed.“The bodies were recovered with difficulty as they were buried in the sand, with some showing signs of decomposition,” the Red Crescent said.Their burial had been put off pending autopsies, Murad said. “What is certain and very clear is that they were shot in the upper parts of their bodies, then gathered in a hole one on top of another, with sand thrown over them and buried,” he said. He said the body of one of the victims was recovered from the grave with his hands still tied. The claim could not be independently confirmed.Whittall described the mission to recover the bodies as fraught. “While travelling to the area on the fifth day we encountered hundreds of civilians fleeing under gunfire,” he said. “We witnessed a woman shot in the back of the head. When a young man tried to retrieve her, he too was shot. We were able to recover her body using our UN vehicle.”“It’s absolute horror what has happened here,” he added. “This should never happen. healthcare workers should never be a target.”Jens Lærke, an Ocha spokesperson in Geneva, said: “The available information indicates that the first team was killed by Israeli forces on 23 March, and that other emergency and aid crews were struck one after another over several hours as they searched for their missing colleagues.“They were buried under the sand, alongside their wrecked emergency vehicles – clearly marked ambulances, a fire truck and a UN car.”View image in fullscreen‘These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people,’ said the IFRC secretary general.Photograph: Red CrescentThe Red Crescent named the employees killed on 23 March as Mustafa Khafaja, Ezzedine Shaat, Saleh Muammar, Rifaat Radwan, Mohammed Bahloul, Ashraf Abu Labda, Mohammed Hilieh, and Raed Al-Sharif. The incident was the single most deadly attack on Red Cross or Red Crescent workers anywhere since 2017, the IFRC said.“I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians,” said the IFRC secretary general, Jagan Chapagain. “They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked.”According to the United Nations, at least 1,060 healthcare workers have been killed in the 18 months since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza. That began after Hamas fighters stormed communities in southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people. The global body is reducing its international staff in Gaza by a thirdowing to staff safety concerns.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Emergency services launched a “large-scale response” to the incident, the force said, but the search was later scaled down.London ambulance service (LAS), the London fire brigade (LFB) and the RNLI said its crews had been stood down. The girl’s next of kin have been made aware and are being supported by officers.LAS was called at a similar time to police after receiving a report of a person in the water at Lowestoft Mews.An LAS spokesperson said: “We sent resources to the scene, including an ambulance crew, an advanced paramedic, an incident response officer and members of our hazardous area response team.“Our crews assisted our emergency services partners at the scene but were later stood down.”The LFB deputy assistant commissioner, Joseph Kenny, said: “Firefighters responded to reports of a person in the River Thames near Lowestoft Mews, Newham. Crews from East Ham, Barking, Ilford and Bexley fire stations were sent to the scene alongside crews from the HM Coastguard, RNLI, London ambulance service and the Metropolitan police service.“The brigade also deployed its drone team and fire boat as part of its response, with crews carrying out a systematic search of the area. The brigade was first called about the incident at 1.23pm. Search operations for firefighters were concluded at 3.49pm when responsibility for the incident was left with the police.”A woman said she carried a life ring to the Thames shoreline to try to save the girl but was unable to find her.Kerry Benadjaoud, 62, told the PA news agency: “My neighbour next door, she was outside doing her garden and there was two little kids running, and they said ‘my friend’s in the water.’”A man told Benadjaoud that he had called the police, she said, adding: “But he said at the time he could see [the girl’s] hands going down.

The Guardian has contacted his company Yianis Group for comment.Jordan Osserman, a spokesperson for the campaign, said: “This case shows how the law is rigged against renters. Christodoulou makes millions off our rent while flouting the law and cutting corners on safety.”During the hearing earlier in March, the judge in the first-tier tribunal (property chamber), Robert Latham, said: “The respondent can only be characterised as a rogue landlord.”After a lengthy legal battle that began in 2020 – when the landlord rejected residents’ request for rent reliefduring the Covid-19 crisis, telling them they coulduse money saved on lunches to pay their rentin full – 46 residents from 15 different flats across Olympic House and Simpson House have been awarded a combined total of £263,555.68.The ruling forms part of a rent repayment order (RRO). These were introduced in housing legislation in 2016 and empower the property chamber of the first-tier tribunal to force a landlord who has broken the law on housing standards to pay back part, or all, of the rent.There are now concerns that Christodoulou may not pay, despite the order. The London Renters Union said the tenants had discovered that the landlord was attempting to liquidate the companies that the judgments are against after transferring ownership of Olympic House and Simpson House from one company to another within his corporate group at a large loss or undervalue.Marc Sutton, a member of Somerford Grove Renters, which represents 170 flats in Olympic House, Simpson House and St John’s Court in Hackney, all majority-owned by Christodoulou, said: “This appears to be a deliberate attempt to evade financial responsibility through corporate restructuring.“These tactics highlight how wealthy landlords manipulate corporate structures to avoid accountability while tenants suffer the consequences.”Osserman added: “Even when we win in court, landlords like Christodoulou can game the system to avoid paying up.” He added: “The only way we can fight back is by organising and taking collective action.”Explore more on these topicsHousingRenting propertyLondonHackneyPropertynewsShareReuse this content"

Recycling, green waste and bulky waste collection have all been suspended during the strike.Negotiations between Unite, representing the striking bin workers, and the Labour-led council have soured in recent weeks, and strikers have been accused of blocking bin lorries staffed by agency workers from leaving depots. The council said it could often get only one vehicle out an hour.On Sunday, the Unite leader, Sharon Graham, accused the council of “bullyboy tactics” and said its behaviour was “absolutely disgusting”, reiterating that members would not back down.Last week, the council said it was considering compulsory redundancies for workers who had declined its offers, and negotiations were due to resume on Monday.Unite’s national lead officer, Onay Kasab, said: “Rather than look for solutions to the strike the council instead announced that it will make workers, who have already seen their pay massively cut, redundant, while it has refused to rule out pay cuts for drivers. Unite will ensure these redundancies do not take place.”Bin workers have been striking since January in a dispute over council plans to scrap the waste recycling and collection officer (WRCO) role from its fleets.The council states the role does not exist in other local authorities and if kept, it would risk creating a “huge future equal pay liability”. Birmingham city councildeclared effective bankruptcy in 2023, largely due to an equal pay bill.Unite said removing the role was “the first step in a broader campaign of attacks against pay and terms and conditions” for bin workers.Cotton said: “I would reiterate that we have made a fair and reasonable offer to our workers which means none of them have to lose any money and I would urge Unite to reconsider their position.”Explore more on these topicsBirminghamWasteLocal governmentLocal politicsTrade unionsIndustrial actionnewsShareReuse this content"

She added: “She greatly appreciates the support and well wishes people are sending.”Giuffre is one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers, and also alleged she was abused byPrince Andrew. She was last reported to be living in Australia.A social media post from four weeks ago suggested Giuffre was in Perth in early March. Western Australia police said on Tuesday they had no record of an incident involving a bus and car in recent weeks. St Johns Ambulance WA said they were not immediately aware of such an incident.In 2021, Giuffrefiled a civil lawsuitagainstPrince Andrewin federal court in New York, alleging he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17.Andrew has repeatedly and strongly denied the accusations.In the lawsuit, Giuffre alleged Epstein and his longtime girlfriendGhislaine Maxwellhad introduced her to Andrew in 2001, and alleged that Maxwell forced her to have sex with Andrew.In 2022,Andrew and Giuffre agreed to an out-of-court settlementfor an undisclosed sum.Maxwell, who has maintained her innocence,was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022for sex trafficking.Epstein wasarrested by federal authorities in July 2019and charged with sex-trafficking counts. Shortly after, hedied by suicidewhile awaiting trial.Explore more on these topicsUS newsPrince AndrewJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Millions of households face sharp rises in everything from council tax to water from Tuesday, in what has been labelled “Awful April”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The exact amount extra that consumers will pay will depend on where they live and their personal circumstances. Despite some respite – including an increase in the minimum wage and a modest rise in most benefits – budgets are expected be squeezed.Here are the main bills that are increasing – and what can be done to cushion the blow.CounciltaxMost households in England will face the maximum increase of 4.99%, and this means the average council tax bill on a typical band D property is going up by £109 a year, to £2,280.Six councilswere given government permissionto raise bills by more than a nationwide cap.In Scotland most homes will receive a rise in council tax of at least 8%. Households in Wales will get council tax rises of 4.5% to 9.5%.Northern Ireland uses a domestic rates system, instead of council tax. All of Northern Ireland’s councils have put up rates by up to 5.9%.What can I do about it?Check whether you qualify for a discount, as you could be entitled to apply for between 25% and 100% off your bill.Council tax is usually billed over 10 months rather than 12. “If money is tight, why not ask the council to spread the money over 12 months instead?” says the consumer expert Martyn James.Energy billsIf you’re on a variable tariff linked to the energy price cap, your costs will increase on 1 April.View image in fullscreenOfgem’s energy price cap for households in England, Wales and Scotland is to rise by £111 from 1 April.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAThe cap on gas and electricity charges, set by the energy regulator Ofgem, is going up by £111, taking the average annual billto £1,849 a year for a typical household. It follows a rise in energy market prices. In April 2024, the average annual energy cost was £1,690.What can I do about it?Read your meter as soon as possible, so you’re not paying at the higher price. Send your energy provider monthly meter readings for accurate bills.You could swap over to a fixed tariff, which protects you from price rises and unpredictability. However, if energy prices fall later in the year you won’t benefit from those savings as your energy costs will remain the same.Energy price cap chartWaterWater bills for households in England and Wales are rising by an average of £10 a month on 1 April. However, the increase will vary significantly depending on the water company.For example, the average annual Thames Water bill is going up by about 31%, from £488 to £639, while Yorkshire Water customers will pay 28% more than in 2024-25, with their bills going from £467 to £602.View image in fullscreenThe annual bill for Thames Water customers is rising by about 31%.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianIn Scotland, water and sewerage prices depend on your council tax band and are generally paid alongside your council tax. The average bill is going up by 9.9%, or about £44 a year.What can I do about it?Your first step should be to see if you can cut back on water consumption.If you live in England or Wales and your home has more bedrooms than people, switching to a water meter could save you hundreds of pounds each year, as you’ll pay only for what you use. It’s free to have one installed but you have to apply through your provider’s website or give it a call. In Scotland, you will be charged the labour costs for installing a water meter, so staying with estimated payments might be the better option. If you don’t have a meter, you’ll probably pay for your water with your council tax. A council tax reduction could mean you also get up to 35% off water and waste.If you can’t get a meter in England or Wales, you may be eligible for an assessed charge, which is based on factors such as the number of people in your home. You can also apply for a social tariff.Increases in average annual water billsCar taxPetrol and diesel car owners will pay £5 more a year in vehicle tax, taking the standard rate cost on post-2017 vehicles to £195. Cars registered before 2017 and after 2001 pay a rate of vehicle tax based on fuel type and CO2 emissions – most of these are going up.Electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt and will cost £10 in the first year before moving to the standard rate. This new vehicle excise duty for EVs will affect new and existing vehicles, but drivers of new electric cars worth more than £40,000 could pay as much as £620 a year from the second year of registration onwards.The tax for new cars depends on emissions, and at some levels owners will pay double the rate previously charged in the first year.What can I do about it?Some cars are still exempt from vehicle tax. For instance, vehicles used by a disabled person and historic vehicles built more than 40 years before 1 January of the current year do not pay vehicle tax, but you need to apply for it through the DVLA.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The price of a first-class stamp will increase by 5p, or 3%, to £1.70, while the second-class service will increase by 2p, or 2.4%, to 87p.What can you do about it?You could save some cash further down the line by stockpiling before the increase comes in.TV licenceView image in fullscreenThe annual cost of a colour TV licence will increase to £174.50 on 1 April.Photograph: Nicholas.T Ansell/PAThe annual cost of a colour TV licence will increase by £5 on 1 April to £174.50. A black and white licence will increase by £1.50, to £58.50.What can I do about it?About 90% of households need a TV licence, according to the BBC – the rules apply if you watch or record live TV or anything on iPlayer, livestream using ITVX, Sky Go, Amazon Prime, YouTube live, Freely, or watch live events on Netflix. However, if you’re watching on demand – a show or programme that is not live TV – you don’t need a TV licence, unless it is on iPlayer.Broadband and mobile phonesMid-contract price rises are on the way for the customers of a number of broadband and mobile companies, totalling £74m a month from 1 April, according to Uswitch.New rules introduced by Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, in January mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers “in pounds and pence” about any price rises upfront.View image in fullscreenMid-contract price rises are on the way for some mobile phone customers.Photograph: miniseries/Getty ImagesUswitch estimates that the increases will add an average of £21.99 annually for those on inflation-linked contracts, and up to £42 a year for those on newer “pounds and pence” plans.What can I do about it?Most contracts won’t allow you to cancel penalty-free mid-contract, but if your contract has come to an end, it is worth calling up to haggle, or switching providers.And some good news …NationalminimumwageFor those aged 21 and over, thenational minimum wagewill increase by 77p, to £12.21 an hour, on 1 April. For 18- to 20-year-olds, the rate has gone up to £10 – an increase of £1.40 an hour. Apprentices and those under 18 will now be paid a minimum of £7.55 an hour, which is a £1.15 increase.What do I need to do?Nothing: you will see the increase in your wages automatically.State pensionUnderthe triple lock, the state pension will rise by 4.1%, in line with earnings growth. Those eligible for the full new state pension will see their weekly payment increase from £221.20 to £230.25, and those on the older basic state pension will see their weekly payment increase from £169.50 to £176.45.What do I need to do?You don’t need to take any action for the increase to come into effect.BenefitsBenefits such as universal credit and child benefit will increase by 1.7% in April. The standard allowance for universal credit is poised to rise from £393.45 a month to £400.14 a month for those 25 and over and single. The carer’s allowance, given to people who look after someone for 35 hours or more a week, will increase to £83.30 a week.What do I need to do?Inflationary rises are usually implemented automatically by the Department for Work and Pensions, but it is important to report any changes in your circumstances to ensure you continue receiving the correct amount of benefits.Explore more on these topicsHousehold billsConsumer affairsEnergy billsCouncil taxWater billsInflationEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Young, confident men really should not rule the internet …Lucy ManganMon 31 Mar 2025 17.15 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 17.52 EDTShareIt turns out that Mike Judge’s supposed sitcomSilicon Valleywas a documentary after all. My bad, as the people young and in touch enough with the world to have known this all along may still say.Twitter: Breaking the Bird is a 75-minute CNN film chronicling the rise, fall and possibly end of the social media site that was launched by a group of eager young things in 2006 amid a widespread belief – at least in the Valley – in the power of the internet to remake the world in radically better ways. This, a co-founder or two has come to consider since, may have been a “hallucinogenically optimistic” view. Well, we were all young once. Although that feels – and in no small measure because of Twitter – like a very long time ago.The original gang comprised Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone and Noah Glass. Dorsey, who became Twitter’s first CEO, came up with the idea of letting the site enable users to update each other on their thoughts, doings and feelings in real time. “Microblogging” is the word I remember being bandied about at the time, although it is not used here. Maybe no one knows what blogging was any more. (It was long-form Twitter. Does that help?)Twitter exploded in popularity, in part because celebrities were attracted to its immediacy and the apparent clarity of interaction it offered. Politicians flocked there, too, once its soft but extraordinary power began to become apparent, then activists, along with ever-growing numbers of ordinary users.The only problem was that the site was – please allow me to summarise some of the technical terms here – a piece of rubbish. These were the “fail whale” years: whenever the site crashed, an apologetic message would come on screen accompanied by the image of a blue whale being lifted by many, many little Twitter birds. “It was the loudest platform and the saddest little business,” saysthe tech journalist Kara Swisher. Dorsey was ousted as CEO, the rest of the co-founders were pushed or walked and a new boss, Dick Costolo, ordered a rebuild from the ground up.Five years later, he restored Dorsey – and his unwavering belief in free speech – to the throne. At first, as Twitter became instrumental in popularising theBlack Lives Matter movement, Dorsey’s belief in his creation as a democratising, liberalising force seemed justified. You will never guess what, though. It didn’t last.Del Harvey was the woman the boys had reluctantly appointed in the early days to deal with online abuse. She saw the pitfalls of an unthinking commitment to free speech. As Twitter’s former engineering manager Leslie Miley puts it: “It’s not just a naive philosophy; it’s a privileged philosophy.” Harvey had argued from the beginning for various tools and protections, but – I hope you are sitting down – wasn’t taken seriously.Hate speech of all kinds, especially misogynistic, flooded in. Then, in 2016, Trump arrived. He commanded attention and drove engagement, but his vitriolic posts legitimised others. Debate raged. Should he be banned? Should other users be banned? Should more posts be taken down? Does free speech mean freedom from consequences? Dorsey preferred to, as Swisher puts it, “go stare at a finch in Sri Lanka” than evolve a more sophisticated policy.Mounting issues meant “Twitter stopped being fun” for Dorsey, according to one of his team. He resigned as CEO and sold the company to Elon Musk – “the singular solution I trust”, apparently because of the billionaire’s commitment to unfettered freedom of speech. X, as Musk rebranded the site, is now a hellscape.Twitter: Breaking the Bird is a compelling tale – albeit told without flair – of how idealism and ignorance, willed and unwilled, combined to bring down a potential empire. It is an illustration of the profound difficulties we will face if we continue to let young, confident, unformed and uninformed men shape and rule the internet – which is to say our society – without making them look at what they are doing and examine the consequences.Although it isn’t asked explicitly, one question underlies every scene: has the internet made us monstrous, or given free rein to what was always there? Put another way, when we look at the hellscape, are we looking at the worst of humanity – a self-selecting group of horrors, unrepresentative of the whole – or the essence of it?Answers come there none. I may just look at a finch in Sri Lanka for a while.Twitter: Breaking the Bird aired on BBC Two and is available onBBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

He particularly captures the strange combination of surety and fragility in which families take shape. Designer Tom Piper has shrunk Hampstead’s wide stage and surrounded it by scaffolding to create a sense not just of lives under construction but also the preciousness of a family unit sheltered from danger. Donnelly’s drama suggests a kind of 100-minute cortisol release as a mother and father battle with fight or flight responses. But despite the nuanced domestic backdrop, Apex Predator’s interwoven supernatural and thriller elements are bloodless, albeit not literally.Mia and Joe live in London with their 11-year-old son, Alfie, and five-month-old Isla. Joe is frequently away for work of a sensitive, classified nature. Mia is driven to despair by sleep deprivation, exacerbated by the noise from upstairs neighbours. To make matters worse, Alfie has been biting other children but his art teacher, Ana, is here to help. Maybe she could give Alfie some extra free-of-charge tuition, take Mia on a boozy night out, perhaps offer her own breast for Isla to suckle?View image in fullscreenBloodless … Sophie Melville (left) and Laura Whitmore in Apex Predator.Photograph: Ellie KurttzA spoiler is probably required here: this play contains vampires. In between glasses of wine, Ana (played with a sly, icy smile by Laura Whitmore) reveals herself to be a bloodsucker and Mia (the always arresting Sophie Melville) receives her venom. Vampirism is presented as an act of self-fortification to deal with the world’s abundant perils, despite the fact that these “apex predators” are traditionally cursed to a pretty miserable existence.Joe (Bryan Dick) is in fact a very modern sort of vampire hunter: he monitors encrypted online forums visited by deluded souls who believe themselves to be the undead. Reality blurs with nightmare, dark comedy is sometimes awkwardly coupled with horror, and scenes from the couple’s flat, the school and the local GP’s examination room merge together. Blanche McIntyre’s production, despite the screeches of Chris Shutt’s sound design, is more bewildering than disturbing. Cutting the interval would help propel the story’s descent and Ingrid Mackinnon’s movement direction could be heightened in a staging that fails to fuse the play’s components as masterfully as the not dissimilarLet the Right One In.Whitmore’s vampire has an unvaried uncanniness: there is never the sense of a weary being who has stalked the land for hundreds of years, witnessing London ablaze and watching “a man called Burbage”. While the hold Ana has over Mia is unconvincing, Donnelly writes snappy, funny dialogue for Mia and Joe, their heated arguments realistically conveyed by Melville and Dick, ever aware that Alfie (played at this performance by Callum Knowelden) is within earshot. The humorous lines given to Leander Deeny, as one of Ana’s victims, are less successful.Its scenes of foggy parental psychodrama are similarly vivid to Morgan Lloyd Malcolm’s 2021 dramaMum, which also starred Melville. But fundamentally, for Donnelly’s ambitious play to succeed, you have to feel swept into its supernatural world and I just didn’t bite.AtHampstead theatre, London, until 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreHampstead theatreParents and parentingBlanche McIntyrereviewsShareReuse this content"

As a general rule, countries collaborating on crime have not yet managed to do away with crime. But I suppose that doing something – even if it’s only being seen to do something – is better than doing nothing. So a big welcome to the 40 countries that have converged on Lancaster House in central London at Keir Starmer’s invitation for a summit on tackling illegal migration.The government has chosen some curious targets for its attacks since the election last July. Mostly punching down. First it had pensioners in its sights, as itcut the winter fuel allowance. Then itwent after farmers. Recently it has had a go at cutting benefits for disabled people. Now it isthe turn of migrants. Maybe it’s just a wonder that Starmer took this long to get round to people making the small boat crossing from France. Every government is trying to out-Farage Farage these days.“There’s nothing progressive about turning a blind eye to the criminal gangs,” said Starmer in his opening remarks to the summit. Which is true. The gangs do prey on vulnerable people. But there is also nothing progressive about turning a blind eye to the many people with no safe routes to claim asylum. The gangs only have a business because there are so many willing volunteers. If you don’t come from Ukraine or Hong Kong, you might as well not bother trying to get refugee status in the UK by a legal route. So just sit it out at home and hope you don’t get killed or imprisoned.We are also now into the legitimised Two Minutes Hate. Or rather, because Starmer is happy to indulge us, the Ten Minutes Hate. Feel free to let yourself go. No need to be constrained by time limits. Take as long as you like to say how angry you really are about illegal immigrants. Keir was not shy about letting us know that he was angry, too. Very angry. And he could see that it made other people angry. It can’t be long before we bring back the stocks and the ducking stool. We all could do with someone to blame for the UK falling apart.Keir was adamant that a corner had been turned. That he was getting a grip of the situation. He had personally deported more than 24,000 people in the past eight months, he said. Under the Tories’ Rwanda plan, it would have taken about 300 years to return that many. “I opposed the Rwanda scheme,” he told us, “because it was a hollow pledge to working people”. Not because it was cruel or because it had been deemed illegal by an international court.You couldn’t help feeling that “working people” was doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Because some of the people who believe that migrants are the cause of the UK’s decline are not working. They are pensioners, or unemployed. But somehow “working people” sounds so much better. It makes the demonisation of those who arrive in small boats feel much more legitimate. They are here to rob us in some way. Of our phones. Of our way of life. It’s better that 100 genuine asylum seekers be returned to an unsafe country than that one criminal beats the system.This was Starmer talking tough. Rolling up his sleeves. He’s keen on that. There were no shortcuts. No gimmicks. Just a load of hard graft. Whatever worked. He was now thoroughly onboard with Giorgia Meloni. Find a country – any country: don’t just stop at the safe ones – that would take people and send them packing. He stopped short of saying he would sink the small boats in the Channel. Though if the French decided that was the right way to go, he would happily turn a blind eye.Britain was a soft touch, he said. By which he meant that we bothered to apply international law to those who arrived by boats. We gave asylum seekers access to lawyers. What mugs we are. We won’t be doing that again. We mustn’t be the only country to make sure that due process is observed. The European convention on human rights and dozens of refugee treaties are just for idiots. When the going gets tough at home and your ratings are falling, you might as well give someone more unfortunate than you a kicking.Later that afternoon during Home Office departmental questions, the 10-year-old shadow home secretary,Chris Philp– yet again wearing his union jack socks – was also demanding tough action. You couldn’t help feeling that the Philpster hasn’t got the memo. He had years to be beastly to asylum seekers and he managed only to send four volunteers to Rwanda. At a rough cost of £150m per person. Something even Conservative MPs agreed did not represent good value. Just imagine. You could have sent eight for £75m each. Then you’d be talking.But Chris remains catatonic. He is adamant the reason that 30,000 migrants have made the crossing since the election is solely because Labour binned the Rwanda policy. The Rwanda policy that had been on the verge of great things until it got sacked off. The criminal gangs hadn’t been able to believe their luck.The Philpster isn’t the only one in denial. The whole of the Commons is. About He Who Cannot Be Named. Priti Patel was granted an urgent question to ask about the possible threat to Bosnia and Herzegovina from Serbia. It was outrageous that the Russians could use the Serbs to annex another country, she said.Guys. Guys. You have a point. ButJD Vance has literally just turned up in Greenlandto do exactly the same thing as the Russians. An unwanted offer from an expansionist, undemocratic power. But Priti didn’t think to mention the name Donald Trump. She is blind to the similarities. Maybe it’s safer that way.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerImmigration and asylumChris PhilpcommentShareReuse this content"

Of course Bond was born of reactionary attitudes and only a bore would point out what the DBE stands for in Mirren’s title. If you doubt the truth of what she says, watch the cringeworthy moment in Goldfinger when Sean Connery’s Bond dismisses his poolside masseuse Dink (played by Margaret Nolan) because he needs to discuss important stuff with Felix Leiter, and as Dink obediently leaves he slaps her behind and says: “Man talk …” Obnoxious.Perhaps a further and even more uncomfortable point is that the Andrew Tate/JD Vance contingent would broadly agree with Dame Helen: yes, the wokery of casting a woman as 007 is unthinkable for precisely the reasons she says but on which they have different views – and, incidentally, the female-casting topic is a clickbait talking-point never seriously considered by anyone in any relevant position of authority at any time. Jeff Bezos (himself a stereotypical Bond villain) may countenance all sorts of product variations, perhaps even continuing to have a female agent with the notional “007” rating. ButJames Bondwill be a separate bloke.View image in fullscreenCringeworthy … Margaret Nolan as Dink with Sean Connery’s Bond in Goldfinger.Photograph: Danjaq/Eon/Ua/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockHelen Mirren’s denunciation of Bond is part of a long-standing exasperation which began with Paul Johnson who in 1958 famously denounced the Ian Fleming books in which 007 displayed “the sadism of a schoolboy bully, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a frustrated adolescent, and the crude snob cravings of a suburban adult”. As the movie franchise has developed, it is of course the second of these three qualities which has taken over; the movie Bond has not been sadist or a snob for many decades – but his sex-obsession and his status as an object of sex-obsession, has grown and metastasised. Everything around him is sexy: cars, luxury watches, weapons, explosions, women. And as Nigel Tufnel says in This Is Spinal Tap: what’s wrong with being sexy?But there is something else to be noticed in what Dame Helen says: she uses the antique term “sexism” and not “misogyny” which has long since supplanted “sexism” in the discourse. Maybe it is a generational thing. But in fact Helen Mirren is using her words correctly: “sexism” and “misogyny” are not interchangeable: however antediluvian most have been in their attitudes, the Bond films do not encourage hatred of women, at least partly because of the comedy and absurdity, and thecase has been madefor a sex-positive reassessment.View image in fullscreenVin Diesel and Helen Mirren in Fast 8.Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarAnd of course now the Bond franchise has evolved away (a little) from the quaint ladmag archetypes. For a while, M was a woman, in the form of Dame Judi Dench. In No Time to Die, Lashana Lynch played the separate “007” agent — tough, capable and derisive of the ageing Bond, in a film co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.But what the Bond films need is the most progressive innovation of all: not a female Bond but a female Bond villain. We have had figures such as Elektra King played by Sophie Marceau in The World Is Not Enough – but they have never really had the clear status of alpha-villain. For the next Bond film we need a lethally powerful and charismatic woman with a prestigious acting pedigree to play the antagonist, someone who has, say, played the MI6 assassin Vicky Winslow in the macho action comedy Red, and the criminal matriarch Queenie Shaw in the (equally macho) Fast and Furious franchise spinoff Hobbs & Shaw. The next 007 film will be a hit if they can persuade Mirren to be the villain. And the new Bond would certainly have to raise his game.Explore more on these topicsJames BondHelen MirrenGendercommentShareReuse this content"

I would rush home after school and wake up early on weekends, just to soak up the magic of storytelling on screen. But as a child with partial deafness, I could only catch about 70% of the dialogue; the rest was guesswork. Like being in a foreign country, winging it with limited vocab, not having full access is tiring and everything is tinged with a sense of alienation.One day in the early 80s my parents brought home a new TV set. Up flicked a page of blocky coloured digital text – Teletext. They pressed page 888 and subtitles suddenly appeared. It was a revolution, my own personal moon landing. The half stories were unlocked. I had full access.TV inclusion was later extended to visually impaired people with the arrival of audio description, and in the mid-90s the government legislated that a proportion of UK terrestrial TV would be offered with British Sign Language interpretation. But since then, there has been little innovation in TV access.As I devised my own children’s series, Mixmups, and started writing stories for Pockets, Giggle and Spin and their magical wooden spoon, I wondered how deaf children, who were too young to read English subtitles, would access my work. I thought about how much of the stories they would understand and how much their brains would be left to guess. At the time, my godson, who is visually impaired, was learning braille and another friend’s two children were diagnosed with autism and ADHD. I realised they too were being left to fill in the blanks.I saw teachers and parents using props, emotional regulation cues and social stories to embed concepts in a bespoke wayAnyone with a special needs child knows the time spent navigating an inaccessible world, and adapting to it. I began observing the work teachers and parents do to bring stories to life using props, emotional regulation cues and social stories to embed concepts in a bespoke way.I wondered if TV access could be personalised too? What if you could turn down the background sound so a deaf child could focus on dialogue alone? What if you could strip out background colour, allowing a child’s eye to be drawn to the characters and essential action only? What if you could choose between British Sign Language or Makaton signs, or learn signs for key concepts at the start of an episode? What if you could watch a shortened storyline to pre-embed understanding or provide a list of sensory props to place in the hands of a child to bring an episode to life in a tactile way? Could Mixmups revolutionise TV access for the next generation by devising a way to allow viewers to pick from a menu based on their own access needs?The Netflix series You vs. Wild used interactive TV technology to allow viewers to make decisions about the narrative, choosing to send presenter Bear Grylls up the mountain or down the valley. I wondered if this tech could extend personalisation of “how” we view, rather than altering the narrative itself. I contacted Stornaway, the Bristol-based interactive TV technology firm and, together with the Mixmups team, we devised Ultra Access.View image in fullscreenPersonalised access … viewers can pick from a menu based on their own needs.The launch of Mixmups with Ultra Access marks an important milestone in broadcasting. With a choice of 14 access features – from low background sound to Makaton and big subtitles – the permutations of viewing Mixmups with Ultra Access are mind boggling. There are now thousands of ways to watch, and meet every child’s unique needs.Beyond Mixmups, Ultra Access could enable all streaming platforms to have an optional BSL signer (as you can have subtitles and audio description), so that all viewers can start from the same landing page (at present, BSL content is often buried and hard to find), or enable global streamers to choose country-specific sign language at the click of a button. Advances in AI will probably make Ultra Access even easier to streamline. Whatever the future holds, Ultra Access remains the biggest development in TV access for decades.

Here’s how to avoid it and what to do if it happensMore than a quarter of adults over 65 fall annually. Fortunately, it’s avoidable, and when it happens you can recoverSarah SloatMon 31 Mar 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 12.29 EDTShareThe National Institute on Aging reports that more thanone in fouradults 65 and older fall annually. Fortunately, it’s an avoidable threat.“Falls are not inevitable,” says Emily Nabors, the associate director of innovation at the National Council on Aging’s Center for Healthy Aging. “There are many things you can do to reduce your risk.”Preparing for falls might trigger some stigma or fears about getting older, but experts say these actions are investments in your future self. Here’s what they say can help.What are the leading causes of falls in older people?Fall risks are divided into internal and external risks, says Nabors. Internal risks include vision problems, balance issues or trouble with mobility. External risks are factors in your home and community, like uneven sidewalks or electrical cords in walkways.‘What the hell is this stuff?’: French people on the culture shock of flossingRead more“More than half of all falls among older adults age 65 and older happen at home,” says Nabors.Falls result from various factors, explains Dr Angela Sanford, an associate professor of geriatric medicine at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine. This mix depends on the individual, though a drop in blood pressure, often linked to medications or dehydration, is frequently involved. Low blood pressure can cause dizziness, blurred vision or fainting, increasing fall risk.Isolated older adults also face higher risk due to inactivity, explains Jennifer Nash, a physical therapist and associate professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Lack of movement reduces strength, balance and flexibility.Tests can help determine your chance of falling. Nash checks how well a client can get up and down from a chair without their arms. Further, if you walk slower than1 meter per second, you’re at an increased risk.Caregivers can help mitigate hazards. The National Alliance for Caregiving and the National Council on Aging created this familyresource guide, which addresses topics such as how to discuss fall concerns with a loved one and how to develop a prevention plan.What do I do if I’m scared of falling?Falling can actually cause a fear of falling. This can cause someone to be less active, which increases fall risk, explains Nash.In these cases, physical therapy can build confidence, and help with gait and balance, says Sanford.The risk of fallingincreaseswith age, but Nabors notes that falls can happen to anyone, regardless of age or level of activity; it’s worthwhile for people of all backgrounds to try to reduce their risk.What can I do to prevent and recover from falls?If you fall, that doubles your chance of another fall. Check your risk level with this brief National Council on Agingquestionnaire.Migraines made life feel unlivable. It took years to find a doctor who believed meRead moreNabors recommends asking your doctor to identify your potential fall risks, including vision issues, balance problems and certain chronic conditions, such as arthritis. Nash recommends yearly eye and hearing exams.Speak with your doctor or pharmacist about medications and their associated risks annually or when you start a new medication, Nabors says. Side effects or interactions with other medications can increase the chance of falling. Be mindful of alcohol and how it might interact with medications.Staying social can also protect against falls, Nash observes. Relationships lead us to make plans, which naturally increases physical activity.Improving and maintaining strength and balance lowers your risk of falling, and increases your resilience if you do fall, says Nabors.How can I improve balance as I age?Assessing your balance and strength in advance of a fall is ideal, says Jonathan Lee-Confer, an assistant professor in the physical therapy program at the University of Arizona. He reframes fall prevention exercises as “activity promotion”. And the sooner you start, the more prepared you’ll be for later years.Physical therapy is a good prevention strategy. Learn some techniques, practice at home and reappraise as needed. There are also severalresourceguidesfor practicing at home, if it’s safe to do so. Exercises for preventing falls – such as wall squats, heel raises and hip circles – often focus on balance and leg strength. Tai chi and yoga can be especially helpful for balance.In your later years, physical therapy is very important if you can’t get down to and then up from the floor without assistance, says Nash. She works with clients on catching themselves if they experience an unexpected loss of balance.View image in fullscreenExercises focusing on balance and strength are particularly helpful for avoiding falls.Photograph: andresr/Getty Images“If you can stand on one foot for at least six seconds, you dramatically decrease the risk of falling,” she explains.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionArm movements help maintain balance during a fall, says Lee-Confer.His researchsuggests that strong arms and legs could lower the risk of debilitating falls. Quick lateral side raises with dumbbells can help. Training the arms to move rapidly “reduces how much our center of mass moves”, he explains. “We’re more likely to regain balance and less likely to lose balance in the first place.”Certain exercises can be beneficial, but keeping active overall helps. Get your heart rate up for a few minutes and do a variety of physical things, like gardening or walking, Nash says. But check with your doctor to make sure that any new physical activity is safe and appropriate.How can I modify my home to prevent falls?Increasing safety and support in the home might be daunting, but it’s simpler than most realize. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers a preventionchecklist.“Many home modifications are simple, easy and often free,” says Nabors. She recommends starting with a budget and a list of priorities. For example, if getting outside easily is important, prioritize fixing broken outdoor steps and installing a handrail.Simple tidying can help: pick up clutter, secure rugs and keep objects off the stairs. Keep frequently used items in easy reach and place a sturdy chair in the bedroom and kitchen to provide support while you get dressed or cook, says Nabors. An armful of packages or groceries can make tripping hazards hard to see, so she also suggests placing a table by the front door where you can place them.Cheap alterations include swapping burnt-out light bulbs with bright, non-glare replacements, adding night lights between the bedroom and bathroom, and adding a shower chair and adjustable shower head.Pricier but worthwhile changes include installing grab bars around the tub or shower, investing in a curbless shower, and widening doorways and hallways so they can accommodate a walker.For more complex health needs, ask a specialist, like an occupational therapist, for a home assessment. They understand how health conditions affect how people interact with their environment, and “can keep in mind future needs, not just current needs”, Nabors says.How do you get up after a fall?If you’ve fallen and you’re alone, Nabors recommends first taking a deep breath and a moment to recalibrate. Assess if you’re hurt. If you can, slowly crawl to a sturdy piece of furniture that can support you, she explains. Then carefullytransition from a kneeling positionto sitting on the chair or sofa. If you can’t move, call for help.If a caregiver is with you, theprocess is similar: the caregiver should check if you are in pain, place a sturdy chair next to you or ask you to crawl to furniture, guide you into a seated position, and check again for injuries. They should avoid the instinct to help you get up as quickly as possible.For those who live alone, a plan is critical. Considermedical alert systemssuch as wearable pendants, watches and wall buttons. Keep your cellphone on you or command smart home technology to make a call. And design a check-in system with neighbors, friends or family.What do I do after a fall?Some falls, like those that result in injury or you can’t get up from, require immediate help – call emergency services or a physician. In other cases, write down where, when and how you fell, and follow up with a doctor.The CDC reports thatless than halfof older people who fall tell a care provider. This is often because of “stigma, they don’t want to be perceived as weak, and they don’t want anyone to question their independence”, says Nash.View image in fullscreenAvoid the instinct to get up quickly after a fall. Assessing yourself for injuries should come first.Photograph: Zinkevych/Getty ImagesBut falls can cause non-visible injuries. It’s important to check for hidden harm, like a concussion. Sanford looks for symptoms of head injury such as confusion, dizziness, headaches or visual changes. A doctor can also identify what might have caused the fall and how to reduce the chance of future falls, and recommend next steps, such as starting physical therapy.“We want to get to the root of the fall before something more serious happens, like a fracture,” says Sanford.Mostfall-related injuriesare non-fatal, but they can cause broken bones and head injuries. And some falls can be deadly, because of an injury or a serious train of events. For example, immobility after fallingcan lead topneumonia, which can lead to death.But justone out of 10falls causes an injury so severe that a person has to restrict their activities or seek medical attention. Fall prevention actions are worthwhile and can help you avoid serious outcomes.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyAgeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a bold path others should followAlexander HurstThe far right leader is banned and disgraced. European leaders can seize this moment to show voters they will fight for themMon 31 Mar 2025 13.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 13.57 EDTShareThe French justice system chose courage over surrender. The law was clear, and so was the court in its sentencing:no special treatment for Marine Le Pen, no deference to the powerful, no using a candidacy for office as an excuse to break the law with impunity.For more than a decade, from 2004 to 2016, Le Pen’s reactionary rightwing party – named the Front National until 2018, when it became the Rassemblement National (RN) – operated an organised scheme to embezzle public funds by creating fictitious parliamentary assistant jobs at the European parliament, and to break other financial rules, in effect using European public money to finance a debt-ridden party domestically. Under a French anti-corruption law passed in 2016, the guilty verdict rendered against Le Pen comes with a sentence of ineligibility to run for office. The ban is for the next five years, effective immediately, which means that the sentence will hold all the way through an appeals process and will almost certainlytorpedo any chanceof her running for president in 2027.Many will see parallels between the RN’s response to this verdict and the way that Donald Trump rallied the anger of his base last summer, after a court in New Yorkfound him guiltyof a criminal hush-money scheme during the 2016 election. Indeed, Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old likely successor to Le Pen (who led RN during the summer’s unanticipated legislative elections), is already playing the victim card,declaringthat French democracy has been “killed”.There are a number of important differences, though. First, this is a much more serious case and conviction than the one against Trump: a hush-money payment might seem salacious, but this involved more than a decade of systematically defrauding the public of millions of euros and had real implications for French politics. During the time that the embezzlement was under way, the FN/RN was heavily indebtedto a Kremlin-connected Russian bank. Paying off the debt helped the party claim it no longer maintained inappropriate links to Vladimir Putin’s power circle – would it have been able to do so without the misused funds? And would it have been as competitive in the elections it contested without the unfair advantage of fraudulent finances?Second, with Le Pen herself ineligible to run in 2027, an angry base will have to transfer its support to Bardella or another potential challenger. As might be expected, many on the right are decrying the immediacy of the ineligibility sentence – but so is Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whobroke from the rest of the leftby declaring that the “impeachment” of a politician should be “left up to the people”. The Communist party, Greens and Socialists have, in various statements, underlined the importance of the rule of law and judicial independence.We will never know what would have happened if the US justice system had not totally failed at protecting the rule of law against an attempted coup d’etat. On the other hand, we know the consequences ofnotacting: the destruction of the rule of law and state capacity, the creation ofa parallel systemof prerogative and privilege from proximity to political power, and a slide towards outright fascism.But the law cannot be a substitute for politics, and the next judgment must be political. The far right has to be made to face its contradictions. It tells voters that the government is full of corrupt elites, or that immigrants are stealing social benefits – yet here are Le Pen and 24 other members of RN, convicted of the massive fraudulent use of public funds. It demands harsher sentencing from courts, and then plays the victim when it is handed harsh sentences. It superficially speaks the language of power, but what it really offers is weakness and submission – to Putin, to Trump. It doesn’t seem like this verdict will substantially change the far right’s message, or strategy; it was always going to claim victimhood at the hands of “the elites”. But it is here, in this third contradiction – what the parties reallyareand what their vision is to remake society – that there is the greatest opportunity to beat it politically.The RN makes no secret about which company it keeps and attracts. The French court’s verdict was decried by such paragons of the rule of law asthe Kremlin(“a violation of democratic norms”), Elon Musk (of course), whodenouncedan “abuse” of the judicial system, and Viktor Orbán,who posted: “Je suis Marine!”Exactly. Orbán is Marine; Putin is Marine; Trump is Marine.By trying to link their illiberal behaviour across borders, leaders of the reactionary right have given defenders of liberal democracy a playbook to follow. It strikes me as odd that, so far, few European politicians have seen the explosive benefit to be had in positioning themselves as a kind of “anti-Trump”, as the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, has doneto such effect, despite his country being far more vulnerable to US aggression than most of Europe is. Perhaps, in fact, that vulnerability has allowed him to see the stakes more clearly – or at least,to be more honestabout them with the Canadian public.Inpolling from February, a worrying 48% of French people said “nothing moves in democracy, there should be less democracy and more effectiveness”. I don’t think peopleactuallywant less democracy, though; I think they want to feel like someone is standing up and fighting for them, and it’s well past time that liberal democracy became as vociferous in defence of itself as its critics are against it. Trumpism is the perfect foil, in part because it’s so deeply unpopular with European voters, who see it in action and who in response support the EUmore than ever before, including broad popular support (even in the UK) for aEuropean defence union.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 1936,a journalist askedPhilippe Pétain, the French general and hero of the battle of Verdun, what the nation needed. “Rassemblement national,” (a national rally)replied Pétain, who, only four years later, would surrender his country to the Nazis and lead its collaborationist Vichy government.In the US, the legal system submitted to the idea that the pursuit of justice and defence of the rule of law would disturb “unity”. InFrance, it has not. I think we’ll find that courage will pay off in the end.Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They also inherited a set of alliances and relationships that underpinned the largest economy in world history. This too they are breaking.The American vice-president, JD Vance, visited a US base in Greenland forthree hours on Friday, along with his wife. National security adviser Mike Waltz and his wife also went along. Fresh fromusing an unsafe social media platformto carry out an entirely unnecessary group chat in which they leaked sensitive data about an ongoing military attack to a reporter, and thereby allegedly breaking the law, Waltz and Vance perhaps hoped to change the subject by tagging along on a trip that was initially billed as Vance’s wife watching a dogsled race.The overall context was Trump’s persistent claim that America must take Greenland, which is an autonomous region of Denmark. The original plan had been that Usha Vance would visit Greenlanders, apparently on the logic that the second lady would be an effective animatrice of colonial subjection; butnone of themwanted to see her, and Greenland’s businesses refused to serve as a backdrop to photo ops or even to serve the uninvited Americans. So, instead, the US couples made a very quick visit to Pituffik space base. (Pete Hegseth, another group chatter, stayed home; but his wife was in the news as well, as an unorthodoxparticipant in sensitive military discussions.)At the base, in the far north of the island, the US visitors had pictures taken of themselves and ate lunch with servicemen and women. They treated the base as the backdrop to a press conference where they could say things they already thought; nothing was experienced, nothing was learned, nothing sensible was said. Vance, who never left the base, and has never before visited Greenland, was quite sure how Greenlanders should live. Hemade a political appealto Greenlanders, none of whom was present, or anywhere near him. He claimed that Denmark was not protecting the security of Greenlanders in the Arctic, and that the US would. Greenland should therefore join the US.It takes some patience to unwind all of the nonsense here.The base atPituffik(formerly Thule) only exists because Denmark permitted the US to build it at a sensitive time. It has served for decades as a central part of the US’s nuclear armoury and then as an early-warning system against Soviet and then Russian nuclear attack.So many souvenirs for JD Vance to take home from Greenland: oil, gas, minerals – and that’s just the start | Marina HydeRead moreWhen Vance says that Denmark is not protectingGreenlandand the base, he is wishing away generations of cooperation, as well as the Nato alliance itself. Denmark was a founding member of Nato, and it is already the US’s job to defend Denmark and Greenland, just as it is Denmark’s job (as with other members) to defend them in return.Americans might chuckle at that idea, but such arrogance is unwarranted. We are the only ones ever to have invokedarticle 5, the mutual defence obligation of the Nato treaty, after 9/11; and our European allies did respond. Per capita, almost as many Danish soldiers were killed in the Afghan war as were American soldiers. Do we remember them? Thank them?The threat in the Arctic invoked by Vance is Russia; and of course defending against a Russian attack is the Nato mission. But right now the US is supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine. No one is doing more to contain the Russian threat than Ukraine. Indeed, Ukraine is in effect fulfilling the entire Nato mission, right now, by absorbing a huge Russian attack. But Vance opposes helping Ukraine,spreads Russian propagandaabout Ukraine, and is best known for yelling at Ukraine’s president in the Oval Office. On the base, Vance blamed the killing in Ukraine on Joe Biden rather than on Vladimir Putin, which is grotesque.Vance claimedthat there is now an energy ceasefire in place between Russia and Ukraine; in fact, Russia violated it immediately. Russia is now preparing amassive spring offensiveagainst Ukraine; the response of Musk-Trump has been to ignore this larger reality completely while allowing Biden-era aid to Ukraine to come to an end. Denmark, meanwhile, has givenfour times as much aidto Ukraine, per capita, as the US.Greenland, Denmark and the US have been enmeshed in complex and effective security arrangements, touching on the gravest scenarios, for the better part of a century. Arctic security, an issue discovered by Trump and Vance very recently, was a preoccuption for decades during and after the cold war. There are fewer than 200Americans at Pituffiknow, where once there were 10,000; there is only that one US base on the island where once therewere a dozen; but that is American policy, not Denmark’s fault.We really do have a problem taking responsibility. The US has fallen well behind its allies and its rivals in the Arctic, in part because members of Vance’s political party denied for decades the reality of global warming, which hasmade it hardfor the US navy to persuade Congress of the need to commission icebreaker ships. The US only hastwo functional Arctic icebreakers; the Biden administration was intendingto cooperatewith Canada, which has some, and with Finland, which builds lots, in order to compete with Russia,which has the most. That common planwould have allowed the USto surpass Russia in icebreaking capacity. This is one of countless examples of how cooperation with Nato allies benefits the US. It is not clear what will happen with that arrangement now that Trump and Vance define Canada, like Denmark, as a rival or even as an enemy. Presumably it will break down, leaving Russia dominant.As with everything Musk-Trump does, however, the cui bono question about imperialism in Greenland is easy to answer: Russia benefits. Putincannot contain his delightwith US imperialism over Greenland. In generating artificial crises in relations with both Denmark and Canada, America’s two closest allies these last 80 years, the Trump people cut America loose from security gains and create a chaos in which Russia benefits.View image in fullscreenPeople protest over JD Vance’s visit to Greenland in front of the US embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark, 29 March 2025.Photograph: Nils Meilvang/APThe American imperialism directed towardsDenmarkand Canada is not just morally wrong. It is strategically disastrous. The US has nothing to gain from it, and much to lose. There is nothing that Americans cannot get from Denmark or Canada through alliance. The very existence of the base at Pituffik shows that. Within the atmosphere of friendship that has prevailed the last 80 years, all of the mineral resources of Canada and Greenland can be traded for on good terms, or for that matter explored by American companies. The only way to put all of this easy access in doubt was to follow the course that Musk-Trump have chosen: trade wars with Canada and Europe, and the threat of actual wars and annexations. Musk and Trump are creating the bloodily moronic situation in which the US will have to fight wars to get the things that, just a few weeks ago, were there for the asking. And, of course, wars rarely turn out the way one expects.Much effort is spent trying to extract a doctrine from all this. But there is none. It is just senselessness that benefits America’s enemies. Hans Christian Andersen told the unforgettable tale of the naked emperor. In Greenland, what we saw was American imperialism with no clothes. Naked and vain.As a parting shot, Vance told Greenlanders that life with the US would be better than with Denmark. Danish officials have been too diplomatic to answer directly the insults directed at them from their own territory during an uninvited visit by imperialist hotheads. Let me though just note a few possible replies, off the top of my head. The comparison between life in the US and life in Denmark is not just polemical. Musk-Trump treatEuropeas though it were some decadent abyss, and propose that alliances with dictatorships would somehow be better. But Europe is not only home to our traditional allies; it is an enviable zone of democracy, wealth and prosperity with which it benefits us to have good relations, and from which we can sometimes learn.So consider. The US is24th in the worldin the happiness rankings. Not bad. But Denmark is No 2 (after Finland). On a scale of 1 to 100, Freedom Houseranks Denmark 97and theUS 84on freedom – and the US will drop a great deal this year. An American is about 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than a Dane. Danes have access to universal and essentially free healthcare; Americans spend a huge amount of money to be sick more often and to be treated worse when they are. Danes on average live four years longer than Americans. In Denmark, university education is free; the average balance owed by the tens of millions of Americans who hold student debt in theUS is about $40,000. Danish parentsshare a year of paid parental leave. In the US, one parent might get 12 weeks of unpaid leave. Denmark has children’s story writer Hans Christian Andersen. The US has children’sstory writer JD Vance. American children are about twice as likely as Danish children to die before the age of five.Timothy Snyder is the Richard C Levin professor of history at Yale University, and the chair in modern European history supported by the Temerty endowment for Ukrainian studies at the University of Toronto.

I hope it’s not inexpertly summarised research, because I have been intrigued by the recently reported finding that menget more disgusted as they age. Researchers at the Institute for Environmental Decisions in Zurich found that while young women generally “experience more disgust than men”, later in life the difference between the sexes narrows, and “men and women will reach similar levels of disgust when they get older”.I don’t think anyone who has encountered young men’s bedrooms either in person or through the@boyroomsocial media account (a festival of coverless, unwashed duvets, defrosted bags of Ikea meatballs left to fester and stockpiled used tissues) will be surprised to learn that male disgust doesn’t kick in early. However, the theory is that as physical vulnerability increases with age, it makes survival sense for men to become warier of potential contaminants. For women, disgust stays stable – high in their fertile years (perhaps an evolutionary safeguard for potential pregnancies) and high post-menopause too, as they become more susceptible to disease.This disgust convergence between the sexes in later life could facilitate domestic harmony in straight couples – a closer consensus on sheet-changing and loo-cleaning frequency, and shared attitudes to hair-clogged plugholes, overflowing bins and whether mould on jam is a deal breaker will surely lead to fewer arguments – unless you’re me and my husband. Because he is already moderately fastidious, while not much disgusts me except mayonnaise.I’m so un-squeamish that, evolutionarily speaking, it’s a wonder I have survived so long – while I don’t actively enjoy dealing with vomit, excrement, hens with prolapses, dead mice or furry fridge oozings, they leave me utterly unbothered. I would argue that is a useful quality in a life partner, but it does mean that my approach to hygiene is best described as “robust”: from March to October, my nails are permanently French-tipped with garden muck, my salad washing is so cursory that slugs sometimes end up wandering across my plate, and I found chicken poo on my leg earlier today and was neither surprised nor grossed out. So what if my husband’s age-related increased disgust leaves him disgusted – by me?Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She wasn’t wrong – married people aren’t exactly known for their thriving sex lives. And I suspect the only couples reliably having sex must be the ones who have scheduled it into their Google calendars, probably in a shared folder alongside “Bunnings trip” and “remortgage review”.I’m not that interested in how much sex people are or aren’t having in long-term relationships, but rather in how intimacy evolves over time and desire shifts after 10, 15, 20 years with the same person. How does it compete with exhaustion, children, finances and the never-ending pile of laundry?‘I felt like I was his carer’: why straight women in relationships lose interest in sexRead moreWe’ve all read storiesabout the electric beginnings of love: the butterflies, the charged glances, the can’t-keep-your-hands-off-each-other urgency. But what happens after the “happily ever after”? When the thrill of new love gives way to the hum of daily life, when the only sparks are from an overloaded power board, and the closest thing to foreplay is someone finally emptying the dishwasher?Love changes. We all learn that sooner or later. I first encountered this concept in a university psychology course, where I studied the stages of love. Teenage me was drawn to the initial, obsessive stage – the kind of love that keeps you up at night and rewires your brain. The final stage, companionate love, sounded tragic. I pictured two frail people in rocking chairs, silently waiting for the end. I didn’t imagine thirty- and fortysomethings who still have decades ahead of them, their passion dulled not by time, but by school drop-offs, work emails and the soul-crushing weight of the news cycle.Because the truth is, love doesn’t just change – it adapts, it stretches, it bends under the pressure of competing priorities. And nowhere is this more apparent than in motherhood. Pregnancy alters your body, postpartum leaves its own marks – leaking breasts, stretched skin, a whole new relationship with exhaustion. Your identity shifts. You’re no longer just a person, or a partner; you’re a mother, and that identity can eclipse everything for a while. Meanwhile, you’re supposed to maintain a career, follow your dreams, drink enough water, get your steps in, andwhat do you mean you want to have sex, it’s after 10pm.Maybe we’re expecting too much of ourselves. Perhaps we were never meant to juggle the sheer number of responsibilities that modern life demands. And yet we do, especially women, who are still sold the myth of having it all – a promise that sounds empowering but, in reality, sets us up for exhaustion and disappointment. Why don’t we call it out for what it is: a scam. A lie that women fall for, generation after generation.As sex therapist Esther Perel wrote in her book, Mating in Captivity: “Today, we turn to one person to provide what an entire village once did: a sense of grounding, meaning, and continuity. At the same time, we expect our committed relationships to be romantic and emotionally and sexually fulfilling. Is it any wonder that so many relationships crumble under the weight of it all?”We can’t be everything to everyone. Expecting one relationship to meet every emotional, practical and romantic need is an impossible standard. And yet, we keep trying.So are we all doomed to a lifetime of scheduling sex between school runs and home loan repayments? Not necessarily. Maybe the key isn’t chasing some impossible ideal of passion that never fades, but learning to appreciate love in all its evolving forms. Maybe it’s about finding intimacy in the everyday – a shared joke over the washing up, a text that says I’m thinking of you, for no reason at all, the quiet comfort of knowing someone still chooses you, even when you’re at your worst and both running on caffeine and three hours’ sleep.What couples need to know about desire: ‘There’s no right or healthy amount of sex’Read morePassion doesn’t just have to be stolen weekends away or grand gestures. It’s also remembering to pick up their favourite chocolate from the shop on your way home. It’s choosing, in a thousand small ways, to turn towards each other rather than away. And maybe it’s about shifting our expectations. So maybe turn off Netflix, ignore the news and rediscover each other – at least for a few minutes before one of you inevitably falls asleep.As for the sex lives (or lack thereof) of married women? Let’s just say, it’s complicated.Saman Shad is a journalist and novelist. Her debut novel The Matchmaker was released by Penguin Australia in 2023.

He had a lot to say.When he needed to run off to an appointment, I asked him if he’d text or email me the rest of his thoughts.His response worried me. “No,” he said. “I better not.

Gotta go!” He was off.My friend has never shown signs of paranoia.The US government is effectively kidnapping people for opposing genocide | Moira DoneganRead moreI relay this to you because theDonald Trumpregime is starting to have a chilling effect on what and how Americans communicate with each other. It is beginning to deter open dissent, which is exactly what the US president intends.The chill affects all five major pillars of civil society – universities, science, the media, the law and the arts.In Columbia University’s capitulation to Trump, it agreed torequire demonstratorsto identify themselves when asked and put its department of Middle Eastern studies under “receivership”, lest itlose $400min government funding.The agreement is already chilling dissent there, as my conversation with my friend revealed.The Trump regime also “detained” aColumbia University graduate studentand green card holder who participated in protests at the school. The administration’s agents have also entered dorms with search warrants and targetedtwootherstudentswho participated in such protests.On Tuesday, an international student in a graduate program at Tufts University was taken into custody outside her off-campus apartment building by plainclothes homeland security agents, handcuffed andwhisked awayto aprison in Louisiana. She has a valid student visa. Her apparent offense? Putting her name to an opinion piece in the Tufts student newspaper that was critical of how the Tufts administration handled protests.Scores of other major universities are on Trump’s target list.Trump’s attack on science has involved threats to three of the largest funders of American science – the Centers for Disease Control, National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation.Tens of thousands of researchers are worried about how to continue their research. Many have decided to hunker down and not criticize theTrump administrationfor fear of losing their funding.Philippe Baptiste, the French minister for higher education, has charged that a French scientist traveling to a conference near Houston earlier this month wasdenied entryinto the US because his phone contained message exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he gave a negative “personal opinion” about Trump’s scientific and research policies. The US Department of Homeland Security denies this was the reason the scientist wasn’t admitted into the country.Meanwhile, America’smajor media fearmore lawsuits from Trump and his political allies in the wake of ABC’s surrender to Trump in December,agreeing to pay him $15mto settle a defamation suit he filed against the network.Journalists who cover the White House are reeling from Trump’s decision to bar those he deems unfriendly from major events where space is limited.The media chill is palpable.

His order banned Perkins Coie lawyers from federal buildings and halted its federal contracts.Another executive order took aim at Paul Weiss, who employed the lawyer Mark Pomerantz before he helped prosecute Trump over hush money payments to Stormy Daniels.Last Thursday, Trumpwithdrew the executive order against Paul Weissbecause, he said, the firm had “acknowledged the wrongdoing” of Pomerantz and pledged $40m in free legal work to support the Trump administration.Non-profits tell the Washington Post that law firms that once might have helped them fight Trump’s orders now fear Trump will pursue them if they do.Trump is even intimidating the arts bytaking over the Kennedy Center, firing board members, ousting its president and making himself chairman.The comedian Nikki Glaser, one of the few celebrities to walk the red carpet at this year’s Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prizes, now thinks twice before doing political jokes directed at Trump.“Like, you just are scared that you’re gonna get doxxed and death threats or who knows where this leads, like, detained.

If you remember them as the original “barbarians at the gate”, the US private equity firm would probably point out that the reference to a leveraged buyout of a US biscuit company is more than 35 years old. These days, the relevant unit of KKR would like to be known as an infrastructure investor, which has a cuddlier ring.On day one as official frontrunner, however, KKR saw no need to inform Thames’s 16 million captive customers of its thinking about the business. True, the plan to take control by investing £4bn in equity isn’t finalised but you’d still expect a wannabe new owner to offer a few words of comfort at this stage, if only to put some distance between itself and Macquarie, the Australian private equiteers of 2006-2017 vintagewho wrecked the balance sheet in the first place.Instead, KKR left the main questions unanswered. Who at KKR would ultimately be in charge of this investment? Will Chris Weston, Thames’s chief executive, survive? Do KKR’s plans for Thames differ meaningfully from the company’s own business plan? And – critically – what sort of “regulatory support and accommodations”,as Thames expressed it mysteriously a couple of weeks ago, are being sought?Thames Water names US private equity group KKR as preferred bidderRead moreNot that the company itself was more forthcoming. There was no explanation of why KKR was chosen over, say, CK Infrastructure or Castle Water, among the pack of interested parties.Thus, you don’t have to be overly cynical to think the clincher for KKR was nothing more than the presumption that it was proposing smaller haircuts for Thames’s class A senior bondholders. There will still be a “material impairment” for the As, but that outcome has been guaranteed for at least 18 months as Thames’s debt has nudged to £16bn, even beforethe contentious £3bn emergency top-up. The question was always the degree of materiality.If KKR reckons it can afford to let the As escape with 75p in the pound (in line with current market prices), you can see why the bondholders would be keen. The financial damage for them could be much worse given the size of Thames’s failures and the size of the necessary catch-up spending.But, if that’s where KKR is aiming – a £4bn injection, together with a bottom-of-the-range writedown and conversion for bondholders – we’d love to hear an explanation of how that will create sufficient financial room to haul Thames out of the mire. KKR is a 25% shareholder in Northumbrian Water, a less troubled utility that offers few lessons. Thames’s woes are of another order.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is our refusal to be erased, our determination to remain and exist on our landMon 31 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 12.16 EDTShareOn the 17th night of Ramadan – a time meant for prayer, reflection and mercy –Gazaburned. Once again, our screens fill with images too harrowing to describe: tiny bodies wrapped in bloodstained cloth, fathers carrying their children’s remains in plastic bags, mothers screaming into skies that rain death instead of mercy. In less than an hour, Israeli airstrikes killed more than 350 Palestinians, including 90 children. Entire families wiped out as bombs fell on areas Israel itself had designated as “safe zones”, turning supposed sanctuaries into mass graves.This was not merely a resumption of violence. This is the continuation of a genocide that never truly paused, only ebbed enough to vanish from headlines while Palestinians continued to die by the dozens daily. The heaviness of this moment is unbearable, bringing back the brokenness of the past year that has not yet healed. For this slaughter to continue while the world watches reveals how deeply indifferent global powers have become to Palestinian suffering, how thoroughly dehumanized an entire people must be for their massacre to be debated as a matter of “security concerns”.These newest atrocities underscore the ongoing reality that Palestinians have faced for months now. In the ruins of Gaza, amid thecountlesslyviolated “ceasefire”, Palestinians confront not only the monumental task of rebuilding but also a struggle for who will control their future. Since 2 March, Israel has not allowed inanyaid, most importantly food and reconstruction resources, while Palestinians starve through Ramadan. As families return to find neighborhoods reduced to rubble, they face competing visions for Gaza’s reconstruction – including proposals that threaten their very existence on the land.Donald Trump recently suggestedtransformingGaza into a “riviera of the Middle East” by resettling its 1.8 million Palestinian residents elsewhere. This proposal reveals a profound misunderstanding of our connection to our homeland, a connection that transcends mere residence and forms the core of Palestinian identity.When outsiders ask why Palestinians don’t leave Gaza, or the increasinglygenocidalviolence in theWest Bank, they fail to grasp that this land isn’t just where we live – it’s who we are. Our relationship with this soil has been cultivated through generations. Since 1967, Israel hassystematically uprootedat least 2.5m trees in the occupied Palestinian territory, including nearly 1m olive trees. The olive trees that dot our landscape embody our history, resilience and indigeneity to the land – cultivated over generations of displacement.The question isn’t why Palestinians return to destroyed neighborhoods – it’s why anyone would expect us not to. Palestinians return because Gaza is home. The rubble beneath their feet isn’t debris; it contains memories, histories and the foundations of homes where generations were born and buried. Where the rubble has become amass gravefor50,000Palestinians.According to the UN’s latest assessment, rebuilding Gaza and the West Bank will require$53.2bnover the next decade: $29.9bn for physical infrastructure and $19.1bn for economic and social losses. These reconstruction efforts the result of 85,000tonsof bombs beingindiscriminatelydropped over the total area of Gaza. Behind these staggering figures lies a more fundamental question: will Palestinians be allowed to rebuild, or will they be rebuilt over?The answer must be Palestinians themselves. The future of Palestine will be determined by, with, and for Palestinians – no matter the form we choose. It is not for the United States, Israel, or the Arab states, who stood by as our people died, to decide what is best for us. Without Palestinians, rebuilding efforts merely perpetuate the cycle of violence and dispossession. We are not pieces on their geopolitical chessboard. We are a people with an inalienable right toself-determination, and reconstruction must serve that right – not subvert it.The immediate challenges are overwhelming. Over 80% of Gaza’s physical infrastructure has beendecimated– roads, power plants, water facilities, schools, universities andeveryhospital, in contravention of international law and basic morality. The removal of more than 50m tons of rubble and unexploded ordnance will requiredecadesto clear and restore semblance of normalcy.Yet amid this devastation, Palestinians demonstrate remarkable resilience. Journalists have documented peoplereturningto northern Gaza, setting uptentsin demolition sites, and even beginning construction work on new buildings. The “ceasefire” stipulated that 60,000 trailers and 200,000 tents should have entered Gaza to help house the forcibly displaced Palestinians – only 20,000tentsand no trailers have entered as Israel obstructs aid. However, Israel did deliver bombs as children slept; 70% of thosemurderedsince Israel resumed its violence have been women and children. In Jabalia, men were seen building the walls of theirdestroyedhome – a powerful symbol of determination to remain. There has been total destruction, but Palestinians remain steadfast like firm mountains. Palestinians are rooted in the land, there is no alternative.Does Israel think when it destroyed the stones, Palestinians will leave? As if theircitieswere not already built on the bones of our ancestors.This determination isn’t naive optimism, it is a recognition that to exist is to resist. We will not ask permission to narrate our pain. We will not wait for perfect victimhood to earn our humanity. Gaza is the site of resistance, rooted in every olive tree, every seed, every grave. We don’t build because we’re certain our homes will stand forever; we build because to stop building is to surrender. After previous bombardments, Gazans would collect concrete from destroyed houses to be crushed into gravel for new structures. Others extracted rebar from damaged walls to reinforce new construction.In the sameinterview, Trump also suggested Palestinians should leave so they no longer have to be “worried about dying”. Palestinians aren’t afraid of death – we’re afraid of being killed systematically. The solution isn’t removing the victims but stopping those doing the killing. Gaza doesn’t need redesigning as if it were an empty hotel room; it needs an end to the cycle of destruction.When I think about what Palestinians hope for, I’m struck by how basic their dreams are. Palestinians want to get jobs, build homes, visit the beach, perhaps travel knowing they can return. Palestinians dream of an airport, a seaport, welcoming tourists, praying at Al-Aqsa mosque, and returning to villages where their grandparents lived.What Gaza needs now is immediate: it needs life restored, urgently and unapologetically. It needs teachers for children who have been denied not just classrooms, but childhood itself. It needs dignified burials for the dead, those whose names are scribbled on their limbs so they might be recognized beneath the rubble. It needs seeds and soil, not just to replant crops, but feed those forcibly starved. It needs hospitals where women are not forced to give birth without anesthetics, where the wounded are not condemned to die for lack of electricity.And above all, Gaza needs the world to see Palestinians as people – people deserving of life, freedom and solidarity.While international support is crucial, it cannot come with strings that undermine Palestinian sovereignty. Foreign aid should not be conditioned on accepting foreign control. It should not be leveraged to force political concessions or normalize relations with an occupying power. True solidarity means supporting Palestinian-led reconstruction without imposing external agendas.The February letter from Arab foreign ministers to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, speaks of implementing “a plan to realize the two-state solution”. However, any plan must begin with recognizing Palestinian agency. Without meaningful Palestinian participation, without respecting our right to choose our own political future, such plans remain hollow gestures. And expecting Palestinians to accept a solution from those who attempted to erase them completely is like asking the wounded to trust the hand that still holds the bloody knife.The challenges ahead are enormous, but so is Palestinian determination. As Israel continues to bomb starving Palestinians, their refusal to abandon our land isn’t stubbornness but existence itself. As Israel continues to murder Palestinian journalists, likeHossam Shabat, we will make sure the world not only sees their crimes, but remembers them. In the face of those who would make our lives impossible, we will continue to find ways to remain. We will rebuild not according to someone else’s vision but according to our own needs and aspirations.This rebuilding is more than reconstruction – it is resistance. It is our refusal to be erased, our determination to remain and our unwavering belief in our right to exist on our land. Nothing is more important than staying. Nothing is more revolutionary than returning. And nothing is more certain than that we will rebuild Palestine with our own hands, for our own people, on our own terms.Ahmad Ibsais is a first-generation Palestinian American, law student and poet who writes the newsletter State of SiegeExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaUS politicsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

A succession of prime ministers have come andgoneat dizzying speed. A snap election last July, foolishly called by Mr Macron in the hope of seeing off Marine Le Pen’s far right National Rally (RN), almostcatapultedit into power. None of that drama, however, remotely rivalled the coup de theatre delivered on Monday in a courtroom rather than a voting booth.Thedecisionby Paris judges to bar Ms Le Pen from standing for office for five years, having found her guilty of embezzling public funds while an MEP, has spectacularly shaken up a political landscape dominated by the far-right threat. Ahead of presidential elections in 2027 – in which Mr Macron cannot run – Ms Le Pen had become the candidate to beat, using her experience to exploit deepening discontent with the political mainstream. In a genuine bombshell moment, it now seems likely that a replacement – probably her youthful protege,Jordan Bardella, who is yet to turn 30 – will be obliged to step in.At a time when the rule of law is beingunderminedby populist leaders who view an independent judiciary as a threat, the judges’ verdict has drawn a necessary and salutary line in the sand. Although she will appeal against the ban, Ms Le Pen was caught bang to rights. Showing characteristic contempt for the European Union’s institutions, as well as taxpayers’ money, she and her cronies illegally siphoned off about €4.5m (£3.8m) to fuel their party’s domestic rise between 2004 and 2016. A fake jobs system, with Ms Le Pen at its heart, facilitated embezzlement on an industrial scale. Beginning after her election as an MEP and continuing once she became party leader, it merited exemplary punishment.The political consequences of the court decision, although undoubtedly seismic, are harder to read. The fines imposed on the RN will do serious damage to its finances and ability to campaign. But inevitably, a martyrdom narrative will now be deployed to bolster the far right’s anti-establishment credentials. In the immediate aftermath of Ms Le Pen’s ban, Mr Bardella duly lamented that French democracy had been “executed” by an “unjust” verdict. Amid assorted messages of far-right solidarity, Elon Musk waspredictablyto the fore, echoing the same theme.Among sections of an electorate that already take a highlyjaundicedview of governing elites, playing the victim could produce political dividends. But those charged with delivering justice in liberal democracies cannot be concerned with such calculations. The current level of Ms Le Pen’s political support does not place her above the law, and nor was it appropriate for it to play any part in the reasoning of the judges. A leader willing to facilitate systematic corruption in political processes for more than a decade deserves to forfeit the right to seek the honour of her country’s highest office.More plot twists are certain. It is still possible, though unlikely, that a successful series of appeals will allow Ms Le Pen a way to get back into the presidential race. If, on the other hand, the leading member of Europe’s most notorious far-right dynasty has blown her chance of power, she only has herself to blame.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How ministers plan to deal with the £5.2bn debt that will reappear on balance sheets in a year – having been temporarily hidden by the Conservatives – is unknown. But doing nothing is not an option.Thealarming mismatchbetween the steeply rising need for special education and the budgets allocated to pay for it is one of the biggest challenges facing the government – with at least 18 councils at risk of insolvency. For families caught in the middle, the consequences can be devastating. Children waiting years for autism and other assessments, or for suitable placements, have their lives placed on hold. A system of grants that was meant to support councils to redesign services, and reduce spending, has mostly failed.There is no short answer to the question of what went wrong. But reforms brought in under David Cameron are responsible for pitting families against councils in the struggle for additional support – while central government sits on the sidelines. Budgets have consistently risen, so this is not a story of austerity in a simple sense. Between 2015-16 and 2024-25,high‑needs fundingin England rose by 59% or £4bn to nearly £11bn. The number of children with education, health and care plans more than doubled, to 576,000.But shrinking public spending has intensified pressures on schools – for example, the rising number ofchildren who are not “school-ready”when they arrive, and families needing help with food and clothes.Reductions in teaching assistantsand support staff have also had an impact. Conservative reforms that downgraded the arts, promoted exams and made academic standards the overwhelming priority, incentivised headteachers to focus on attainment above all else. The fact that summer-born children, particularly boys, areover-represented among the Send cohort, means age and sex differences must also be considered. Is the current curriculum unsuited to some of the youngest children in a year group?In some areas, independent special schools costing up to £61,500 a year are responsible for a growing share of council spending. This diversion of public money to private providers is the wrong solution, as in thechildren’s social care sector. But while an expected push for inclusion in mainstream schools should be welcomed, Bridget Phillipson will need to show this is more than a cost-saving exercise. Above all, she must ensure that identifying pupils’ needs is not framed as a problem. While the rise in mental health conditions in young people is hugely concerning, improved understanding and awareness of autism and neurodiversity is beneficial.If councils were allowed to go bankrupt, a whole range of services would be at risk – along with the vulnerable residents who depend on them. Clearly, this is a scenario that must be avoided. But writing off the existing debt, which is one option open to the government, would not resolve the issue of rising needs in future. Perhaps the real challenge for Labour is to enable an honest debate that recognises the difficulties faced by families, schools and councils. If special needs provision requires reform, so does the wider education system in which so many children do not thrive.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I work for an ICB and generally support the government’s view that the NHS needs reform. Therecent reportby Lord Darzi made it clear that substantial changes are necessary, and I, and thousands of my colleagues, recognise that it is vital that changes are made.With all this said, the newly announced cuts are alarming for everyone. To put it into perspective, last year ICBs completed a round of 30% cuts, in real terms, for which they were given two years to complete. The newly announced 50% cut has apparently to take place before December this year. Two weeks on from the revelation of these planned cuts, ICBs have no further information to enable them to take action. No vision for what our remit will cover, what’s in and what’s out of the 50% cuts, or who will pick up the tasks we can no longer afford to perform.My colleagues remain pragmatic, but the lack of knowledge about what the system is expected to look like at the end of these cuts is causing tremendous concern. At the core of what we do is patient care. The bottom line is that we simply do not know how the same level of patient care can be maintained while such deep cuts are being prioritised at such speed.My colleagues are good people trying hard to their best for patients, but we are not magicians. If we are to make these changes we need reasonable timescales and a clear vision for the service. Without that, patients will inevitably feel the pain.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I firstpresented the bill in 2020to lock the UK’s climate and biodiversity commitments into law. Labour backed its ambition in 2023, yet whipsblocked it in January.The bill could centre nature’s importance across decision-making. Instead, billions have been found to prop up flawed carbon-capture technology, while the co-benefits of investing in nature-based solutions – like reforestation, peatlands, wetlands and regenerative farming – are sidelined.Thecutsto the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, even with a boost to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, ignore the interconnections of climate and nature plans, risking both. This siloed approach, mirrored in Labour’s cuts to international aid and a pause to nature-friendly farming payments, must end.The solution? To deliver the joined-up legislative framework we need to weave climate and nature across Labour’s cross-governmental missions. And that means making time to advance the climate and nature bill.Caroline LucasGreen MP for Brighton Pavilion, 2010-24Rachel Reeves emphasised her desire “to get people back to work”, but gave no hint of what form that work would take. One country-wide job creation scheme that could be delivered over the next few years would be for the government to double the£6.6bn already committedin its election manifesto to itswarm homes planfor improving energy efficiency.This massive increase in investment could be funded by the government announcing the cancellation of further investment in nuclear power. Our report,Redirect Sizewell C funding to warm homes, shows that about £40bn will be spent over the next 15 years on this nuclear white elephant. Were it to be scrapped now, this could free up more than £7bn by 2030.This huge redirection of funds would generate long-term, secure jobs, particularly for young people across the UK. It could be quick to implement, so by the next election, homes across the country will be warmer, healthier and with reduced energy bills. This widespread improvement in living conditions, and the generation of jobs in every constituency, could improve Labour’s currently diminishing chances of winning the next election.Colin HinesGreen New Deal GroupAlison DownesStop Sizewell CExplore more on these topicsGreen economySpring statement 2025LabourGreen partySizewell CCaroline LucasNuclear powerlettersShareReuse this content"

If Arsenal go on a winning run this could take Liverpool into May even without dropping any points, but if Mikel Arteta’s side lose their next three it could all be over as soon as 13 April, when Liverpool play West Ham at home. In the immediate future a couple of teams in particular could go a long way towards deciding things: Arsenal host Fulham and visit Everton in their fixtures this week, while Liverpool host Everton and visit Fulham. Even beyond those games the sides have comparable fixtures this month – neither will play a current top-half team – but Arsenal also have two Champions League fixtures against Real Madrid to deal with and must close the gap before the start of May.From Sels to Salah: a Premier League best XI of the season so farRead moreChampions LeagueThis looks like being a curious month in the race for European qualification, with every one of the 34 fixtures scheduled to be played by teams currently in the Premier League’s top seven over the course of April (as well as another two which need to be rearranged after Manchester City and Nottingham Forest qualified for the FA Cup semi-finals) pitting them against teams currently outside that group. This is to be followed by an epic, hold-on-to-your-hats month of May in which a third of their 21 games will be against each other, though by then there may be less on the line.When it is all over it looks increasingly likely that the top five teams will qualify for the Champions League, with England in pole position to snaffle one of the two bonus places offered by Uefa to the continent’s most successful nations. As of 31 March England topped this season’s rankings on 24.25 points, ahead of Spain with 21.678 and Italy with 19.937, with Germany another couple of points behind. With five teams still involved and accumulating points compared with Germany’s and Italy’s three, and despite tough Champions League draws for Arsenal and Aston Villa (who face Paris Saint-Germain), England looks more likely to extend its lead than to be overhauled.View image in fullscreenThe last time Nottingham Forest were in the Champions League was in 1980, when they were defending champions.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesManchester City are precariously positioned in fifth, one point ahead of Newcastle and Brighton and a mere four better off than Bournemouth in an apparently distant 10th. The extent ofErling Haaland’s ankle injurycould have a big impact. But they also have the kindest fixture list, with only two of their last nine games against teams currently in the top half – and those are Bournemouth andFulham, respectively 10th and eighth at the moment, who they play in their final two outings (though they also have to negotiate a potentially tricky derby at Old Trafford this Sunday).Villa, Tottenham and Manchester United will also hope to secure Champions League places by winning either the Champions League (in Villa’s case) or the Europa League. They play their quarter-final ties in the weeks of 7 and 14 April.Other European placesNewcastle are the first English side to secure a place in European competition for next season, snaffling a spot in the Conference League playoff stage bywinning the Carabao Cup, though it will become up for grabs again if they qualify through the league for one of Uefa’s more prestigious competitions.View image in fullscreenEddie Howe has helped secure a European spot for Newcastle after guiding them to a Carabao Cup win.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe number of teams still able to qualify for Europe by other means than league performance makes this a blurry and confusing picture: Chelsea would qualify for the Europa League if they win the Conference League, Arsenal could win the Champions League, Tottenham and Manchester United are in the Europa League, Aston Villa could win either the Champions League or the FA Cup, which would earn them a Europa League place, while Nottingham Forest, Manchester City and Crystal Palace also remain in the FA Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All that can be said with certainty is that at least one Europa League place will be allocated through final league positions, most likely to the side that finish sixth (unless they also win a cup).RelegationThe good news for Southampton, in last place with only nine points, is that when it comes to the earliest Premier League relegations they are not even going to end up with a podium finish. The bad news is their fate could be sealed by the end of the week: two defeats plus a pair of wins for Wolves would end their survival hopes. And Derby’s Premier League record low points tally – 11 in 2007-08 – remains under threat.Wolves, 17th and with the next-worst side eight points above them, are the team the bottom three sides will all be hoping to catch. But not only is their form decent – only five teams have outperformed the three wins and a draw they have claimed in the past six games, while the bottom three have one win, and four points, between them – so are their fixtures. Wolves played every one of the current top seven in their first nine games, a disastrously difficult run which they ended with two points, and now it is time for cosmic payback: they play only two of them in their last nine, a run they start with a home game against the side immediately above them, West Ham, and a trip to the team immediately below them, Ipswich.Two wins there and the fate of the current bottom three may be all but sealed, particularly as the fixture list looks much less kind for Ipswich and 19th-placed Leicester, both of whom play three top-six sides and only one from the bottom half – Wolves in both cases – this month. A David Moyes-inspired revival has hauled Everton clear of all but the faintest relegation worries but spare a thought for them; they play the current top five in their next five games.PosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool2942702Arsenal2929583Nottm Forest2914544Chelsea2916495Man City2915486Newcastle289477Brighton296478Fulham295459Aston Villa29-44510AFC Bournemouth29124411Brentford2954112Crystal Palace2833913Man Utd29-33714Tottenham Hotspur29123415Everton29-43416West Ham29-163417Wolverhampton29-182618Ipswich29-341719Leicester29-401720Southampton29-499Explore more on these topicsPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last week, Ingrid, who is now 18, told the court she had been “whipped” in the face with a wet towel after her father had refused to let her play outside with friends.However Gjert insisted that while he regretted the incident, his towel had only made contact with her finger.“I’m drying my neck with a towel,” Gjert told the court in Sandnes, Norway. “She’s really angry and says: ‘I fucking don’t want to be in this prison of yours any more,’ while holding her index finger at me.“I pull the towel against her finger twice in quick succession. She then says: ‘What the hell are you doing, are you hitting me?’ To which I reply: ‘I didn’t hit you.’Pressed by the judge about whether it really was only the finger that was struck, Gjert replied. “Yes, given the distance we were standing at, and the size of the towel, nothing else would be possible.”View image in fullscreenJakob Ingebrigtsen in court with his legal counsel Mette Yvonne Larsen and lawyer Veslemoy Aga last week.Photograph: Lise Åserud/ReutersLast week the court was shown a photograph of a red mark on Ingrid’s face following the incident, but Gjert suggested it may have been caused by “acne or a skin reaction”. He said that all his children had suffered from a similar condition when they were “agitated or sad”.Asked whether he got the impression the blow had hurt, Gjert added: “No, I think it hurt both of us. And I think the ‘hurt’ wasn’t physical. I think it was much more emotional. She was very disappointed, sad and scared all at once that I could do what I did.”Gjert also admitted that he had found it “extremely difficult to accept my own actions” and made it clear he missed his daughter, who has not lived with her parents since.“I miss her every day,” he said. “She is the last thing I think about when I go to bed at night, and the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning. The loss is extreme.”Gjert also denied claims made in court last week that he had kicked Jakob off a scooter when the Tokyo 1500m and Paris 5,000m Olympic champion was eight or nine.“It is completely unthinkable that I would have kicked him,” he said. “It is completely out of the question to kick one of my children.”Gjert, who also denied that he had pushed Jakob so hard that he flew several metres after a row over an iPad, painted a negative picture of his son as he and Ingrid watched on in court.“Jakob has been a privileged boy his whole life, he’s been allowed to do and say whatever he wants,” he said. “He’s almost been carried on a golden chair his whole life. There have been different opinions related to the discussions, without a doubt. But nothing physical.”Gjert said that while he coached Jakob, his son was constantly telling him how “useless, ignorant and hopeless” he was. And that, before he won his first Olympic gold medal in Tokyo, Jakob would tell him: “Dad is an idiot who is going to ruin everything.”The 59-year-old coach told the court he was so opposed to violence that he had told his children they should not play video games such as Counter Strike and Grand Theft Auto.“I have spent a lot of time implementing non-violence in my children’s upbringing,” he said. “Violence is not a solution to anything.”“There was a constant argument and discussion about their constant urge to play these games with elements of violence,” added Gjert, who said that on one occasion he had thrown the PlayStation out of the window and on to the asphalt in the courtyard.The trial, which is due to last until 16 May, continues.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

The Czech, who had just reached the boys’ singles final at the Australian Open, was invited byNovak Djokovic, his idol, to train together at the Serb’s academy in Belgrade. The pair quickly established a rapport, with Djokovic offering advice and counsel. For Mensik, this was a pivotal moment.On Sunday, at the Miami Open, the pair stood across the net from each other again, this time as rivals, and he closed out a 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) victory to win his first ATP title in one of the top tournaments.Novak Djokovic falls short of 100th title as Jakub Mensik, 19, wins Miami Open finalRead moreIt was an immense performance from the teenager, who continued to dominate behind his enormous, precise first serve and he was fearless and attacking throughout, particularly in the tie-breaks.His breakthrough run included beating three top-eight players – Jack Draper (No 7), Taylor Fritz (No 4) and Djokovic (No 5). There is no doubt he has marked himself as a future grand-slam contender.For his 37-year-old one-time mentor, this result is far more difficult to parse. It is impossible to ignore the sorry physical state Djokovic was in before the match, which was significantly delayed due to rain. He emerged for his warm-up sporting a dramatically swollen right eye and he repeatedly attempted to treat the apparent infection with eye drops.Although the treatment appeared to help somewhat, it was not entirely surprising that Djokovic seemed off early in the match, dropping his opening service game and trailing by a break for much of the opening set. Afterwards, he graciously opted out of discussing his physical problems and only he knows how much it affected him.As he settled into the final, Djokovic did produce a positive level in a quality match from all involved. Against an opponent who could do no wrong, however, he was uncharacteristically meek when the match was on the line in both tie-breaks.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic has yet to win a tournament since Andy Murray became his coach in January before the Australian Open.Photograph: Leonardo Fernandez/Getty ImagesWhile that timidity under pressure is uncharacteristic, he has become more familiar with those sensations. Histriumph at the Paris Olympic Games, where he willed himself to win the one title that had evaded him, remains the anomalous result in his past 16 months on tour. It is his only title sincethe ATP Finals in 2023, which closed off one of his most dominant years. His milestone 100th title continues to evade him.As seen by his solid run through the tournament, which he navigated without dropping a set until the final, the winner of 24 singles grand slam titles is still capable of quality play, but the standards he has set are so high that it is increasingly difficult to maintain them. A talented young player, such as Mensik, unscarred by Djokovic’s greatness, unlike the previous generation, absolutely should enjoy the challenge of facing him.Thirty-seven is an interesting age. This is the point by which many legends have begun to slow down. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal won their final grand slam at 36. Serena Williams won her last major aged 35, although her difficulties were far greater after giving birth to her daughter, Olympia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The positive news is that the schedule should offer him more opportunities to return to winning ways. In recent weeks, the ATP has been in total disarray and the draws are unusually open.So many of the top players – Carlos Alcaraz, Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev, Taylor Fritz and Andrey Rublev – have been struggling for various reasons. Even though Jannik Sinner has only competed at the Australian Open this year and is in the middle of a three-month ban, he maintains a comfortable lead in the ATP race.The next significant tournament arrives quickly, with the Monte Carlo Masters marking the start of the red-clay season on Sunday. For Djokovic, there will be more obstacles ahead, but as he tries to hold his own at the top of the sport for as long as he can, this is also a challenge he should relish.Explore more on these topicsNovak DjokovicTennisUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

I’ll be there supporting my team or I’ll be in my team. Whatever it is, there’s no way you can miss the World Cup 2025.”We are deep in an interview that began at seven o’clock on a sleepy Monday morning in England, eight o’clock that evening in New Zealand, and Tui is flying. The most charismatic woman in world rugby has lit up the past 40 minutes with her powerful personal story and electrifying presence. It is a reminder of how she did the same in November 2022, at Eden Park in Auckland, soon after New Zealand’sBlack Ferns had beaten England 34-31in the greatest game in the history of women’s rugby.As she savoured victory in a gripping World Cup final – the only occasion England have lost in their past 53 games – Tui was interviewed on the pitch. “How was it New Zealand?” she cried out to nearly 43,000 fans. “How was it? They said no one cared about women’s rugby, but guess what? We are here, we’re going nowhere.”Ellie Kildunne scores quickfire hat-trick in England’s 11-try rout of WalesRead moreShe then led the crowd in a rousing rendition of a Māori folk song,Tūtira Mai Ngā Iwi, like a great conductor celebrating at a post-concert party. Tui looked nothing like the stoical young girl she had been when, in her family’s deeply troubled past, she survived life as the daughter of an alcoholic father and a mother whose new relationship was scarred by harrowing physical and emotional abuse.There were often times when her dad, with whom she remains close, would leave her in his parked car for hours while he drank in the pub or took drugs at house parties. She witnessed the death of one of his friends from a drug overdose.Tui started drinking when she was 10. She thought it would bind her more closely to her dad while she ached for her mum, who was assaulted repeatedly by a subsequent partner.The 33-year-old winger is an inspirational figure in New Zealand and her return to the game after a break coincides with the clamour for her to be selected for the Black Ferns’ World Cup squad. She explains how, at the age of 18, watching the 2010 women’s World Cup in England transformed her. To play in the same tournament in England 15 years later has become a consuming ambition.“So many things have happened in my life that I now think anything’s possible,” she says. “To make it to another World Cup would be a dream. I’ve been very open with the coach [Allan Bunting] and said that whatever capacity he wants me in I will be there.”View image in fullscreenRuby Tui poses for a selfie with fans after the Black Ferns’ 2021 Rugby World Cup final win against England.Photograph: Fiona Goodall/World Rugby/Getty ImagesTui is the leading try scorer in Super Rugby Aupiki this season with Chiefs Manawa. But she says: “I will be happy to run on the field with the water bottles because to make the World Cup, and end up on that Twickenham paddock, would be beyond my wildest dreams. You start out thinking your wildest dreams can’t come true. But if you work on your mind, your mental resilience, way more can come true.”She pauses and then says: “Mental resilience is just as important as physical preparation and, for that, you’ve got to draw on whatever happened in your journey.”In her 2022 autobiography, Tui writes with graphic honesty about the trauma she experienced as a girl and how rugby saved her from the derangement and violence. Remembering the 2010 World Cup, she writes: “I can honestly say that watching the Black Ferns, seeing them on the screen, seeing that they were real, changed my life. The memory came back to me of Canvastown [where she and her mum lived with a brutal man], the dark Wakamarina River, the unhappiness, the screaming that went on all the time.”She shakes her head and says now: “Boy, oh boy. The 2010 Rugby World Cup in England was huge for me. The final was not held at the main Twickenham stadium. It was at the Stoop [across the road] and that tiny detail is so significant to me now. This year the final will be at Twickenham. But the tenacity of those women in 2010 blew me away. I knew some of them personally and they all had full-time work. I still don’t understand how they made it happen, but I draw huge inspiration from them.”Women’s Rugby World Cup 2025 draw: champions New Zealand to face IrelandRead moreWhile Tui marvels at the capacity of her predecessors to hold down ordinary jobs while playing elite rugby, at that same time she was paying her own way through university by working more than 80 hours a week – starting most days at 4am as a postwoman, working as a lifeguard in the afternoon and doing night shifts at a bar while also trying to attend lectures and study.“I needed the money so I took every single job I could,” she says with a grin. “But the cool thing was I ended in rugby-playing circles with some of the Black Ferns. I was like: ‘Why aren’t these amazing stories more widely known?’ I often think of the next superstars who will have hugely different careers to us – they will be full-time professionals from the get-go. But my journey definitely keeps me grounded.”Tui addresses the past with acceptance and forgiveness and, even though she was once so distraught she considered ending her life when a teenager, she turned her distress into a book of redemption. How did her parents feel when they read such a jolting account of their past? “Dad’s way more casual but Mum had to relive every page, which I understand. She’s a very wordy and intellectual person.View image in fullscreenRuby Tui is racking up the tries for Chiefs Manawa this season.Photograph: Phil Walter/Getty Images“When I started the book I thought it would be about rugby. But I was chatting to the ghostwriter, Margaret [Thomson], and yarning about my childhood. She was going: ‘What do you mean? Say that again.’“I was like: ‘Oh, is that interesting?’ But I then said: ‘I can’t print any of this unless Mum’s 100% OK about it.’ I then told my mum: ‘I’ll pull the plug on the book if you’re not happy.’ I wanted it to be collaborative but I said: ‘Mum, you can’t share this. I’ve got a contract [stipulating confidentiality].’”Tui smiles. “You know what mums are like. But she was anxious and went away to read the book. When she’d finished she sent me a message: “Ruby, you have to share this story.’ From that moment I felt a surge of energy, this huge support from my mum. She’d never realised that, as a kid, I saw her as an absolute hero. She also had no idea that as a young tween how directly my life was influenced by her decisions. As mother and daughter it felt like our story was being shared for all the women out there. That was really cool.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m a rugby player so I thought maybe I’d sit in a library. But we’d go to these cities and for five hours straight I’d be meeting people [at book signings]. Five hours straight of the most amazing, heartfelt, hard-hitting life stories.“There was one book signing in Auckland where you couldn’t see the end of the line. I don’t know how many hours they waited, but I remember some of the first people in that line. It was a mum and daughter and I was smiling while having my photo taken with them and I was like: ‘Thanks for waiting, guys.’ And [the mother’s] eyes were welling up and she goes: ‘Your story made me leave. We’ve just left him. Thank you.’”Tui shakes her head in dazed wonder. “Oh my goodness. I was just out trying to grow women’s‑rugby numbers. I had no idea what effect it would have on the world.”Her influence runs so deep that she is one of a group – including other former New Zealand internationals John Kirwan, Codie Taylor and Aaron Cruden –spearheading a campaign with Bupathat focuses on the physical and mental health experiences of New Zealand’s rugby elite. Each rugby icon chooses a word to represent them. While others selected “cancer” or “loss’, “depression” or “resilience”, Tui opted for something different.“I love this campaign so much because I know how vulnerable the others had to be to share their words. I went with “mind” because it’s so beautiful and means so much to me. One of the first psychologists I worked with talked about how we can’t be afraid of the mind gym. It clicked with me because mental fitness is something you have to work at every day.“This Bupa campaign is about normalising these conversations. ‘How can I use my mind? What did my mind do there?’ My mental skills coach recently explained that the more we allow our emotions to take control, the less access we have to our brain’s IQ. If we can learn to calm down, a higher percentage of our brain and our IQ, all of our greatness and logical thinking, will be accessible.”View image in fullscreenRuby Tui (top, second right) is one of the players taking part in a new campaign by Bupa and New Zealand Rugby showcasing the personal health and wellness journeys of New Zealand’s rugby elite.Photograph: Steven Boniface and BupaDoes her painful past still strengthen her today? “Absolutely. I always say to people: ‘It’s not like my journey was harder than yours. It’s just that throughout my journey I’ve felt things that have rocked me and therefore shaped me.’ It’s about awareness. I went through these things and I’m so grateful that I not only addressed them but I said: ‘How can I grow from it?’ What I’ve been through has been a huge tool for me.”Tui’s father is Samoan and her mother is white and she articulates the flaws and strengths of both cultures. In her book she writes: “This is the future of the world, the coming together of cultures.” But how does she feel about the world when people such as Donald Trump and Elon Musk are trying to divide and destroy?“I love that question,” Tui says with a throaty chuckle. “How great is it that we both live in different countries and we can have a little giggle? I’m like: ‘Surely these people are for our entertainment?’ But sometimes I do scratch my head.”The sport she loves, in contrast, gives her joy. Tui will almost certainly be a key character at the World Cup, but she offers a wider perspective. “Rugby has been this dream I never knew I had. I never thought I’d play this long, but rugby gives so much connection to so many authentic human beings.”Tui leans forward and adds: “As athletes we’re sometimes seen as these physical things that don’t have much emotion. But the truth is we are human after all. We are more than just our stats and physical records. Who we are as humans is hugely important.”Ruby Tui is supporting ‘Human After All: The Alternative Team Photo’.

Saturday’s second-biggest attendance in Spain had watched the country’s most passionate rivals train. Sunday’s biggest crowd saw them play, a record 58,538 fans still inside and still singing late into a night they’ll never forget. The Benito Villamarín was bouncing, smoke rising round the home fans as they belted out the club’s anthem –here we are, squashed together like cannon balls– as the players started a lap of honour. Somewhere in all the madness and the noise, Antony, stripped to the waist and sitting on the goalkeeper Adrián’s shoulders, heaved a giant flag through the air. “This is incredible,” he said, and it was.This was Antony’s first Seville derby and he’d not seen anything like it for years: never mind Ajax or Old Trafford, this took him back to Brazil. But it wasn’t just him, a debutant in a fixture that hits hard; nor had anyone else, the place going wild, something extra in the celebrations this time, Betis players still there half an hour after the end, parading round the pitch before bounding down corridors, singing and hammering at doors, cracking open the beers. You’d think they had won the Champions League. The one man there who has – five times – said that when it came to “feeling, vibrations, this is without doubt the most special game there is,” so Isco and his teammates celebrated something that, right there in the moment, felt even better: they had beaten rivals Sevilla 2-1.Marseille’s season is collapsing and Roberto De Zerbi is not helpingRead moreA goal down after Rubén Vargas’s opener on 17 minutes, Johnny Cardoso’s superb volley and Cucho Hernández’s sharp finish before half-time gave Betis a deserved victory, Diario de Sevilla concluding: “The best team wins the derby and that’s Betis.” Which, put like that, doesn’t sound dramatic or like all that much, but inside the Villamarín it sounded like everything, the pitch flooded at full time, people running everywhere and nowhere, leaping into each other’s arms.Marca described itas “total ecstasy”, Diario de Sevilla called it “euphoria in green and white”, ABC went for “passion dyed green” and they were all right. “Amazing,” Isco called it. “I’ve been at big clubs with incredible fans but never seen this,” Adrián insisted. “This is what this lovely sport gives us.”They had waited a long time for this. The last time Betis had won a derby in La Liga wasalmost seven years ago. That day, Joaquín Sánchez scored the only goal, aged 37. Afterwards he had declared: “I can leave football a happy man now.” In fact, it took him another four years to go. Now here he was, the player who reacted to one derby win by declaring there would befines for any footballerswhodidn’tstay out until 5am and the director now sitting in the box in a suit and tie before heading down to hug them too, another party about to start.View image in fullscreenBetis supporters greet the Sevilla coach outside the ground, before a game that divides the city.Photograph: Andres López Sheridan/SPP/ShutterstockThis derby is always a bit different, at least off the pitch – on it, in truth, it’s very often not very good, which was another reason why Sunday night’s clash was so good, so celebrated. Nowhere lives local rivalryquite like Seville, which has a population of 687,488 and two football clubs with over 90,000 members – third and fifth in Spain respectively – and 206 supporters’ clubs within the city. On Saturday 31,500 were at the Villamarín and 15,231 the Sánchez Pizjuán, three miles north, just to see them train.This, saidquite possibly the most ABC cover ever, was “a derby like God wills it”. Looking out from the front page, holding scarves, were Begoña Navia-Osorio, 84, and Isabel María Rus-Velázquez, 80: two nuns, one supported each side. It was Laetare Sunday, when lent is let go a little bit, and derby day, when the city lets go a lot. On Avenida de la Palmera, heading out of the centre of the city, from the banks of the Guadalquivir and towards Heliópolis, the church doors were open at the Parroquia Corpus Christi, sermons heard from the street, football shirts in the back row. Rejoice, Isaiah 66.10 says, and so they would.A couple of hundred metres further along, the stadium gates were opening too, kids on shoulders, waving flares as the bus edged its way the short distance to the Villamarín from the Al-Andalus hotel. On board, phones were held up to blacked-out windows. “I recorded people crying with emotion,” Isco admitted. Inside the ground, every seat had a green Betis flag laid upon it. Well, almost every seat: in the Sevilla end, fans who had been walked there past the hospital, where they applauded patients watching from the windows, held Betis flags too but these were white, the badge crossed out. And in the main stand, a couple of early arrivers –yes, you– filled their bags before everyone else took their seats.On the pitch, it kicked off before it even kicked off, the first confrontation sparked when someone from Sevilla’s coaching staff pushed over a ballboy gathering up the balls after the warm-up. A giant banner covered the south stand: two angels crowning the Betis badge from 1919-22, a line borrowed fromAntonio Rodríguez-Buzón’s poem to the Macarena. And then, as it fell, they played. This was a game for hot hearts and cool heads, the Betis coach Manuel Pellegrini had said. Betis are the better side, a team with better players and on a better run, winning five matches in a row while Sevilla had won two in eight. But, well, it’s a derby and Betis had not won any of the last 12. If there was one thing Pellegrini was concerned about it was the desperation to end that run.View image in fullscreenJohnny Cardoso celebrates after equalising alongside Isco (left).Photograph: Julio Munoz/EPAWhen Sevilla opened the scoring on 17 minutes, Dodi Lukebakio setting up a superb goal for Vargas, that fear might have felt even more real: Betis had not come back from a goal down to win a derby at home since 1940. “Nah, it was all under control,” Adrián said afterwards. He was joking, but he was also right, Betis breaking that run in a way that seemed almost easy, taking control and the lead before half-time.Pablo Fornals and Cardoso dominated the middle. Sevilla couldn’t handle Hernández, the striker whose record since joining reads: played six, won six. Jesús Rodríguez, 19 years old,a hint of Joaquín about him, flew up the left. Despite slipping often and changing his boots twice – “I’m going to have to speak to Puma” – Antony was always an outlet on the other side, a player who says “I have found myself here” and who Isco insisted “has changed us”. So much so that Isco reckoned he would “have to do one of those crowdfunding things to see if we can keep him for another year at least”.As for Isco – the man who described Betis as “my light in the darkness”, revived and rescued fromsix months out of footballwhich had felt permanent – his assist for Hernández’s to score Betis’ second goal just before half-time was gorgeous: a touch so soft he could have been playing in slippers, and a perfect portrait of his play. “He’s a superstar,” Antony said, gazing at him like a smitten teenager.View image in fullscreenAdrián and Antony celebrate in style.Photograph: Fran Santiago/Getty ImagesWhen that goal went in, substitutes came sprinting on from the bench; at the end, they did too, joined it seemed by the entire staff of the club, the pitch suddenly full of people. Antony, who had just performed a rainbow flick down in the corner, was racing up the line, leading one last attack when he realised they had done it. He tore off his shirt and roared, pointed at the pitch:this is my place now. Isco and Gio Lo Celso embraced Pellegrini. Marc Bartra gestured to the badge. Someone whacked on Freed from Desire, loud. Cucho climbed into the crowd, Chimy Ávila running after him. They paraded a green cuddly toylike a child of their own. Adrián lifted Antony on to his shoulders, and off they went.For much of Sunday night there had only been one team on the pitch, now, past 11pm, there really was. Sevilla had disappeared up the tunnel defeated, “swallowing poison” in their captain’s words and leaving 600 supporters waiting high in the north stand, where they refused to simply stand silent. Betis stayed, holding on to this, their fans loving every moment, stands shaking. The anthem went on. Freed from Desire got an encore. Beyond finals, it is genuinely hard to recall a post-match celebration like it. A long time later, they were still tooting out on Avenida de la Palmera.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowAlavés 0-2 Rayo Vallecano, Athletic Bilbao 0-0 Osasuna, Barcelona 4-1 Girona, Espanyol 1-1 Atlético Madrid, Getafe 1-2 Villarreal, Real Betis 2-1 Sevilla, Real Madrid 3-2 Leganés, Real Sociedad 2-1 Real Valladolid, Valencia 1-0 MallorcaMondayCelta Vigo v Las Palmas (8pm BST)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.This was a first derby win in the league under Pellegrini and although he was justifiably swift to note that his Betis side had beaten Sevilla in the cup – “and without that wewouldn’t have won the trophy” – he admitted they owed a debt to their fans. “Winning the derby can never be the sole objective,” he said, insisting that what really mattered was three more points towards a Champions League place. Isco too talked about “getting those little stars on our sleeves”, calling this “a win that allows us to dream of big things”. Their sixth in a row in the league, it leaves them sixth but level on points with fifth-place Villarreal.But in that moment, boy, did it feel like more, on the last derby night before Betis have to abandon their Villamarín home for a couple of years, as building work gets under way. “It’s going to be a long night: I hope there’s a celebration befitting this,” Rodríguez said. “It’s a night for wine or champagne or whatever,” Adrián reckoned; he had shed a tear or two, and he knew he wasn’t alone. “I feel very emotional: what I have lived in Seville this week I have never lived anywhere else,” Hernández said. “Tonight we will celebrate because we deserve it.” As the place finally emptied, Isco and Antonyshared a beer, their work here done for now. “Making people happy is what this sport is for,” Isco said.PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona2954662Real Madrid2933633Atletico Madrid2924574Athletic Bilbao2922535Villarreal2812476Real Betis294477Rayo Vallecano292408Mallorca29-7409Celta Vigo2803910Real Sociedad29-43811Sevilla29-63612Getafe2913613Girona29-83414Osasuna29-93415Valencia29-143116Espanyol28-132917Alaves29-122718Leganes29-182719Las Palmas28-152520Valladolid29-4616Explore more on these topicsReal BetisLa LigaSevillaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler or Ben Foakes: who should keep wicket for England’s Test team?That debate has lost relevance. When Jamie Smith went on paternity leave for the tour of New Zealand at the end of last year, Essex’s Jordan Cox was his replacement. WhenCox fractured his thumbbefore the series, Durham’s Ollie Robinson was next on the call sheet, though Ollie Pope ended up with the gloves for all three Tests. A younger crowd has moved in to take the space, Foakes and Bairstow having been left out after last year’s tour of India.Surrey’s Dom Sibley: ‘We’ve got an unbelievable side. It drives standards’Read more“It’s quite clear that they’re moving on,” Foakes says. “All throughout my career I’ve had the England thing – even if I’m picked or not, I’ve had that as my main focus and drive. Those shitty days that you don’t want to be in the gym or whatever it might be, that’s your thing that keeps you going.“When I got dropped this time it felt like them moving on from the me, Jos, Jonny sort of thing. That felt like the end so that’s a difficult position mentally to be in, in terms of what is your next step to keep you trying to perform.”Foakes’s career has been intertwined with Buttler and Bairstow, but has also taken a different shape. The other two are white-ball kings who were trying to make it work across all three forms, glovework not as vital as their batting. Foakes provides fewer pyrotechnics in the middle, but is the finest keeper of the three, finding love from the aesthetes if not the selectors.Namedplayer of the series against Sri Lankain late 2018 –he hit an innings-rescuing century on debutin the first Test – Foakes was discarded after two matches in the Caribbean a couple of months later. He got a consistent run in 2022 and impressed after Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes took charge, playing responsible parent at No 7 to the amped-up kids before him. The reward was a ton againstSouth Africa at Old Trafford.View image in fullscreenBen Foakes’s keeping skills have never been in doubt.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesBut he was dropped for the following year’s Ashes, the returning Bairstow taking his spot after Harry Brook had become undroppable. Foakes’s lightning hands were required up to the stumps on Indian turners at the start of 2024, but England moved on to Smith. The current, and possibly final, balance is 25 Tests, with a batting average of 29.2 requiring dissection. Only six of those matches were at home, where he averaged 40, and he was never granted the opportunity to bat above seven.“My career’s never been smooth,” Foakes says. “It’s almost like if I’ve done badly, I’ve been picked or dropped. If I’ve done well, I’ve been picked or dropped. I don’t think I ever felt like I was a go-to guy they were going to give a run, so that in a way made it easier because I knew at some stage – or at any stage – it was happening. Every tour I got picked on, I wasn’t expecting it. It was more of a blessing than expectancy.“Last summer was probably when I thought I might get a run. But that sums up my England career. When I thought I might, I didn’t. When I thought I wouldn’t, I did. Mentally, I knew at any stage it could happen and I accepted that.”He sensed the drop last year when he was not withdrawn by England from aCounty Championshipfixture for Surrey. “A little while before, we were told anyone that was going to play in the Test summer was going to be pulled out from that game,” says Foakes. “And Gus [Atkinson] and Popey [Ollie Pope] got pulled out, and I wasn’t. I knew before I got called. Baz called me, just a little 10-second chat, explained I was dropped and then that was it.” What was the explanation? “They wanted someone that packed more punch down the order.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While confirmation of the 32-year-old’s place in the queue came in New Zealand, there is some respite in knowing where he stands after all that time as an in-and-out player.“Just the number of years I went through that, every summer just not knowing – it takes a toll on you mentally,” says Foakes. “It can stop you enjoying your cricket, just because there’s so much stress constantly involved in it.“It would usually be every series, I’m getting stressed out about whether I’m getting picked or not. Or if someone got injured, do I need to practise? Whereas when they picked Jordan, and then Ollie, I was like: ‘Well that’s done.’ Obviously, not a nice feeling, but at the same time it was like: ‘I don’t have to worry about that any more or for the time being.’”Foakes’s drive has subsequently shifted; if the Test career is over, “a new challenge” or “next step” is needed to keep him ticking. Winning championships at Surrey remains a motivation, but having been red-ball focused for so long – Foakes has played one Twenty20 match since 2020 – he has been working on his white-ball skills over the winter and wants to see where that takes him. “Whether it works out or not, at least I’ve got that challenge.”There could be a return to the Blast this summer and he will definitely be involved in another championship fight as Surrey bid for four in a row. He will probably come up againstBairstow, who has a new job captaining Yorkshire’s red-ball side.

This has occurred as a result of significant sums of money owed to the chairman’s businesses which has in turn impacted on the club’s immediate cashflow.“The chairman is working hard to resolve this situation at the earliest possible opportunity and in the meantime thanks everyone for their patience and understanding.”Chansiri, part of a family which controls the Thai Union Group, the world’s largest producer of canned tuna, headed a consortium which bought Sheffield Wednesday in January 2015 for £37.5m from previous owner Milan Mandaric. It is not the first time during his time in charge that players have been paid late while there have also been a number of other financial challenges.Wednesday sold their Hillsborough stadium to Chansiri for about £60m in July 2019 to ensure they did not breach spending rules while in October 2023 Chansiri appealed to fans to raise £2m to help the club pay an outstanding debt to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and cover wages.

He will replace an acting CEO who has been keeping the seat warm after an earlier pick for the role had second thoughts.He will also arrive at the day-to-day helm of the Jockey Club, a self-elected body which operates under a Royal Charter, after what can only be describedas a difficult six-year spellat Reach, the publisher of the Mirror, Daily Express and Daily Star among many others, and at a time when attendance at the Cheltenham festival, the biggest revenue generator by far on the racecourse arm’s balance sheet, is in a sudden, steep decline.And, perhaps most significantly, Mullen is also the first Jockey Club CEO with a background in the gambling industry. In this sense, his recruitment echoes the arrival of Martin Cruddace – also a former employee of Mirror Group Newspapers, oddly enough, albeit in the dim and distant past – to head up Arena Racing Company (ARC), Britain’s other major racecourse operator alongside Jockey Club Racecourses (JCR), after stints as a senior executive at Betfair and as chief executive of the Association of British Bookmakers.Mullen joined William Hill in 2010 as chief operating officer and later spent three years from March 2015 as CEO of Ladbrokes Coral. As a result of his time on the other side of the fence, as it were, he will be intimately acquainted with the detail of precisely how much the racing sector of their business is worth to the bookies.Cruddace is widely believed to have used a similar industry background to seal an impressively lucrative media rights deal from online firms who stream racing from ARC tracks. JCR is currently getting a smaller slice of online turnover, despite staging the vast majority of British racing’s most popular races and events.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowLingfield:2.02 Charlie Mason 2.32 Mandana 3.02 Disclosure 3.38 Dance Time (nb) 4.13 War Hawk 4.48 Port Road 5.20 Midnightattheoasis (nap).Fakenham:2.10 Summerleaze 2.40 Kelijoe 3.10 Rock On Rita 3.45 Jongleur D’Etoiles 4.20 Busy Being Busy 4.55 Red Delta.Kempton:2.22 Go West 2.52 Character Testing 3.22 Demoiselle Kap 3.55 Flegmatik 4.30 Lions Peak 5.05 Viroflay.Wolverhampton:5.25 Disquietude 6.00 Could Be The Move 6.30 Nobleman 7.00 Dicko The Legend 7.30 Rumba Bay 8.00 Kondratiev Wave 8.30 I Can’t Believe.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Cruddace’s deal was such a good one for his tracks that Paddy Power and SkyBet briefly threatened to scrub a meeting at one of ARC’s courses from their websites last year, while calling for “a conversation about media rights”, but a stiff letter from ARC’s lawyers was enough to bring them swiftly back into line.ARC’s business model is largely driven by off-course betting, whereas attendance and its associated revenues is important for JCR. But the strange situation in which online firms pay a bigger slice of their turnover for betting on a Class 6 handicap at Southwell than they do for offering odds on the Grand National or Cheltenham Gold Cup is one that Mullen is well positioned to address.There is additional baggage, though, from Mullen’s time at Ladbrokes Coral Group which also needs to be unpacked.His three years in charge covered the final throes of the 15-year controversy over £100-a-spin fixed-odds betting terminals on Britain’s high streets. And as familiar names that had built their brands on racing and bookmaking fought to avoid a £2 spin restriction, Mullen was, in the words of a leading online gambling news website, “the most outspoken industry leader with regards to the FOBTs debate”.It didn’t work; the £2 limit arrived in 2019 and the predictions of Mullen and others that it would lead to shop closures, job losses and immediate financial meltdown in racing did not come to pass.Racing is, though, paying a price for the way in which fixed-margin gaming and its guaranteed profits gripped the gambling industry from the day that the first FOBT was plugged in and switched on.The issue of “affordability” checks on punters that has preoccupied racing for several years is focused on the online market. But the fact that racing and other betting on sport is lumped in with gaming products such as slots and roulette when deciding that checks are necessary owes much to the perceived excesses of the FOBT era which saw the erasure of long-established distinctions between betting and gaming.One of Truesdale’s achievements as the Jockey Club’s CEO was to prompt a parliamentary debate on affordability checks via an online petition which attracted more than 100,000 signatures. He will now be succeeded by someone who played at least some part – and, some might suggest, a not insignificant part - on the other side of the debate and whose former industry arguably toxified gambling – leaving racing and betting to suffer in the fallout.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So, when researchers Stefan and Janine Schoombie came across a badly wounded wandering albatross chick in a relatively accessible part of the island, they resolved to return at night. After hiking for 30 minutes in the dark, Stefan started quietly setting up his camera equipment behind a rock. “We were expecting to have to stalk, but the mice were climbing all over us,” he says.It didn’t take long for the mice to start feeding on the albatross chick. “The bird was a complete fluffball,” says Janine. “So, they just climbed up its back and started nibbling at its head. We could see their teeth going into its flesh.” The bird, too young to walk let alone fly, could only shake its head in irritation. “As scientists our job is to not intervene,” says Stefan. “But we really wanted to help that bird.”The next morning, they returned to the site to find that the chick had been joined by one of its parents – but the adult bird could also do nothing. “It was such a hopeless situation,” says Janine. A few days later, the chick succumbed to its injuries and was eaten by giant petrels.Now, however, help is at hand for the seabirds of Marion Island, 1,180 miles (1,900km) south-east of Cape Town. Next month, scientists from theMouse-Free Marion Project (MFM)– a partnership between BirdLife South Africa and the South African government – will be taking a crucial step towards eradicating the mice from the island by spreading toxic baits on foot, across a relatively small section of the island.View image in fullscreenMarion Island is a key breeding site for grey-headed (pictured), sooty and light-mantled albatrossesPhotograph: Ben Dilley/MFMThis time next year a helicopter will be used to drop bait across a much larger swathe of Marion. Assuming the project achieves its funding targets, these tests will culminate in the winter of 2028 when five or six helicopters (brought to the island by ship) will distribute poisoned bait across the entire island, in an attempt to eliminate the pests that were unintentionally introduced to the island by 19th-century sailors. If successful, it will be thelargest ever eradication of micein a single operation.The efforts to start improving the fortunes of the island’s birds could not have come at a better time. Last week,the South African goverment announcedthat bird flu had been confirmed as present on the island for the first time. It has been found in six different bird species, with wandering albatross chicks dying in the greatest numbers (150 out of approximately 1,900 chicks) last year.Marion Island and neighbouring Prince Edward Island – which, fortunately, is mouse free – are the breeding ground for 50% of the world’s wandering albatrosses. But this is by no means the only species whose survival is threatened by the mice: 19 of the 29 bird species that nest on Marion Island face local extinction by the rodents. Of these, Marion is considered globally important for grey-headed, sooty and light-mantled albatrosses.The pressure is huge. You only have to miss two mice out of however many million and you’re back where you startedKeith Springer, Mouse-Free Marion ProjectThe decision to eradicate the mice was not taken lightly, says MFM project manager Anton Wolfaardt: “I’m a biologist,” he says. “I don’t like killing things.” Eradication was first discussed seriously more than a decade ago, with a feasibility study in 2015 finding that getting rid of the mice was technically possible. An ethics assessment conducted in 2022 showed that doing nothing and leaving the mice to destroy the island’s ecosystem was not an ethically neutral action. “It’s a necessary step,” says Wolfaardt, “to right the human-inflicted wrongs of the past.”These wrongs include the introduction of five unneutered cats to the island in 1949. The cats were meant to control mice around the research base but, says Wolfaardt, “they quickly discovered that the island’s naive seabirds made far easier targets”. By the mid-1970s, there was a feral cat population of about 2,000 killing an estimated 450,000 seabirds every year.View image in fullscreenA mouse attacks a wandering albatross chick.Photograph: Stefan and Janine Schoombie/MFMAfter a sustained campaign, the cats were eliminated in 1991. “Removing the mice is the last piece of the puzzle,” says Wolfaardt, who explains that the problem has got worse in the past 30 years as warmer temperatures and drier conditions have caused the mouse population to increase.For inspiration and expertise, Wolfaardt and his team have looked to New Zealand, theglobal leaders in pest eradication. Because New Zealand has few native mammals, the introduction of rats, mice, stoats and cats have wreaked havoc among local species. Starting in the 1960s, the New Zealand government began clearing tiny islands of pests to give native bird species safe havens on which to breed.As the New Zealanders honed their skills, they embarked on more ambitious projects, clearing more than 300 islands of pests. The development of GPS and helicopter baiting buckets in the 1990s enabled them to tackle much larger islands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With three years to go until rollout, the project is already a full-time job. “The pressure is huge,” he says. “You only have to miss two mice out of however many million and you’re back where you started.” Almost 20 years ago, when the mouse population was thought to be smaller on the island, the number of micewas recorded as about 300 a hectare(10,000 sq meters) at the height of breeding season.View image in fullscreenEradicating mice from the island would bring huge gains for wildlife.Photograph: Ben Dilley/MFMThe island-wide baiting operation was initially meant to begin this year, but funding challenges and two recent unsuccessful mouse eradication projects, on Gough Island by the RSPB and on Midway Atoll by the US Fish andWildlifeService, have forced a belt-and-braces approach.Springer knows from experience that it’s all about controlling the controllables – people, equipment, plans – and hoping for decent weather in the winter of 2028. “You can have years where it’s more challenging to fly helicopters,” he says. “But with this kind of complex operation you’re nominating your timeline years in advance. You can’t change plans at the last minute.”‘It’s a monster task’: can culling ferrets and rats save one of the UK’s largest seabird colonies?Read moreWolfaardt and Springer know that if they don’t succeed it will be decades before they can try again. But they also know that most eradication projects over the past 15 years have been successful – and that few have been as carefully planned as MFM.Wolfaardt says it’s the prospect of success – rather than the fear of failure – that drives him. “Conservation rarely has silver bullets, but eradicating introduced species from islands is the closest we have to a silver bullet. I’ve been working in conservation for 30 years. This is the only situation I’ve encountered where we can actually turn back the clock. And if we are successful, we can say with 100% certainty that there will be massive conservation gains.”This article was amended on 31 March 2025.

The annual peak, recorded on 22 March, was the lowest since records began 47 years ago, with sea ice covering just 5.53m sq miles – about 1.1m sq miles less than last year – and 30,000 sq miles below the previous low in 2017. The Gulf of St Lawrence had almost no ice, while the Sea of Okhotsk experienced notably lower than average sea ice extent.In late January, sea ice extent in the Arctic unexpectedly decreased, losing an area the size of Italy (more than 115,000 sq miles). This can be attributed to cyclones pushing southerly winds in the Barents and Bering seas, causing ocean waves that broke apart and melted thin ice at the edge of the ice sheet. Temperatures up to 12C above normal were recorded between northern Greenland and the north pole.Arctic sea ice extent is expected to continue its decline in the coming years due to a combination of warmer temperatures, warm seas, wind breaking up ice, and thinner ice – all exacerbated by the climate crisis. Some climate models suggest the Arctic could experience ice-free summers before 2050, though these projections remain uncertain.Elsewhere, the past weekend marked the start of a prolonged and widespread risk of severe thunderstorms across central and eastern parts of the US, with this threat continuing through much of the coming week. On 29 and 30 March there was severe weather from the Great Lakes to Texas, with several tornadoes reported, along with straight-line wind gusts of up to 96mph (154km/h) and 3in hail. This initial round of severe weather will affect eastern parts of the country on Monday.The second bout of severe weather is expected to develop across the central plains on Tuesday, as an eastward-moving upper-level low interacts with the boundary between hot and humid air across southern states, and cold air across the north. Tuesday’s thunderstorms are expected to develop from Minnesota to Texas, with the risk slowly shifting eastwards during the second half of the week. Storms will bring a further chance of damaging winds, very large hail, and tornadoes – some of which have the potential to be significant.View image in fullscreenA pedestrian shields themselves from the rain during a downpour in Edinburg, Texas, last week.Photograph: Joel Martinez/APThe slow eastward progression of the storm system is expected to result in an additional threat in the form of flooding, with periods of heavy rain in some areas.

But lawmakers are keeping quiet as Trump targets incentivesWe asked 18 Republicans whose districts benefit most from Biden’s IRA climate law if they back Trump’s demandsOliver Milman,Dharna NoorandAliya UteuovaMon 31 Mar 2025 07.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 11.51 EDTShareBillions of dollars in clean energy spending and jobs have overwhelmingly flowed to parts of the US represented byRepublicanlawmakers. But these members ofCongressare still largely reticent to break withDonald Trump’s demands to kill off key incentives for renewables, even as their districts bask in the rewards.The president has called for the dismantling of the Inflation Reduction Act – a sweeping bill passed byDemocratsthat has helped turbocharge investments in wind, solar, nuclear, batteries and electric vehicle manufacturing in the US – calling it a “giant scam”. Trump froze funding allocated under the act and has vowed to claw back grants aimed at reducing planet-heating pollution.Republicans who now control Congress have to decide if they will eliminate the IRA’s grants and, more crucially, the tax credits that have spurred a boom in clean energy activity in their own districts. A total of 78% of this spending has gone to Republican-held suburban and rural districts across the US, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.‘A pandemic-level shock to the system’: RFK Jr’s old environmental group weighs EPA cutsRead moreOf the 20 congressional districts that have attracted the most clean energy manufacturing investment since the IRA passed in 2022, 18 are represented by Republicans, according to Atlas. The top three districts, in North Carolina, Georgia and Nevada, represented by Richard Hudson, Earl Carter and Mark Amodei, respectively, have collectively seen nearly $30bn in new investments since the legislation.Despite this, none of the 18 Republican representatives contacted by the Guardian would comment on whether they agree with Trump that clean energy incentives should be scrapped.horizontal bar graph showing top 20 congressional districts to benefit from clean energy investment since IRA passed“Members aren’t necessarily looking for opportunities to disagree with the White House at the moment,” said Heather Reams, the president of Citizens for ResponsibleEnergySolutions, a center-right group that advocates in favor of clean energy.The Atlas data set is the newest in aseriesofreportsshowing the IRA benefitted Republican-led districts the most. And the largest individual pools of money from the bill also went to projects in red communities, according to a separate data set shared with the Guardian by an anonymous source at the Department of Energy (DoE).The top grant from the IRA, worth $500m, went to a General Motors plant in Lansing, Michigan – represented by Republican Tom Barrett – the DoE data shows. And though the biggest loan of $15bn went to California’s Pacific Gas and Electric Company utility to expand clean power and modernize infrastructure, the second and third largest went to battery plants in Glendale, Kentucky, and Kokomo, Indiana, represented by conservatives Brett Guthrie and Victoria Spartz, respectively. Hageman, Guthrie and Spartz did not respond to requests for comment.Some Republicans have publicly lauded the tax credits’ impacts on their districts even as they have attacked the IRA. The ultraconservative Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance,praised the IRA-funded expansionof solar manufacturing in her district but called the bill itself “dangerous”, winning her scrutiny from Joe Biden in 2023. Her district saw more investment than all but 14 others, the Atlas data shows.In a sign of private nervousness among conservatives about a repeal of the tax credits, though, a group of 21 Republican lawmakers, including Carter and Amodei,signed a letter to colleagueswarning that axing the IRA risks planned projects and would escalate energy bills. Some conservatives made similar calls during a January hearing in the House ways and means committee.How Trump is targeting wind and solar energy – and delighting big oilRead moreBut these voices have gotten quieter in recent weeks, with some Republicans who privately supported the letterrefusing to sign itfor strategic reasons, and some letter signatories saying the IRA tax credits shouldnot necessarily be a major priority.Ongoing budget concerns have made it especially difficult for conservatives to defend the credits. Republicans’ fiscal year 2025 proposal authorized $4.5tn in tax cuts through 2034 and called on committees to partially offset the cost with $2tn in spending reductions. A full repeal of the IRA’s green energy tax credits would slash about $850bn in spendingthe Tax Foundation thinktank recently found.“They’re trying to kind of balance finding the money so that they’re not adding to the federal debt, while also trying to protect these beneficial and popular tax credits and provisions,” said Dana Nuccitelli, the research coordinator at the non-partisan advocacy group Citizens’ Climate Lobby. “It’s not easy.”Reams, of the Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions thinktank, said that as the realities of lost jobs and increasing energy costs become clear, Trump may change his mind about the need to repeal the credits. “There’s whatDonald Trumpsays – remember, he hated EVs, but he just bought a Tesla – and what he does,” she said. “You’ve got to not take it all so literally and bide some time to get a sense of what really is going on.”Still, there are already signs that Trump’s hostile stance towards renewables – he hashalted approvalsof wind and solar projects on federal land and waters – - is starting to dampen clean energy activity in the US.Approximately $8bn in clean energy manufacturing activity has been canceled so far this year, Atlas has calculated, with a separateanalysis by Climate Powerfinding that 50,000 jobs have been lost or are threatened.A full repeal of the IRA would hike energy bills for households and imperil a further 1.5m jobs in the US, according to yet anotherrecent report, by Energy Innovation. “Manyof those jobs will be at risk if the IRA is repealed,” Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford, warned recently about the company’s plans to expand its electric vehicle factories.“TheTrump administrationaims to restore US manufacturing jobs, but cutting existing federal energy incentives could really undermine that goal,” said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas.It’s a message some climate advocates have been bringing to Republican lawmakers in recent weeks in an attempt to save the tax credits. Citizens’ Climate Lobby, for instance, this month lobbied 47 Republicans on Capitol Hill calling on them to protect the tax credits, and is now asking its members tocall their Republican representatives, focusing not on their climate benefits but on their potential to spur economic growth.“Everybody loves manufacturing jobs,” Nuccitelli said.‘Protect our future’: Alaskan Indigenous town fights ‘destructive’ uranium mine projectRead moreIn their lobbying, Citizens Climate Lobby is also highlighting the low price of building clean power, the need for abundant energy amid forecasted spikes in energy from the artificial intelligence boom, and the fact thatrepealing the incentivescould cause household electricity bills to increase by about 10% over the next decade.Despite the lack of public support for the tax credits from GOP lawmakers, the organization said they enjoy significant support on Capitol Hill, with some GOP lawmakers calling to protect them in private meetings and personal phone calls with other congressional colleagues.Only two Democratic-led districts were on the list provided by the Atlas Public Policy. One was Arizona’s Raúl Grijalva, who was a strong advocate for the IRA’s green incentives before hedied this month.“The Inflation Reduction Act is a vital investment in the future stability of the planet,” his office wrote in a statement to the Guardian before his passing. “As a self-proclaimed business genius, Trump should easily be able to understand the high financial and humanitarian costs of increasing climate catastrophes.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpBiden administrationHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsRepublicansDemocratsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump and the government will say no we can do this quicker, but good luck. But probably less than a year is realistic. If your politicians are looking at real, hard political choices and are focused on it, and really kick officials’ backsides, then yes, you can get these things done in a matter of months as opposed to years.”No 10 said officials would continue talks with the US “as long as there’s a chance to reach a deal” afterforecasterssaid a 20-percentage-point increase in tariffs on UK goods and services would cut the size of the British economy by 1% and force tax rises this autumn.Starmer’s official spokesperson said: “We’ve been actively preparing for all eventualities ahead of the expected announcements from President Trump this week, which [we] would expect the UK to be impacted by alongside other countries.“Our trade teams are continuing to have constructive discussions to agree a UK-US economic prosperity deal, but we will only do a deal which reflects this government’s mandate to deliver economic stability for the British.”Global fears over Trump’s latest tariff plans were intensifying on Monday, as financial markets sold off sharply,sending share prices slidingin their worst month in more than two years.Senior members of the government have been engaged inintense negotiationsover recent weeks with the US, but are now resigned to being hit with whatever Trump announces on 2 April. However, government sources said they did not recognise the timelines suggested by Falconer.They acknowledged there was deep uncertainty around what the US president planned to do, including within his own administration, but said they were taking a “cool-headed” approach and were prepared for multiple scenarios.The spokesperson said: “We’ve been clear that a trade war with [the] US is not in the national interest, but we will reserve the right to respond in a way that does protect British industry once we’ve seen the detail. That’s why we’re preparing for all eventualities. It’s why we’ve said that we rule nothing out.”Falconer, who led the UK’s attempts to reach a comprehensive US free trade deal during Trump’s first term, said failure to avoid new tariffs on Wednesday would hurt the UK economy but he backed Starmer’s plan to seek a wider deal. “It’ll be damaging to some people if it’s applied, particularly exporters, autos and steel, but it’s not going to shift the UK economy overnight,” he said. “God knows we survived Brexit which is far bigger than this is going to [be].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ministers have also been under pressure to drop the 2% digital services tax which hits big US tech giants such as Meta, Google and Amazon.British businesses want to avoid being dragged into an escalating trade war and many have urged caution from the government. Even if the UK eventually escapes targeted tariffs though, there will still be a knock-on impact of trade barriers on Europe, which is a far bigger trading partner.Explore more on these topicsTrade policyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpUS politicsForeign policyLabourKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Cumulative losses at NGN had climbed to £1.25bn by the end of June last year, accounts filed at Companies House show.In January the Duke of Sussex became the latest victim tosettle his legal claim against NGNwith an undisclosed substantial payout that will be included in the company’s filings next year.Hugh Grant, another vocal and long time campaigner keen to see the details of alleged phone hacking exposed in court, settled for an“enormous sum”last year.Grant said he would have“loved” to have gone to court, but if he had won and the damages awarded were any less than the offer he felt forced to accept, he would not have been able to afford legal costs put at roughly £10m for both sides that would have been required by the rules of civil litigation.NGN’s latest accounts show that Murdoch’s newspaper empire incurred fresh costs of £14m related to legal costs and settlements in the phone-hacking scandal against the Sun and News of the World last year.That was the smallest amount since NGN started revealing phone-hacking costs in 2011, and well down on the £51m in 2023 and £128m in 2022.Filings published for Murdoch’sstruggling rightwing news media venture, TalkTVshow that its losses have climbed to £145m since its launch in 2022.The business, whichshut down its TV channel to go online-only last year, reported a £50.4m pre-tax loss in the year to June 2024.Piers Morgan, TalkTV’s star signing, announced in January that he was leaving Murdoch’s media empire totake control of his Uncensored YouTube channel, He had previously said in February 2024 that he was leaving his daily evening TV show.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This differential treatment is unacceptable – equality before the law is the backbone of public confidence in our justice system.“I will change the law to ensure fairness for all in our courts, and I’m grateful to the Sentencing Council for delaying implementation while parliament considers the bill.”The Sentencing Council confirmed after a meeting with Mahmood on Monday that it “would not introduce a guideline when there is a draft bill due for imminent introduction that would make it unlawful. On that basis, the council, an independent statutory body, has chosen to delay the in-force date of the guideline pending such legislation taking effect.”Starmer gave his backing to legislation to prevent the guidelines earlier on Monday. “I’m very disappointed in the response of the Sentencing Council on this issue, which is why we will now bring forward legislation,” he told GB News. “There’s no other option. So we will do that. We will fast-track it.”Senior legal figures have expressed discomfort at how the situation has unfolded, with the guidance aimed at addressing some clear disparities in sentencing between white and non-white offenders.Former lord chief justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s obviously for parliament to decide what the law is, but these are difficult issues. The last thing anyone would want is politicians involved in deciding individual sentences.“And the last thing the judges would want is deciding ultimately on penal policy, that is for the government.”The suspension comes at the end of a breakdown in relations between Mahmood and the Sentencing Council. After the guidance was first published, Mahmood wrote to the chair of the council, Lord Justice Davis, calling for the change to be scrapped and insisting there would “never be a two-tier sentencing approach under my watch”.Davis had suggested he would defy that pressure on Friday, however, saying the council had concluded “the guideline did not require revision” and blaming a “widespread misunderstanding” for the backlash.He addedin a letter to Mahmood: “The rule of law requires that all offenders are treated fairly and justly by judges and magistrates who are fully informed about the offences, the effect on the victims and the offenders. The section of the guideline relating to pre-sentence reports is directed to the issue of information about offenders, no more and no less.”David said that it was guidance that judges must “do all that they can to avoid a difference in outcome based on ethnicity” and said they would be “better equipped to do that if they have as much information as possible about the offender. The cohort of ethnic, cultural and faith minority groups may be a cohort about which judges and magistrates are less well informed.”Mahmoodhas ordered a reviewinto the role and powers of the council, which may also require new legislation, likely to be part of a wider sentencing bill due to be published after the sentencing review being undertaken by former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke.A No 10 spokesperson said on Monday that the government was committed to considering more broadly “the role of the Sentencing Council”, but added: “We’re obviously not going to rush that work, and we will consider it carefully.”He refused to rule out the Sentencing Council being scrapped. Asked why, the spokesperson said: “I’m just not going to get ahead of the work being done. We are not going to rush into ruling anything in or out. We need to look at the Sentencing Council and its role carefully, and any further changes will be set out in due course.”A government source said they acknowledged there was still work to be done to address disparities in the justice system. “It’s clear that more needs to be done to both understand and address them but these guidelines would undermine equality before the law,” the source said.Explore more on these topicsSentencingUK criminal justiceEnglandWalesShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

They alleged the investigation into her death had been marred by delays, a lack of communication and institutional homophobia.More than 100 people joined Peaches Christ, the Scissor Sisters’ Ana Matronic, and the former RuPaul’sDragRace contestants Cheddar Gorgeous and Crystal outside New Scotland Yard in central London with placards reading “Justice for Heklina”, “Pride not prejudice, hold the Met accountable” and “End Met police homophobia now!”View image in fullscreenThe Scissor Sisters’ Ana Matronic gives a speech on London’s Embankment.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZumaPress Wire/Rex/ShutterstockPeaches Christ said: “Heklina was one of my oldest and closest friends. We were family and finding her dead in London was truly traumatising, but it has only been made worse by the complete lack of attention from the London Met police.“For nearly two years, myself and Heklina’s next of kin have been ignored. Only when I went to the media was there a response.”She added in a speech: “Heklina deserves better service and justice and every queer person and every minority deserves to be treated fairly.”Crystal, a British-Canadian drag artist whose real name is Colin Seymour, told the crowd: “Are our lives worth less? One of us has died. Our institutions shrugged and moved on.”She said the group demanded change as she highlightedthe Met’s failings in the case of the serial killer Stephen Portand the 2023 report by Louise Casey, which said the force wasguilty of institutional racism, misogyny and homophobia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said: “We know that many feel deep distress following Steven’s death and some feel frustration with the pace of the police investigation.“We are also aware of the concerns of Steven’s next of kin and have apologised to them directly.“A full review of the investigation is ongoing to establish any missed opportunities.

Reams of headlines have suggested that they have come from nowhere – yet the grassroots regional drama schools that trained them say this overlooks their hard work.To find undiscovered talent for the show, Adolescence’s casting director, Shaheen Baig, visited two northern drama schools that work with children from underrepresented and deprived communities.Baig recently posted on Instagram that she wanted to give a “special shoutout” tothe Drama MOBandArticulate Drama School and Agency, because: “There’s not enough praise for drama teachers up and down the country doing great community work with very little financial support or recognition.”Yet other reporting of the show’s breakout star, Owen Cooper, has emphasised the narrative that “Owen had ‘done nothing and came from nowhere’”, as though he had been spotted on the street, says theDramaMOB co-founder Esther Morgan.In reality, Cooper attended a weekly drama class at the Drama MOB inManchester.View image in fullscreen‘It simply isn’t true that he came from nowhere … Owen Cooper as Jamie Miller in Adolescence.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix“We have been frustrated with the narrative … this simply isn’t true,” says Morgan. “He was a drama student and represented by our casting agency. Owen was a fantastic actor when he started with us and we are incredibly proud to have provided Owen with the skills and training he has needed to enter the industry, audition-ready.”She feels this plays into the performing arts’ London-centric focus. “It’s not so much north/south but London/everywhere else. The north is underfunded and often ignored as a creative space.”The Drama MOB has provided training for more than 500 children a week in Manchester since it was established in 2013, including fully funded places to children who can’t afford drama training and free workshops for local primary schools.Morgan says that Baig approached the Drama MOB directly, and auditioned a number of boys for the lead role of Jamie.View image in fullscreenTina O’Brien (left) and Esther Morgan, co-founders of Drama MOB in Manchester.Photograph: Dom BrophyCoronation Street star Tina O’Brien, who co-founded the school, says Owen’s performance is “outstanding”, and reflects the school’s mission to train “the next generation of northern talent”.Adolescence has become the first streaming show to top the UK most-watched television charts since launching in early March, and has sparked a public conversation about the relationship between online “incel” culture and real-world harm.As a result, Netflix is making the series available to all secondary schools across the UK through Into Film+, with the healthy relationships charity Tender providing guidance and resources. Keir Starmer also met children’s mental health charities on Tuesday to discuss the issues raised in the series, such as social media misogyny and online safety.Baig also approached Articulate in Yorkshire, which has helped its students work in Hollywood as well as in the UK television industry. Like the Drama MOB, it offers scholarships for children who can’t afford classes, and says the majority of its students are from working-class backgrounds.Stacey Burrows, Articulate’s managing director, says her team has worked with Baig for years, including to cast students in shows such as theupcoming Peaky Blinders movieand theNetflix series Toxic Town.Baig’s team sent briefs for each character in April 2024 and the school suggested suitable children for many roles. The process spanned a couple of months and included self-taped auditions, Zoom recalls and in-person meetings, as well as a final chemistry read with other actors.View image in fullscreenStacey Burrows, managing director of Articulate Agency.Photograph: Lorne Campbell/GuzelianThe actors chosen include Amélie Pease, 18, who plays Jamie’s sister, Lisa; Fatima Bojang, 18, who plays Jade in episode two; and Austin Haynes, 16, who plays Fredo in episodes two and four.Burrows says it was an “absolute joy” to watch them in the show. “We were so thrilled with the final result of Adolescence – all three of our artists were shining brightly and it gives us a real sense of pride and accomplishment because we’re not just agents who book jobs, we are mentors and teachers, too. Those kids worked so unbelievably hard for those opportunities and they deserve all the praise they are getting,” she says.Stephen Graham: the ‘working-class, mixed-race kid’ who cares deeply about the workRead moreBut she agrees that some of the narrative around talent coming from “nowhere” was frustrating for schools like hers. “We have heard a lot from Stephen Graham that Owen came from ‘nothing’ or ‘nowhere’, which fits with the narrative they seemed to want at the outset. This has caused wide upset among many grassroots drama schools, helping working-class kids to break into the industry,” she says.“Not only that, but to disregard early training sends out the message that young people don’t need to work hard at their craft. It also risks preventing people going to grassroots training grounds and getting into the arts.”Another drama school, The Boury Academy in London, posted on Instagram that “to pretend he was simply discovered on the street is to erase the work of the very people who made that opportunity possible”.A spokesperson for Stephen Graham says that he has “simply been emphasising that Adolescence is Owen’s first professional acting credit in order to showcase what an amazing, raw and brave talent he is” and that he has previously mentioned his drama training.Burrows wants to see more recognition of how drama schools like hers have a “life-changing” impact on their students, from resilience to communication skills, and for this to fuel greater support. “Regional drama schools are crying out for funding,” she says.Articulate receives no funding from external sources and all scholarships are self-funded from its small profits, she says. Some children drop out because they can’t afford the bus fares, and she regularly drives students to auditions when they can’t pay for transport.“What we need is the support of actors like Stephen Graham, encouraging kids to come to drama schools like ours that are doing incredible things, and not dismissing them as coming from ‘nowhere’,” she says. “We need casting directors to keep coming to us to keep offering life-changing opportunities and we need huge directors like Shane Meadows and Clio Barnard to take the time to reach out, come and see us and see what our kids can do and how talented they truly are.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAdolescenceDramaDrama and danceArts in schoolsManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

Last week,the University of Sussex was fined a record £585,000for free speech breaches after a three-and-a-half-year investigation into the resignation of Prof Kathleen Stock, who was the target of protests over her views on gender identification and transgender rights.Adult Human Female is regarded by trans rights groups as inflammatory, transphobic and inaccurate. Documents before the Watford tribunal said the film examined claims made by trans rights activists that “trans women are women” and should be treated as women in all legal and social contexts.“Through interviews with academics, journalists, health care professionals and feminist campaigners, the film argues against those claims, and describes the detrimental treatment of women who have dissented from them,” the tribunal documents say.O’Neill and Wayne, who describe themselves as gender critical, believe sex is a matter of biology, that it is impossible for a human to change sex, and that sex is important in a range of different political and social contexts.They also do not subscribe to gender identity theory, “namely the belief that people are born with an internal sense of gender which may or may not correspond to their biological sex”, the documents state.They claim these are protected beliefs and their union has discriminated against them contrary to section 57(2) of the Equality Act 2010. They also claim UCU’s conduct amounted to harassment, which “had the purpose and/or effect of violating their dignity and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them”.The union – or respondent – denies it has discriminated against O’Neill and Wayne. Documents before the tribunal said: “The respondent’s conduct was proportionate and necessary in the interests of advocating the rights of others. Accordingly, the reason for any less favourable treatment was not the claimants’ gender-critical belief or lack of a belief in gender identity theory.”Denying harassment, the union’s defence stated: “The conduct of the respondent was to highlight its commitment to supporting its members that identify as trans or non-binary. The respondent’s conduct was proportionate and in line with its current support for its trans, non-binary and LGBT+ members.”The tribunal continues on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsTransgenderTrade unionsUniversitiesHigher educationnewsShareReuse this content"

He wrote: “I was just informed by Prime Minister Starmer of the United Kingdom, that they caught the terrorists who attacked the beautiful Turnberry, in Scotland. They did serious damage, and will hopefully be treated harshly.“You cannot let things like this attack happen, and I greatly appreciate the work of Prime Minister Starmer, and UK law enforcement.”Trump wrongly claimed that three people were in prison as a result of police inquiries.A 33-year-old man was charged over the incident and appeared at Ayr sheriff court on Monday. Kieran Robson was charged with malicious mischief and made no plea during the brief hearing. He was released on bail pending a further court appearance.Another man, 75, and a 66-year-old woman were arrested and released pending further inquiries.The incident took place during a weekend of pro-Palestine protests across the UK after Trump prompted international outcry when he suggested the US could “take over” war-ravaged Gaza and “own it”, which critics say amounts to endorsing the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.Palestine Action supporters posted footage on social media of the words “Gaza is not 4 sale” sprayed on the Ayrshire golf course. The group said its action was a “direct response to the US administration’s stated intent to ethnically cleanse Gaza” after “having laid out plans to ‘clean out the whole thing’ and forcibly displace its population”.A spokesperson for Trump Turnberry dismissed the incident as a “childish, criminal act”, adding: “Turnberry is a national treasure and will continue to be the number one beacon of luxury and excellence in the world of golf.”Police Scotland said inquiries into the incident were continuing.Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The tumour and normal tissue is “mapped” or contoured on to medical scans, to ensure the radiation targets the cancer while minimising damage to healthy tissues and organs.Normally, this is a slow, manual process that can take doctors between 20 and 150 minutes to complete. AI auto-contouring takes less than five minutes and costs around £10-£15 per patient.‘The field of human ancestry is rife with racism’: pioneering project to build cancer database in AfricaRead moreResearch shows thatAI contouring can cut waits for radiotherapyby more than five days for breast cancer patients, up to nine days for prostate cancer patients and three days for lung cancer patients.In May 2024, the Conservative government announced£15.5m over three years to fund AI auto-contouringfor all hospitals providing radiotherapy. Work continued on the scheme after the general election, with online webinars and follow-up calls for radiotherapy departments held in September.The 51 trusts offering radiotherapy continued to work on installing the cloud-based technology, with a number using it early, in the belief the funding was secured.But in February, in an email seen by the Guardian, Nicola McCulloch, the deputy director of specialised commissioning at NHS England, said the funding had been cancelled “due to a need to further prioritise limited investment”. There would no longer be a centrally funded programme to support implementation of the technology, she said.The decision means many radiotherapy departments face a return to manual contouring, prompting accusations that the government is ditching digital and going back to analogue cancer care.Analysis by Radiotherapy UK has calculated that removing funding for AI contouring in England will add up to 500,000 extra days to waiting lists for breast, prostate and lung cancer alone and leave each of the 51 trusts with a £300,000 shortfall.Waiting lists for radiotherapy are already long. Figures show that in January, 60% of cancer patients waiting to begin radiation treatment, nearly 1,000 people, waited longer than two months, and 23% waited more than 104 days.The chair of Radiotherapy UK, Prof Pat Price, said: “The government cannot laud the advent of AI in one breath, and allow this to happen. Far from moving from an analogue to digital NHS, when it comes to radiotherapy it feels like the opposite is happening. This wrong-footed decision will exacerbate the impact of severe staff shortages.”The leading oncologist urged ministers to intervene. “Some departments are so short-handed that they’re shutting machines down because no one is there to operate them and nationally, radiotherapy vacancy rates are running at 8%. This investment in AI could have alleviated some of these pressures. Without it, cancer patients will wait longer than necessary for treatment, potentially costing their lives.”Clive Peedell, a consultant clinical oncologist at South Tees Hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “This is a really catastrophic mistake. Half of all cancer patients will need radiotherapy at some point during the course of their treatment. Labour is supposed to be the party of the NHS, but instead it is going against innovation in cancer care.“To just turn the tap off is ridiculous. We’ve had a big increase in cases, but we are managing our workloads because AI is helping us. If we can’t get the funding to keep using it, we’ll have to go back to planning treatment by hand. So we’ll probably have to employ more staff or have much longer waiting lists because of this terrible decision.”Jane Richards (not her real name), a manager working in radiotherapy services, said the decision to pull funding for AI contouring felt like a betrayal. Her area had implemented the technology already, believing the funding from NHS England was assured.“Every time I see Keir Starmer or Wes Streeting talking about the importance of AI, I get frustrated,” she said. “We’re not talking about the future of a technology, we’re talking about something that we are making use of in the here and now and we are demonstrating has an impact, yet we don’t have central funding for it.“So I feel incredibly angry. If you can only fit two patients into one manual radiotherapy planning clinic instead of four using AI contouring, and you’ve got four patients coming in each week, waiting lists are going to grow exponentially. And if they face longer waits, their prognosis will be worse.”Spencer Goodman, a professional officer for radiotherapy at the Society of Radiographers, said: “Radiographers recognise AI’s potential to improve patient care efficiency. Withdrawing funding for AI technologies that help define radiation fields in radiotherapy is a step backward. Given the current workforce shortage, proven AI tools can help streamline processes and enable faster, more accurate patient treatment, benefiting both providers and patients.”A spokesperson for the Department ofHealthsaid “funding has not been cut”, but did not refer directly to the AI contouring funding decision. “This government is investing £70m in radiotherapy over the next year to replace old machines, so that patients can access the latest technology available.”They said AI was already being used in various areas of healthcare, including breast cancer diagnosis, and that the government’s national cancer plan was aimed at improving prevention, diagnosis, treatment and research.Explore more on these topicsHealth policyCancerArtificial intelligence (AI)HealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Her only child, Michal Olszewski, 52, an aeronautical engineer who lives in Lincoln with his wife, had been travelling regularly to the Polish capital to support her.Olszewski has been living in the UK since 2006, initially as a EU citizen. He subsequently became a British citizen and has dual Polish-UK nationality. As his mother has become increasingly frail he wanted her to move to the UK so he and his wife could care for her properly. There is a legal route under the settlement scheme for people in Olszewski’s situation to bring parents to the UK.Olszewska arrived in the UK last September on a six-month visitor visa and shortly afterwards the application, containing all the correct information, was made for her to live permanently in Britain with her son and his wife. Until a few days ago the family had heard nothing from the Home Office although the application had been lodged in good time before the six-month visa expired.But on 25 March the Home Office finally responded, informing the family: “Unfortunately your application is not valid and we are unable to accept it.”The rejection letter went on to say: “The required application process for someone applying as a family member of a relevant naturalised British citizen is to use the appropriate paper form. Your application was made online. There is no right of appeal in respect of an invalid application.”The rejection letter informed Olszewska that she did not have the right to be in the UK as her visitor visa had expired and that the consequences of staying unlawfully included being detained, fined, imprisoned, along with being removed and banned from returning to the UK.The paper form of an application to stay must be requested from the Home Office which prints the person’s name on it and then sends it by email to the applicant, who must print it out, fill it in and post it back to the Home Office. The Home Office has said it is moving its immigration system online. But not everyone is aware that some applications are still required to be done on paper.Olszewski said: “This is a big disgrace from the Home Office. It was only after almost six months that they told us the application was invalid. My mum is very distressed about this. I’m her only child, we’re very close and we want to spend her last few years together.“My wife and I will be looking after her in our home. I pay my taxes and I’m a good citizen. This makes me very angry. This is a country of law and democracy but this decision feels like it was made by a Soviet bureaucracy.”The family’s solicitor, Katherine Smith, from Redwing Immigration, said: “The implications of an application being rejected as invalid are very drastic. It was harsh the Home Office wouldn’t accept the online application or allow time for a paper form to be completed. Elzbieta is now without legal status in the UK due to the delay in reaching this decision and is distressed by this.”As there is no right of appeal against the Home Office decision, Smith is planning to start judicial review proceedings against them.A Home Office spokesperson said: “It is our longstanding policy not to comment on individual cases.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

The scheme was launched in 2001 but was substantially ramped up after the global banking crash, with an £85,000 limit set in 2010.That limit was set in reaction to the financial crisis, when a number of UK banks were brought to their knees. That included Northern Rock, whichsuffered the first bank run in the UK in over a centuryin 2007. At that time, only the first £2,000 of savings were protected in full, while 90% of the next £33,000 would be paid back. That meant most people lost money if their lenders failed.A much higher cap, introduced in 2010, wastemporarily cut to £75,000to bring it in line with euro exchange rates under EU rules in 2015, before beingrestored to £85,000 in 2017. However, post-Brexit rules now allow the UK to set its own cap.The PRA will now consult on the new limit and, if approved, it would cover the savings of retail and SME customers from 1 December.Debate over the deposit protection level has been swirling since the mini-banking crisis of 2023, when lenders including Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For example, new drugs such asdonanemabandlecanemabcan help slow the progression of Alzheimer’s, but only in people in the early stages of the disease.Prof Oskar Hansson from Lund University, a co-author of the work, said: “There is an urgent need for accurate and cost-effective Alzheimer diagnostics considering that many countries have recently approved the clinical use of amyloid-targeted therapies [such as donanemab and lecanemab].”Plaques of a protein called amyloid beta and the formation of tangles of another protein called tau in the brain are considered hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.Writing in the journalNature Medicine, Hansson and colleagues reported how they found fragments of tau, called eMTBR-tau243, could be detected in blood and correlated with a build-up of tau tangles in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, but not other diseases.The team’s analyses, which involved 902 participants, found levels of this tau fragment were elevated in people with Alzheimer’s symptoms who had mild cognitive impairment, and higher again in those with dementia. Levels were not raised in people with cognitive impairments due to other conditions.“Scientifically, these results are very promising and important as this marker performed better than existing tests and the new marker could help track performance of new drugs in trials,” said Prof Tara Spires-Jones, a neurodegeneration expert at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work.But, she said, it was not a foolproof blood test for Alzheimer’s.“This is also not a simple test, rather requiring complex scientific methods only available in specialist laboratories, so this will not be routinely available without further validation and development of cheaper, easier detection,” she said.Dr Sheona Scales, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said eMTBR-tau243 was one of a number of different biomarkers being studied for use in blood tests for Alzheimer’s.“What’s interesting is that the blood levels of eMTBR-tau243 seem to be linked to a person’s memory and thinking abilities,” she said. “At present, it is not always possible to make a connection between the level of tangles observed with imaging and level of cognitive impairment, but having blood tests that do this will help to monitor diseases like Alzheimer’s in the brain as they progress, and help inform prognosis in future.”Another piece of research, also published in Nature Medicine, has revealed the ratio of two proteins in brain fluid is associated with the degree of cognitive impairment experienced by people with Alzheimer’s, independent of levels of amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles in their brains.This research, led by scientists in the US, involved samples from 3,397 people across the US, Sweden and Finland, and looked at levels of two proteins – YWHAG and NPTX2 – that are normally found at the junctions, or synapses, between neurons in the brain.The team found the ratio of YWHAG:NPTX2 was better able to indicate that people were experiencing cognitive problems than their levels of amyloid beta and tau, and could be used to predict their future cognitive decline and dementia onset.Prof Tony Wyss-Coray, a co-author of the study from Stanford University, said the results could help identify the best medications for individuals and help design better clinical trials by selecting appropriate participants.Explore more on these topicsAlzheimer'sDementiaMedical researchHealthMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

There is an urgent need for trauma and surgical care, blood transfusion supplies, anaesthetics, essential medicines, and mental health support,” the UN health agency added.Later on Monday, Myanmar’s junta announced Friday’s major earthquake had led to the deaths of 2,056 people. A spokesperson said that 270 more people were still missing, with 3,900 people injured.Predictive modellingestimates by the US Geological Survey, which monitors seismic activity, suggest the death toll could eventually reach well over 10,000.The WHO said at least three hospitals were destroyed and 22 were partly damaged, while “the scale of deaths and injuries is not yet fully understood”. The agency had earlierissued an urgent flash appealfor $8m (£6.1m) for emergency support.Myanmar has declared a week of national mourning, with national flags to fly at half mast.Across central parts of the country, homes, religious sites, schools, universities, hotels and hospitals have all been damaged or destroyed. Rescue volunteers have spent days trying to free people from collapsed buildings.View image in fullscreenBuildings lie in ruins in Amarapura, Myanmar.Photograph: ReutersIn Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country’s second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants, people camped out in the streets for a third successive night. The city’s 1,000-bed general hospital had also been evacuated, with hundreds of patients being treated outside.“The situation is so dire that it’s hard to express what is happening,” said Aung Myint Hussein, the chief administrator of Sajja North mosque in Mandalay.At the U Hla Thein monastery in Mandalay, 270 monks were taking a religious exam at the time the earthquake struck. Rescue workers at the scene on Monday said 70 had been able to escape but 50 had been found dead, and 150 were still unaccounted for.Communications with many of the affected areas are poor, partly due to the country’scontinuing civil war, with much of the country out of the control of the military administration.View image in fullscreenPeople taking shelter in tents set up outdoors in Mandalay.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter a rare request by Myanmar’s isolated junta for international help – possibly due to the overwhelming magnitude of the impact – international assistance began to arrive over the weekend. China and Russia have sent aid and personnel, while India,Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore have also sent assistance.A rescue team from Taiwan has also been standing ready to provide assistance to Myanmar but has not been called upon, amid speculation that the team was denied entry so as not to offend Taiwan’s enemy and Myanmar’s ally China.The earthquake happened just as many humanitarian agencies were cutting back projects in Myanmar after Donald Trump’s cuts to the main US humanitarian group, USAID.The US state department said on Monday, three days after the quake struck, that a USAid team was heading to Myanmar to help identify the country’s most pressing needs, a move thatlagged far behind the aid efforts of other countriesthat are already on the ground.State department spokesperson Tammy Bruce denied that funding and personnel cuts were impeding USAid’s response and said Washington was working with partners in Myanmar to get help to affected people.Sarah Charles, who headed the agency’s humanitarian assistance bureau until February last year, said the response had been hurt by “a lot of internal confusion about capability to respond and willingness to respond”. Cuts by the so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, had delayed what would have been the start of a US emergency response within 24 hours of the disaster, Charles said.The UN representative in Myanmar, Marcoluigi Corsi, said: “Even before this earthquake, nearly 20 million people in Myanmar were in need of humanitarian assistance.“This latest tragedy compounds an already dire crisis and risks further eroding the resilience of communities already battered by conflict, displacement and past disasters.”Aftermath of the Myanmar earthquake – a visual guideRead moreMyanmar was already in crisis before the disaster, due to a spiralling conflict triggered when themilitary seized power in a coup in 2021. The junta is facing an armed resistance to its rule, formed of civilians who took up arms to fight for the return of democracy, and armed ethnic organisations that have long fought for independence.It has lost swathes of territory and responded with relentless airstrikes, which continued after the devastating quake, even close to the epicentre.In neighbouring Thailand, which was also affected by the quake, authorities were investigating possible factors that led to the devastating collapse of a Bangkok construction site, where dozens remain missing.The Bangkok deputy governor Tavida Kamolvej has indicated it is unlikely that anybody else will be rescued from the building that collapsed. At least 19 people are known to have been killed in Thailand.The country’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, has also called a meeting with government departments responsible for sending SMS alerts to the public, amid criticism of the response when the earthquake struck.Agence France-Presse andAssociated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsMyanmarThailandAsia PacificSouth and central AsiaEarthquakesnewsShareReuse this content"

It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”.Trump’s latest threat – more explicit and violent than any made before – came after he sent a letter to Iran, as yet undisclosed,offering to hold talks on its nuclear programme. Iran had sent a reply to the US stating it was willing to hold indirect talks, officials confirmed.Esmail Baghaei, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, said of Trump’s threat: “The explicit threat of bombing Iran by the head of a country is clear contradiction to the essence of international peace and security.“Such a threat is a gross violation of the United Nations charter and a violation of the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards regime. Violence brings violence and peace creates peace, America can choose.”The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a sceptic about talks with the US, said Iran was “not overly concerned” by Trump’s words. “We consider it unlikely that such harm would come from outside. However, if any malicious act does occur, it will certainly be met with a firmand decisive response,” he said.Brig Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the Revolutionary Guard’s aerospace force, said: “Someone in glass houses does not throw stones at anyone,” adding: “The Americans have at least 10 bases with 50,000 troops in the region, meaning they are sitting in a glass house.”But the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, clearly had authority to keep the prospect of talks alive, saying Iran had already replied to the Trump letter through intermediaries in Oman and adding he knew the Iranian letter had now reached the US. Araghchi said direct talks were not possible while the US continued to threaten and bully Iran.View image in fullscreenIran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi.Photograph: Karen Minasyan/AFP/Getty ImagesTrump sent his original letter proposing talks through the United Arab Emirates’ senior diplomatic envoy, Anwar Gargash.The choice of Gargash as an intermediary was seen as a sign that the letter was intended to give negotiations a genuine chance, rather than leave Iran no option but to reject the offer of talks.Trump has set a deadline of mid-May for progress to be made, but a longer deadline also exists of mid-August, by which time the original 2015 nuclear agreement will largely expire and a European response will be required. Trumptook the US out of that agreementin 2018, a move widely seen as a mistake since it led Iran to speed up its uranium enrichment programme.That Iran sent its reply through Oman, its traditional chosen mediator, rather than the UAE may suggest Iran does not want the UAE – which has normalised relations with Israel – to act as intermediaries. The US and Iran had held indirect talks on reviving the nuclear agreement under the Biden administrationin Vienna from 2021, but they fizzled out, and all sides agreed the indirect nature of the talks ate up time, something Trump is reluctant to offer Iran.Some of the ground will have been covered in four rounds of parallel talks held between Iranian and European negotiators in Geneva.Contempt as Trump claims he can run for third term: ‘This is what dictators do’Read moreTehran has not commented on how broadly the Trump letter went in demanding concessions from Iran. But the Iranian ambassador to Iraq, Mohammad Kazem al-Sadegh, indicated the US was seeking talks that went wider than the nuclear programme, saying the letter called for the disbandment of the Iranian-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces militia.The US administration has been divided over whether to simply demand Iran expose its civil nuclear programme to fuller international inspection, or make a wider set of demands including a complete end to its nuclear programme and an Iranian commitment to stop bankrolling resistance groups in the Middle East such as Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen.The US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, has called for the “full dismantlement” of the Iranian nuclear programme, something Tehran rejects. By contrast, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, spoke only of restricting Iran’s nuclear programme, something Iran has been willing to accept since 2015 so long as it leads to a lifting of sanctions on the Iranian economy. Some inside the Trump administration believe an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities will produce regime change.Trump will want assurances, at the very least, that a revived Iranian economy will not just lead to extra funds for Iranian-backed militia. Kamal Kharazi, the head of Iran’s strategic council on foreign relations and sometimes touted as a chief negotiator, has accused the US of operating a psychological war by adopting a policy of “either war or negotiation”.Widespread rejection in the Gulf of a US-inspired attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is a relatively new factor in the equation, and Trump’s plan to reportedly visit Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip means he may personally hear strong opposition to an attack on Iran from the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.The Gulf’s opposition to an attack on Iran is based not on close ideological affinity with Iran, but on a sense the region must avoid further political instability, and with the current Iranian leadership already weakened, regime change is not something they welcome.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIran nuclear dealDonald TrumpNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

Cynthia Erivo’s nomination for Wicked earlier this year marks the first time a woman of colour has been nominated for the leading actress Oscar more than once (she was previously nominated for Harriet). Only 15 black women have ever been in contention for the prize.Speaking on upcoming documentary Number One on the Call Sheet, Berry said that the 23 years since her victory have “forced me to ask myself, did it matter? Did it really change anything for women of colour? For my sisters? For our journey?”Number One on the Call Sheet review – a spectacular tribute to black excellence in HollywoodRead moreBerry adds that she felt the tide would turn in 2021, when both Andra Day and Viola Davis were nominated, for The United States vs Billie Holiday and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom respectively.“I felt 100% sure that this was the year one of them was gonna walk away with this award,” she says, adding: “For equally different and beautiful reasons, they both deserved it, and I thought for sure.”However, both women losing out to Frances McDormand for Nomadland made Berry reconsider, she said.“The system is not really designed for us, and so we have to stop coveting that which is not for us. Because at the end of the day, it’s ‘How do we touch the lives of people?’ and that fundamentally is what art is for.”The documentary also features Taraji P Henson andWhoopi Goldbergexpressing amazement over the dearth of leading actress winners – and nominees.“Wait a minute, none of us were good enough?” Goldberg asks. “Nobody?

Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found.”The bodies of the three soldiers were recovered after a massive six-day effort by US, Polish and Lithuanian armed forces and authorities to dig the M88 Hercules armoured recovery vehicle out of a peat bog.Search and rescue teams worked with heavy equipment and excavators to remove silt from the water before eventually towing the vehicle out early on Monday.“Three US army soldiers assigned to 1st Armored brigade combat team, 3rd infantry division were found deceased in Lithuania today, 31 March,” US ArmyEuropeand Africa’s public affairs office said in a statement. The soldiers’ identities were being “withheld pending notification of next of kin”, it added.Hundreds of local and foreign troops and other rescue workers, including engineers and divers, were involved in the rescue operation to recover the armoured vehicle.Lithuanian armed forces provided military helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, unmanned aerial systems and search-and-rescue personnel. They brought in additional excavators, sluice and slurry pumps, other heavy construction equipment, technical experts and several hundred tonnes of gravel and earth to help the recovery.US navy divers were able to manoeuvre through thick layers of mud, clay and sediment “with zero visibility” to reach the 63-tonne vehicle on Sunday evening and find two points to attach steel cables, according to the command.The command said that during the effort to pull the vehicle out, it began to lose traction, so additional heavy bulldozers were brought in and attached to provide additional grip. The vehicle was pulled free after about two hours.The US navy dive team is searching the area using radar for the missing fourth soldier.Maj Gen Curtis Taylor, commander of Task Force Iron and the 1st Armored division, thanked the “heroic efforts” of those involved in the search and recovery. The US army and Lithuanian authorities are investigating what caused the incident.Lithuania, a Nato and EU member, hosts more than 1,000 US troops stationed on a rotational basis.Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS militaryLithuaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I’m here in person.”Musk and groups he supports have spent more than $20m to help conservative favourite Brad Schimel in Tuesday’s race, which will determinethe ideological makeup of a courtlikely to decide key issues in a perennial battleground state. Musk has increasingly become the center of the contest, with liberal favourite Susan Crawford and her allies protesting Musk and what they say is the influence he wants to have on the court.“I think this will be important for the future of civilization,” he said. “It’s that’s significant.”He noted that the state high court may well take up redistricting of congressional districts, which could ultimately affect which party controls the US House.Wisconsin supreme court race a litmus test for Elon Musk’s political powerRead more“And if the [Wisconsin] supreme court is able to redraw the districts, they will gerrymander the district and depriveWisconsinof two seats on the Republican side,” Musk claimed. “Then they will try to stop all the government reforms we are getting done for you, the American people.”A unanimous state supreme court on Sunday refused to hear a last-minute attempt by the state’s Democratic attorney general to stop Musk from handing over the checks to two voters, a ruling that came just minutes before the planned start of the rally.Two lower courts had already rejected the legal challenge by Democrat Josh Kaul, who argues that Musk’s offer violates a state law. “Wisconsin law prohibits offering anything of value to induce anyone to vote,” Kaul argued in his filing. “Yet,Elon Muskdid just that.”But the state supreme court, which is now controlled four-to-three by liberal justices, declined to take the case as an original action. The court gave no rationale for its decision. All four liberal justices have endorsed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, the Democratic-backed candidate.Kaul had no immediate comment on the court’s order.Musk’s attorneys argued in filings with the court that Musk was exercising his free speech rights with the giveaways and any attempt to restrict that would violate both the Wisconsin and US constitutions.The payments are “intended to generate a grassroots movement in opposition to activist judges, not to expressly advocate for or against any candidate,” Musk’s attorneys argued in court filings.Musk’s political action committee used anearly identical tactic before the presidential electionlast year, offering to pay $1m a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second amendments. A judge in Pennsylvania said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.Musk’s attorneys, about four hours before the rally was to begin, asked that two liberal justices who have campaigned for Crawford – Jill Karofsky and Rebecca Dallet – recuse themselves from the case. His attorneys argued their work for Crawford creates “the spectre of inappropriate bias.” If they did recuse, that would leave the court with a three-two conservative majority.Both justices rejected the request and said they would spell out their reasons why at a later date.One of the court’s conservative justices has endorsed Schimel, who wore a “Make America Great Again” hat while campaigning Sunday.Schimel said in a national television interview that he does not control “any of the spending from any outside group, whether it’s Elon Musk or anyone else” and that all Trump asked was whether he would “reject activist judges” and follow the law.“That’s exactly what I’ve committed to anybody, whether it’s President Trump, Elon Musk or any donors and donors or supporters or voters in Wisconsin. That’s my commitment,” Schimel told Fox News Sunday.The contest has shattered national spending records for a judicial election, with more than $81m in spending.It comes as Wisconsin’s highest court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election in the state.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskUS politicsTrump administrationWisconsinnewsShareReuse this content"

Kennedy’s murder has been attributed to lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald.Stone’s 1991 film JFK faced harsh criticism from historians for its suggestions that Kennedy’s death was the result of high-level conspiracies. Stone has said Kennedy was not killed by a single assassin and believes certain elements within the US intelligence community were involved.The Justice Department and other federal government bodies have reaffirmed the conclusion in the intervening decades that Oswald acted alone. But polls show many Americans still believe his death was the result of a conspiracy.Also testifying on Tuesday are journalist and author Jefferson Morley and author James DiEugenio. Morley said on social media he will focus on the CIA’s complete pre-assassination file on Oswald during the hearing.Trump promised on the campaign trail to provide more transparency about Kennedy’s death.Explore more on these topicsFilmOliver StoneJohn F KennedyHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

The US embassy in Paris sent letters to a few dozen French companies, it noted, informing them that the rollback of diversity measures applies to all suppliers and service providers of the US government, regardless of where they are based.The letter asked recipients to complete, sign and return within five days a form certifying that they “do not operate any programmes to promote diversity, equity and inclusion” according to Le Figaro, which published what it said was a copy of the letter.“If you do not agree to sign this document, we would appreciate it if you could provide detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal teams,” the letter continued.France’s trade ministry was swift to respond. “American interference in the inclusion policies of French companies – along with threats of unjustified tariffs – is unacceptable,” it said in a statement. It vowed thatFranceand Europe would defend “the companies, their consumers, but also their values”.While affirmative action policies are largely illegal in France, which bans decisions based on a person’s origin, ethnic group or religion, efforts by large companies to diversify their recruitment pools and quotas have turned the countryinto a global leaderwhen it comes to the number of women on company boards.On Sunday France’s minister for gender equality, Aurore Bergé, described the letter as an obvious “form of interference.” Speaking to the broadcaster BFMTV, she added: “That’s to say it’s an attempt to impose a diktat on our businesses.”The French government was working to determine exactly how many companies had received the letter, she said. “It is out of the question that we will prevent our businesses from promoting additional social progress [and] social rights,” said Bergé. “Thankfully, a lot of French companies don’t plan to change their policies.”Similar requests were reportedly received by companies inItaly and Spainas well as ineastern Europe.On Sunday, Belgium’s deputy prime minister, Jan Jambon, also pushed back against the US efforts. “We have no lessons to learn from the boss of America,” he told the RTL-TVi television channel.The country’s minister of foreign affairs, Maxime Prévot, said Belgium “would not take a single step backwards” and that the government was exploring how best to legally respond to the US,he told newspaper HLN.The US request comes at a delicate moment for the transatlantic relationship, which has been left troubled amid threats ofescalating tariffs,security concernsand the recent Signal leaks thatlaid barethe Trump administration’s disdain for Europe.In Belgium, the minister of equal opportunities, Rob Beenders, pointed to the wider picture of what was at stake. “Companies that embrace diversity benefit from more creativity, innovation and a better connection with their customers,”he said.His viewwas backed upby a 2020 report by McKinsey & Company that found companies with greater gender and ethnic diversity were more likely to outperform their peers. The difference was significant, with gender diversity leading to a 25% probability of higher profits, while ethnic diversity led to a 36% probability.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionDonald TrumpEuropeBelgiumFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Its simple, honest, perfect songs of protest have mesmerised the writer ever sinceZadie SmithMon 31 Mar 2025 10.56 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 12.22 EDTShareOn 11 June 1988, I was 12 and sitting with my family watching the Free Nelson Mandela Concert on TV. As a clan, we were old hands at trying to free Mandela, having done our fair share of marching and boycotting over the years, and this concert felt like the culmination of all that. There was a lot of excitement in the room: we squeezed on to the sofa and opened the windows wide. (If the wind’s blowing in the right direction, you can hear a Wembley audience roar from Willesden.)Many world-famous musicians played that day. Most of them I don’t remember, but one I will never forget: Tracy Chapman. I think a lot of people feel that way, though when you rewatch the footage you realise what she was up against at the time. Nobody cheers as she takes the stage. In fact, the crowd seem hardly aware she’s arrived. People are chanting, chatting or just partying among themselves.She looked like our mother: no make-up and the same three-inch dreadlocksDrafted in as replacement for Stevie Wonder – who had last-minute technical issues – it must have taken a lot of courage for an unknown 24-year-old to play in front of 90,000 people, not to mention a worldwide television audience of 600 million. And on the first line of Fast Car, her voice does break, a little. For a moment, you spy the Harvard Square busker she’d so recently been, demoralised by all the commuters and the students rushing by …But a second later, she has everybody’s full attention. Now there is only her guitar, the melody, the words.I want a ticket to anywhere / Maybe we make a deal / Maybe together we can get somewhere.It’s such an intimate, unexpected performance. Bombastic music was in style, and Wembley in particular was the home of spectacle and theatrics. Chapman was something completely different: a protest singer with an acoustic guitar. It’s wonderful to watch that mammoth crowd fall into an awed silence.Back in Willesden, we were pretty stunned too, although perhaps for different reasons. For us, it was the shock of the familiar. She was dressed just like the young activists you saw on the marches – black cowlneck T, black jeans, black boots – and she even looked like our mother: no makeup and the same three-inch dreadlocks. She was so … familiar. We also recognised the musical lineage. That rich alto timbre. It was like listening to the daughter ofJoan Armatrading.But what was such a person doing on television? That really felt unprecedented. And she didn’t just look like the people on our side of the screen, she was singing our songs. Songs of everyday struggle, working-class experience, poverty, drink, political protest, domestic troubles, thwarted dreams. She was talkin’ about a revolution. On the BBC!View image in fullscreen‘No fat, no filler’ … the debut albumIn 1988, we lived in a monoculture. By the end of that summer, it seemed like pretty much everyone who had any interest in music at all had made a pilgrimage to Woolworths or Our Price and bought her debut album, Tracy Chapman. By autumn, those 11 songs had buried themselves deep into so many people’s lives, affecting our political thinking, romantic dreams, existential beliefs, Top 10 lists. All because of that one performance.None of this was typical. Most artists of that period had juggernaut PR machines around them, but with Chapman the communication was singular and direct, from singer to eardrum, and nothing could get in the way of it, and nothing extra was needed to amplify it. For years after that concert, I don’t recall reading a single interview with her, and I don’t think I saw her perform again until she sang Fast Car with Luke Combs at the 2024 Grammys.For years, the only photograph I’d ever seen of her was the one on the front of that first album. Yet despite knowing next to nothing about her, I and millions of others have been listening to her for decades. When you write songs like Tracy Chapman does, you don’t really need to do anything else but that. Her debut is the articulation of this principle: 11 perfect songs, with no fat and no filler, driven by a clear unity of purpose that announces itself from the get-go and never lets up.View image in fullscreen‘A reclamation of unity’ … Chapman in Los Angeles, circa 1988.Photograph: Lester Cohen/Getty ImagesThis is an album about “the people”. They are addressed directly in Talkin’ Bout a Revolution, and kept in mind throughout: the labour they perform, their hopes and aspirations, the loves they’ve gained and lost, their mistakes and shames, even their crimes. Lyrically, they are known but never idealised. They are certainly the working poor but they are more than the “proletariat”. They are also human beings. Full of human contradictions. Sometimes, for example, they want “mountains of things” instead of freedom. Not infrequently they do dangerous or dumb things, or make poor decisions that make their already hard lives worse. Behind the wall, a man beats his wife. Love ennobles the people, as it ennobles everybody, but love also just as often gets disrupted or crushed by the pressing demands of sheer survival.What is never forgotten, not even for a line, is how the American game is rigged against them, at every turn. Working them half to death for the minimum wage, or creating division where solidarity is required:Across the lines/ Who would dare to go /Under the bridge/Over the tracks / That separate whites from blacks?Black women were soul- singers or pop stars. Folk was another country. But Chapman went across all these linesOne of the things that most moved me about this album was not only its challenge to the segregated politics of American life, but its reclamation of the unity of American music. Now thatBeyoncé can top the country chartsand we have musicians such as Rhiannon Giddens performing with equal expertise at the Newport folk and jazz festivals, it’s sometimes hard to remember how rigidly binary the American music business was in the 1980s and 90s. It was incredibly difficult back then to imagine a folk singer with a guitar existing outside of the paradigm set by Bob Dylan. Hip-hop could be and often was “protest music”, but black women were soul singers or pop stars. We could sing the blues and jazz, but folk was another country. Chapman went across all these lines, singing passionately about one country and the working people who live there, employing a stripped-down production that still feels profoundly radical.There’s never a good moment, I’d imagine, for a young artist to explain to their record label that they want to record an a cappella lament about domestic violence. But somehow, on Tracy Chapman, there it is: an unforgettable human voice, untampered by anything else, singing an excruciating truth.It won’t do no good to call / The police always come late / If they come at all.The poor people described in Tracy Chapman do not have all the answers, but they are hungry for truth. They don’t want to be lied to any more, not by politicians or employers or neighbours or lovers. The truths they want to hear are not particularly complex but they are essential. That’s the job of a protest singer, in my view: to remind technocrats and politicians and all those who hold power of the fundamental concerns of the people.Listening to the track Why? now, as this masterful album is rereleased, it’s astonishing how few answers we presently have to Chapman’s basic questions:Why do the babies starve? / There’s enough food to feed the world / Why when there are so many of us / Are there people still alone? // Why are the missiles called peacekeepers / When they’re aimed to kill? / Why is a woman still not safe / When she’s in her home?That simple, honest language is the tool of the protest singer. The Orwellian doublespeak that follows, meanwhile, is all too familiar, and continues to be employed at the highest levels of American power:Love is hate / War is peace / No is yes /We’re all free.Chapman’s sheer melodic beauty and committed, generous lyrics are a gift to her listeners. But I feel that her career – which started with this extraordinary album – has also served as a startling and humbling example to artists. She reminds us that an artist can pursue an individual course without being individualistic. That she can speak to many without necessarily speaking to the press. That there is such a thing as privacy, and that every human being has a right to it.Finally, and most vitally, that a soul is something worth holding on to. In fact, it’s pretty much all that you have.Tracy Chapman’s debut album is rereleased on vinyl on 4 AprilExplore more on these topicsMusicFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Farewell Richard Chamberlain, TV eye-candy extraordinaireFrom vestment-ripper The Thorn Birds to the steamy Dr Kildare, the actor – who has died at 90 – was known for playing devastatingly attractive and unattainable menMark LawsonMon 31 Mar 2025 13.39 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 13.41 EDTShareRichard Chamberlain,who has died at 90, achieved exceptional television celebrity by playing devastatingly attractive men whose professions made them unavailable to women.In The Thorn Birds – a 1983 miniseries that achieved huge ratings for ABC in the US and BBC One in the UK – he was Ralph De Bricassart, a Catholic priest whose vow of celibacy is tested beyond breaking point over four decades by Meggie, a young woman whom he meets on an Australian sheep farm.Based on a 1977 bestseller by Colleen McCullough, the drama benefited from finding a way of making attraction dangerous again in a post-60s era of sexual freedom. Watched by almost 60% of the available American TV audience – an extraordinarily high score – it got 16 Emmy nominations, winning six. Unusually, its British TV premiere – on 8 January 1984, between ratings hits Hi-De-Hi! and That’s Life! – was given a standalone preview programme in the previous week. Comprising an interview with Chamberlain, it was a tribute to his fame and the international impact of The Thorn Birds.View image in fullscreenMaking attraction dangerous again … Richard Chamberlain with Rachel Ward in The Thorn Birds.Photograph: Warner Bros. Television/AllstarRepeated in 1988, the vestment-ripper became one of the most resonant TV memories for the Boomer generation. Chamberlain’s performance may have influenced the dashing celibate who became known as the “hot priest” in Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag.The Thorn Birds required Ralph to be irresistible to women and his casting reflected a previous triumph as TV eye-candy – in 191 episodes of the NBC medical drama Dr Kildare, from 1961 to 1966. For Chamberlain’s Dr James Kildare, who rose from intern to resident at the fictional Blair General hospital, the throbbing hearts he heard through his stethoscope were mainly caused by him, not cardiac conditions. Patients were as off-limits as Bricassart’s parishioners would be later, although publicity pictures showed Chamberlain flushing a syringe that may have been suggestive. While Kildare was a good enough doctor to have removed his own appendix when caught in an emergency without a surgeon, the point of the character was his looks.View image in fullscreenHeart-throbbing stuff … Chamberlain as Dr Kildare.Photograph: NBCUPHOTOBANK/Rex FeaturesChamberlain’s facility for acting out the tensions of forbidden love may have been helped by the fact that the actor playing these famous objects of female desire was gay, a fact he did not confirm until a 2003 memoir. Recounting a relationship with the actor-producer Martin Rabbett that endured across five decades until Rabbett’s death, the book also reflected on the psychological cost of passing as straight on and off screen, with one lie perpetuating another. The Thorn Birds, for example, led to his casting as the legendarily heterosexual Casanova.Some among younger generations of gay men may lament Chamberlain’s reticence about his sexuality, but there seems little doubt that lifelong honesty would have disqualified him from those career-making roles as Kildare and Bricassart at a time when, at least theoretical, sexual availability was seen as a crucial part of superstardom.The third standout TV role of Chamberlain’s career is overshadowed by different sensitivities. In the 1980 version of Shōgun, the actor was typically charismatic and dashing in a five-part adaptation of James Clavell’s novel about John Blackthorne, an English sailor captured by samurai and forced to adopt Japanese identity, butthe more culturally precise 2024 remakewill outrank it in TV history.A skilled enough actor to have played Hamlet to good notices on stage in England and on TV in the US, Chamberlain was at his best on television. His particular success in miniseries spoke to a rare ability to encourage viewers to come back night after night, week after week. His impact was shown by a steady flow of late-career cameos in shows including Nip/Tuck, Hustle and Will & Grace.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The irresistible comedy that could just save AmazonLast One Laughing UK, a reality show in which comedians like Mortimer, Daisy May Cooper and Richard Ayoade try to make each other laugh, has gone viral with good reason … it’s a total hootStuart HeritageMon 31 Mar 2025 09.14 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 10.15 EDTShareAs you can probably tell by spending any time on it, Amazon Prime Video is in trouble. Citadel, its $300m Russo brothers-produced international spy thriller series, was met with widespread indifference. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, a show that will end up costing Amazon a billion dollars, is destined to go down as one of the worst investments of all time. Everywhere you look, the platform is wall-to-wall duds.And yet there is one glimmer of hope. The sole scrap of buzz Amazon has generated in months comes in the form of a cheap little reality show. Last One Laughing UK has been all over social media for the last couple of weeks, clipped up and shared across TikTok, Instagram and X. And this is down to its deceptively simple premise: a bunch of comedians sit in a room together and try to make each other laugh. If they laugh, they’re out. That’s all there is to it.View image in fullscreenWeirdly thrilling … Daisy May Cooper screws up her face like she is trying not to breathe in a fart so as not to laugh.Photograph: AmazonLast One Laughing UK has summoned some genuinely funny people for the show, among them Richard Ayoade, Bob Mortimer, Lou Sanders, Daisy May Cooper and Joe Wilkinson. You can see why they were so eager to sign up, too, because the show is about as low stakes as you can get. It follows the loose Big Brother format, where everyone has to share a common area. But the entire show only represents a six-hour commitment for them. They made multiple episodes of television in less time than it takes to watch The Brutalist twice. Even ignoring the quality of the final product, that’s an extremely efficient way to go about business.The show presents the contestants with a chance to recycle some of their old material. Most of the viral clips have revolved around Bob Mortimer, who performed a magic act first seen onThe Smell of Reeves and Mortimer30 years ago and sang some songs heposted on social mediaduring Covid. The fact that these routines not only found new life on LOL UK, but also pushed his fellow contestants to the brink, is testament to Mortimer’s talent.View image in fullscreenPushing his fellow contestants to the brink … Bob Mortimer on Last One Laughing UK.Photograph: AmazonBut Mortimer isn’t solely responsible for the LOL UK highlight reel. Richard Ayoade’s shockingly aggressive pursuit of laughs was another standout moment. Joe Wilkinson’s bizarre little Stars in their Eyes sequence was punishingly funny, as was the surprise appearance of Danny Dyer.There’s also something really irresistible in watching people trying their hardest to quell a response as involuntary as laughter. Daisy May Cooper’s attempt to shut herself down, which involved screwing up her face like she was trying not to breathe in a fart, is funny in itself. Judi Love often looked like a woman who’d swallowed a live grenade. Harriet Kemsley, who may well be the breakout contestant of the whole show, at one point looked as if she was having a nervous breakdown trying to stop a laugh from leaking out. It’s weirdly thrilling to watch something as mundane as a cracking poker face.View image in fullscreenPoker face! … Judi Love tries not to laugh on Last One Laughing UK.Photograph: AmazonIn truth, the UK is late to the LOL game. Like almost every other successful reality show, from Big Brother to The Traitors, Last One Laughing is a foreign format that circled the globe before arriving here – in this case, it’s based on a Japanese show called Documental that first aired in 2016. Since then, versions have sprung up in 27 different countries, from Albania to Indonesia. Trevor Noah hosted the South African version, Graham Norton hosted Ireland’s and Rebel Wilson hosted Australia’s. For us, it’s Jimmy Carr. There is an argument that LOL UK’s success hinges less on the British sense of humour than a watertight format. After all, if it works in Russia – where it aired in 2023 – you suspect it can work anywhere.Last One Laughing UK has been compared to Taskmaster, but that isn’t entirely fair. Taskmaster is an intricately assembled series that rewards lateral thinking, whereas this is essentially just people sitting around for a few hours. But it is nevertheless very funny. More importantly – unlike most Amazon shows – people are actually talking about it. It must be strange being an Amazon executive this week. You spent all that money on Lord of the Rings, but it turns out that people far prefer the sight of Bob Mortimer sitting on a squeaky chair. What a world.Last One Laughing UK is on Prime Video now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dignity began life during a holiday in Crete in 1985. I bought Sounds magazine at the airport. Morrissey was on the cover and the headline “Home thoughts from abroad” got me thinking about Glasgow. I was living in a tenement flat in Pollokshields, from where I’d see the cleansing department guys sweeping the road. So I started writing about a “worker for the council, has been 20 years” who dreamed of sailing away on a “ship called Dignity”.I made the boat a dinghy because it felt like something a cleaner might afford. The “Sunblest bag” mentioned was a reference to a popular make of bread, while “raki” was the local drink on that holiday. I softened the line “he takes no crap off nobody and dog shit off the gutter” to “litter” because we realised radio would never play it otherwise. At a time of mass unemployment, the song was more about what employment does for people: the dignity of labour.When we play Dignity live now, I hardly sing the first verse because the audience does itIt hung around on a cassette tape through various early lineups of the band, but once we started playing it as the settled band, it gelled. When we demoed it, a band had been in the studio the day before and had hired a piano. Our keyboard player Jim Prime was working in a bank, but I’ll always remember he said: “I’ll come in and play the piano before someone takes it away.” Then he came up with this brilliant cascading melody that alludes to Nick Lowe’s I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass, which brought the song to life. That demo got us our record deal. Then we recorded it with Jon Kelly, playing live in Air Studios in London. The wall of guitars at the end is a nod to Lloyd Cole and the Commotions’ Forest Fire, which I loved.I remember Jon asking: “Do you have any songs that appeal to 12 to 14-year-old girls? Because they’re the ones who buy singles.” I said: “No.” Dignity’s highest chart position was No 20, but it’s become a sort of folk song. It’s played at weddings, funerals. Dundee United play it when we win and I’ve met people who’ve told me, “I was a worker for the council for 20 years” – just like the guy in the song.Lorraine McIntosh, backing vocalsWhen I first heard Dignity, I was in the audience. It was 1986 and Deacon Blue were playing Queen Margaret Union in Glasgow. I wanted to join in. Ricky had asked me to sing on some demos but I was away on holiday so they used another backing vocalist. When I got back, they asked me to do some more demos and a gig. So I was in.Dignity was obviously a special song, but I was 21 or 22 and couldn’t relate to the lyrics. I’d not worked for the council for 20 years and didn’t need a dream because at that age I had everything ahead of me. However, at gigs I realised that people really related to it, so I picked out the bits that I felt the audience would want highlighting, to sing along with.We never do it at soundchecks except for once, at a gig in Glasgow after some council workers with shovels asked for itI sing more on Dignity live now than I do on the original record. When we recorded it, I was more interested in London’s brilliant cafes and sausage sandwiches down the road. I was an innocent abroad and when we stayed in the Columbia hotel there was a fantastic coming together of Deacon Blue, Prefab Sprout and Noddy Holder in the hotel bar.We did a second recording, with Bob Clearmountain, and Ricky did the new vocals in New York. There was so much re-recording and different videos because the record company were determined it would be a hit. Eventually it crawled into the charts, but then it took on a life of its own. When we play Dignity live now, I hardly sing the first verse because the audience are singing it. A while back, people asked if the lyric was “sail it up” or “set it up”. When Ricky said “sail”, I realised I’d been singing the wrong word for 30 years.Once, when we were soundchecking for a Hogmanay gig in Glasgow’s George Square, the ground was frozen and there were council workers with shovels working in front of the stage. One of them shouted: “Ricky, do Dignity!” But we never do it at a soundcheck. Ricky said: “Actually, I think we owe you one.” And we played Dignity for them.Deacon Blue’s new album, The Great Western Road, is out now.

But with ‘sublime’ sounds came struggles with substances. Her intense new album peels back the plasterMon 31 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 08.59 EDTShare‘Kissed by a witch, I got hexed!” Aya howls through a storm of screaming electronics and bass groans on I Am the Pipe I Hit Myself With. The song revisits a time before Aya Sinclair was one of the UK avant garde’s most exciting talents – when she was still aHuddersfieldteenager, newly into Christian rock. The music gave her “this tingly, bubbly sensation”, she says. “And someone said: ‘This is the holy spirit.’” The experience led her to join a Pentecostal congregation for a couple of years, but after confiding in a church friend about some “feelings” – Sinclair would later come out as a trans woman – she was “kicked out for being queer, essentially. I was given an ultimatum, to either closet myself or leave.” As she whispers in this track, over the quickening click of a Geiger counter, “they had me out on a witch-hunt, when I found myself”.It’s a suitably vulnerable, conflicted opener to her new album Hexed!, which plays out in a lurching mix of heavy metal and hardcore electronics. The record sounds twisted and contorted, wincing at the pain of “peeling back the plaster”, she says over a video call. She is warm, funny and seemingly at peace – following the traumas and battles with substance abuse that she revisits on this nightmarish, alien album.Aya: Off to the Esso – videoIn her youth, Sinclair, now 31, used to love going for night walks. But seeing the suburban Huddersfield homes where she had once imagined starting a heteronormative family life gave her a “knotty feeling”. She now recognises that feeling as “latent queerness that wasn’t presenting itself yet – the knowledge that it wasn’t a life I could ever have”. Having come out as trans in 2018, she is in an ongoing process of understanding her gender identity. “My body is constantly changing, which is on the one hand very exciting,” she says, “but at the same time is also confusing.” She also notes that, as a woman, “I can’t walk on my own at night any more.”As a musician, Aya speaks of being able to “contact this sublime, other essence” by drawing “excitement from sound”. But she also admits that “chasing that high through rave music has led me to some pretty dark relationships with substances”. After struggles with ketamine, cocaine and alcohol abuse, she is, on the day of our interview, six months clean.‘My first impression was this person’s a genius’: the life and legacy of producer pioneer SophieRead moreAya moved toManchesterin 2016, not long after the opening of The White Hotel, a former car repair workshop turned club in Salford and the locus for a new wave of local experimentalists. These included Iceboy Violet, with whom she formed the collective boygirl under her previous moniker Loft, and Tom Boogizm who she says “can DJ for 10 hours, but then make the most heartbreaking ambient record [as Rat Heart] you’ve ever heard – that dual energy represents Manchester to me.”A visit to 2019’s Bang Face festival at Pontins holiday park in Southport, Merseyside, influenced her acclaimed 2021 debut album Im Hole. “You go into places where there’s usually someone doing balloon animals to families,” she says, “but instead, everyone’s off their face on dingers, and you’re watching the most blown-out, 200bpm hardcore you’ve ever heard.”But her time in the north was also difficult. The body horror of Hexed! track Heat Death, picturing inflating cerebellums and broken teeth, was inspired by a period of “really intense, dissociative panic attacks. Losing two hours, coming around and thinking: ‘OK, well I guess I got off the train – I’m covered in snot and tears, and have no idea how I got here, but at least I’m in Manchester.’” While she still has these experiences, “they’re way less frequent and more manageable now that I’m sober”.View image in fullscreenTelling ‘the past through the future’ … Aya.Photograph: Dee IskrzynskaShe illustrates the chaos of the period pre-sobriety through scattershot lyrics. The album’s stories blur time periods and locations, and the boundaries between narration and dialogue, reality and nightmare. “I’m slipping down the slope again / You’re gripping for the soap / I’m gipping on the coke,” she yells on Off to the Esso, a viscerally distressing picture of drug-fuelled nights out. She says she used substances as a way to provide “a level of distance from myself”, and manage her sensitivity to the world around her. “Unfortunately, that stops you fully engaging with the world as well.”Sinclair relocated to London in 2020 to move in with her partner, but the north still looms large on her new record, down to the regional slang in Off to the Esso: “I’m sizzled, sozzled, hen.” She found a way to “tell the past through the present” by marrying the rock of her Huddersfield teenage years with the hardcore dance music she discovered later. And the album ends on northern moorland, where Aya seems to lift the album’s titular hex. Bidding farewell to “received wisdom, to double glaze in the middle distance”, her pained screams become digitised, angelic refrains. On our video call, she grins as she pictures the scene. “We’ve run away from the three-bedroom house, and we’re on top of the moors. We’re screaming at the sky, and the sky is screaming back at us.”Hexed! is out now on HyperdubExplore more on these topicsExperimental musicElectronic musicManchesterHuddersfieldGreater ManchesterSexualityinterviewsShareReuse this content"

A work of often startling originality, it was hugely admired in its day and still hovers on the fringes of the repertory in the French-speaking world. Elsewhere, however, its outings have been sporadic, soChelsea Opera Groupcannot be too highly commended for tackling it in a very fine concert performance conducted by Paul Wingfield.The opera derives from theBreton legend of the city of Ysthat vanished, Atlantis-like, beneath the ocean. The king of the title, however, is not its central protagonist, and Lalo focuses on his two daughters, gracious Rozenn and imperious Margared, both in love with the soldier Mylio, initially believed a casualty of the recent war between Ys and the forces of the enemy prince Karnac. A pawn in her father’s politics, Margared is to marry Karnac as part of their peace treaty. But her refusal to do so on discovering that Mylio is both alive and loves Rozenn, leads first to the resumption of hostilities, then to her conspiring with Karnac to open the floodgates that protect the city from the sea.The work has often been dubbed Wagnerian, in part thanks to its dark, brass rich orchestral colouring and the echoes of Elsa and Ortrud in Lohengrin that inform Lalo’s depiction of the relationship between Rozenn and Margared. Yet the description is also in many ways wide of the mark as Lalo’s absolute conciseness of expression and avoidance of symphonic development are the antithesis of Wagnerian expansion. Reiterated rhythmic patterns, at times turning obsessive, drive the music forwards. The choruses, extensive and exacting, oscillate between ritual and violence. And the extraordinary vocal writing for Margared, clipped, neurotic and declamatory, fatally undermines the lyricism of all those round her.The performance was thrilling. Wingfield drove the score hard, its moments of edgy nervousness and the disturbing excitement of Lalo’s war music contrasting with the beauty of the love scenes between Mylio and Rozenn. Choral singing and playing were characterised by furious energy and commitment. Etching words and phrases in her lower register, Maria Schellenberg’s Margared was all hauteur and barely repressed rage. Rozenn has sometimes been depicted as gentle and timid, though Hye-Youn Lee portrays her as a woman of great moral certainty and strength. This is a beautiful voice, too. Mylio’s music lies high and Luis Gomes, though admirably heroic and lyrical, had a couple of moments of strain towards the end. Alexey Gusev, on the other hand, made a terrific Karnac, deeply attractive yet implacably malign. Thomas D Hopkinson was the dignified king. ChelseaOperaGroup at their best – and we need to hear the work itself much more frequently than we do.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

It also performed well for sushi and brown rice. It’s noYumAsia for complete rice perfection, but if you’re nervous about cooking rice in a pan, this is a great starting point. It does get incredibly hot, though.The genius carry-on bagView image in fullscreenAntler Essential overnight bag£125 at John Lewis£125 at AntlerThis bag “has had complete strangers stopping me in the street and on the Eurostar platform recently”, said Cartner-Morley in her March style essentials. “The clever thing … is the integral back strap, which allows it to slide over the pop-up handle of your wheeled suitcase. This keeps it sitting securely on top of your luggage without everything falling over in chaos when you try to buy a coffee or get on to a train.” It also fits easily into a luggage rack or under the seat in front.The natural deodorant that worksView image in fullscreenFussy natural deodorant£10 at FussyWith more and more of us wanting tocut back on plastic, it’s no surprise so many of you loved Anita Bhagwandas’s roundup of thebest refillable beauty products. And especially popular was this refillable deodorant from Fussy. “Unlike many ‘natural’ deodorants, it genuinely works,” she wrote. “Choose your recycled plastic case, andpick from several scents (I’m obsessed with Parma Violets)to create your own bespoke deodorant.”The cappuccino nailsView image in fullscreenNails Inc Turks And Caicos Beach nail polish£8 at AmazonNot only do “cappuccino-coloured nails look great with everything”, said Cartner-Morley in her monthly style essentials, but also the “shade is subtle enough that if – like me – you’re not exactly a dab hand on the DIY, a few application wobbles won’t show”.The all-rounder raincoatView image in fullscreenRains unisex long jacket£71.50 at John LewisScandinavian label Rains “is one of the brands I reach for whenever the weather takes a turn”, says Ellie Violet Bramley in ourguide to stylish raincoats. “Its long jacket has seen me through countless soggy commutes, playground trips and walks in the woods.” It’s machine-washable, too.The birthstone ringView image in fullscreenStacking family birthstone ringFrom £21.60 at EtsyThis sentimental gift idea was popular for Mother’s Day, but it would also make a lovely gift all year round, for mothers and friends alike. “If in a few years, my now three-year-old decided to give me one of these, her birthstone nestled next to mine, I can guarantee I would melt,” said Bramley in ourgift guide.The luxury loungewearView image in fullscreenSatin pyjamas£34.90 at UniqloLounging around must have become much more glamorous around the country after hundreds of you bought these satin pyjamas from ourMother’s Day gift guide.

Then I moved to London and, having no money, I had to start walking to places. Shockingly, I enjoyed itKate McCuskerMon 31 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTShareInever understood people who enjoy high-intensity exercise. Wine – yes. Films – obviously. Model trains – whatever floats your boat. But exercise? I didn’t get it. I wept on reformer pilates machines and left circuits classes halfway through under the guise of going to the toilet. I went to the park with the intention of running and instead lay down in the grass with a Cornetto. I pleaded illness – and once, the death of a fictional pet – to waive class cancellation fees. Exercise just wasn’t for me.And it’s not as if I didn’t try. I attempted swimming and barre, power yoga and boxing – all of it hellish, not to mention inaccessibly expensive. When I walked past a certain glass-fronted gym near my flat, invariably with some sort of snack in my hand, I felt a pang of pity for the people inside – sweaty, muscled prisoners, unable to free themselves from the tyranny of the treadmill.In the evenings, walking 90 minutes home from work is like making peace with the dayUnfortunately, it’s always been this way. I am innately athletically challenged – psychologically weak and unwilling to suffer for things I don’t want to do. For years I told myself that I was not the kind of person who engaged in the vapid world of physical activity. Then I started walking everywhere.At first, it was out of necessity – I had just moved to London, was broke, lonely, and couldn’t really grasp the concept of getting the bus in the right direction. At home in Omagh, Northern Ireland, to go for a walk was to drive to a destination and then spend 40 minutes tramping through a mucky forest or doing uninspiring laps of a lake. In London, I was amazed by the ground that could be covered just by walking an hour or two from my front door: Highgate cemetery, Hampstead Heath and, if I ever fancied spectral silence at the weekend, Moorgate, with all the bankers emptied out, were all within reasonable distance. Even now, I’m winded by the feeling of freedom and wonder I experience walking from one end of the city to the other.Discovering that I could move my body in a way that didn’t feel like some sort of gruelling punishment from God was revelatory. I mourned all the years I had spent sitting still.‘It’s a superpower’: how walking makes us healthier, happier and brainierRead moreThese days, walking is, for me, the exercise equivalent of hiding vegetables in my mashed potatoes: suddenly I’ve covered four miles in one stretch without really noticing. In the evenings, walking 90 minutes home from work is like making peace with the day, however good, bad or unremarkable it might have been. On weekends, I factor in walking time when making plans, and enjoy each mile knowing that I have someone I’m excited to see waiting for me at the other end.A few weeks ago, I trepidatiously joined a yoga class again after many years believing that the end (when you lie on the floor like a starfish) was the only worthwhile part. To my surprise, I didn’t have to take a break or scream at the instructor that downward dog did not count as a rest. Actually, I enjoyed it, and went back the next week and the next. But the walk there and back home was still the best part.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They are Elton John in platform shoes and outlandish glasses at his piano, they are Sabrina Carpenter in a glamorous dress as she drops her towel on stage.Much like a Hollywood starlet who lounges around all day in a dressing gown eating crisps only to emerge later in stunning fashion on the red carpet, fireflies are creatures of the night, where their spectacular light shows both enchant and confound us.These displays, a semaphore of love and attraction, differ across species and location. Perhaps the most awe-inspiring of the more than 2,000 species found around the world is the amber comet, Pyractomena vexillaria, which is only thought to remain in a few isolated patches of Texas andMexico.While some fireflies emit just a few short bleeps of light, the amber comet gives off something akin to a supernova. Ben Pfeiffer, a firefly researcher, was stunned to see this display a couple of years ago while idling beside a river in centralTexas, a state where the insect hadn’t been seen since the 1940s.The burning bright flash of light, followed by a trailing glow, was so intense it illuminated the grass around it. “All the other fireflies stopped flashing for about five seconds because it was so bright,” Pfeiffer said. “It was the coolest thing.”Let it glow: fireflies illuminating Japanese woodlands – in picturesRead moreVictoria-era Britons likened fireflies to fairies, native Americans saw them as spiritual messengers, in Italy a firefly in the house is a sign of divine good luck. Their magic is wondrous but has also been something of a mystery – it’s only in the last few decades where scientists have fully understood how fireflies are able to deploy bioluminescence, when luciferin, luciferase and oxygen interact in the “lantern” of their abdomen, for their light shows.It’s also, more sadly, only recently that we’ve realized what trouble fireflies are in. The amber comet is emblematic of this – much of its range in Mexico has been converted to agriculture, while housing and roads are now plonked onto its favored riparian areas in Texas, pushing the species towards extinction.Globally, fireflies – their relatives glowworms are better known in the UK, although all of these creatures are not flies nor worms but beetles – are part of a broader decline of insect life. We risk losing delight, as well as utility. So let’s vote for beauty, vote for dazzle, vote for the closest thing to fairies we have in this often benighted world.

Here it is again with the solution.Cheryl’s house number problemCheryl: I have thought of two distinct one-digit numbers. The last digit of the product of the two numbers is the last digit of Bernard’s house number. What is the sum of these two numbers?Albert: I do not know what Bernard’s house number is.Bernard: I know my house number, of course, and I know what the sum of the two numbers is.Albert: At first, I did not know what the sum of the two numbers is, but now I know.What is the sum of the two numbers?Solution10Let Cheryl’s two numbers beaandb. Here is a table of possible values for the final digit ofab, with the possible pairs whose product has that final digit, and the possible sumsa+b.View image in fullscreenSay Bernard’s house number ends in 2. Cheryl may have thought of 1 and 2 (1 x 2 = 2), or 3 and 4 (3 x 4 = 12), or 8 and 9 (8 x 9 = 72). So the suma+bcould be 3, 7, 17 etc. Bernard cannot know with 100 per cent certainty the value ofa+b.The only time Bernard can know the sum is when there is only one possibility fora+b. If you look at the table, the only timea+bis unique is when the last digit is 1 or 9. In both cases, the sum is 10.At the end of the process we do not know Cheryl’s numbers.

Alongside the expensive fashions bought with the proceeds of serious fraud are the tools needed to achieve it, says DCI Paul Curtis.“These are serious offenders and for whatever reason they felt the need to have these to protect themselves,” he says. Among the other tools are “Sim farms” bought on the dark web, which scammers use to send out numerous text messages at once; stacks of laptops; and mobile phones and payment card readers.The tools and spoils of crime have come from raids headed by the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit (DCPCU), whose offices theObservervisited this month. Tasked with uncovering payment fraud across the country and charging the perpetrators, this group of officers from the City of London andMetropolitan policeforces are at the forefront of the battle against fraud.Some of their most recent successes involved scammers who pretended to bebank officialsandpolice officersto defraud people, and a Chinese man whodrove around the West End of London sending masses of fake text messagesfrom a machine in his car.View image in fullscreenDCI Paul Curtis says fraud is ‘under-reported, and causes huge harm’.The National Crime Agency (NCA) estimates that 40% of crime is fraud-related; it puts the amount lost every year in the billions. Uncovering the criminals behind payment fraud is an uphill struggle.The problems are numerous: criminals are often based abroad and take advantage of constant advances in technology to dupe victims. But one difficulty is simple and prevalent, which is that people are so embarrassed to have fallen for a scam that they fail to mention it to those around them, let alone report it. “It’s under-reported, and it causes huge harm,” says Curtis. “And that harm isn’t just financial.” Victims can lose their sense of self-confidence and develop problems with mental health, and this can even lead to suicide.“Getting over people’s own embarrassment and shame is really challenging,” he says. “It’s about telling people and getting comfort from that network around you, like from your family [and] from your social network. And if people have that support, that can be so empowering to them [they can] then make a report and engage with law enforcement.”TheGuardianrecently revealed details of thesophisticated and mercenary tacticsused by scammers in an elaborate operation based in Tblisi, Georgia, which tricked Britons out of £9m. Many were called again and again by the criminals and persuaded to hand over more and more money.Curtis says criminals in fraud cases use methods similar to those of sexual predators when grooming their victims. “It works in exactly the same way with fraudsters. They have to build the confidence with the victim. They have to build that trust up. So sometimes this isn’t a quick process to become a victim of fraud,” he says.View image in fullscreenA Louis Vuitton bag seized in a raidAdvances in technology present ongoing problems for the DCPCU. Money can now be moved across borders at much greater speed than before, putting it out of the reach of law enforcement, and advertisements for fake investment vehicles often purport to be backed by celebrities, such as happened withMoneySavingExpert’s Martin Lewis.Developments in generative AI – where artificial intelligence can create text, images or videos using patterns in existing data – give fresh opportunities to criminals, according to Ben Donaldson, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, the banking body that funds the DCPCU.“I think it gives [criminals] a range of capabilities that they just didn’t have before and … it’s getting easier and easier for them to use some of this technology,” he says. In the past, emails and messages which claimed to be from a bank could be spotted because of poor grammar or spelling, but this is no longer the case as the technology being used by criminals improves.“It’s much, much easier to do that [fraud] in a very, very convincing way [as] there’s a whole sort of suite of capabilities available to criminals now which do change the nature of the threat. The bar to entry [with] that type of technology is getting lower all the time,” says Donaldson.This month, UK Finance and the consumer group Which?wrote a joint letter to the UK governmentcalling for “robust action” to be taken against technology companies to offset the growing cost of fraud.Donaldson says the vast majority of authorised push payment (APP) fraud, which involves tricking someone into voluntarily sending money from their bank account, emerges from social media accounts. The decision by Facebookto get rid of factcheckers and reduce censorship, announced in January, raises concerns that it will be even easier for criminals to exploit people, he says.Police have called for more effective user verification so that criminals cannot operate anonymously, as well as for more sharing of information that can identify them.Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, says it has launched its Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange – through which banks can share information about scams – which has led to the removal of 20,000 accounts. TikTok says each request for data from the police is examined and evaluated before data is disclosed.So at a time when fraud is ballooning and coming at people in emails, texts, WhatsApp messages and through any number of social media channels, what can people do to stay safe?Treat your personal information in the same way you treat your house keys, says Donaldson. “You shouldn’t hand over any aspects of your personal information unless you would trust that person with the keys to your front door.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

So far, so unnewsworthy. But what first appeared as her morning caffeine fix was, in fact, a luxury handbag. TheBalenciagadesign, which is crafted from calfskin, sells for about £4,346.60 more than the average takeaway coffee in the UK.It mimics the reusableBalenciaga coffee cup– made of porcelain and polypropylene, it sells for £85 – and throwaway vessels.View image in fullscreenGigi Hadid with a Moschino handbag made to look like a carton of orange juice.Photograph: XNY/Star Max/GC ImagesSánchez, a former journalist who is engaged to Jeff Bezos, is not alone in opting for an accessory that mimics a consumer good but retails for several thousand pounds more. The supermodel Gigi Hadid recently wore a £1,541 Moschino vintage leather handbag made to look like a carton of orange juice. The brand also offersa clutch in the shape of celery. There is a Louis Vuitton bagdesigned to resemble a paint can(£1,980), as well as crisp packet bags, also from Balenciaga – spicy chilli, salt and vinegar, or cheese and onion (£1,450). Looking to more UK-centric consumer goods,Anya Hindmarch has built a business out of the model. Her Frosties, Perelló olives and Lea & Perrins bags are priced at up to £1,300.According to Iain R Webb, a writer, curator and professor of fashion and design at Kingston school of art in London, this is not new. “Historically, fashion has always appropriated the common place and utilitarian,” he said, citing “Marie Antoinette dressing up (or down) like a shepherdess” and the £185 T-shirt from the luxury label Vetementsriffing on the global logistics company DHL.But Orsola de Castro, an author and a cofounder of the activist group Fashion Revolution, thinks these consumer product-mimicking designs are best relegated to the past: “This kind of thing stopped being relevant after Andy Warhol did the Campbell’s soup tins. Then it made sense. Then it had a rebellious spirit. Then it was making a point.”She added: “If the coffee cup had existed then, the depiction of a coffee cup bag would have been some kind of a statement on plastic or on the unnecessariness of it all. But now it is simply just vulgar.”View image in fullscreenAn orange Louis Vuitton bag shaped as a paint can.Photograph: Edward Berthelot/Getty ImagesThe optics of Sánchez, who as an author, pilot and Emmy award-winning journalist reportedly has a net worth of more than $30m (£23m), carrying a mundane object given a mogul makeover are particularly loaded. Dr Gaby Harris, a lecturer in fashion cultures at Manchester Metropolitan University, sees “coded within these items … the privilege of the wealthy to engage with mass consumption while retaining exclusivity”.Andwith coffee prices at a record high, the play on a cup has even more significance than, say, a head of celery might. “We are observing the inflation of goods while incomes remain stagnated. Thus, everyday staples such as coffee bear greater expense while top earners continue to amass wealth,” said Harris.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is the rise of boom boom, the aesthetic of 80s-style greed and conspicuous consumption, that has been in the ascendant since Donald Trump returned to office. “Sadly,” according to Webb, “politically and economically we are witnessing a reflection of the 1980s, so it is not surprising that the showoff aspect of conspicuous consumption should again raise its ugly head: fashion that is as flash as its price tag, fashion that says: ‘I have loadsamoney’.”But the picture is nuanced. As Sean Monahan, the trend forecaster who coined boom boom,recently said: “The American elite is in flux. For a long time, it was about people not wanting to flaunt wealth … Now, it’s unclear where people are in the status hierarchy.” In this context, a luxury handbag in the shape of an everyday cup of coffee makes a certain topsy turvy sense.Explore more on these topicsHandbagsBalenciagaMoschinoLouis VuittonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now 68, she can launch herself off a 7.5-metre platformPaula CocozzaMon 31 Mar 2025 01.55 EDTShareAntonia Murphy has always loved water. It can be warm or icy, wild or maintained in a municipal facility. Although “not a great swimmer”, she is a confident one. So when she moved to Edinburgh two years ago, she promptly checked out the public leisure centre. She was captivated by the alluring, deep blue of the diving pool. “I thought: ‘This is unbelievable.’ I felt seduced,” she says.She had “larked around” as a child, but never learned to dive, so she went along to theRoyal Commonwealth’s public session. “This bloke was standing there. We got chatting.” He told her about coaching sessions – and Murphy, then 66, booked a taster class.“It was lovely. I’m diving with young women and men.Divingcuts across all the rubbish about gender and age. You’re in your bathing costume. There’s no more stripping down. You can’t wear makeup. It’s a real equaliser,” she says. “And no one gives a flying wotsit that I’m nearly 70.”Now 68, Murphy, a semi-retired psychotherapist, has progressed to the intermediate group. She can dive off springboards. She can somersault – “not the neatest, but really good fun!” – and launch herself from the dizzy heights of the 7.5-metre platform board. “All you have to do is stay really strong and solid … It is like flying.”View image in fullscreenDizzy heights … Murphy takes a leap at the Royal Commonwealth pool in Edinburgh.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianOf course, sometimes, the fear comes – especially when she is waiting on the edge of the board, or about to reverse-dive. Last time, Murphy hit the board with her fingers and briefly felt the touch of disaster. But the classes teach technique; the coaching is excellent. “Everyone claps when anyone tries a new dive. Even if it’s a flop. Because they tried it, and they are better than they were before, when they weren’t trying it.”The fourth of five children, Murphy and her siblings used to swim in their local pool in south London. They went as “a tribe”; it was “a good way of getting us out the house for sixpence”. Visiting relatives on the west coast of Ireland, whole summers were spent in the sea.“There is something about the attraction of the water, the surface of the water, breaking the water,” she says. “When you learn to dive, one of the things you learn is entry: you pull the surface of the water back with you, and there is no splash.”But what drives the attraction? “I feel really supported in the water,” Murphy says. She loves breaking the surface on entry and when rising again. “Sometimes I surprise myself because I’ve gone in so deep. I’m coming up, thinking: ‘Christ, where’s the surface?’”Murphy graduated from the University of Leeds in maths and philosophy, then worked as a science education editor while living in a housing co-operative. It was after her sister Olivia died by suicide that she changed careers. “It threw me into my own therapy. It launched me into thinking about things internally.”She set up a clinical practice and a few years later had a son. She wanted a baby, but not a partner. “I realised I could do this myself,” she says. “I’m lucky, because I’ve always loved being single. I’m not a great lover of coupledom.” She isn’t exactly solitary. “I am an independent person who likes their own space.

Deep-sea mining has not yet begun, but some companies and countries areexploring the practice, which could startin the coming years.“We’re playing gods with the cradle of life – and that’s way too dangerous,” Brotherson said from his office in Papeete.Asked if he would consider deep-sea mining in the future, Brotherson said: “Over my dead body.”French Polynesia is located in the South Pacific Ocean about halfway between Australia and South America. It consists of more than 100 islands, including Tahiti and Bora Bora. Although technically still under French sovereignty, the islands are largely autonomous, with their own government, currency and local laws.View image in fullscreenMoetai Brotherson, French Polynesia’s president, says he would ‘rather not see independence in my time if it’s being rushed and done wrong’.Photograph: Atea Lee Chip Sao/The GuardianUnder French Polynesia’s statute of autonomy,Francehas ultimate jurisdiction over what it deems “strategic materials”, which includes the minerals found in the seabed. Brotherson’s administration is attempting to get the statute modified.Brotherson was elected in 2023 as a member of the pro-independence Tāvini Huiraʻatira party. He said deep-sea mining was a “lure” for Pacific Island countries, which might see the practice as a “shortcut to a better social and economic situation”.Deep-sea mining involvesextracting minerals and metals such as nickel, cobalt and copper from the deep seabed, at depthsgreater than 200m. These minerals are used in a range of products including batteries, electronics and renewable energies.Proponents say mining the deep sea will support the green energy transition and aid the development of Pacific Island economies. Others argue the practice could have a devastating impact on the seabed, and the long-term consequences for the environment and ocean ecosystems are uncertain.Deep-sea mining has divided Pacific island governments. While some, including French Polynesia andMicronesia, are against the idea, others such as the Cook Islands and Nauru have been actively pursuing partnerships with mining companies as a way to diversify their economies.In February, theCook Islands signed a strategic partnership deal with Chinawhich included cooperation to explore deep-sea mining in the Cook Islands’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In March, Kiribati announced it would also be exploring adeep-sea mining partnership with China.Other large states including Russia and South Korea holdexplorationcontracts, andcompanies are pushingto beginmining the deep sea.View image in fullscreenFrench Polynesia’s presidential palace in the capital, Papeete.Photograph: Atea Lee Chip Sao/The GuardianWhile Brotherson supports the right of theCook Islandsto exploit its deep-sea resources, he doesn’t agree with it.“From our perspective, it’s very disturbing because it sets a precedent and also ignores the fact that undersea pollution doesn’t have boundaries,” said Brotherson, who noted that pollution from mining in the Cook Islands could end up in French Polynesian waters.Dr Lorenz Gonschor, an expert on Pacific regionalism and governance at the University of the South Pacific, said exploration of deep ocean resources was likely to happen in the future.He said as “large ocean nations” the emerging practice gavePacific islands“tremendous importance in the sense that they will now potentially have huge economic resources”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, currentlysupports a ban on deep-sea miningbut Brotherson worries that could change with the election of a new president in France.France has complicated relationships with its Pacific Island colonies, which also includes New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna. New Caledonia sawviolent unrest and protestslast year sparked byvoting reforms proposed by the French parliament.Brotherson has stated publicly that he would consider holding a referendum on independence from France in the next 10 to 15 years.France, however, has shown no indication of moving towards decolonisation for French Polynesia, rejecting calls for independence at the 2023 UN special committee on decolonisation and continuing to maintain an active military presence in the islands. Macron, during his last visit to French Polynesia in 2021, emphasised strengthening the existing relationship.Map of French PoolynesiaGonschor acknowledged that independence for French Polynesia would be a “big challenge”, particularly because of its history of economic subsidies and “superficial development” from France. Still, he believed there was a chance of seeing independence in our lifetimes.“From a geopolitical standpoint, it’s unavoidable. In the long run, France won’t be able to afford to keep these overseas colonies.”Brotherson is willing to take a slow path to secure independence “the right way” and start by building French Polynesia’s “economic self-resilience”, which includes asustainable tourismand energy transition, as well as a move to boost the local agricultural sector and prioritise the digital economy.“I’d rather not see independence in my time if it’s being rushed and done wrong … It would be great if I could see it, but it’s not about me,” Brotherson said. “It’s about the people in the country.”Explore more on these topicsPacific leaders: in their wordsFrench PolynesiaFranceDeep-sea miningPacific islandsOceansCook IslandsnewsShareReuse this content"

She loves her boyfriend, cartoons and football – she supports Manchester City. Until recently, TikTok dancing brightened her days. “Any kind of dancing,” she says.When the Guardian met her she was about to turn 18 and was on crutches, her ankle twisted during a scramble to escape a Myanmar military airstrike. A soldier of the Chin militia, thefour years of civil waragainst the ruling junta have consumed much of Anina’s adolescence.The teenager has been trained as a sniper, in a challenge to both Myanmar’s military rule and patriarchal norms. She has killed more men than she cares to tally.“I hate people boasting about how many they’ve killed,” she says. “I stopped counting after three.”View image in fullscreenHouses bombed by Myanmar military jets in Falam township, Chin State, Myanmar, 31 December 2024.In Falam, western Myanmar, Anina – her nom de guerre – is the only female resistance fighter among hundreds besieging the military’s last garrison. Her marksmanship has won respect in a deeply patriarchal society where, she says, girls are dismissed as too weak for combat yet children are widely recruited.Taking the former capital of Chin State, a predominately Christian territory bordering India, would mark a milestone in the armed struggle for democracy. It would be the first time resistance forces have captured a district centre without support from established ethnic armies, according to her group, the Chin National Defense Force (CNDF).Created after themilitary ousted an elected government in February 2021, these civilian-formed resistance forces are dominated by young people. The Chin fighters want to push the junta forces back to Myanmar’s Buddhist heartland and defeat them there. But they face an enemy equipped with Chinese and Russian jets, which controls cities and airports, and which answers battlefield losses with atrocities.“Because of them, I have lost many friends,” Anina says, as a junta transport plane thunders overhead.Her friends call her Anina – which sounds like “close by” in Burmese – because they say they feel her presence even when she isn’t there. Her real identity remains hidden to protect her family.View image in fullscreenAnina on a crutch after twisting her ankle in an airstrike, Falam, Chin State, 4 January.Myanmar has a long history of children being drawn into armed conflict. For years, the country has appeared on international lists where children are recruited by both the governing military and ethnic militias fighting for autonomy.InJune 2022, the UN Secretary General’s annual reporton children and armed conflict documented verified cases of child recruitment in the country: 260 boys and 20 girls, some as young as 12. Most were attributed to the Myanmar military with 222 cases, while others were recruited by various ethnic armed groups.The situation has worsened since the 2021 coup. With limited opportunities, many young people who remained in the country have sought to join anti-junta resistance groups.A UN committee warned that in just over a year after the coup, as many as 382 children had been killed by the military and its allies, with another 142 tortured. During that time, over 1,400 children had reportedly been arbitrarily detained, including those who participated or were suspected of participating in protests.Don’t tolerate being looked down on, or hit, or whatever they do because you’re a woman. Fight backAnina, sniperIn Falam, Anina, armed with an Indian rifle, and the other Chin snipers patrol the mountains, hunting for the enemy. The two sides are close enough to trade taunts. But Anina moves in silence, shooting from 50 to 700 metres away, never lingering – to do so risks death by rocket-propelled grenade, artillery, airstrike or enemy sniper.“We heard about the girl sniper,” a captured junta soldier told the Guardian. “We were told the snipers here were accurate and scary; that in one night, they killed four of our soldiers.”Anina learned to shoot as a child, joining village deer hunting parties with her father. “I don’t fear the sound of the gun,” she says. “My father told me how to focus and concentrate on the target.”View image in fullscreen‘My father told me how to focus and concentrate on the target’: Anina with a hunting rifle in a village at the frontline in Falam.She joined the uprising aged 14, after the military opened fire on peaceful protesters across the country. Despite her shooting skills, she was young and female, so she was assigned to cleaning and cooking duties. But she was drawn to elements of the resistance that challenged the military’s deep-rooted chauvinism and misogyny.“We were told men and women would be treated the same,” she says. “But when we went to the frontline, girls were asked to cook. I don’t like cooking.”Her path to becoming sniper began with Azad, a self-described “leftist internationalist” from the southern US, who had spent four years fighting alongside Kurdish forces in Syria before joining Myanmar’s resistance a year ago. Under his training in July 2024, Anina tied for top place among 12 trainees, of which, then 17, she was the youngest. Her fellow top performer, Obed, was killed last November.View image in fullscreenAzad, who trained Anina in July 2024.Azad, 24, recalls Anina’s resolve during training. Once, when scope recoil split her forehead, he feared the bullet had exploded in the chamber. “There was blood on her face,” he says. “She woke seconds later. The shot had hit. She wiped the blood, got back on the scope, and struck the target again.”Now helping to form a group of foreign volunteers, Azad sees the struggle in Myanmar as a “revolt against the textbook example of state power – fascism”.“It’s a natural uprising coming from the human inability to accept dictatorship,” he says. “For people worldwide, that’s a wellspring of hope.”For Anina, meeting a foreign fighter in these remote hills seemed “unbelievable” at first. “He wants [us] to have the same freedom he has in his country,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She says Anina was urged to stay in education. “We couldn’t convince her,” Olivia Thawng Luai says. “And she was the best sniper in training, so we let her hold the gun.”She adds that children should not be fighting but be educated “to lead our land”.“They should be pursuing their dreams,” she says. “Instead, they’re here in the forest, fighting the military. That upsets me.”View image in fullscreenOlivia Thawng Luai, defence secretary in the Chin National Defence Force, in a village near Falam, 2 January.Wounded in the arm by shrapnel in her first Falam battle in November, Anina persisted. “Everyone thinks girls belong in the kitchen and should be motherly,” she says. “It’s just an excuse. Now I’m always at the front. My comrades treat me as an equal.”Myanmar civil war: a quick guide to the conflictRead moreThinzar Shunlei Yi, a prominent democracy activist, says women have had to “push twice as hard to be taken seriously”, though the conflict is forcing all of Myanmar “to rethink gender roles”.Recent reports say the military junta in Myanmar plans to conscript women to replenish its depleted ranks.“The real test is whether these changes last,” Thinzar Shunlei Yi says. “If women are good enough to fight and die for freedom, they should also be good enough to lead in a new Myanmar.”Anina’s boyfriend, Vak Vei, 20, is a fellow sniper with bloodshot eyes from night operations. He says they worry for each other, but take comfort in serving together. They wear matching hairbands on their ankles from their first meeting at a rebel camp two years ago. “She’s the leader in our couple,” he says. “I rely on her.”Other bonds are kept distant. Anina hasn’t seen her family in a year, keeping her phone on flight mode to avoid their calls.“I miss them. I want to go home sometimes,” she says. “But if I return, my parents won’t let me leave again. I’ll stay until we win.”View image in fullscreenAnina stays in abandoned houses while fighting with the CNDF.She has a message, she says, for girls and young women: “Don’t tolerate being looked down on, or hit, or whatever they do because you’re a woman. Fight back. If you get a slap, slap them back.”For now, she spends her time in bomb craters and abandoned homes, her world narrowed to her scope’s view.“I don’t look like someone who dances now,” she says, glancing at her crutches. “These days, I don’t feel like dancing so much.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentConflict and armsMyanmar coupMyanmarSouth and central AsiaWomen's rights and gender equalityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were being detained for illegal camping, but the officers were also searching for evidence of drugs.“Love you!” a husband and wife shouted at each other as they were separated to be taken to jail.Oregon judge blocks city from enforcing homeless camping banRead moreOfficer Paul Verling placed one 43-year-old woman in the back of his car while his team tested a confiscated glass pipe for drug residue. He told her she could potentially avoid jail if she entered drug treatment.The woman said she had been using methamphetamine to cope with homelessness and would be grateful for treatment. But once Verling ran her name through the system, he discovered she had a warrant for a probation violation. That made her ineligible for “deflection”. She, too, would be going to jail, he said, possibly for a month.“You wanna engage in some rehab when you get out?” he said.“Yes sir,” she mumbled.“I’m glad we had this talk today,” Verling said, as he took her out of the car to escort her into a jail enclosure.View image in fullscreenMedford police officers detain a number of people in Medford, Oregon, on 25 February.Welcome to Oregon’s “war on drugs” 2.0.In September, Oregon lawmakers enacted legislation turning low-level drug possession into amore serious crime punishable by up to 180 days in jail. The resulting crackdown has led to thousands of arrests statewide in recent months. People targeted in cities such as Medford, and overworked public defenders tasked with representing them, say the drug enforcement has been chaotic and at times brutal.While the new policy has appeared to reduce visible drug use in some public spaces, unhoused people, who have been most impacted by the police response, say it has exacerbated their struggles.The new law also marks a stunning reversal of policy for the Pacific north-west state.Just four years ago, Oregon voters passedMeasure 110, a groundbreaking drug decriminalization measure that abandoned jail sentences for possessing small amounts of drugs and imposed an infraction citation instead. Passed on the heels ofBlack Lives Matteruprisings, the measure aimed to treat addiction as a disease instead of a crime, prioritize services and recovery over jail,reduceovercrowding behind bars and help address racial disparities in policing and prosecutions.At the time, Oregon was grappling with rising overdoses. Itrankedsecond nationally for drug addiction rates and worst in the US for access to treatment. The problem was systemic, rooted in decades of failure to invest in the level ofbehavioral health servicesneeded for people with mental illnesses and addiction. Measure 110 called for aninfusion of $302mfor addiction recovery and harm reduction services, with a focus on underserved communities, including Black and Indigenous people impacted by criminalization.Drug policy reform advocates hoped the first-in-the-nation decriminalization experiment would become a model.But the timing could not have been worse. The law went into effect in 2021 asfentanylwas rapidly entering Oregon’s unregulated drug market, the pandemic was shuttering vital social services andhomelessnesswas surging amid Covid and unprecedentedwildfires.View image in fullscreenCrystal Bilyeu of Max’s Mission, a harm-reduction organization, connects people with supplies such as Narcan, fentanyl test strips and wound care kits.As Measure 110-funded recovery programs were just getting off the ground, the decriminalization measure was widely blamed for crime, surging fentanyl overdoses and the increasing visibility of homelessness and drug use, even as researchsuggesteda complex set offactorsbehind thesetrends. Thebacklash was fierce, and the state’s Democratic governor, Tina Kotek, signed the bill last year recriminalizing possession.Supporters say the renewed enforcement is restoring order on the streets, while helping people with addiction and maintaining funding for services. Koteksaidshe did not want the policy to be “business as usual” of jailing drug users, but a “treatment first” approach. Thebillencourages counties to set up “deflection” programs, enabling some arrestees to forgo charges if they get help for their substance use disorders. People with possession cases can alsoavoidconviction if they complete probation, and lawmakers have promised pathways for records to eventually be expunged. And part of the funding for new treatment programs first passed under Measure 110 has remained intact, enabling some innovative projects to continue their work,though withfewer resources.Implementation of the new law varies widely by county. Data reveals some jurisdictions are launching mass arrests, while referring very few people to treatment.‘They’re throwing us in handcuffs’The Medford police department has led the state in drug criminalization – by a lot.The city is located in a region near the California border that is one of the more conservative areas of a blue state; more than half of voters in Jackson county, which includes Medford, supportedDonald Trump.From September, when the new law was enacted, through 26 March, the Medford police force carried out 902 drug possession arrests – more thandouble the number of cases in Portland (a city with seven times the population). Jackson county has logged 1,170 arrests total.Verling, an officer on the city’s “livability” team, a unit focused on low-level crimes, including unlawful camping, trespassing, public drinking and drug possession, said many police were relieved when drugs were recriminalized. The 2020 reform had led to increasing reports of drug use on the streets and growing concern about public intoxication.View image in fullscreenFrom September through 26 March, the Medford police force carried out 902 drug possession arrests.Recriminalization, Verling said, allows him to engage people in hopes of pushing them to treatment. “I really don’t want to see someone go to prison … but this gives us the ability to get back into their lives,” he said on a recent patrol through Medford.He said the job was most rewarding when seeing someone turn their life around after they’ve been jailed – and when his team arrests dealers, potentially “making people sober by making the drugs inaccessible”.One of the livability team’s main priorities has been clearing homeless encampments, and as Verling drove his patrol car onto a pedestrian greenway, the impact was clear. During the pandemic, encampments were a common site. Now, there were few visible signs of homelessness. Several locals were jogging.Where did people go?“People leave town. They’re like, ‘OK well it’s a crime to camp here,’” he said, adding he believed many were in shelters.The issues of homelessness and drug addiction are deeply intertwined, and Verling said he had become adept at spotting signs of drug use and paraphernalia: “Focus on their hands – that will lead you to it.”Oregon’s recriminalization law allows the state’s 36 counties to adopt individualizedapproachesto deflection.Jackson county designed its program so officers could directly hand over arrestees to drug treatment programs instead of jail, a collaborative approach meant to get people immediate help without involving the courts. But many don’t qualify, aren’t offered this alternative during their arrest, or they decline an officer’s offer. According to the latest available data, while there have been nearly 1,200 possession arrests, as of 27 March, only 69 people have been referred to deflection.Instead, many get arrested. And rearrested. One 43-year-old unhoused woman said police were “acting like every person on the street is a drug addict, which is not true”, and that she had been arrested four times by Medford’s livability team since October, generally for camping violations. While she was quickly released after her last arrest, her partner was not, leaving her to camp outside alone. The woman, who asked not to use her name out of fear of police retaliation, said she was sleeping in front of a social services center in hopes her partner could easily find her when he gets out. “The separation makes me feel like I can’t breathe,” she added. “Police say they’re helping the homeless, but they’re just throwing us in handcuffs and jail.”View image in fullscreenHawthorne Park in Medford, Oregon.Inside the county jail, as livability officers were processing an arrest of an unhoused man who had camped under a bridge, officer Elliott Jantzer said the hardest part of the job was “arresting the same person over and over again and seeing no change”.“Society is supposed to fix these problems. We can’t really fix it. We don’t have capacity,” he said.Jailed with no attorneyBut the criminal justice system is where most people targeted by the new law end up.On two days that week in February, dozens of defendants waited to be arraigned in courtroom 301 of the Jackson county circuit court justice building. Some appeared in person in the windowless hearing room, others appeared over video from the county jail in Medford. Some pleaded with the judge, saying they needed to get home to take care of children, asserting the charges were incorrect or expressing bewilderment about the entire ordeal.None of the jailed defendants had lawyers for their cases, and most said they wanted one. One man facing a drug possession charge quietly asked for a lawyer, but then changed his mind and pleaded guilty, seemingly hoping for a quicker resolution.The defendants were there on all types of charges, but when drug possessions were called for defendants not already in jail, the outcome was the same: the defendant didn’t show. “Failure to appear – warrant”, the judge repeated four times.The scenes laid bare the impact of recriminalization on the state’s criminal system, which for years has struggled with a massivepublic defender shortage, in part due to difficulties recruiting lawyers to the low-salary, high-caseload jobs. In that particular week, there were more than 900 defendants in Jackson county alone who, despite having active criminal cases, had no lawyers.View image in fullscreenPublic defender Clint Oborn poses for a portrait in his office in Medford, Oregon.“It’s a violation of their constitutional rights,” said Clint Oborn, the executive director of the Southern Oregon Public Defender Inc (SOPD), walking back to his office after arraignments. “Some people plead guilty and never get an attorney, or if they want one, they’re put on a waiting list.” Most clients with drug possession cases who don’t show up to court are unhoused and eventually get jailed on warrants, he said.Cyril Rivera Neeley, one SOPD attorney, said one of his clients was a senior citizen charged with drug possession in September who refused to plead guilty,had to wait five months for a trial and then was jailed for missing a court appearance; another is a defendant who thought they were being hospitalized for a mental health episode, but was instead jailed for a drug misdemeanor when officers found paraphernalia.Patrick Green, the Jackson county district attorney, said he supported recriminalization because defendants end up supervised by probation officers, who hold defendants accountable and connect them to treatment and services. And he argued jail can be helpful: “We know with addiction, you do have to get a person some clean time for them to be in the right frame of mind to be willing to engage in treatment.”But he also acknowledged that the return of possession arrests had increased his staff’s caseloads. The majority of his 18 prosecutors have had to take on these cases, giving them less time for other matters, and the new law has exacerbated jail overcrowding, he said. Many possession cases are resulting in “conditional discharge”, he said, where defendants waive their right to a trial or an attorney and are immediately placed on probation, but can be jailed again if they lose contact with their officer or commit other violations.“Once they get out of jail, they often keep using, their probation gets revoked and they return to jail,” said Colin Murphy, another public defender. “It’s the same cycle I saw before we decriminalized. If this approach to getting rid of drugs in our community actually worked, it should have worked by now, because we’ve been doing this since the 1970s.”The strategy diverts police away from serious investigations, he said: “We’re told law enforcement has very scarce resources. But in these possession cases, I see five cops standing around investigating one unhoused person because she had a baggie in her pocket.”‘I stay out of sight’With limited use of deflection, and a shortage of lawyers to represent people, the new system has felt pointless to some unhoused people in Medford.“It’s not fair, it’s unethical, it’s a fucking scam,” said 34-year-old Nikki, sitting early one morning under a bridge in Medford’s Hawthorne Park. A thick layer of fog hung in the air, and she gestured at the flowing creek beside her: “Look at how beautiful this place is.”View image in fullscreenBrittany, left, and Nikki, right, in Hawthorne Park on 24 February.The state’s affordable housingshortageis theprimary driverof homelessness, with over 27% of renters facing severely unaffordable rent, forced tospendhalf or more of their income on housing. Some unhoused people like Nikki come from out of state in hopes of better services. Her main motivation, she said, was healthcare: she’s a transgender woman, and her deep-red home state of Missouri hadbecome a leader in anti-trans lawsand medical restrictions. But she also liked the environment of Medford, in an area known as the Rogue Valley. There’s a backdrop of mountain ranges, and a greenway bike path connecting local cities.“It’s been awesome living here, and it’s been shit,” said Nikki, who asked to use a nickname as she talked openly about drug use. She said she regularly uses meth and has done stints in rehab that didn’t last.She said she had spent time in the county jail when she was picked up on warrants, forced into the men’s section. For people with serious addictions, detox in jail is “horror beyond what you can imagine”, she said. Incarceration can also increase overdose risks when people are released with lower tolerance.Now, Nikki tries to sleep in hidden corners in the woods where police won’t bother her – “out of sight, out of mind”.Christopher De Falco, a 30-year-old who had gathered in Hawthorne Park for a weekly potluck lunch for the unhoused, said he had long dealt with addiction, homelessness and incarceration and felt the new approach would help few people getting sober: “Until the person truly wants to quit, they’re not going to. Forcing people into treatment, it’s against our will and unjust.”View image in fullscreenChris smokes marijuana in Hawthorne Park on 24 February.Nearby, 38-year-old Ray, who only gave his first name, said going to jail felt routine to him: “another day in the office.” He heard other countries had safe injection sites, which he said seemed like a better way to get people into services than jail time.Nikki said one Medford officer recently came up to her while she was sitting by the creek asking, “What’s in your bag? What’s in your pocket? Where are your drugs?” she recounted. “I didn’t even have drugs on me!” She said she was being profiled: “I’ve got two bags, messy hair, dirty pants and dirty shoes.”As she described the encounter, a Medford “livability” officer drove by. Nikki jokingly hummed a Nazi anthem as the vehicle passed, adding: “‘livability’ just means they work for everybody but you.”Stuck on the waitlistPeople who do enter deflection in Medford are often taken by officers directly to the Addictions Recovery Center (ARC), one of two treatment providers partnering with police on the program. Staff address participants’ basic needs, including food, clothes, medications; conduct an addiction assessment; and place them in temporary shelter. The clients are required to complete ten appointments, generally within 30 days, which can include meetings with counselors or peer support staff, at which point the threat of prosecution is erased.Ben Spence, ARC’s community justice program manager, said roughly half of their participants have successfully completed deflection; some people fail when they become unreachable, though his staff works hard to track people down and keep them engaged. The ten appointments are just a start to their recovery journey, he added.View image in fullscreenA drug user holds fentanyl test strips given out by Max’s Mission.Of the 69 referrals in the county, as of 27 March, 23 had successfully completed the program, 26 had failed and 17 remained in the process, said Vicky Armstrong, the county’s deflection coordinator. She emphasized that the program was in its early days and that deflection was just one of many pathways into treatment: “You can’t legislate people into sobriety. You can legislate opportunity.”Green, the DA, said he felt deflection was a better path to treatment than the criminal system, which can be a slow process, and that the fact that only some people were succeeding was a good sign: “We didn’t [make it] too easy or too hard. We really found that sweet spot.”At Medford police headquarters, Lt Rebecca Pietila, in charge of community engagement, said law enforcement viewed recriminalization with deflection as a “compromise – a happy medium”. She said deflection was working well due to close partnerships between police and providers, noting that Jackson county had a higher success rate than the state average.She said it would take time to build law enforcement buy-in as many officers were pleased to have an opportunity to restart arrests. “They want to hold people accountable, because we know drug crime is not just about addiction, it leads to theft and disorderly behavior and victimization,” she added.View image in fullscreenAndrew Cartwright of Medford police department’s livability unit detains a person who was sleeping under a bridge on 25 February.Pietila said she would like to see drug laws become tougher, with stiffer penalties for certain possession quantities, and that she supported efforts toexpand the county jailso more arrestees could be held longer. For unhoused people with severe addiction, “sometimes jail is the only intervention”.For many in the region, it is still easier to get a jail cell than into treatment.OnTrack Rogue Valley, another drug treatment provider and deflection partner, has more than 300 people on its waitlist for residential programs. That includes 200 people waiting for a 16-bed program, said executive director Sommer Wolcott. “Many of those200 people are unhoused with severe substance use disorders who desperately want a treatment bed,” Wolcott said. “They need 24-hour care and support. They can’t just stop using.”Some people are stuck for more than a year on the waitlist, and at times, when staff try to track them down, they discover the client has died of an overdose.Wolcott personally knows of three people who died while on her treatment waiting list last year. But, she said, there could be many more.‘Empathy matters’As Medford police escalate their crackdown on possession, and treatment facilities remain at capacity, some advocates are doing their best to keep drug users safe and alive through harm reduction. Max’s Mission, a southern Oregon group founded by a couple whose son died of an overdose in 2013, does weekly outreach in Hawthorne Park, which involves syringe exchanges, connecting people to housing and treatment services and giving out tarps, socks, snacks,wound care kits and naloxone, the overdose-reversal drug.View image in fullscreenCrystal Bilyeu packs wound care kits in advance of outreach on 24 February.Crystal Bilyeu, who was helping lead Max’s Mission outreach one recent afternoon, said she had reversed 48 overdoses with naloxone, including 17 in 2024. The 41-year-old was herself unhoused and struggling with addiction in the early years of the pandemic. While living outside, she would give out cards advertising a “never use alone” hotline people can call while using so that EMS can be alerted if they overdose, and she became known as someone who always had naloxone in her backpack.The strict anti-camping laws worsened her substance use disorder, she said, as she often used drugs to stay awake since sleeping brought the risk of trouble with law enforcement. “I used it for survival,” she said. She got clean after she became pregnant, she said, and Julia Pinsky, Max’s Mission founder, got her a motel room until she could get into treatment. Having somewhere stable to sleep made the start of her recovery possible, she said.Bilyeu, who was eventually hired by the organization, now gives out harm reduction supplies to the same communities she used to live with. “We meet people where they are at,” she said. “I think empathy matters. I’ve been there before and I can help them with an open mind and no judgment.”The presence of someone like Bilyeu can be the difference between life and death. Later that day, Christy Sexton, 50, stopped in Hawthorne Park to greet another volunteer assisting the unhoused. Her 31-year-old son, Mike, had died of a fentanyl overdose two weeks earlier, she said, and she had just viewed his body. “He looked very peaceful,” Sexton said. “I couldn’t stop kissing his head and telling him how much I loved him.”View image in fullscreenChristy Sexton, right, is comforted by another volunteer worker, Alan, at Hawthorne Park. Christy had just returned from viewing the body of her son Mike, who died of a fentanyl overdose.Sexton is unhoused, living in her car, and her son was also struggling with homelessness. She described him as “everybody’s friend” and a devoted son: “He made sure every single day that I knew how much he loved me.”She didn’t know the circumstances of his overdose, but wished more people were aware of the state’sGood Samaritan law, dictating that people can’t be prosecuted for drug possession if they seek aid for someone overdosing.While starting to process the shock of her son’s death, she said she was plagued by the thought that someone might have been too scared of police to call 911 – and instead left her son to die.“I’ll never understand why my son’s life had to be taken.”Explore more on these topicsOregonDrugsUS crimeHomelessnessWest CoastDrugs policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianHe was the most senior Asian officer in British policing, tipped for the top job of Met commissioner. But then came Black Lives Matter and the murder of Sarah Everard – and he couldn’t stay silent any moreBySteve RoseMon 31 Mar 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 05.28 EDTShareNeil Basu is enjoying not being a police officer, he says. “The vast majority of mornings, I wake up and go: ‘Thank God I don’t have to do that any more.’ I sleep. I never used to sleep.” Before he quit two and a half years ago, Basu was assistant commissioner at theMetropolitan policein London and the most senior minority ethnic police officerin Britain. For his final seven years in the job, he had to be on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. “The only time I relaxed was when I was on a plane, until they brought in wifi,” he says. As officers aren’t allowed alcohol while on duty, “I’ve got an encyclopedic knowledge of zero-alcohol beers and I’m a rugby player; you can imagine how difficult that was.”There is plenty more Basu doesn’t miss about policing. After 30 years in the toughest areas of the job – kidnap, rape, murder, gang violence, counter-terrorism – he has seen things that would keep most of us awake at night. But as a British Asian man rising through the ranks of the Met, he also experienced first-hand the prejudice, politics, cultural malaise and stubborn reluctance to change policing – including the circumstances of his departure. He has a lot to get off his chest – a book’s worth, in fact, although he describes his aptly titled memoir, Turmoil: 30 Years of Policing, Politics and Prejudice, less as a score-settling exercise and more as “a letter from an angry lover”. “I love policing,” he says. “I love what it does for society. I love that, when it’s done well, police officers are the best people on the planet. It’s a shame that when it’s done badly, they’re the worst.”Basu’s career was bookended by the murder ofStephen Lawrenceat the beginning andthe Casey reviewat the end and his frustration at how little changed in between is palpable. Lawrence’s racially motivated murder, in south-east London in 1993, was so badly handled that it culminated in the1999 Macpherson report, which reached the damning conclusion that the Met was institutionally racist. Twenty-four years later, prompted by the murder of Sarah Everard by a Met officer, Wayne Couzens, Lady Casey’s review of the Met’s culture found that it wasstillinstitutionally racist, as well as misogynistic and homophobic.View image in fullscreen‘I grew up in a very macho culture’ … Neil Basu.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianBasu “agrees with every single word” of the Casey review, he says. He was one of the interviewees for it. Having read the initial draft, he urged Casey to tone it down, which she did. What was it like before? “Utterly horrific,” he says. “I was crying when I walked away [after reading it]. I thought I’d wasted 30 years of my life.”Basu knew plenty about racism before he joined the Met, of course. His father was an India-born doctor who married a white Welsh nurse. The family’s neighbours in the West Midlands wouldn’t speak to them, he says: “They would complain about the smell of curry coming from our house when we didn’t even have a kitchen.” His parents didn’t tell Basu and his two brothers the worst of their experiences as a mixed-race couple, just as Basu didn’t tell them how he was regularly bullied and racially abused at school. He was born Anil Basu, but he anglicised his first name to fit in.He was “painfully shy” as a child, he says, but he was sporty, playing football, rugby and cricket. “I grew up in a very macho culture. I was in boys’ and men’s sports teams all my life and my social life was very male-dominated.” His early career aspirations were similarly masculine: professional footballer (“I wasn’t good enough”), soldier (until a car accident affected his fitness). Having studied economics, he became a banker. He was thinking of Gordon Gekko in Wall Street – this was Margaret Thatcher’s 1980s – “but I hated every single minute of it … I realised it was full of greedy, corrupt people doing a useless, valueless job”. He wanted to do something useful, like his parents. He also loved cop shows (and still does): Columbo, The Sweeney, Hill Street Blues, Inspector Morse. “If you find a police officer telling you they don’t watch police shows, I’ll show you a liar,” he says.I don’t feel like I was victimised, but I watched lots of other people be victimised and I didn’t do enough to stop itWhen Basu decided to join the Met in 1992, at 24, “lots of friends were going: ‘What on earth are you doing?’” he says. “My father carried to his grave the fact that he didn’t want me to be a cop; my mother told me that last year.” The mantra in those days was Fifo: “fit in or fuck off”, he explains. He kept his head down and his mouth shut. He tolerated the perennial “banter” about himself and other Black, brown and female officers (“I strongly believe banter is bullying,” he says). And he did not query the racial biases he saw in policing, even when they were applied to him. When he was off duty and out of uniform driving his old BMW, he would be pulled over routinely and searched by other officers. “I don’t feel like I was victimised, but I watched lots of other people be victimised and I didn’t do enough to stop it,” he says.If anything, Basu wonders if he was a beneficiary of “positive discrimination”. In 1998, he was transferred from Brixton to New Scotland Yard to be part of the response team to the Macpherson report, despite being a relatively junior detective – his brown skin was now an asset, it seemed. “The Met was trying to look for people of talent and promote them, legitimately, as part of positive action,” he says. “I happen to think I was quite good at my job as well.”View image in fullscreenBasu makes a statement at New Scotland Yard after a car crashed into security barriers outside the Houses of Parliament in 2018.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyReformsdidhappen post-Macpherson: training in race relations and recognising hate crimes, recruiting more minority ethnic staff, improving family and witness liaison. He is proud of his work at Operation Trident, where he became a senior investigating officer in 2003, at just 35. Trident was initially focused on “Black on Black” gangland homicides, which were rife inLondon. “I dealt with a murder where a guy had stood on some other guy’s brand new trainers in a nightclub queue and he went and got a gun and blew him away,” he says.The investigation later expanded to take in all gun- and gang-related crime in the capital. It was a new approach to policing, he says. “The whole purpose of Trident was to get the Black community to help us solve that problem for the Black community. So, for the first time, we’re not delivering policingtoyou; we are doing itwithyou.” Despite some heavy-handed attempts to implicate grime music, the unit achieved success, removing guns and violent gang criminals from the communities they were harming. “There’s no way we could have done the kind of things we did – kicking people’s doors in at two o’clock in the morning on all-Black estates – you don’t get to do that and not cause a riot unless somebody is helping you in that community.”But in 2011, five years after Basu had left the unit, Trident officers shot and killed Mark Duggan – a mixed-race man – in north London undercontested circumstances(the Met said it had intelligence that Duggan was armed and dangerous; Duggan’s defenders have said that a gun found seven metres away from his body was not his). It provoked riots across the country. Trust in policing was back on a downward trajectory, which would continue for the next decade, culminating in the Casey review.Where did it all go wrong? Basu cites two factors. The first is terrorism. After 9/11, in 2001, and the 7/7 terrorist attacks in London, in 2005, the threat of Islamist terrorism overshadowed all other concerns. “Anybody who started speaking about equality while you were facing that as the big trauma in policing was seen as a bit nuts,” he says. Suspicions of brown-skinned people were effectively re-legitimised – in politics, in the media and in policing. Then, in 2010, came the coalition government’s austerity programme. The Met had to make£769m of savingsbetween March 2011 and March 2015, which translated to cutting more than 3,000 jobs.As the 2020s approached, Basu’s relationship with the Met was deteriorating. He was now assistant commissioner and head of counter-terrorism, but, having stayed silent for so long, he felt the need to speak up about the culture wars around him: Islamophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, the backlash to Black Lives Matter. As he puts it in his book, “it was time to stop fitting in, but now I had no intention of fucking off”.My own bosses were talking to me in a way that they’d never talked to me before … It felt like I was being edged out of my jobThe Guardian might well have cost him his job, he jokes. In 2019, a month after Boris Johnson became prime minister, Basugave an interviewabout Brexit’s impact on counter-terrorism. Almost as an aside, he commented that Johnson would not be recruited into policing today, on account of his past comments calling Black people “picaninnies” and comparing women in burqas to letterboxes. “I felt really strongly that this was a chance, finally, to say something important about race and racism in society, and particularly about police and racism.”He continued to speak up. In June 2020, Basu wrotea column in this paperexpressing solidarity with protests in the US and the UK over the police killing of George Floyd, arguing that “we need to listen to our communities, and our people, and focus on what we in the UK can do better”. By contrast, theSewell report, the Johnson government’s response to the Floyd protests, released in March 2021, claimed that “we no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities” – a conclusion that was disputed andcondemned by many, Basu included.View image in fullscreenBasu speaks to the media after the inquest jury for the Fishmongers’ Hall attack reached its unlawful killing conclusion in 2019.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAThat month, Sarah Everard was raped and murdered by Wayne Couzens. Shortly after,David Carrick was exposed as a serial rapist. Both were serving Met officers. Basu never met either man, he says, but “it doesn’t make you feel any better that they were in your police force and in one of your commands”.As Basu became more outspoken, his position became less tenable. “I was creating a bed of nails for myself, which was going to hurt me,” he says. WhenCressida Dick, whom he considers an ally, stood down as Met commissioner in 2022, Basu was tipped to succeed her, but he had made enemies. He doubts Johnson bore a personal grudge, “but I think the people around him would have said: ‘How can you let that man get away with things like that?’” One MP reportedly considered him “too woke” for the top job. At the same time, the Met was being blamed for failing to prevent recent terrorist incidents in the capital, such as the fatal 2017 attacks atWestminster BridgeandLondon Bridge.Basu felt as if he was being singled out. “My own bosses were talking to me in a way that they’d never talked to me before,” he says. He felt he was being gaslit. “I was told I was being tired and irritable, like ‘Maybe you need a break’ … It felt like I was being edged out of my job.”Basu never wanted to be commissioner, he says, but he acknowledges: “It’s really hard to know whether that’s true or whether that is a good way of avoiding ever having to face that question.” Despite the change of government, he doubts it could happen now, even if he wanted it. He has become too politicised, he says, added to which his memoir has surely burned what bridges remained. “The only reason I’d do it is to be the first ethnic minority commissioner of the Metropolitan police. But I don’t believe that would change policing any more than having the first female, openly gay commissioner [Dick] changed policing, or Barack Obama changed the United States … It’s a nice story for a day and then it’s five years of my life that me and my family will never get back.”View image in fullscreenBasu on Westminster Bridge in 2022 for the unveiling of a memorial plaque for the victims of the London Bridge attacks in March 2017.Photograph: Imageplotter/AlamyHe only realised how much the job had taken its toll after he left the force. He has been married twice and feels guilt over how little time he has spent with his three sons, who are now in their 20s. Being commissioner would take away even more. “I served 10 commissioners, including two acting commissioners. The only one I saw get away with their reputation and their health intact was John Stevens [commissioner from 2000 to 2005, now Lord Stevens]. That is not a good advert for that job.”He occasionally misses “being in the room where it happens”, especially when he watches a good crime drama on television. “My wife hates it, because I’ll go through the entire thing correcting all of the procedural flaws.”Despite the bitterness, regrets and reverses, Basu is proud of the progress policing, and Britain, have made in matters of race. “It might have been too slow for a lot of people, but it was going in the right direction. I was confident my children would have a different experience to me. I was confident that I’d had a better experience than my parents.” When it comes down to it, he says: “I’d rather be living here as a mixed-race person than in any other single country I can think of.”Turmoil: 30 Years of Policing, Politics and Prejudice by Neil Basu is published on 10 April by Aurum (£20).

We talk to sixth-formers about the pressures and joys they experience***Contains some spoilers***The release of the hit Netflix dramaAdolescencethis month has unleashed a wave of panic around teenage boys. Keir Starmer said the UK “may have a problem with boys and young men”, while parents began worried conversations about their children’s online lives. But how true to life is it?Michael Conroy, who has been going into schools to train teachers and professionals about boys’ personal development for years, says he has seen a shift in what he hears about. “Just 10 years ago, we didn’t have young men speaking in very sexualised ways to female teachers, quite a few in the same school.” He sees the ubiquity of pornography as a huge factor, with boys as young as 11 using it obsessively. “I’m getting invited to work with primary schools now.” The knock-on effect, he says, is an unrealistic and sometimes dangerous attitude to girls and relationships.To find out what boys themselves think,Helen Piddwent to a sixth-form college in Manchester and spoke to five pupils about the pressures, difficulties and joys of being a boy. They told her about what they think of receiving unsolicited pictures, friendships with girls and why, when it comes to the views of influencers, “a lot of it is just rubbish”.Photograph: Moore Media/Getty Images/iStockphotoExplore more on these topicsAdolescenceToday in FocusYoung peopleGender"

His attorney, Lindsay Toczylowski, said officials had previously misinterpreted his tattoos as gang symbols, and that his client was scheduled to appear at an immigration court appearance in the US before he was suddenly sent toEl Salvador.The deportations come amidlegal challengesto Trump’s use of the 18th-centuryAlien Enemies Act, which a federal appeals court has blocked. A federal judge has ordered “individualized hearings“ for those targeted for removal.Intelligence agencies reportedly contradict Trump’s claims linking the Tren de Aragua gang to the Venezuelan government, undermining a key justification for the deportations,according to the New York Times.Still, theTrump administrationhas vowed to continue the deportation strategy through other means, and is currently petitioning the supreme court to lift the block on its use of the wartime deportation powers.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationMarco RubioEl SalvadorAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

There is an urgent need for trauma and surgical care, blood transfusion supplies, anaesthetics, essential medicines, and mental health support,” the UN health agency added.Later on Monday, Myanmar’s junta announced Friday’s major earthquake had led to the deaths of 2,056 people. A spokesperson said that 270 more people were still missing, with 3,900 people injured.Predictive modellingestimates by the US Geological Survey, which monitors seismic activity, suggest the death toll could eventually reach well over 10,000.The WHO said at least three hospitals were destroyed and 22 were partly damaged, while “the scale of deaths and injuries is not yet fully understood”. The agency had earlierissued an urgent flash appealfor $8m (£6.1m) for emergency support.Myanmar has declared a week of national mourning, with national flags to fly at half mast.Across central parts of the country, homes, religious sites, schools, universities, hotels and hospitals have all been damaged or destroyed. Rescue volunteers have spent days trying to free people from collapsed buildings.View image in fullscreenBuildings lie in ruins in Amarapura, Myanmar.Photograph: ReutersIn Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country’s second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants, people camped out in the streets for a third successive night. The city’s 1,000-bed general hospital had also been evacuated, with hundreds of patients being treated outside.“The situation is so dire that it’s hard to express what is happening,” said Aung Myint Hussein, the chief administrator of Sajja North mosque in Mandalay.At the U Hla Thein monastery in Mandalay, 270 monks were taking a religious exam at the time the earthquake struck. Rescue workers at the scene on Monday said 70 had been able to escape but 50 had been found dead, and 150 were still unaccounted for.Communications with many of the affected areas are poor, partly due to the country’scontinuing civil war, with much of the country out of the control of the military administration.View image in fullscreenPeople taking shelter in tents set up outdoors in Mandalay.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter a rare request by Myanmar’s isolated junta for international help – possibly due to the overwhelming magnitude of the impact – international assistance began to arrive over the weekend. China and Russia have sent aid and personnel, while India,Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore have also sent assistance.A rescue team from Taiwan has also been standing ready to provide assistance to Myanmar but has not been called upon, amid speculation that the team was denied entry so as not to offend Taiwan’s enemy and Myanmar’s ally China.The earthquake happened just as many humanitarian agencies were cutting back projects in Myanmar after Donald Trump’s cuts to the main US humanitarian group, USAID.The US state department said on Monday, three days after the quake struck, that a USAid team was heading to Myanmar to help identify the country’s most pressing needs, a move thatlagged far behind the aid efforts of other countriesthat are already on the ground.State department spokesperson Tammy Bruce denied that funding and personnel cuts were impeding USAid’s response and said Washington was working with partners in Myanmar to get help to affected people.Sarah Charles, who headed the agency’s humanitarian assistance bureau until February last year, said the response had been hurt by “a lot of internal confusion about capability to respond and willingness to respond”. Cuts by the so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, had delayed what would have been the start of a US emergency response within 24 hours of the disaster, Charles said.The UN representative in Myanmar, Marcoluigi Corsi, said: “Even before this earthquake, nearly 20 million people in Myanmar were in need of humanitarian assistance.“This latest tragedy compounds an already dire crisis and risks further eroding the resilience of communities already battered by conflict, displacement and past disasters.”Aftermath of the Myanmar earthquake – a visual guideRead moreMyanmar was already in crisis before the disaster, due to a spiralling conflict triggered when themilitary seized power in a coup in 2021.

At least 19 people are known to have been killed in Thailand.The country’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, has also called a meeting with government departments responsible for sending SMS alerts to the public, amid criticism of the response when the earthquake struck.Agence France-Presse andAssociated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsMyanmarThailandAsia PacificSouth and central AsiaEarthquakesnewsShareReuse this content"

China is among several countries that have sent aid and personnel to assist in rescue efforts.A video showed onlookers clapping as the woman was carried away on a stretcher. She was reported to be in a stable condition, the embassy said.Across central Myanmar rescue teams have scrambled to free people from beneath countless collapsed buildings. Homes, religious sites, schools, universities, hotels and hospitals have all been damaged or destroyed.On Sunday, workers rushing to find survivors at an apartment complex in Mandalay, freed a pregnant woman who had been trapped for two days, amputating her leg in order to free her. However she was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Many more are feared trapped beneath the 12 storey building complex.Rescue efforts also continued in the Thai capital Bangkok, where 76 workers are believed to be trapped under a 30-storey tower that collapsed while under construction.Across central Myanmar, emergency teams have been hampered by a lack of equipment, with some rescuers using their bare hands to search for the missing.

Sending aid to the junta will only make things worse,” said Debbie Stothard, the founder of Altsean-Burma, a network of human rights organisations in south-east Asia.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarSouth and central AsiaThailandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The school’s principal, Brendan Cahill, issued a statement to students’ parents last week saying Green had agreed to take leave from the school and had given him assurances she had not made any political statements to students. The school had also reached out to the Queensland Jewish Board of Deputies, Cahill said in the letter, and was further investigating Green’s “personal musical recordings”.Green has not commented publicly on her awards speech or her departure from the school.Last week, the lord mayor of Brisbane, Adrian Schrinner, pulled the council’s $25,000 funding for the awards.“Music should be a positive force that brings people together, not tear them apart,” the Lord Mayor’s statement said.A further $450,000 in annual funding to the awards’ organiser, QMusic, is now under review, with the state government’s arts minister, John-Paul Langbroek, demanding an explanation from the organisation why the awards were allowed to become a platform for “divisive commentary”.“I will be questioning the awards process, current eligibility criteria, and comments made at the awards ceremony,” Langbroek said in a statement.QMusic’s chief executive, Kris Stewart, did not respond to the Guardian’s queries on Monday.The petition, launched by Taiwanese-Australian composer musician Matt Hsu, the founder of Brisbane’s Obscure Orchestra, criticises both the “inflammatory” and “unfounded” claims by Schrinner, and a subsequent statement from Stewart, who said music awards should not be a “platform for political debate”.Hsu told Guardian Australia on Monday QMusic was using the guise of neutrality to curb artists’ freedom of expression.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m heartbroken that we can’t quite seem to find respectful ways to have a conversation on this, one in which artists should be centred, and that it seems to have become so politically divisive in our country, a place for freedom of expression and thought has always been central to our national character.”Gillham, who is suing the MSO after it cancelled a performance after his onstage support for the people of Palestine last August, said on Monday he was deeply alarmed and concerned about the increasing pressure being applied to cultural organisations to silence and deplatform artists who make public statements in support of Palestine.“The recent decision by Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner to withdraw Brisbane city council funding from the Queensland Music Awards following pianist Kellee Green’s acceptance speech – in which she spoke about the suffering of Palestinian civilians and urged peaceful protest and action – is yet another example of this troubling trend,” he said.“Attempts to label such speech as “hate” in order to suppress political expression are not only damaging to individual artists, but also to the health and integrity of our cultural institutions and public discourse.“Now, more than ever, we must uphold the principles of artistic freedom, open dialogue, and the right to speak out against injustice – especially within the arts.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian musicQueenslandnewsShareReuse this content"

The survey of 1,100 people was of a piece with recent major polls from Newspoll, Resolve and YouGov, which showed small movements toward Labor in recent weeks.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIt continued a small steady uptick in support for Labor, after the last two polls put the raceat 47% to 47%in mid-March, and47% to 48% to the Coalitionin early March.But while Albanese’s personal approval ratings took another two-point hit in this week’s poll, with 44% of voters approving and 46% disapproving, he remained ahead of Dutton, who scored 41% and 47% on the same measures.Essential’s “primary+” measure also allows voters to remain undecided. It put Labor’s primary vote at 30%, the Coalition’s at 34%, the Greens’ at 12%, and minor party and independent support at 19%, with 5% undecided.According to the latest analysis fromGuardian Australia’s poll tracker– a model developed by political scientists, which follows all the major polls – the Coalition still leads overall on primary and two-party-preferred support.Australian election 2025 polls tracker: Labor v Coalition latest opinion polling resultsRead moreAfter four consecutive weeks of gains for Labor, the model showed the party’s two-party-preferred support starting to level off.Dutton’s campaign, after three days on the road, had visited his own seat of Dickson and the National-held Maranoa; the Greens seat of Brisbane; Labor-held Moreton, McMahon, Macarthur and Paterson; and independent Fowler. But of those, only Brisbane and Paterson are considered seriously in play for the Coalition.Albanese had visited Coalition-held Dickson and Hinkler, plus Labor-held Eden-Monaro, Canberra and Hasluck.The early patterns of travel showed Dutton keen to pick up new seats, with the Coalition needing about 20 new seats to win government, while Albanese visited two key seats Labor wants to protect from Liberal challenge.Both Albanese and Dutton continued to score poorly on several key leadership questions among voters. Asked whether the party leaders were “out of touch with ordinary people”, 57% said it of Albanese (down six points from last poll) and 57% also of Dutton (up two points from the last poll). Some 53% of voters described Dutton as “decisive”, but only 44% said the same of Albanese; while 44% described Albanese as “trustworthy”, only 41% said the same of Dutton.The opposition leader was ranked as “competent” by 53% of voters; only 50% described the prime minister that way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is their standard playbook throughout the world.” He added: “This will backfire, like the legal attacks against President Trump.”Trump himself said the conviction and ban from running for office was a “very big deal” adding, “that sounds like this country, that sounds very much like this country,” in an apparent reference to legal cases that he himself faced before he took office.“Je suis Marine!” (“I am Marine”), Hungary’s illiberal prime minister,Viktor Orbán, posted in French on social media, referencing the rallying cry “Je suis Charlie” widely used in support after the 2015 Islamist attack on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine.In the Netherlands, the far-right Freedom party (PVV) leader,Geert Wilders, said he was “shocked by the incredibly tough verdict”, adding: “I support and believe in her for the full 100% and I trust she will win the appeal and become president of France.”Tom Van Grieken of Belgium’s Vlaams Belang called the decision “an attack on democracy”, while Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain’s far-right Vox party, posted: “They will never succeed to silence the voice of the French people.”Many described the ruling as political. Jair Bolsonaro, the former president of Brazil, told Reuters: “This ruling is clearly leftwing judicial activism. Wherever the right wing is present, the left and the system will work to get their opponents out of the game.”Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and the leader of the far-right League party, said: “Those who fear the judgment of the voters often find reassurance in the judgment of the courts.“In Paris they condemnedMarine Le Penand would like to exclude her from political life,” he said. Salvini added that the decision was “a declaration of war by Brussels” and “a bad film that we are also seeing in other countries such as Romania”.Earlier this month Romania’s constitutional court upheld a decision to ban the far-right presidential election frontrunner Călin Georgescu from standing in a rerun of the vote in May afterthe initial result was annulledbecause of suspected Russian interference.George Simion, Georgescu’s far-right replacement – who is also ahead in the polls – said of the Paris verdict: “Targeting or annihilating your political opponent by any means is straight out of the instruction manual of totalitarian regimes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jordan Bardella, the RN’s 29-year-old president and Le Pen’s likely replacement if she cannot stand, said she was the victim of an “unjust” verdict and claimed French democracy was being “executed”.Some conservative politicians also expressed their reservations about the impact of the ruling. Laurent Wauquiez of the centre-right Les Républicains (LR) said it it was “not healthy” for an elected official to be prevented from running in an election.Marine Le Pen verdict throws National Rally into chaos but could boost far right | Angelique ChrisafisRead more“Political debates must be settled at the ballot box and it is the French people who must decide,” Wauquiez, his party’s likely presidential candidate, said, adding that the court decision would “weigh heavily on the functioning of the French democracy”.On the radical left, Yanis Varoufakis, Greece’s former finance minister, said a “panicking illiberal establishment across the west” was “diving headlong into a totalitarian pit” and “France’s neofascists will only benefit from this”.But Jürgen Hardt, a German conservative, said Le Pen had seen the EU as “a self-service store with which she could finance herself and her party”, adding that her fate “should be a warning to all corrupt politicians on the left and right fringes”.And the German Green MEP Daniel Freund, the chair of the European parliament’s anti-corruption working group, said the court had “shown that the rule of law applies to everyone, regardless of polling numbers”.Explore more on these topicsMarine Le PenFranceNational RallyEuropeThe far rightElon MuskViktor OrbánnewsShareReuse this content"

She was also ordered to pay a €100,000 (£84,000) fine.A furious Le Pen announced she would lodge an appeal against the ruling, as nationalist and populist figures from around the world rushed to support her.Donald Trump said the conviction was a “very big deal”.“I know all about it, and a lot of people thought she wasn’t going to be convicted of anything,” the US president told reporters at the White House. “But she was banned for running for five years, and she’s the leading candidate. That sounds like this country, that sounds very much like this country,” Trump said, in an apparent reference to legal cases that Trump himself faced before he took office.Elon Musk, Tesla’s billionaire owner, who has backed the far right in Germany and plays a major role in Trump’s administration, said thesentence against Le Pen would “backfire, like the legal attacks against president Trump”.The judges’ decision, backed by more than 150 pages of legal justifications after a nine-week trial, was necessary because nobody was entitled to “immunity in violation of the rule of law”, the head judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis,​ said.It was nonetheless considered a political earthquake in France as Le Pen had hoped to mount a fourth campaign to become president for her anti-immigrationNational Rally(RN) party.Speaking for the first time in public about the verdict, Le Pen told TF1 television on Monday night that she would “pursue whatever legal avenues” she could to prevent herself from being “eliminated”. “I’m not going to submit to a denial of democracy this easily,” she said.Le Pen, who was not found to have benefited personally from the embezzlement, insisted she had done nothing wrong. “I am going to appeal because I am innocent,” she said.“I’m not going to let myself be eliminated like this. I’m going to pursue whatever legal avenues I can,” she added.The RN, the single largest party in the French parliament, called the sentence a travesty.The president of the RN, Jordan Bardella, 29, who could be considered a replacement presidential candidate despite his relative inexperience, said: “Today it is not onlyMarine Le Penwho was unjustly condemned: French democracy was killed.”He urged party supporters to “mobilise” peacefully to show “that the will of the people is stronger”, starting a petition in support of Le Pen and a leafleting campaign across the country to take place this weekend.The ban on running for public office, to last five years, was ordered to kick in with immediate effect, meaning it will apply even though Le Pen, 56, is appealing against the verdict.Neither the prison penalty nor fine will be applied until her appeals are exhausted, a process that could take years.In the front row of the court, Le Pen showed no immediate reaction when the judge declared her guilty. But she grew more agitated and shook her head in disagreement as the judge said her party had illegally used European funds for its own benefit.At one point, Le Pen whispered: “Incredible.” She then abruptly left without warning, before her sentence had been handed down.Before Monday’s ruling, she had considered the 2027 presidential race as her best chance to gain more ground on an anti-immigration platform, while her opponents attacked her party’s policy platform as racist, xenophobic and anti-Islam.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Socialist president, François Hollande, said the judge’s decision was “based on law” for “serious” allegations. But Laurent Wauquiez, of the traditional right Les Républicains party, said it was a “very heavy and exceptional sentence” that was “not very healthy in democracy”.Mathieu Lefèvre, a member of parliament for Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party, told BFMTV: “Marine Le Pen isn’t the victim of a political or judicial conspiracy. She’s perhaps first the victim of herself and a system of embezzlement.”Le Pen and 24 party members, including nine former members of the European parliament and their 12 parliamentary assistants, were found guilty of a vast scheme over many years to embezzle European parliament funds, by using money earmarked for European parliament assistants to instead pay party workers inFrance.The so-called fake jobs system covered parliamentary assistant contracts between 2004 and 2016, and was unprecedented in scale and duration, causing losses of €4.5m (£3.8m) to European taxpayer funds. Assistants paid by the European parliament must work directly on Strasbourg parliamentary matters, which the judges found had not been the case.Le Pen will be able to retain her current post as a member of the French parliament for Pas-de-Calais, but will not be able to stand again in a future parliamentary election for the duration of her ban on running for office.Le Pen took over the leadership of the Front National from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2011 and began a drive to sanitise the party’s jackbooted, antisemitic image.Sherenamed the party National Rally in 2018, wanting it to be viewed as a potential governing force, not just a protest movement, and has run for president three times, twice making it to the final run-off against Emmanuel Macron.In 2022, Le Pen provided the far right with its highest-ever tally in a French presidential election,winning more than 13m votes.An Ifop poll published by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper this weekend found Le Pen could have won 34-37% in the first round of the next presidential election and her fate in the run-off second round would depend on whether all her opponents united to vote against her.The party will now have to decide who would take her place in the next French presidential race.Bardella, a member of the European parliament, is popular among voters but is seen as having little experience.Explore more on these topicsMarine Le PenFranceNational RallyEuropean UnionEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

The fourth soldier is still missing.The Lithuanian authorities received a report on Tuesday that the soldiers went missing on an expansive training ground in the eastern city of Pabradė, near the border with Belarus. The soldiers were on a tactical training exercise when they and their vehicle were reported missing, the US army said.“We stand in grief with the families and loved ones of these extraordinary ‘dogface soldiers’ during this unimaginable time,” said Maj Gen Christopher Norrie, 3rd infantry division commander. “But the search isn’t finished until everyone is home. Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found.”The bodies of the three soldiers were recovered after a massive six-day effort by US, Polish and Lithuanian armed forces and authorities to dig the M88 Hercules armoured recovery vehicle out of a peat bog.Search and rescue teams worked with heavy equipment and excavators to remove silt from the water before eventually towing the vehicle out early on Monday.“Three US army soldiers assigned to 1st Armored brigade combat team, 3rd infantry division were found deceased in Lithuania today, 31 March,” US ArmyEuropeand Africa’s public affairs office said in a statement. The soldiers’ identities were being “withheld pending notification of next of kin”, it added.Hundreds of local and foreign troops and other rescue workers, including engineers and divers, were involved in the rescue operation to recover the armoured vehicle.Lithuanian armed forces provided military helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, unmanned aerial systems and search-and-rescue personnel. They brought in additional excavators, sluice and slurry pumps, other heavy construction equipment, technical experts and several hundred tonnes of gravel and earth to help the recovery.US navy divers were able to manoeuvre through thick layers of mud, clay and sediment “with zero visibility” to reach the 63-tonne vehicle on Sunday evening and find two points to attach steel cables, according to the command.The command said that during the effort to pull the vehicle out, it began to lose traction, so additional heavy bulldozers were brought in and attached to provide additional grip. The vehicle was pulled free after about two hours.The US navy dive team is searching the area using radar for the missing fourth soldier.Maj Gen Curtis Taylor, commander of Task Force Iron and the 1st Armored division, thanked the “heroic efforts” of those involved in the search and recovery. The US army and Lithuanian authorities are investigating what caused the incident.Lithuania, a Nato and EU member, hosts more than 1,000 US troops stationed on a rotational basis.Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS militaryLithuaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It isno longer the government of judges, but the dictatorship of judges, which wishes to prevent the French people from expressing themselves,” the text said.The party called “for a popular and peaceful mobilisation,”urging supporters to “show those would want to circumvent democracy that the will of the people is stronger!”“You have always been able to count on Marine Le Pen, on her willingness to defend you, on her patriotism. Today, she is counting on you,” it said.Share"

Polls had long suggested that Le Pen, who helms the far-right theNational Rally(RN) party, was among the leading contenders to succeed the country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, after his second and final term ends in 2027.If Le Pen cannot run, most have pointed to Bardella, her 29-year-old protege who succeeded her at the helm of the party in 2021, asthe most probable presidential candidate. At times cast as too young and inexperienced, Bardella has, however, seemingly had the backing of his boss. “Of course he has the capacity to become president of the republic,” Le Pen said in a documentary broadcast by BFMTV late on Sunday.Such a move would nonetheless mark a dramatic new era forFranceand – far-right politics aside – may seem unthinkable for many voters. When Macron was elected president in 2017, he was 39 years old, which made him the youngest president in the history of the Fifth Republic. Before his election, the average age at which a French president was elected was 58.5 years.First elected to the European parliament at the age of 23,Bardella became the new face of the French far rightlast year after he led the RN’sEuropean election campaignto unprecedented heights.He then went on to lead the RN during France’s snap parliamentary elections, yielding a third-place finish despite polls that suggested the party would come first. (RN garnered most votes in the first round but was relegated byan alliance on the left voting tacticallyin the second round.) “We always make mistakes, I made mistakes, and I take my share of responsibility for the results,” Bardella told French television soon after the results came in.View image in fullscreenJordan Bardella (right) and RN member and EU lawmaker Fabrice Leggeri inside a bomb shelter with an Israeli army officer, Ethan Dana, during a visit to Netiv Haasara kibbutz in southern Israel.Photograph: Jack Guez/ReutersThe son of Italians who arrived in France in the 1960s, Bardella joined the far-right party at the age of 16. He embodied a striking contrast to Le Pen. Growing up on a housing estate in Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb, he was raised by a single mother who he said often had just €20 left in her purse at the end of the month.Smooth-talking and clad in navy suits, Bardella soon proved himself adept at sticking closely to the party’s hardline stance, leveraging his massive following on French TikTok to attempt to normalisethe RN’s vehemence against immigrants, and Muslims in particular. Earlier this month, he became the first RN party leader to visit Israel, speaking at a conference on the fight against antisemitism.Last year, after two years spent analysing Bardella’s speeches, one academic described them as being “copy-pasted” from Le Pen and her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, a founder of the party launched in the 1970s as the National Front and who was known for making antisemitic, racist remarks.“It’s still the same triad of immigration, identity and Islam. The big difference is tone and style,” Cécile Alduy, a professor at Stanford University, said. “The message is the same but delivered in a really smooth, poised and calm tone of voice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In what was seen by many at the time as a swipe at Le Pen – and which ledone leftwing politician to call him “Brutus”after the Roman politician who assassinated his ex-ally Julius Caesar – Bardella told BFMTV that “not having a criminal record is, for me, rule number one when you want to be an MP”.Explore more on these topicsNational RallyMarine Le PenFranceThe far rightEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”.Trump’s latest threat – more explicit and violent than any made before – came after he sent a letter to Iran, as yet undisclosed,offering to hold talks on its nuclear programme. Iran had sent a reply to the US stating it was willing to hold indirect talks, officials confirmed.Esmail Baghaei, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, said of Trump’s threat: “The explicit threat of bombing Iran by the head of a country is clear contradiction to the essence of international peace and security.“Such a threat is a gross violation of the United Nations charter and a violation of the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards regime. Violence brings violence and peace creates peace, America can choose.”The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a sceptic about talks with the US, said Iran was “not overly concerned” by Trump’s words. “We consider it unlikely that such harm would come from outside. However, if any malicious act does occur, it will certainly be met with a firmand decisive response,” he said.Brig Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the Revolutionary Guard’s aerospace force, said: “Someone in glass houses does not throw stones at anyone,” adding: “The Americans have at least 10 bases with 50,000 troops in the region, meaning they are sitting in a glass house.”But the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, clearly had authority to keep the prospect of talks alive, saying Iran had already replied to the Trump letter through intermediaries in Oman and adding he knew the Iranian letter had now reached the US. Araghchi said direct talks were not possible while the US continued to threaten and bully Iran.View image in fullscreenIran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi.Photograph: Karen Minasyan/AFP/Getty ImagesTrump sent his original letter proposing talks through the United Arab Emirates’ senior diplomatic envoy, Anwar Gargash.The choice of Gargash as an intermediary was seen as a sign that the letter was intended to give negotiations a genuine chance, rather than leave Iran no option but to reject the offer of talks.Trump has set a deadline of mid-May for progress to be made, but a longer deadline also exists of mid-August, by which time the original 2015 nuclear agreement will largely expire and a European response will be required. Trumptook the US out of that agreementin 2018, a move widely seen as a mistake since it led Iran to speed up its uranium enrichment programme.That Iran sent its reply through Oman, its traditional chosen mediator, rather than the UAE may suggest Iran does not want the UAE – which has normalised relations with Israel – to act as intermediaries. The US and Iran had held indirect talks on reviving the nuclear agreement under the Biden administrationin Vienna from 2021, but they fizzled out, and all sides agreed the indirect nature of the talks ate up time, something Trump is reluctant to offer Iran.Some of the ground will have been covered in four rounds of parallel talks held between Iranian and European negotiators in Geneva.Contempt as Trump claims he can run for third term: ‘This is what dictators do’Read moreTehran has not commented on how broadly the Trump letter went in demanding concessions from Iran. But the Iranian ambassador to Iraq, Mohammad Kazem al-Sadegh, indicated the US was seeking talks that went wider than the nuclear programme, saying the letter called for the disbandment of the Iranian-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces militia.The US administration has been divided over whether to simply demand Iran expose its civil nuclear programme to fuller international inspection, or make a wider set of demands including a complete end to its nuclear programme and an Iranian commitment to stop bankrolling resistance groups in the Middle East such as Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen.The US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, has called for the “full dismantlement” of the Iranian nuclear programme, something Tehran rejects. By contrast, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, spoke only of restricting Iran’s nuclear programme, something Iran has been willing to accept since 2015 so long as it leads to a lifting of sanctions on the Iranian economy. Some inside the Trump administration believe an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities will produce regime change.Trump will want assurances, at the very least, that a revived Iranian economy will not just lead to extra funds for Iranian-backed militia. Kamal Kharazi, the head of Iran’s strategic council on foreign relations and sometimes touted as a chief negotiator, has accused the US of operating a psychological war by adopting a policy of “either war or negotiation”.Widespread rejection in the Gulf of a US-inspired attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is a relatively new factor in the equation, and Trump’s plan to reportedly visit Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip means he may personally hear strong opposition to an attack on Iran from the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.The Gulf’s opposition to an attack on Iran is based not on close ideological affinity with Iran, but on a sense the region must avoid further political instability, and with the current Iranian leadership already weakened, regime change is not something they welcome.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIran nuclear dealDonald TrumpNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

A Red Crescent official in Gaza said that there was evidence of at least one person being detained and killed, as the body of one of the dead had been found with his hands tied.The shootings happened on 23 March, one day into the renewed Israeli offensive in the area close to the Egyptian border. Another Red Crescent worker on the mission is reported missing.“Seven days ago, civil defence and PRCS ambulances arrived at the scene,” the head of Ocha in Palestine, Jonathan Whittall, said in a video statement. “One by one, [the paramedics and civil defense workers] were hit, they were struck. Their bodies were gathered and buried in this mass grave.“We’re digging them out in their uniforms, with their gloves on. They were here to save lives. Instead, they ended up in a mass grave,” Whittall said. “These ambulances have been buried in the sand. There’s a UN vehicle here, buried in the sand. A bulldozer – Israeli forces bulldozer – has buried them.”Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said that one of its employees was among the dead found in Rafah.“The body of our colleague killed in Rafah was retrieved yesterday, together with the aid workers from [the Palestinian Red Crescent] – all of them discarded in shallow graves – a profound violation of human dignity,” Lazzarini wrote in a social media post.View image in fullscreenRed Crescent staff digging in the area.Photograph: Red CrescentIsrael’s military said its “initial assessment” of the incident had found that its troops had opened fire on several vehicles “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”.It added that the movement of the vehicle had not been coordinated with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in advance, and that the area was an “active combat zone”. The Red Crescent said the Tel al-Sultan district had been considered safe, and movement there was normal, “requiring no coordination”.On Monday the IDF issued evacuation orders covering most of Rafah, indicating it could soon launch another major ground operation, eight days after the paramedics and rescue workers were killed.The IDF did not reply on Monday to a request for comment on the reports that the paramedics and rescue workers had been buried in a mass grave at the scene of the shooting. It earlier claimed to have killed nine militants from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad on 23 March, but its statement did not make clear whether it was alleging the militants had been in the Red Crescent ambulances, or had been hit by an airstrike on Rafah earlier in the night.According to the Red Crescent, an ambulance was dispatched to pick up the casualties from the airstrike in the early hours of 23 March and called for a support ambulance. The first ambulance arrived at hospital safely but contact was lost with the support ambulance at 3.30am. An initial report from the scene said it had been shot at and the two paramedics inside had been killed.A convoy of five vehicles, including ambulances, civil defence trucks and two cars from the health ministry, were sent to retrieve the bodies. That convoy then came under fire, and the Red Crescent said most of the dead were from that attack. Eight of the dead were from the Red Crescent, six from civil defence and one was a UN employee.Dr Bashar Murad, the Red Crescent’s director of health programmes, said one of the paramedics in the convoy had been on a call to his colleagues at the ambulance station when the attack took place.“He informed us that he was injured and requested assistance, and that another person was also injured,” Murad said. “A few minutes later, during the call, we heard the sound of Israeli soldiers arriving at the location, speaking in Hebrew. The conversation was about gathering the team, with statements like: ‘Gather them at the wall and bring some restraints to tie them.’ This indicated that a large number of the medical staff were still alive.”View image in fullscreen‘Healthcare workers should never be a target,’ said Jonathan Whittall.Photograph: Red CrescentThe Palestinian Red Crescent president, Younis al-Khatib, said the IDF had impeded the collection of the bodies for several days. The IDF said it had facilitated the evacuation of bodies as soon as “operational circumstances” allowed.“The bodies were recovered with difficulty as they were buried in the sand, with some showing signs of decomposition,” the Red Crescent said.Their burial had been put off pending autopsies, Murad said. “What is certain and very clear is that they were shot in the upper parts of their bodies, then gathered in a hole one on top of another, with sand thrown over them and buried,” he said. He said the body of one of the victims was recovered from the grave with his hands still tied. The claim could not be independently confirmed.Whittall described the mission to recover the bodies as fraught. “While travelling to the area on the fifth day we encountered hundreds of civilians fleeing under gunfire,” he said. “We witnessed a woman shot in the back of the head. When a young man tried to retrieve her, he too was shot. We were able to recover her body using our UN vehicle.”“It’s absolute horror what has happened here,” he added. “This should never happen. healthcare workers should never be a target.”Jens Lærke, an Ocha spokesperson in Geneva, said: “The available information indicates that the first team was killed by Israeli forces on 23 March, and that other emergency and aid crews were struck one after another over several hours as they searched for their missing colleagues.“They were buried under the sand, alongside their wrecked emergency vehicles – clearly marked ambulances, a fire truck and a UN car.”View image in fullscreen‘These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people,’ said the IFRC secretary general.Photograph: Red CrescentThe Red Crescent named the employees killed on 23 March as Mustafa Khafaja, Ezzedine Shaat, Saleh Muammar, Rifaat Radwan, Mohammed Bahloul, Ashraf Abu Labda, Mohammed Hilieh, and Raed Al-Sharif. The incident was the single most deadly attack on Red Cross or Red Crescent workers anywhere since 2017, the IFRC said.“I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians,” said the IFRC secretary general, Jagan Chapagain. “They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked.”According to the United Nations, at least 1,060 healthcare workers have been killed in the 18 months since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza. That began after Hamas fighters stormed communities in southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people. The global body is reducing its international staff in Gaza by a thirdowing to staff safety concerns.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The death toll, now at 1,700, is widely expected to rise.‘Wherever I looked I saw collapsed buildings’: Myanmar quake rescuers and medics struggle with size of taskRead moreDespite the logistical challenges, some countries have been quick to act. But Donald Trump has been accused of blowing up the US’s ability to respond to international disasters throughcuts to foreign aid programmes.China sent an 82-person team of rescuers into the country on Saturday. On Sunday, the state-run Xinhua news agency said a 118-member search and rescue team had also arrived. The team included earthquake experts, medical workers, field hospital workers and rescue dogs.The Chinese government said on Monday that it has sent a first batch of relief supplies worth 100m yuan ($13.78m) to Myanmar, including tents, blankets and first aid kits, the official Xinhua news agency reported.Hong Kong has earmarked HK$30m ($3.8m) for emergency relief support, and sent in a 51-person team, with two search and rescue dogs and equipment, including life detectors. Russia’s emergency and health ministries said they had flown 120 rescuers, a medical team and supplies to Myanmar. And an aid flight from India landed in Myanmar on Saturday, with four more aircraft and two navy ships on the way, officials said.The UK has pledged £10m ($12.9m) in humanitarian aid, with UK-funded local partners already mobilising on the ground. The EU has promised €2.5m ($2.7m) in initial emergency relief.View image in fullscreenA photo taken from video released by Russia’s emergency ministry showing Russian and Chinese colleagues helping rescue a woman from the rubble in Mandalay, Myanmar.Photograph: APFrom south-east Asia, Indonesia will deploy logistical aid from Monday, including a hospital ship and several helicopters. The Philippines and Vietnam are sending teams of medics.But the US, once among the biggest providers of foreign aid, has been slow to act, with a modest pledge of $2m announced on Sunday. “It’s a real bad one, and we will be helping. We’ve already spoken with the country,” Donald Trump told reporters on Friday, describing the quake as “terrible”.The US embassy in Myanmar added in a statement on Sunday that “aUSAIDemergency response team is deploying to Myanmar to identify the people’s most pressing needs, including emergency shelter, food, medical needs, and access to water”.But Trump’s gutting of American foreign aid infrastructure and funding mean the three-person USAID assessment team is not expected to arrive in Myanmar until Wednesday, almost a week after the disaster, according to areportby the New York Times.It was also unclear what aid would be sent, or how any money would be used, given that the systems needed to distribute aid had been dismantled, said Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates. “Maybe the embassy can do it, but they don’t have any of [USAID’s] specialists.”Aftermath of the Myanmar earthquake – a visual guideRead moreKey among those specialists are USAID’s elite disaster assistance response teams (Darts), which are usually deployed as first responders to catastrophes worldwide to coordinate US relief efforts, direct aid and provide technical expertise. Those teams will probably vanish as USAID gets dismantled.Robertson said the US had gone from “leader” to “laggard”.A US rescue team arrived in Thailand on Sunday to assist with search efforts at the site of a building that collapsed in the capital, Bangkok.Delivering help to neighbouring Myanmar, which is gripped by conflict, will be far more challenging. Rights groups have warned that assistance should be funnelled carefully to the country through community-based groups, and not the military junta, which has a history of weaponising aid.“Donald Trump has completely blown up the US government’s ability to respond to international disasters. He unilaterally dismantled the pre-eminent aid agency,” Robertson said.“It’s entirely appropriate that China and Russia are sending their teams faster than the US did. Because that’s the new reality … This is something we’re going to see time and time again over the coming years, every time there’s a disaster.”The US had been “disarmed” in relation to its soft power, he added.On Friday a three-judge panel lifted the injunction blocking Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) from shuttering USAID, at roughly the same time the Trump administration notified Congress of plans to eliminate the agency entirely, despite pushback from some members of Congress, who say their permission is required first.USAID staff worldwide have received termination notices effective in July or September which, if enacted, would leave a skeleton aid crew operating under the banner of the US Department of State.Nether the state department nor a USAID-state coordinating office responded to a request for comment.In the wake of a natural disaster, the swift deployment of aid was key, said humanitarian organisations such as Doctors Without Borders.International organisations such as the World Health Organization – from which the US recently withdrew – has mobilised its logistics hub in Dubai to prepare trauma injury supplies and trigger its emergency management response. The agency is urgently seeking $8m to save lives and prevent disease outbreaks over the next 30 days.The UN humanitarian agency Ocha is also mobilising emergency response efforts, alongside its partner organisations.“A severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers,” Ocha said in a statement on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarUS foreign policyEarthquakesSouth and central AsiaUSAIDNatural disastersnewsShareReuse this content"

Emergency services launched a “large-scale response” to the incident, the force said, but the search was later scaled down.London ambulance service (LAS), the London fire brigade (LFB) and the RNLI said its crews had been stood down. The girl’s next of kin have been made aware and are being supported by officers.LAS was called at a similar time to police after receiving a report of a person in the water at Lowestoft Mews.An LAS spokesperson said: “We sent resources to the scene, including an ambulance crew, an advanced paramedic, an incident response officer and members of our hazardous area response team.“Our crews assisted our emergency services partners at the scene but were later stood down.”The LFB deputy assistant commissioner, Joseph Kenny, said: “Firefighters responded to reports of a person in the River Thames near Lowestoft Mews, Newham. Crews from East Ham, Barking, Ilford and Bexley fire stations were sent to the scene alongside crews from the HM Coastguard, RNLI, London ambulance service and the Metropolitan police service.“The brigade also deployed its drone team and fire boat as part of its response, with crews carrying out a systematic search of the area. The brigade was first called about the incident at 1.23pm. Search operations for firefighters were concluded at 3.49pm when responsibility for the incident was left with the police.”A woman said she carried a life ring to the Thames shoreline to try to save the girl but was unable to find her.Kerry Benadjaoud, 62, told the PA news agency: “My neighbour next door, she was outside doing her garden and there was two little kids running, and they said ‘my friend’s in the water.’”A man told Benadjaoud that he had called the police, she said, adding: “But he said at the time he could see [the girl’s] hands going down.

She added: “She greatly appreciates the support and well wishes people are sending.”Giuffre is one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers, and also alleged she was abused byPrince Andrew. She was last reported to be living in Australia.A social media post from four weeks ago suggested Giuffre was in Perth in early March. Western Australia police said on Tuesday they had no record of an incident involving a bus and car in recent weeks. St Johns Ambulance WA said they were not immediately aware of such an incident.In 2021, Giuffrefiled a civil lawsuitagainstPrince Andrewin federal court in New York, alleging he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17.Andrew has repeatedly and strongly denied the accusations.In the lawsuit, Giuffre alleged Epstein and his longtime girlfriendGhislaine Maxwellhad introduced her to Andrew in 2001, and alleged that Maxwell forced her to have sex with Andrew.In 2022,Andrew and Giuffre agreed to an out-of-court settlementfor an undisclosed sum.Maxwell, who has maintained her innocence,was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022for sex trafficking.Epstein wasarrested by federal authorities in July 2019and charged with sex-trafficking counts. Shortly after, hedied by suicidewhile awaiting trial.Explore more on these topicsUS newsPrince AndrewJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has contacted his company Yianis Group for comment.Jordan Osserman, a spokesperson for the campaign, said: “This case shows how the law is rigged against renters. Christodoulou makes millions off our rent while flouting the law and cutting corners on safety.”During the hearing earlier in March, the judge in the first-tier tribunal (property chamber), Robert Latham, said: “The respondent can only be characterised as a rogue landlord.”After a lengthy legal battle that began in 2020 – when the landlord rejected residents’ request for rent reliefduring the Covid-19 crisis, telling them they coulduse money saved on lunches to pay their rentin full – 46 residents from 15 different flats across Olympic House and Simpson House have been awarded a combined total of £263,555.68.The ruling forms part of a rent repayment order (RRO). These were introduced in housing legislation in 2016 and empower the property chamber of the first-tier tribunal to force a landlord who has broken the law on housing standards to pay back part, or all, of the rent.There are now concerns that Christodoulou may not pay, despite the order. The London Renters Union said the tenants had discovered that the landlord was attempting to liquidate the companies that the judgments are against after transferring ownership of Olympic House and Simpson House from one company to another within his corporate group at a large loss or undervalue.Marc Sutton, a member of Somerford Grove Renters, which represents 170 flats in Olympic House, Simpson House and St John’s Court in Hackney, all majority-owned by Christodoulou, said: “This appears to be a deliberate attempt to evade financial responsibility through corporate restructuring.“These tactics highlight how wealthy landlords manipulate corporate structures to avoid accountability while tenants suffer the consequences.”Osserman added: “Even when we win in court, landlords like Christodoulou can game the system to avoid paying up.” He added: “The only way we can fight back is by organising and taking collective action.”Explore more on these topicsHousingRenting propertyLondonHackneyPropertynewsShareReuse this content"

They alleged the investigation into her death had been marred by delays, a lack of communication and institutional homophobia.More than 100 people joined Peaches Christ, the Scissor Sisters’ Ana Matronic, and the former RuPaul’sDragRace contestants Cheddar Gorgeous and Crystal outside New Scotland Yard in central London with placards reading “Justice for Heklina”, “Pride not prejudice, hold the Met accountable” and “End Met police homophobia now!”View image in fullscreenThe Scissor Sisters’ Ana Matronic gives a speech on London’s Embankment.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZumaPress Wire/Rex/ShutterstockPeaches Christ said: “Heklina was one of my oldest and closest friends. We were family and finding her dead in London was truly traumatising, but it has only been made worse by the complete lack of attention from the London Met police.“For nearly two years, myself and Heklina’s next of kin have been ignored. Only when I went to the media was there a response.”She added in a speech: “Heklina deserves better service and justice and every queer person and every minority deserves to be treated fairly.”Crystal, a British-Canadian drag artist whose real name is Colin Seymour, told the crowd: “Are our lives worth less? One of us has died. Our institutions shrugged and moved on.”She said the group demanded change as she highlightedthe Met’s failings in the case of the serial killer Stephen Portand the 2023 report by Louise Casey, which said the force wasguilty of institutional racism, misogyny and homophobia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said: “We know that many feel deep distress following Steven’s death and some feel frustration with the pace of the police investigation.“We are also aware of the concerns of Steven’s next of kin and have apologised to them directly.“A full review of the investigation is ongoing to establish any missed opportunities.

Millions of Americans, struggling with higher prices and bigger bills, elected a president who pledged to revive his country’s industrial heartlands – and leave the rest of the world to pick up the bill.On Wednesday – a day dubbed Liberation Day by the president and his aides – Trump has vowed to pull the trigger and impose an historic barrage of tariffs on goods from overseas he claims will fund an extraordinary revival.Global stock markets fall as new Trump tariffs loomRead moreTen weeks after obtaining power, Trump has said he will raise tariffs on all products from countries that charge tariffs on US exports; hit goods from Canada and Mexico with sweeping duties; introducesteep tariffs on foreign cars, computer chips and drugs; and target countries importing oil from Venezuela with duties on their US exports.This is “the big one”, according to the president. Business leaders and economists are certainly worried about the scale of his trade strategy, which the Tax Foundation already estimates could knock US gross domestic product (GDP) by roughly 0.7% and cost about 500,000 US jobs.“The escalating tariffs are a body blow to the global trading system,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, and a former official at the International Monetary Fund.Wherever you stand, a move on this scale would constitute a radical shake-up – and set the stage for a fundamental overhaul of theUS economy. And yet, even as he ramped up the rhetoric, Trump has appeared to tread carefully.“I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families,” the president declared at his inauguration in January. “Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.”While the threats were immediate, the action was not.TakeCanadaand Mexico. The administration has adopted a strikingly hardline stance against the US’s largest and nearest trading partners, but its imposition of blanket tariffs has been hit by a dizzying array of shifting deadlines, delays and reversals.An initial pledge to impose tariffs from “day one” shifted, without explanation, to February. When February rolled around, a last-ditch deal kicked the can to March. When the tariffs were finally imposed, it was a little over 24 hours before carmakers weregranted a temporary exemption, and 48 hours before all goods covered by an existing trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada werespared for another month.All the while, Trump and his most senior officials have slowly, but surely, accepted the risks they are raising in pursuit of the rewards they have vowed to obtain.“Tariffs don’t cause inflation,” the presidentclaimed in January. OK, prices “could go up somewhat short term”, heconceded in February. “There’ll be a little disturbance,” headded in March, stressing that he was alright with that.The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent,acknowledged earlier this monththat there may well be a “one-time price adjustment” as a result of Trump’s tariffs. “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream,” he argued.While Trump predicts that slapping high US tariffs on foreign goods will prompt an influx of international companies to make products inside the US, rather than out, companies and investors worldwide are alreadystruggling to keep upwith his administration’s erratic trade policymaking.‘They’re on. They’re off. We can’t plan’ – bourbon makers dazed by Trump tariffsRead moreSo far, since his return to office, Trump has hiked tariffs on Chinese exports to the US and raised tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium to 25%.The average US tariff rate has already shot up from 2.5% to 8.4% this year, the highest level since 1946, according to the Tax Foundation.Alex Durante, its senior economist, said the country is “inching towards” the kind of tariffs last seen since the 1930s, when theSmoot-Hawleybill, among the most decried pieces of legislation in US history, introduced tariffs on thousands of goods.Anyone, anyone? What happened when the US last introduced tariffsRead more“With each tariff action we’re rapidly approaching a universal tariff that would be damaging to the economy,” said Durante. “Behind the scenes, I think there is probably some concern, even among some of [Trump’s] staff, that they’re rapidly approaching the point of no return.”As his administration grappled with the fallout from theinadvertent inclusionof a journalist in a group chat about secret military plans last week, the president summoned reporters to the Oval Office to pre-announce tariffs on foreign cars. “This is very exciting,” he told them.The excitement is far from universal. Prasad, at Cornell, said: “We are shifting to a world where a commonly accepted set of rules is being displaced by unilateral actions that ostensibly promote a fair trading system, but will instead create volatility and uncertainty, inhibiting the free flow of goods and financial capital across national borders.”The car tariffs would be “a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many US) automakers”, said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, who suggested they would push up prices by as much as $10,000 in the US. “We continue to believe this is some form of negotiation and these tariffs could change by the week,” he added, “although this initial 25% tariff on autos from outside the US is almost an untenable head-scratching number for the US consumer”.Such action is also widely expected to prompt retaliation – with US exporters in the firing line.While a spokesperson for the European Commission stressed it was too early to detail the European Union’s response to actions “still not implemented” by the US, they added: “I can assure you that it will be timely, that it will be robust, that it will be well calibrated and that it will achieve the intended impact.”Trump is watching closely. As countries and markets hit by new US tariffs consider how to hit back, the president publicly warned the EU and Canada that he would hit them with “far larger” duties if they worked together on their response.Some doubt whether the federal government has enough capacity to execute the trade onslaught which Trump has said is coming. “I simply just don’t think that [the US Trade Representative] right now has enough staff to even figure out how to implement some of these tariffs,” said Durante.But after myriad false starts and much fluctuation, the lingering question – despite all the shots, warnings and vows – is not how far Trumpcantake his trade wars, but how far he will.The president is, at heart, a salesman. In business, he sold real estate – with mixed success. In television, and then politics, he sold stories – with extreme success.Millions of Americans bought the image he constructed on The Apprenticeof himself as a phenomenally successful entrepreneur. Millions more bought his promise on the campaign trail to share this phenomenal success with the rest of the nation.Trump is no longer selling a promise, but his strategy to deliver it. He won the White House twice by using stories, sometimes unbound by truth, to bend perceptions, break norms and build support. But rhetoric – however bold, and brash – can’t change reality.The president says unleashing a wave of tariffs, and triggering an abrupt surge in costs in the US and across the world, would cause just a “little disturbance”.Should Wednesday’s action prove as drastic as billed, businesses and consumers may struggle to reconcile this description with what they encounter.Liberation Day is the moniker coined by this administration. Liability Day might prove more apt.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS politicsDonald TrumpCanadaEuropean UnionEuropeInternational tradeanalysisShareReuse this content"

However, Eurostar said the report showed that finding space in the depot would be “hugely costly and disruptive” and would not free up capacity for the future growth plans of the three potential new operators.The ORR said some capacity at Eurostar’s Temple Mills maintenance depot in north-eastLondoncould be made available to other operators. Access to a suitable depot for maintaining and storing trains has been cited by the industry as a critical requirement for companies to compete with Eurostar.The regulator said: “Eurostar’s London depot would be able, if required, to accommodate additional trains.”It added: “Changes to operational and maintenance arrangements at the depot, as well as possible alterations to infrastructure, would be required to access extra capacity and allow more trains to be stabled/maintained there.”Eurostar holds a monopoly on running passenger services through the Channel tunnel, which opened in 1994.Virgin, which haspreviously operated intercity trains in Britainon the two main lines between London and Scotland, plans to start rail services connecting London with Paris and Brussels. It also hopes to run trains to Amsterdam. Earlier this month it said it wasraising £700m to fund the plan.I love to travel Europe by train. But here’s what a joined-up 21st-century network needs | María RamírezRead moreA Virgin Group spokesperson said: “Finally a green signal for competition. The Temple Mills depot is the only facility in the UK which can accommodate European-style trains and claims suggesting it was at capacity have been blocking Virgin from coming to the line.“Virgin is therefore very pleased with the outcome … There are no more major hurdles to overcome.” It added: “We expect to be able to make an announcement very soon.”Gemini Trains, chaired by the Labour peer Tony Berkeley, and the Spanish startup Evolyn are also hoping to run trains through the tunnel.Eurostar said the ORR-commissioned report “confirms” that the depot was “effectively almost full today for major maintenance work and would require investment to meet the growing demands of international rail”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its chief executive, Ben Plowden, said: “Much of the great potential of the Channel tunnel is currently untapped, so while there are further hurdles to clear, we are very glad that the reality of new services is closer than ever.”According to new research from the charity, current growth trends and potential modal shift should mean demand for international rail from the UK more than doubles by 2040.Separately on Monday, Network Rail’s boss, Andrew Haines, announced his retirement amid a government overhaul of the sector. He will leave the company in October after seven years in the role.The functions of Network Rail, which manages railway infrastructure, will be taken over by Great British Railways, a new state-owned company.

If Arsenal go on a winning run this could take Liverpool into May even without dropping any points, but if Mikel Arteta’s side lose their next three it could all be over as soon as 13 April, when Liverpool play West Ham at home. In the immediate future a couple of teams in particular could go a long way towards deciding things: Arsenal host Fulham and visit Everton in their fixtures this week, while Liverpool host Everton and visit Fulham. Even beyond those games the sides have comparable fixtures this month – neither will play a current top-half team – but Arsenal also have two Champions League fixtures against Real Madrid to deal with and must close the gap before the start of May.From Sels to Salah: a Premier League best XI of the season so farRead moreChampions LeagueThis looks like being a curious month in the race for European qualification, with every one of the 34 fixtures scheduled to be played by teams currently in the Premier League’s top seven over the course of April (as well as another two which need to be rearranged after Manchester City and Nottingham Forest qualified for the FA Cup semi-finals) pitting them against teams currently outside that group. This is to be followed by an epic, hold-on-to-your-hats month of May in which a third of their 21 games will be against each other, though by then there may be less on the line.When it is all over it looks increasingly likely that the top five teams will qualify for the Champions League, with England in pole position to snaffle one of the two bonus places offered by Uefa to the continent’s most successful nations. As of 31 March England topped this season’s rankings on 24.25 points, ahead of Spain with 21.678 and Italy with 19.937, with Germany another couple of points behind. With five teams still involved and accumulating points compared with Germany’s and Italy’s three, and despite tough Champions League draws for Arsenal and Aston Villa (who face Paris Saint-Germain), England looks more likely to extend its lead than to be overhauled.View image in fullscreenThe last time Nottingham Forest were in the Champions League was in 1980, when they were defending champions.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesManchester City are precariously positioned in fifth, one point ahead of Newcastle and Brighton and a mere four better off than Bournemouth in an apparently distant 10th. The extent ofErling Haaland’s ankle injurycould have a big impact. But they also have the kindest fixture list, with only two of their last nine games against teams currently in the top half – and those are Bournemouth andFulham, respectively 10th and eighth at the moment, who they play in their final two outings (though they also have to negotiate a potentially tricky derby at Old Trafford this Sunday).Villa, Tottenham and Manchester United will also hope to secure Champions League places by winning either the Champions League (in Villa’s case) or the Europa League. They play their quarter-final ties in the weeks of 7 and 14 April.Other European placesNewcastle are the first English side to secure a place in European competition for next season, snaffling a spot in the Conference League playoff stage bywinning the Carabao Cup, though it will become up for grabs again if they qualify through the league for one of Uefa’s more prestigious competitions.View image in fullscreenEddie Howe has helped secure a European spot for Newcastle after guiding them to a Carabao Cup win.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe number of teams still able to qualify for Europe by other means than league performance makes this a blurry and confusing picture: Chelsea would qualify for the Europa League if they win the Conference League, Arsenal could win the Champions League, Tottenham and Manchester United are in the Europa League, Aston Villa could win either the Champions League or the FA Cup, which would earn them a Europa League place, while Nottingham Forest, Manchester City and Crystal Palace also remain in the FA Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All that can be said with certainty is that at least one Europa League place will be allocated through final league positions, most likely to the side that finish sixth (unless they also win a cup).RelegationThe good news for Southampton, in last place with only nine points, is that when it comes to the earliest Premier League relegations they are not even going to end up with a podium finish. The bad news is their fate could be sealed by the end of the week: two defeats plus a pair of wins for Wolves would end their survival hopes. And Derby’s Premier League record low points tally – 11 in 2007-08 – remains under threat.Wolves, 17th and with the next-worst side eight points above them, are the team the bottom three sides will all be hoping to catch. But not only is their form decent – only five teams have outperformed the three wins and a draw they have claimed in the past six games, while the bottom three have one win, and four points, between them – so are their fixtures. Wolves played every one of the current top seven in their first nine games, a disastrously difficult run which they ended with two points, and now it is time for cosmic payback: they play only two of them in their last nine, a run they start with a home game against the side immediately above them, West Ham, and a trip to the team immediately below them, Ipswich.Two wins there and the fate of the current bottom three may be all but sealed, particularly as the fixture list looks much less kind for Ipswich and 19th-placed Leicester, both of whom play three top-six sides and only one from the bottom half – Wolves in both cases – this month. A David Moyes-inspired revival has hauled Everton clear of all but the faintest relegation worries but spare a thought for them; they play the current top five in their next five games.PosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool2942702Arsenal2929583Nottm Forest2914544Chelsea2916495Man City2915486Newcastle289477Brighton296478Fulham295459Aston Villa29-44510AFC Bournemouth29124411Brentford2954112Crystal Palace2833913Man Utd29-33714Tottenham Hotspur29123415Everton29-43416West Ham29-163417Wolverhampton29-182618Ipswich29-341719Leicester29-401720Southampton29-499Explore more on these topicsPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Browns then rewarded Watson, at the time one of the best quarterbacks in the league,with a $230m fully guaranteed contract. Watson never faced criminal charges over the sexual assault allegations but the NFL suspended him for 11 games of the 2022 season after its own investigation.The Browns’ sad and seedy Deshaun Watson era nears its predictable endpointRead moreCleveland’s faith in Watson has not been rewarded. He is yet to complete a full season with the Browns due to injury and suspension and has consistently been one of the worst quarterbacks in the league in QBR. He has thrown 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in his three seasons with the Browns (Fifteen quarterbacks threw more than 19 touchdowns in the 2024 NFL season alone). They have played just one playoff game since his arrival, which they lost, despite boasting one of the best defenses in the league. Watson missed that game through injury.On Monday, Haslam acknowledged the Browns’ decision has so far been a bust.“We took a big swing-and-miss with Deshaun,” Haslam said at the league’s annual meeting. “We thought we had the quarterback; we didn’t. And we gave up a lot of draft picks to get him, so we’ve got to dig ourselves out of that hole … [The trade] was an entire organization decision and it ends with Dee [Haslam] and I, so hold us accountable.”The chances of Watson turning around his Browns career appear to be slim. He is expected to miss a significant part of the 2025 season after tearing – and then re-tearing – his achilles, an injury thatended his campaign in 2024.The 29-year-old still has two years left on his contract, and the Browns owe him $46m in each of those seasons. There has been speculation the Browns will select a quarterback with the No 2 overall pick in this month’s draft, a position they earned after going 3-14 last season. However Haslam said on Monday the team would not rush into a decision.“It would be great if we could get ‘the quarterback,’ but we’re not going to force it,” Haslam said. “We’re going to be patient and we’re going to try to accumulate as many really good football players as we can.”Explore more on these topicsCleveland BrownsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Manny Ramirez was banned for 50 games in 2009after using the drug.The suspension of Profar is effective immediately. Barring postponed games, Profar would be eligible to return on 29 June against Philadelphia and would lose $5.8m of his $12m salary. He is also ineligible for the postseason. The ban means the Braves are shorthanded in outfield with Ronald Acuña Jr still recovering from injury.Profar called it the “most difficult day of my baseball career” and said he would never knowingly cheat.“This is especially painful for me because anyone who knows me and has seen me play knows I am deeply passionate about the game,” he said in a statement. “There is nothing I love more than competing with my teammates and being a fan favorite. I want to apologize to the entire Braves organization, my teammates and the fans.“It is because of my deep love and respect for this game that I would never knowingly do anything to cheat it. I have been tested my entire career, including eight times last season alone, and have never tested positive. I would never willingly take a banned substance, but I take full responsibility and accept MLB’s decision.”The 32-year-old Profar was an All-Star and won a Silver Slugger last season when he batted .280 and set career highs with 24 homers and 85 RBIs for San Diego.

Last week, Ingrid, who is now 18, told the court she had been “whipped” in the face with a wet towel after her father had refused to let her play outside with friends.However Gjert insisted that while he regretted the incident, his towel had only made contact with her finger.“I’m drying my neck with a towel,” Gjert told the court in Sandnes, Norway. “She’s really angry and says: ‘I fucking don’t want to be in this prison of yours any more,’ while holding her index finger at me.“I pull the towel against her finger twice in quick succession. She then says: ‘What the hell are you doing, are you hitting me?’ To which I reply: ‘I didn’t hit you.’Pressed by the judge about whether it really was only the finger that was struck, Gjert replied. “Yes, given the distance we were standing at, and the size of the towel, nothing else would be possible.”View image in fullscreenJakob Ingebrigtsen in court with his legal counsel Mette Yvonne Larsen and lawyer Veslemoy Aga last week.Photograph: Lise Åserud/ReutersLast week the court was shown a photograph of a red mark on Ingrid’s face following the incident, but Gjert suggested it may have been caused by “acne or a skin reaction”. He said that all his children had suffered from a similar condition when they were “agitated or sad”.Asked whether he got the impression the blow had hurt, Gjert added: “No, I think it hurt both of us. And I think the ‘hurt’ wasn’t physical. I think it was much more emotional. She was very disappointed, sad and scared all at once that I could do what I did.”Gjert also admitted that he had found it “extremely difficult to accept my own actions” and made it clear he missed his daughter, who has not lived with her parents since.“I miss her every day,” he said. “She is the last thing I think about when I go to bed at night, and the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning. The loss is extreme.”Gjert also denied claims made in court last week that he had kicked Jakob off a scooter when the Tokyo 1500m and Paris 5,000m Olympic champion was eight or nine.“It is completely unthinkable that I would have kicked him,” he said. “It is completely out of the question to kick one of my children.”Gjert, who also denied that he had pushed Jakob so hard that he flew several metres after a row over an iPad, painted a negative picture of his son as he and Ingrid watched on in court.“Jakob has been a privileged boy his whole life, he’s been allowed to do and say whatever he wants,” he said. “He’s almost been carried on a golden chair his whole life. There have been different opinions related to the discussions, without a doubt. But nothing physical.”Gjert said that while he coached Jakob, his son was constantly telling him how “useless, ignorant and hopeless” he was. And that, before he won his first Olympic gold medal in Tokyo, Jakob would tell him: “Dad is an idiot who is going to ruin everything.”The 59-year-old coach told the court he was so opposed to violence that he had told his children they should not play video games such as Counter Strike and Grand Theft Auto.“I have spent a lot of time implementing non-violence in my children’s upbringing,” he said. “Violence is not a solution to anything.”“There was a constant argument and discussion about their constant urge to play these games with elements of violence,” added Gjert, who said that on one occasion he had thrown the PlayStation out of the window and on to the asphalt in the courtyard.The trial, which is due to last until 16 May, continues.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

But what’s it like to be on a truly terrible roster?Jacob UittiMon 31 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 04.02 EDTShareThe business of sports is aboutwinning. But that, of course, doesn’t mean there aren’t plenty of losers out there. That’s most evident every year in theNBAaround the first day of spring. With about a dozen games left in the regular season, it’s obvious which teams are also-rans – and they have probably known that for some time. But when a team are losing and losing often, how does that affect the roster? How do the players deal with the constant lows?“When you lose,” says former NBA All-Star Xavier McDaniel, “it’s like getting a life sentence. I knew for me, losing, it started me to drink beer. Losing created a lot of bad habits. Losing can be a disease. We were losing so much [my rookie season] that by January I was drinking beer!”Growing up, McDaniel was seemingly destined for the pros.Tall, tough and talented, the X-Man led his high school and college teams to victory after victory. In the 1985 draft, he was picked No 4 overall by the Seattle SuperSonics. When you’re a top selection like that, you’re often entering a lowly team. That was the case for McDaniel. His rookie season, the Sonics finished 31-51. They improved in his sophomore season and for most of his career in the league, McDaniel was on winners. But there were a few seasons later in Boston and New Jersey when times were equally as tough.“I would say [you can tell a losing season is unfolding] when you get about 30 games in and you’re struggling,” he says. “You see you’re going nowhere fast. For me, [losing] feels like shit. When you’re losing, everything is bad. The food is bad, everything is bad.”If you’re young and on a bad team, you can hope that the roster will get reinforcements via the draft in the coming summers. But if you’re a vet on a loser, you may as well start packing your bags. Bad teams want to showcase the young guys and deal the vets. Or it could be a case that the temperaments on the team just don’t mix. “One thing about the NBA,” says McDaniel, “you’ve got to find guys who play welltogether.”‘He has two major flaws’: Luka Dončić’s biographer on the Lakers starRead moreWhen he started his career,Scott Williamsbarely knew what it was like to lose. In his first three seasons, the undrafted player out of the University of North Carolina won three titles with Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls. But in subsequent years, he found himself languishing on bad Philadelphia teams. Those squads, he says, didn’t care about the idea of the team. That was their downfall.“A lot of times,” says Williams, “I’ve found that it’s [about the] character of the makeup of the team. In basketball, really only about eight dudes determine the success or failure of the season. And if you got one or two or three dudes on a team that don’t have the [right] character, you’re going to have a losing year.”In the NBA, Williams says, everyone is talented. So it is often attitude that separates winners from losers. “If your star doesn’t have good character, if he doesn’t want to put in work, the preparation, the consistence,” says Williams, “if he doesn’t have resiliency, you’re going to struggle.”Williams remembers his days with Jordan. “There was nobody that had more intensity and stronger will and a passion to work than Michael Jordan,” says Williams. “Everyone has to come along if the superstar is doing it.”Williams played on 60-plus-win teams and teams that have won games in the teens. There is no greater high in his life, he says, withperhapsthe exception of the birth of his children, than winning an NBA title. It’s the culmination of so much work, time and sacrifice. But the opposite is true when you’re on a team going nowhere. Such was the case when he was in Philly on squads helmed by a young Allen Iverson.“When you’re in a losing season – man, you can’t wait for the freaking year to end,” Williams says. “You’re showing up every day with dudes with negative attitudes who areme-firstpeople. It’s miserable to be around them. You count the days until your contract is finished so you can get out of there.” It’s hard to stay motivated, he says. “It weighs on you. To fight that defeatist mentalist is hard – especially in your 20s when you haven’t had as many life lessons.”What’s worse, when you’re on a losing team with players who don’t care about improvement, Williams says, it can make you question your own effort. “Why would I want to risk diving for a ball and banging my knee when we’re down 15 when the dude next to you won’t even help you up off the floor after you do it?” he says. “But there’s certain things you have to fight through and realize there’s a bigger picture.”In 1981,Cedric Maxwellwas named the NBA finals MVP. Surrounded by guys like Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish and Tiny Archibald, it was Maxwell who won the hardware when his Boston Celtics beat the Houston Rockets. The win, though, came after several years of rebuilding, including the first two years of Maxwell’s career when the Celtics went 32-50 and 29-53. Boston were in the middle of an overhaul, despite playing in the Eastern Conference finals in 1977. Injuries and ageing players plagued the roster. So, in the hopes of turning things around, Celtics coach Tom Heinsohn looked to his rookie.The team had lost six games in a row to start Maxwell’s rookie campaign. But he got in and played 30-plus minutes in a game on 11 November against Buffalo. He scored 21 points and grabbed nine rebounds. “I came in that game and played really well,” says Maxwell. “And I remember [veteran Celtic] John Havlicek came up to me and said, ‘Hey, rook, just keep it going!’” But despite his good play, the Celtics never flipped the script that year. “The [vets] were convinced we’d turn the thing around, like, ‘We’re going to get on a streak!’ But we never did.”All the losing led Maxwell to feel down, he says. But that’s when the team’s veteran big man offered his own bit of philosophy. “I remember Curtis Rowe saying to me after I felt depressed about one game – Curtis said to me, ‘Rook, there ain’t no Ls or Ws on them checks.”But while some guys don’t live and die with the results, for Maxwell, winning is everything. “I’ve always been a competitor,” he says. So, he did what he could: he focused on himself and his own self-improvement. He focused on what he could control. “I was going to find a way to make myself better,” he says. He watched his teammates and their bad habits. He made sure that he didn’t follow in their footsteps.“During the late 1970s, drugs were big in the NBA,” Maxwell says. “I was asked multiple times did I want to get some coke or do some blow. But I had a strong enough constitution to know that wasn’t something I wanted. Those bad habits, those things I was able to avoid.”Looking back, Maxwell can sum up his position on losing with one piece of advice. Don’t let the noise and negativity affect your game or the way you look at the world. Because right around the corner could be an upswing, the playoffs, a chance at a title.“The best thing,” says Maxwell, “is to be your own person. As my mom and dad used to say, ‘Be a leader. Don’t be a follower.’ That was something that helped me out in what I wanted to do. So, to any rookie out there, just be true to yourself.”Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Czech, who had just reached the boys’ singles final at the Australian Open, was invited byNovak Djokovic, his idol, to train together at the Serb’s academy in Belgrade. The pair quickly established a rapport, with Djokovic offering advice and counsel. For Mensik, this was a pivotal moment.On Sunday, at the Miami Open, the pair stood across the net from each other again, this time as rivals, and he closed out a 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) victory to win his first ATP title in one of the top tournaments.Novak Djokovic falls short of 100th title as Jakub Mensik, 19, wins Miami Open finalRead moreIt was an immense performance from the teenager, who continued to dominate behind his enormous, precise first serve and he was fearless and attacking throughout, particularly in the tie-breaks.His breakthrough run included beating three top-eight players – Jack Draper (No 7), Taylor Fritz (No 4) and Djokovic (No 5). There is no doubt he has marked himself as a future grand-slam contender.For his 37-year-old one-time mentor, this result is far more difficult to parse. It is impossible to ignore the sorry physical state Djokovic was in before the match, which was significantly delayed due to rain. He emerged for his warm-up sporting a dramatically swollen right eye and he repeatedly attempted to treat the apparent infection with eye drops.Although the treatment appeared to help somewhat, it was not entirely surprising that Djokovic seemed off early in the match, dropping his opening service game and trailing by a break for much of the opening set. Afterwards, he graciously opted out of discussing his physical problems and only he knows how much it affected him.As he settled into the final, Djokovic did produce a positive level in a quality match from all involved. Against an opponent who could do no wrong, however, he was uncharacteristically meek when the match was on the line in both tie-breaks.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic has yet to win a tournament since Andy Murray became his coach in January before the Australian Open.Photograph: Leonardo Fernandez/Getty ImagesWhile that timidity under pressure is uncharacteristic, he has become more familiar with those sensations. Histriumph at the Paris Olympic Games, where he willed himself to win the one title that had evaded him, remains the anomalous result in his past 16 months on tour. It is his only title sincethe ATP Finals in 2023, which closed off one of his most dominant years. His milestone 100th title continues to evade him.As seen by his solid run through the tournament, which he navigated without dropping a set until the final, the winner of 24 singles grand slam titles is still capable of quality play, but the standards he has set are so high that it is increasingly difficult to maintain them. A talented young player, such as Mensik, unscarred by Djokovic’s greatness, unlike the previous generation, absolutely should enjoy the challenge of facing him.Thirty-seven is an interesting age. This is the point by which many legends have begun to slow down. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal won their final grand slam at 36. Serena Williams won her last major aged 35, although her difficulties were far greater after giving birth to her daughter, Olympia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The positive news is that the schedule should offer him more opportunities to return to winning ways. In recent weeks, the ATP has been in total disarray and the draws are unusually open.So many of the top players – Carlos Alcaraz, Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev, Taylor Fritz and Andrey Rublev – have been struggling for various reasons. Even though Jannik Sinner has only competed at the Australian Open this year and is in the middle of a three-month ban, he maintains a comfortable lead in the ATP race.The next significant tournament arrives quickly, with the Monte Carlo Masters marking the start of the red-clay season on Sunday. For Djokovic, there will be more obstacles ahead, but as he tries to hold his own at the top of the sport for as long as he can, this is also a challenge he should relish.Explore more on these topicsNovak DjokovicTennisUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The club added that “profits on disposal of player registrations of £152.5m and a profit on disposal of subsidiaries of £198.7m led to an overall net profit of £129.6m after tax”.It was predicted at the time of last year’s takeover of the women’s team by Chelsea’s parent company, BlueCo 22, that the deal would help Chelsea comply with PSR. The move has faced scrutiny from the Premier League in relation to rules around fair market value and associated-party transactions. The league passed Chelsea selling two hotels at Stamford Bridge to BlueCo 22 for £76.5m last year.Chelsea said the team’s sale would ensure “CFCW has dedicated resources, management and commercial leadership solely focused on the growth and success of the women’s team”. The club are on course to win a sixth straight Women’s Super League title.It has been turbulent for the men’s team under Clearlake, the majority shareholder, and Boehly. Chelsea have not been in the Champions League since the 2022-23 season and have beenhugely active in the transfer market. They have spent more than £1bn on signings but have also looked to raise funds through outgoings. The sale of homegrown talent helps because money received for academy products goes down as pure profit. Among the players sold in the most recent financial year wereMason Mount,Ian MaatsenandChristian Pulisic.Chelsea acknowledged that not competing in Europe’s premier competition had affected their revenue. However, their broadcasting income rose thanks to a sixth-placed finish in the Premier League and appearances in theCarabao Cup finaland theFA Cup semi-finalslast season.

Amorim’s side are13th in the ­Premier Leagueon 37 points, 33 behind the leaders, Liverpool. Amorim was asked whether it would be a ­surprise should Fernandes wish to move this summer to a club where he can ­compete for major honours.“That is the challenge,” said Amorim. “I want Bruno here because we want to win the Premier League again so we want the best players. He’s [30] but still so [fit], plays 55 games every season and between assists and goals he’s there for 30 at least, so he’s not going anywhere.”Asked how he can be sure, Amorim said: “We are in control of the ­situation and I feel that he is really happy here. Sometimes, the ­frustration that everybody sees and [they] maybe say is not a good thing in a captain, but it’s a sign he wants this [success] so bad. He’s not going ­anywhere because I’ve already told him.”Marcus Rashford was loaned to Aston Villain January because Amorim was unhappy with the 27-year-old in training.

Saturday’s second-biggest attendance in Spain had watched the country’s most passionate rivals train. Sunday’s biggest crowd saw them play, a record 58,538 fans still inside and still singing late into a night they’ll never forget. The Benito Villamarín was bouncing, smoke rising round the home fans as they belted out the club’s anthem –here we are, squashed together like cannon balls– as the players started a lap of honour. Somewhere in all the madness and the noise, Antony, stripped to the waist and sitting on the goalkeeper Adrián’s shoulders, heaved a giant flag through the air. “This is incredible,” he said, and it was.This was Antony’s first Seville derby and he’d not seen anything like it for years: never mind Ajax or Old Trafford, this took him back to Brazil. But it wasn’t just him, a debutant in a fixture that hits hard; nor had anyone else, the place going wild, something extra in the celebrations this time, Betis players still there half an hour after the end, parading round the pitch before bounding down corridors, singing and hammering at doors, cracking open the beers. You’d think they had won the Champions League. The one man there who has – five times – said that when it came to “feeling, vibrations, this is without doubt the most special game there is,” so Isco and his teammates celebrated something that, right there in the moment, felt even better: they had beaten rivals Sevilla 2-1.Marseille’s season is collapsing and Roberto De Zerbi is not helpingRead moreA goal down after Rubén Vargas’s opener on 17 minutes, Johnny Cardoso’s superb volley and Cucho Hernández’s sharp finish before half-time gave Betis a deserved victory, Diario de Sevilla concluding: “The best team wins the derby and that’s Betis.” Which, put like that, doesn’t sound dramatic or like all that much, but inside the Villamarín it sounded like everything, the pitch flooded at full time, people running everywhere and nowhere, leaping into each other’s arms.Marca described itas “total ecstasy”, Diario de Sevilla called it “euphoria in green and white”, ABC went for “passion dyed green” and they were all right. “Amazing,” Isco called it. “I’ve been at big clubs with incredible fans but never seen this,” Adrián insisted. “This is what this lovely sport gives us.”They had waited a long time for this. The last time Betis had won a derby in La Liga wasalmost seven years ago. That day, Joaquín Sánchez scored the only goal, aged 37. Afterwards he had declared: “I can leave football a happy man now.” In fact, it took him another four years to go. Now here he was, the player who reacted to one derby win by declaring there would befines for any footballerswhodidn’tstay out until 5am and the director now sitting in the box in a suit and tie before heading down to hug them too, another party about to start.View image in fullscreenBetis supporters greet the Sevilla coach outside the ground, before a game that divides the city.Photograph: Andres López Sheridan/SPP/ShutterstockThis derby is always a bit different, at least off the pitch – on it, in truth, it’s very often not very good, which was another reason why Sunday night’s clash was so good, so celebrated. Nowhere lives local rivalryquite like Seville, which has a population of 687,488 and two football clubs with over 90,000 members – third and fifth in Spain respectively – and 206 supporters’ clubs within the city. On Saturday 31,500 were at the Villamarín and 15,231 the Sánchez Pizjuán, three miles north, just to see them train.This, saidquite possibly the most ABC cover ever, was “a derby like God wills it”. Looking out from the front page, holding scarves, were Begoña Navia-Osorio, 84, and Isabel María Rus-Velázquez, 80: two nuns, one supported each side. It was Laetare Sunday, when lent is let go a little bit, and derby day, when the city lets go a lot. On Avenida de la Palmera, heading out of the centre of the city, from the banks of the Guadalquivir and towards Heliópolis, the church doors were open at the Parroquia Corpus Christi, sermons heard from the street, football shirts in the back row. Rejoice, Isaiah 66.10 says, and so they would.A couple of hundred metres further along, the stadium gates were opening too, kids on shoulders, waving flares as the bus edged its way the short distance to the Villamarín from the Al-Andalus hotel. On board, phones were held up to blacked-out windows. “I recorded people crying with emotion,” Isco admitted. Inside the ground, every seat had a green Betis flag laid upon it. Well, almost every seat: in the Sevilla end, fans who had been walked there past the hospital, where they applauded patients watching from the windows, held Betis flags too but these were white, the badge crossed out. And in the main stand, a couple of early arrivers –yes, you– filled their bags before everyone else took their seats.On the pitch, it kicked off before it even kicked off, the first confrontation sparked when someone from Sevilla’s coaching staff pushed over a ballboy gathering up the balls after the warm-up. A giant banner covered the south stand: two angels crowning the Betis badge from 1919-22, a line borrowed fromAntonio Rodríguez-Buzón’s poem to the Macarena. And then, as it fell, they played. This was a game for hot hearts and cool heads, the Betis coach Manuel Pellegrini had said. Betis are the better side, a team with better players and on a better run, winning five matches in a row while Sevilla had won two in eight. But, well, it’s a derby and Betis had not won any of the last 12. If there was one thing Pellegrini was concerned about it was the desperation to end that run.View image in fullscreenJohnny Cardoso celebrates after equalising alongside Isco (left).Photograph: Julio Munoz/EPAWhen Sevilla opened the scoring on 17 minutes, Dodi Lukebakio setting up a superb goal for Vargas, that fear might have felt even more real: Betis had not come back from a goal down to win a derby at home since 1940. “Nah, it was all under control,” Adrián said afterwards. He was joking, but he was also right, Betis breaking that run in a way that seemed almost easy, taking control and the lead before half-time.Pablo Fornals and Cardoso dominated the middle. Sevilla couldn’t handle Hernández, the striker whose record since joining reads: played six, won six. Jesús Rodríguez, 19 years old,a hint of Joaquín about him, flew up the left. Despite slipping often and changing his boots twice – “I’m going to have to speak to Puma” – Antony was always an outlet on the other side, a player who says “I have found myself here” and who Isco insisted “has changed us”. So much so that Isco reckoned he would “have to do one of those crowdfunding things to see if we can keep him for another year at least”.As for Isco – the man who described Betis as “my light in the darkness”, revived and rescued fromsix months out of footballwhich had felt permanent – his assist for Hernández’s to score Betis’ second goal just before half-time was gorgeous: a touch so soft he could have been playing in slippers, and a perfect portrait of his play. “He’s a superstar,” Antony said, gazing at him like a smitten teenager.View image in fullscreenAdrián and Antony celebrate in style.Photograph: Fran Santiago/Getty ImagesWhen that goal went in, substitutes came sprinting on from the bench; at the end, they did too, joined it seemed by the entire staff of the club, the pitch suddenly full of people. Antony, who had just performed a rainbow flick down in the corner, was racing up the line, leading one last attack when he realised they had done it. He tore off his shirt and roared, pointed at the pitch:this is my place now. Isco and Gio Lo Celso embraced Pellegrini. Marc Bartra gestured to the badge. Someone whacked on Freed from Desire, loud. Cucho climbed into the crowd, Chimy Ávila running after him. They paraded a green cuddly toylike a child of their own. Adrián lifted Antony on to his shoulders, and off they went.For much of Sunday night there had only been one team on the pitch, now, past 11pm, there really was. Sevilla had disappeared up the tunnel defeated, “swallowing poison” in their captain’s words and leaving 600 supporters waiting high in the north stand, where they refused to simply stand silent. Betis stayed, holding on to this, their fans loving every moment, stands shaking. The anthem went on. Freed from Desire got an encore. Beyond finals, it is genuinely hard to recall a post-match celebration like it. A long time later, they were still tooting out on Avenida de la Palmera.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowAlavés 0-2 Rayo Vallecano, Athletic Bilbao 0-0 Osasuna, Barcelona 4-1 Girona, Espanyol 1-1 Atlético Madrid, Getafe 1-2 Villarreal, Real Betis 2-1 Sevilla, Real Madrid 3-2 Leganés, Real Sociedad 2-1 Real Valladolid, Valencia 1-0 MallorcaMondayCelta Vigo v Las Palmas (8pm BST)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.This was a first derby win in the league under Pellegrini and although he was justifiably swift to note that his Betis side had beaten Sevilla in the cup – “and without that wewouldn’t have won the trophy” – he admitted they owed a debt to their fans. “Winning the derby can never be the sole objective,” he said, insisting that what really mattered was three more points towards a Champions League place. Isco too talked about “getting those little stars on our sleeves”, calling this “a win that allows us to dream of big things”. Their sixth in a row in the league, it leaves them sixth but level on points with fifth-place Villarreal.But in that moment, boy, did it feel like more, on the last derby night before Betis have to abandon their Villamarín home for a couple of years, as building work gets under way. “It’s going to be a long night: I hope there’s a celebration befitting this,” Rodríguez said. “It’s a night for wine or champagne or whatever,” Adrián reckoned; he had shed a tear or two, and he knew he wasn’t alone. “I feel very emotional: what I have lived in Seville this week I have never lived anywhere else,” Hernández said. “Tonight we will celebrate because we deserve it.” As the place finally emptied, Isco and Antonyshared a beer, their work here done for now. “Making people happy is what this sport is for,” Isco said.PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona2954662Real Madrid2933633Atletico Madrid2924574Athletic Bilbao2922535Villarreal2812476Real Betis294477Rayo Vallecano292408Mallorca29-7409Celta Vigo2803910Real Sociedad29-43811Sevilla29-63612Getafe2913613Girona29-83414Osasuna29-93415Valencia29-143116Espanyol28-132917Alaves29-122718Leganes29-182719Las Palmas28-152520Valladolid29-4616Explore more on these topicsReal BetisLa LigaSevillaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This has occurred as a result of significant sums of money owed to the chairman’s businesses which has in turn impacted on the club’s immediate cashflow.“The chairman is working hard to resolve this situation at the earliest possible opportunity and in the meantime thanks everyone for their patience and understanding.”Chansiri, part of a family which controls the Thai Union Group, the world’s largest producer of canned tuna, headed a consortium which bought Sheffield Wednesday in January 2015 for £37.5m from previous owner Milan Mandaric. It is not the first time during his time in charge that players have been paid late while there have also been a number of other financial challenges.Wednesday sold their Hillsborough stadium to Chansiri for about £60m in July 2019 to ensure they did not breach spending rules while in October 2023 Chansiri appealed to fans to raise £2m to help the club pay an outstanding debt to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and cover wages. Last November, Wednesday were placed under a registration embargo by the EFL over amounts owed to HMRC.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Winning this competition would see welcome silverware and mean ­qualification for the Champions League. We must do everything we can to support the team in these final key stages.

However, a closer examination of today’s financial figures reveals that such spending must be sustainable in the long term and within our operating revenues. Our capacity to generate recurring revenues determines our spending power.“We cannot spend what we do not have and we will not compromise the financial stability of this club – indeed, our off-pitch revenues have significantly supplemented the lower football revenues this year, testament to our diversified income strategy.”AroundAbout 2,000 fans attended the Change for Tottenham protest before the home fixture with Manchester United on 13 February. There were chants for Levy to leave the club and several banners were held up. Spurs were ninth in Deloitte’s list of the world’s richest clubs and spend 42% of their revenue on wages, the lowest of any team in the top 10.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

Phil Taylor was the first champion to win £100,000 in 2006, with Van Gerwen collecting £250,000 in 2014.Since 2019, the tournament has featured 96 players with the first prize holding steady at £500,000, part of a total prize pot of £2.5m available at the Ally Pally.In total, PDC prize money across next season will be up £7m on this year’s figures.

The latter event will also expand to a 48-player field in 2026 to mark the 20th staging of the tournament.Four other top-tier events – the World Grand Prix, Players Championship finals, European Championship and UK Open – will all increase to a £750,000 prize fund, with the World Series of Darts Finals and the World Cup of Darts (a team event) each adding a further £50,000 to their respective pots.European Tour event prize funds will increase to £230,000 for the 14 tournaments to be held next year, while the top prize at all 34 Players Championship “floor” events will rise to £150,000.Beyond the Pro Tour there will also be a £5,000 per event increase for Challenge Tour, Development Tour and Women’s Series events.

He was the best crumbing forward I played with ... the perfect crumber, and he was a good mark for his size as well. When he was on song, he was unbeatable.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFrom the Pocket: AFL WeeklyFree weekly newsletterJonathan Horn brings expert analysis on the week's biggest AFL storiesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The impact of the win is starting to settle inMon 31 Mar 2025 11.44 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 12.00 EDTShareAs cheers erupt from the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, attendants outside the stadium wonder aloud if it’s Novak Djokovic playing. But it’s two teens battling it out in the first round of the Miami Open: Learner Tien of the United States at 19 and João Fonseca of Brazil at 18. The Miami crowd, dotted with Brazil’s colors, is raucous for Fonseca.Tien misses an easy overhead, and the Brazilian fans roar, offering a chant more commonly seen at a soccer stadium, throwing all tennis decorum of not cheering errors out the window. The umpire tries to speak over the crowd for the next point to begin, but Tien is already starting his serve, seemingly unfazed.The two couldn’t be more different: Where Fonseca rides the crowd’s energy, Tien is calm and collected. Unperturbed.“The crowd was loud. I didn’t really mind. Honestly, it makes the match more entertaining when people are more invested in the match,” Tien tells me. “It’s always cool to play other younger guys around your age that are playing well. You get to gauge where you are compared to your peers, age wise. You hope that down the road someday, that these matches become rivalries.”The stage is a stark change of from where Tien was playing matches just months before. After playing one semester of college at USC at age 17, the teenager turned pro and hit the Challenger circuit. He burst on the scene for more casual tennis fans in February at the Australian Open, battling it out with Daniil Medvedev over five sets in the second round andbesting the three-time Australian Open finalist. The next month, he beat No 2 in the world Alexander Zverev in Acapulco, Mexico.Cracks more obvious in Djokovic’s game as he strives to remain at summit | Tumaini CarayolRead moreBut the soft-spoken Tien, whose game is most commonly referred to as “smart,” is composed on the big stage, comfortable to be tongue-and-cheek in defeat. Tien lost his match to Fonseca in three sets. In a farewell to Miami, he posted a photo from the match, tagging Rio de Janeiro as the location.Making it to the main tour has been a long time coming for the lefty 19-year-old from Irvine, California, even if he wasn’t sure where tennis would take him from the beginning.“I started when I was little older than one,” Tien says. “I think [it was] one of my dad’s old rackets that were lying around. So they didn’t really even expect for me or my sister to start playing tennis that young. So it’s not like they were prepped with little kiddy rackets or anything.“My parents would play recreationally. I got to the courts a couple times a week, just with my dad, just watching him play in random men’s leagues. So that’s kind of how I got introduced. Eventually my dad started taking me to the courts, randomly feeding me balls from a pretty young age, and then it kind of just progressed from there on.”Tennis was never the main event though. His parents, both of whom immigrated to the US from Vietnam, named Learner in honor of his mother, who is a teacher; his sister, Justice, gets hers from her father’s profession – he is a lawyer. Tien’s mother homeschooled them both.“The tennis wasn’t really in the picture yet,” Tien says. “My sister is a few years older than me, so my mom retired when my sister was born, so she was already just at home with my sister starting to teach my sister. So she just thought she’d teach me, too.”Thanks to his mother’s teaching, Tien was ahead for his age. He entered high school a few years early, at the age of 11. “I started school young. I would work through the year. I wouldn’t have summer break and stuff like that. I would just work throughout the year. So I just naturally finished those early grades pretty quick. And then, yeah, I didn’t see really a reason just to stop me there. So I just went into high school.“I obviously like tennis more than I like school, so it was a good motivation for me to kind of get away from school just to go and play. But throughout juniors, my parents did a very good job, honestly, of not putting a lot of pressure on me to win. You know, even though it felt like the end of the world when I would lose, like some random match. They did a pretty good job of just letting me know it’s pretty irrelevant whether you won or lost, we get better.”At age 16, Tien played the US Open boys – and men’s with a wildcard in hand. He fell ill just before the tournament and lost in the first round of both. “It was my first time in New York, too. So a lot of firsts, but it was cool at that age, especially, just to be there.” (Playing in the junior grand slam the following year, he faced off against Foneseca.)In 2022, at age 17, Tien, unsure of whether he wanted to fully enter the professional circuit or go to school, entered USC. He played one semester.“I honestly think that that time in school was really big for me, just to figure out what I wanted to do. I was really unsure if I was ready yet. And I think that time really helped me find clarity and just knowing that you know, tennis is something that I would really want to pursue, and that I was willing to do at that point whatever it took to make that happen,” he says. “So I think that was probably one of the biggest turning points.”Tien suffered a three-month layoff from a rib injury early last year. “I was injured last year, so coming back, I didn’t have a lot of expectations. And I started doing really well after that. And so obviously my expectations changed a bit as I started doing better.”Playing mostly Challenger and Futures tournaments, Tien went on a 28-match win streak last spring, totalling 63 wins for the year. In the Next Gen Finals, he faced, yet again, Fonseca in the championship and lost in three sets.“Towards the end of the year, I kind of set a goal to break [the] top 100,” he said. “I didn’t end up doing that last year, but it happened early this year. But, you know, I was playing a lot of Challengers last year, and I really wanted to move on to the main tour. That was one of my big goals. This year I’m playing a lot more tour events and playing a tour schedule,” he says. “I’ve obviously had a lot more success than I probably foresaw coming in this year. So I’m just trying to take a lot of experience from my first time around a lot of these events.”The most notable experience this year was beating Medvedev. After failing to convert a match point in the third, he lost the fourth 6-1, before battling back to win it in a fifth-set tiebreaker. After the match, Tien was asked what had happened in the fourth set. “Honestly … I just had to pee so bad,” he said to the crowd’s laughter.“I didn’t want to get bageled,” he says today. He scraped out the game at 0-5, so he could start serving in the fifth. “I problem solve pretty well through matches. There’s always kind of an initial gameplan going on the court, but most of the time that’s not really something you can stick with through an entire match.”When asked what that match meant to him, Tien says it was a confidence boost, but one that he couldn’t appreciate right away.“It didn’t honestly hit me,” he says. “It was tough to kind of let it all sink in, just because of everything that was going on. I was still in the tournament, and I only had a day to rest for my next match. I kind of had to bounce back pretty quick. But, you know, in the weeks after it kind of hit me, and obviously that win was really big for my confidence overall.”Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

He also owned the fourth-longest active managerial tenure in the world before his firing. His 15 year, seven month, 24 day tenure stands as the 38th-longest tenure by any soccer manager in the world since the second world war.Kerry Zavagnin was named the interim coach for Sporting KC, who are winless (0-5-1) through six matches to start the 2025 season – part of a 13-match winless run dating back to the end of last season, which ended with four straight losses as SKC missed the MLS playoffs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I wish the club nothing but the best in the future.“Vermes guided Sporting KC to an MLS Cup championship in 2013 and US Open Cup titles in 2012, 2015 and 2017. His teams made the playoffs 11 times, including eight straight from 2011-18. He was named the MLS Sporting Executive of the Year in 2019, having served as the club’s technical director since 2006.Vermes was instrumental not just in the first team’s success, but also in building out the broader infrastructure of the club once known as the Kansas City Wizards. He led the team into a new era during that rebrand, and contributed to the club’s designs for its home stadium and training facility, and oversaw the development of the youth academy.Vermes ranks third all-time among MLS coaches with 203 wins in the regular season. He played for the franchise from 2000-02 and is the only person to win the MLS Cup as a player and a coach with the same team.Explore more on these topicsSporting Kansas CityMLSUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Or at least, theyknewhow to win. While last season ended with the club clinching a league-record sixth MLS Cup, they’re now making a different sort of history. Winless through their first six games of the season, Saturday’s 2-1 defeat to Orlando City means the Galaxy have made the worst start to a campaign of any defending MLS champion ever. They don’t put a star above the crest for that.At first, the injuries to Riqui Puig and Joseph Paintsil were used as explanation. The departure of striker Dejan Joveljić, Gaston Brugman and Mark Delgado were also seen as factors. This talent deficit has undeniably contributed to the sudden downfall of theMLSCup winners, but increasingly it feels as if other things are at play.Fifa considering LAFC v Club América playoff to replace León at Club World CupRead moreFor one thing, the attacking balance is off. Despite making 21 more passes into the final third than Orlando on Saturday, the Galaxy had six fewer shots and just 1.03 in expected goals (xG) compared to the visitors’ 1.58. Paintsil made his first appearance of the season off the bench, but the Ghanian is still lacking sharpness. His 28 minutes on the pitch coincided with Orlando’s comeback from 1-0 down to win 2-1.Defensively, the Galaxy were never the most resolute of teams, even at their best. Their defensive record was only the eighth best in the West last season. Previously, though, they created enough in attack to mask this. That is no longer the case and it certainly isn’t helping that goalkeepers John McCarthy and Novak Micovic are taking turns to throw one in their own net, with both committing terrible errors in recent weeks.Marco Reus has been unable to replicate Puig’s natural creativity. His work ethic has been a problem too. Gabriel Pec is cutting inside on to his left foot too often. Christian Ramírez is struggling for service. Emiro Garcés hasn’t been the same player this season. The Galaxy could hardly be handing over a longer list of issues for Puig to fix when he’s back.GRLionel Messi: super sub?We have seenLionel Messido all sorts of incredible things in his time with Inter Miami, but Saturday saw the Argentinian fill a role he hasn’t often been asked to play in his career. He was a substitute.Messi has been dealing with whatInter Miamicalled a “low-grade” adductor strain and an issue with his left thigh. The injury kept him from traveling to South America for Argentina’s World Cup qualifiers against Brazil and Uruguay, and it also kept him on the bench for Inter Miami’s Saturday game against Philadelphia Union.Any hopes that all that time on the sidelines would reduce Messi’s effectiveness were, of course, sorely mistaken. The World Cup winner scored within two minutes of entering the match, finishing off what would turn out to be the winning goal off a feed from Luis Suárez.The notion of using Messi as a super-sub is patently ridiculous, even as he rockets ever closer to the age of 40 … Or is it?Opta notedafter the game that Messi averages about 1.6 goals per 90 minutes across all of his 113 appearances as a sub for club and country.If you’re like me, you probably found both numbers to be eye-popping. Not only is that a ridiculous goals-per-90 ratio, but he’s been a star for so long it’s difficult to imagine Messi coming off the bench that many times. I guess that’s how it goes when you play more than 1,000 games.AAView image in fullscreenOnni Valakari helped San Diego FC to a big win over LAFC.Photograph: Michael Owens/Getty ImagesSan Diego, please forgive usIt’s time for MLS experts to stop underrating expansion teams. Plenty of pundits (ourselves included) felt San Diego FC would struggle in their debut campaign. After all, they had brought in few players proven in MLS and hired an inexperienced manager (Mikey Varas) to lead the way.Instead, SDFC are enjoying a charmed start, leaning on new faces to earn results even with big names like Hirving Lozano and Marcus Ingvartsen missing time because of injuries.Saturday was a dream day for the club, with a debut home victory lifting them to third in the Western Conference. Not only did San Diego win at home, they did so over LAFC, a team that everyone expects will become a rival.

Two goals conceded just before the half-time break made for a much more nervous finish than needed, but there were many bright spots in the opening 40 minutes.“I hope everybody takes notice in San Diego of the effort of the guys, the quality of the guys. I thought they were absolutely lights out. I had goosebumps,” Varas said afterward.You would have thought after great debut seasons from LAFC and St Louis City, MLS watchers had learned their lesson. SDFC might be one of the last MLS expansion teams, but they’re already showing they don’t need to be graded on a curve.JAView image in fullscreenCF Montréal have cycled through coaches quickly with few good results to show for it.Photograph: Melissa Tamez/APCF Montréal’s identity gets even murkierAll it took was a49-word press releaseto signal that CF Montréal’s organizational progress had come to a screeching halt, again. Published last Monday morning, that release announced the club’s decision to fire manager Laurent Courtois just five games into his second season on the sidelines. Courtois, whose hiring from the Columbus Crew setup pointed to Montréal’s desire to return to the possession-heavy days of Wilfried Nancy, was fired before he even had a chance to coach in front of the home crowd in 2025 thanks to the club’s seven-game, weather-induced road trip to start the season.And now? The intentions of owner Joey Saputo’s club are harder to read than ever.With the league’s lowest level of spending on the first team roster,CF Montréalcan’t win by amassing high-level talent. They more or less hit their ceiling in the East’s wildcard round last year. Now on their sixth manager since 2019 in interim coach Marco Donadel, CF Montréal can’t win by establishing a consistent tactical approach either, because that consistency doesn’t exist. Changing coaches didn’t magically fix them, as Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Chicago illustrated. They’re simply not a trophy threat, regardless of who’s managing them.Montréal are playing a different game than all 29 other clubs in MLS – and it’s not a winning one.At least Saputo has Bologna to fall back on, a club where “people appreciate our work … here [in Montréal] they don’t appreciate our work,” he said in abizarre interviewdays after firing Courtois.People in Montreal might appreciate CF Montréal’s top brass more if they started taking the club seriously, but it seems that’s too much to ask.JLExplore more on these topicsMLSLA GalaxyInter MiamiLionel MessiCF MontréalSan Diego FCUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Could classroom AI tools free teachers from repetitive tasks and bureaucracy, allow them to focus on their students and ultimately help solve the recruitment crisis that bedevils England’s schools?“I think technology will have an important role to play in freeing up teachers’ time, and in freeing up that time, putting it to better use with more face-to-face, direct teaching that can only ever be done by a human,” she said.“This is less about how children and young people use technology, and more about how we support staff to use it to deliver a better education for children. I think that’s where the biggest potential exists.“In the next few years I want to see AI tech embedded across schools, with staff supported to use the best technology to improve children’s outcomes but also to make teaching a more attractive career for people to go into and stay.“It’s not about replacing teachers. It’s about how the use of technology can complement the very human face-to-face contact that can’t be replaced.”Some of the tools are being designed to solve very specific problems. Jessica Leigh Jones, the chief executive of iungo Solutions, showed Phillipson and Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, a tool to assess how well students had wired circuit boards for vocational qualifications such as T-levels.Using a digital microscope, the tool can rapidly scan dozens of boards and provide feedback to students in a fraction of the time needed by a qualified and experienced electrical engineer – a specialist role in short supply, Jones noted.Jade Lesh, iungo’s digital growth engineer, told Phillipson the tool “minimises the time spent marking each piece of work”, and that their tests have found it to be as accurate as a trained human’s eye.Time saved was also Phillipson’s interest in an observation tool being developed by TeachScribe, giving early-years teachers lapel microphones to record their comments about each child’s development – how well they are playing with others or being creative – which are then uploaded to a database and compared with the government’s early-years curriculum goals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They “levelled the playing field” between experienced and early-career teachers, and removed the traps teachers can fall into when assessing their own pupils.“If you’ve got a class of 30, you’re always going into marking with an idea of ‘well, this one will be all right’. AI doing it takes away that unconscious bias and is actually just marking what’s there, which might throw up some things that a teacher hasn’t picked up in the past,” she said.This article was amended on 31 March 2025. An earlier version said that TeachScribe used “earpieces” when it uses lapel microphones.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)SchoolsTeachers' workloadTeachingBridget PhillipsonEnglandEducation policynewsShareReuse this content"

And by using pirated material,Metaare stealing from us twice over. I don’t think it’s at all surprising that we’re outraged.”Earlier this year, acourt filingalleged that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergapproved the company’s useof a notorious “shadow library”, LibGen, which contains more than 7.5 million books. On 20 March, the Atlantic republished asearchable databaseof the titles contained in LibGen, through which many authors discovered that their works may have been used to train Meta’s AI models without their permission.The letter claims this is a “clear infringement” of copyright law. “There can be no question that the scraping of authors’ works for the purpose of generative AI training is unlawful in the UK, yet tech giants like Meta are operating in the UK without sufficient enquiry being made into their practices,” it reads. “Authors are almost powerless given the enormous cost and complexities of pursuing litigation against corporate defendants with such deep pockets.”For writers, “and all those who make a living by their hard work, originality and imagination, this is another David and Goliath moment,” said Mosse on why she signed the letter. “Copyright exists, the terms and licensing provisions are robust, the law is clear. This is theft on a large scale and it must stop. Fair is fair.”The statement, written by the Society of Authors (SoA), was published on Change.org in the form of a petition, and has since garnered nearly 5,000 signatures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I’m here in person.”Musk and groups he supports have spent more than $20m to help conservative favourite Brad Schimel in Tuesday’s race, which will determinethe ideological makeup of a courtlikely to decide key issues in a perennial battleground state. Musk has increasingly become the center of the contest, with liberal favourite Susan Crawford and her allies protesting Musk and what they say is the influence he wants to have on the court.“I think this will be important for the future of civilization,” he said. “It’s that’s significant.”He noted that the state high court may well take up redistricting of congressional districts, which could ultimately affect which party controls the US House.Wisconsin supreme court race a litmus test for Elon Musk’s political powerRead more“And if the [Wisconsin] supreme court is able to redraw the districts, they will gerrymander the district and depriveWisconsinof two seats on the Republican side,” Musk claimed. “Then they will try to stop all the government reforms we are getting done for you, the American people.”A unanimous state supreme court on Sunday refused to hear a last-minute attempt by the state’s Democratic attorney general to stop Musk from handing over the checks to two voters, a ruling that came just minutes before the planned start of the rally.Two lower courts had already rejected the legal challenge by Democrat Josh Kaul, who argues that Musk’s offer violates a state law. “Wisconsin law prohibits offering anything of value to induce anyone to vote,” Kaul argued in his filing. “Yet,Elon Muskdid just that.”But the state supreme court, which is now controlled four-to-three by liberal justices, declined to take the case as an original action. The court gave no rationale for its decision. All four liberal justices have endorsed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, the Democratic-backed candidate.Kaul had no immediate comment on the court’s order.Musk’s attorneys argued in filings with the court that Musk was exercising his free speech rights with the giveaways and any attempt to restrict that would violate both the Wisconsin and US constitutions.The payments are “intended to generate a grassroots movement in opposition to activist judges, not to expressly advocate for or against any candidate,” Musk’s attorneys argued in court filings.Musk’s political action committee used anearly identical tactic before the presidential electionlast year, offering to pay $1m a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second amendments. A judge in Pennsylvania said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.Musk’s attorneys, about four hours before the rally was to begin, asked that two liberal justices who have campaigned for Crawford – Jill Karofsky and Rebecca Dallet – recuse themselves from the case. His attorneys argued their work for Crawford creates “the spectre of inappropriate bias.” If they did recuse, that would leave the court with a three-two conservative majority.Both justices rejected the request and said they would spell out their reasons why at a later date.One of the court’s conservative justices has endorsed Schimel, who wore a “Make America Great Again” hat while campaigning Sunday.Schimel said in a national television interview that he does not control “any of the spending from any outside group, whether it’s Elon Musk or anyone else” and that all Trump asked was whether he would “reject activist judges” and follow the law.“That’s exactly what I’ve committed to anybody, whether it’s President Trump, Elon Musk or any donors and donors or supporters or voters in Wisconsin. That’s my commitment,” Schimel told Fox News Sunday.The contest has shattered national spending records for a judicial election, with more than $81m in spending.It comes as Wisconsin’s highest court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election in the state.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskUS politicsTrump administrationWisconsinnewsShareReuse this content"

Alongside the expensive fashions bought with the proceeds of serious fraud are the tools needed to achieve it, says DCI Paul Curtis.“These are serious offenders and for whatever reason they felt the need to have these to protect themselves,” he says. Among the other tools are “Sim farms” bought on the dark web, which scammers use to send out numerous text messages at once; stacks of laptops; and mobile phones and payment card readers.The tools and spoils of crime have come from raids headed by the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit (DCPCU), whose offices theObservervisited this month. Tasked with uncovering payment fraud across the country and charging the perpetrators, this group of officers from the City of London andMetropolitan policeforces are at the forefront of the battle against fraud.Some of their most recent successes involved scammers who pretended to bebank officialsandpolice officersto defraud people, and a Chinese man whodrove around the West End of London sending masses of fake text messagesfrom a machine in his car.View image in fullscreenDCI Paul Curtis says fraud is ‘under-reported, and causes huge harm’.The National Crime Agency (NCA) estimates that 40% of crime is fraud-related; it puts the amount lost every year in the billions. Uncovering the criminals behind payment fraud is an uphill struggle.The problems are numerous: criminals are often based abroad and take advantage of constant advances in technology to dupe victims. But one difficulty is simple and prevalent, which is that people are so embarrassed to have fallen for a scam that they fail to mention it to those around them, let alone report it. “It’s under-reported, and it causes huge harm,” says Curtis. “And that harm isn’t just financial.” Victims can lose their sense of self-confidence and develop problems with mental health, and this can even lead to suicide.“Getting over people’s own embarrassment and shame is really challenging,” he says. “It’s about telling people and getting comfort from that network around you, like from your family [and] from your social network. And if people have that support, that can be so empowering to them [they can] then make a report and engage with law enforcement.”TheGuardianrecently revealed details of thesophisticated and mercenary tacticsused by scammers in an elaborate operation based in Tblisi, Georgia, which tricked Britons out of £9m. Many were called again and again by the criminals and persuaded to hand over more and more money.Curtis says criminals in fraud cases use methods similar to those of sexual predators when grooming their victims. “It works in exactly the same way with fraudsters. They have to build the confidence with the victim. They have to build that trust up. So sometimes this isn’t a quick process to become a victim of fraud,” he says.View image in fullscreenA Louis Vuitton bag seized in a raidAdvances in technology present ongoing problems for the DCPCU. Money can now be moved across borders at much greater speed than before, putting it out of the reach of law enforcement, and advertisements for fake investment vehicles often purport to be backed by celebrities, such as happened withMoneySavingExpert’s Martin Lewis.Developments in generative AI – where artificial intelligence can create text, images or videos using patterns in existing data – give fresh opportunities to criminals, according to Ben Donaldson, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, the banking body that funds the DCPCU.“I think it gives [criminals] a range of capabilities that they just didn’t have before and … it’s getting easier and easier for them to use some of this technology,” he says. In the past, emails and messages which claimed to be from a bank could be spotted because of poor grammar or spelling, but this is no longer the case as the technology being used by criminals improves.“It’s much, much easier to do that [fraud] in a very, very convincing way [as] there’s a whole sort of suite of capabilities available to criminals now which do change the nature of the threat. The bar to entry [with] that type of technology is getting lower all the time,” says Donaldson.This month, UK Finance and the consumer group Which?wrote a joint letter to the UK governmentcalling for “robust action” to be taken against technology companies to offset the growing cost of fraud.Donaldson says the vast majority of authorised push payment (APP) fraud, which involves tricking someone into voluntarily sending money from their bank account, emerges from social media accounts. The decision by Facebookto get rid of factcheckers and reduce censorship, announced in January, raises concerns that it will be even easier for criminals to exploit people, he says.Police have called for more effective user verification so that criminals cannot operate anonymously, as well as for more sharing of information that can identify them.Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, says it has launched its Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange – through which banks can share information about scams – which has led to the removal of 20,000 accounts. TikTok says each request for data from the police is examined and evaluated before data is disclosed.So at a time when fraud is ballooning and coming at people in emails, texts, WhatsApp messages and through any number of social media channels, what can people do to stay safe?Treat your personal information in the same way you treat your house keys, says Donaldson. “You shouldn’t hand over any aspects of your personal information unless you would trust that person with the keys to your front door.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

It is beginning to deter open dissent, which is exactly what the US president intends.The chill affects all five major pillars of civil society – universities, science, the media, the law and the arts.In Columbia University’s capitulation to Trump, it agreed torequire demonstratorsto identify themselves when asked and put its department of Middle Eastern studies under “receivership”, lest itlose $400min government funding.The agreement is already chilling dissent there, as my conversation with my friend revealed.The Trump regime also “detained” aColumbia University graduate studentand green card holder who participated in protests at the school. The administration’s agents have also entered dorms with search warrants and targetedtwootherstudentswho participated in such protests.On Tuesday, an international student in a graduate program at Tufts University was taken into custody outside her off-campus apartment building by plainclothes homeland security agents, handcuffed andwhisked awayto aprison in Louisiana. She has a valid student visa. Her apparent offense? Putting her name to an opinion piece in the Tufts student newspaper that was critical of how the Tufts administration handled protests.Scores of other major universities are on Trump’s target list.Trump’s attack on science has involved threats to three of the largest funders of American science – the Centers for Disease Control, National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation.Tens of thousands of researchers are worried about how to continue their research. Many have decided to hunker down and not criticize theTrump administrationfor fear of losing their funding.Philippe Baptiste, the French minister for higher education, has charged that a French scientist traveling to a conference near Houston earlier this month wasdenied entryinto the US because his phone contained message exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he gave a negative “personal opinion” about Trump’s scientific and research policies. The US Department of Homeland Security denies this was the reason the scientist wasn’t admitted into the country.Meanwhile, America’smajor media fearmore lawsuits from Trump and his political allies in the wake of ABC’s surrender to Trump in December,agreeing to pay him $15mto settle a defamation suit he filed against the network.Journalists who cover the White House are reeling from Trump’s decision to bar those he deems unfriendly from major events where space is limited.The media chill is palpable.

His order banned Perkins Coie lawyers from federal buildings and halted its federal contracts.Another executive order took aim at Paul Weiss, who employed the lawyer Mark Pomerantz before he helped prosecute Trump over hush money payments to Stormy Daniels.Last Thursday, Trumpwithdrew the executive order against Paul Weissbecause, he said, the firm had “acknowledged the wrongdoing” of Pomerantz and pledged $40m in free legal work to support the Trump administration.Non-profits tell the Washington Post that law firms that once might have helped them fight Trump’s orders now fear Trump will pursue them if they do.Trump is even intimidating the arts bytaking over the Kennedy Center, firing board members, ousting its president and making himself chairman.The comedian Nikki Glaser, one of the few celebrities to walk the red carpet at this year’s Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prizes, now thinks twice before doing political jokes directed at Trump.“Like, you just are scared that you’re gonna get doxxed and death threats or who knows where this leads, like, detained.

The institution has, reads the order, “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” that portrays “American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive”. The vice-president, JD Vance, is, by virtue of his office, on the museum’s board. He is charged by Trump to “prohibit expenditure” on programmes that “divide Americans based on race”. He is to remove “improper ideology”. The order is titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”. George Orwell lived too soon.The move is deeply shocking, but predictable. After Trump’s insertion of himself as chair of the John F Kennedy Center and his railing against the supposed wokeness of the national performing arts venue, the federally funded Smithsonian was bound to be next in line. Those who imagined the Kennedy Center was a one-off, attracting the president’s ire for personal reasons, were deluding themselves about the scale of Trump’s ideological ambition. Picked out for opprobrium in the executive order are the Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum for celebratingtransgender women(the museum, it should be pointed out, has yet to be built); the National Museum of African American History and Culture; and an exhibition titled The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture at the American Art Museum.I visited the Museum of African American History for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It is a vast book of a museum, heavy with text. It was full, when I visited, of mostly Black families seeking out an encounter with a narrative that has long been a footnote to, or erased completely from, the main national story. You could spend days absorbing the web of stories that the museum offers, beginning in its basements with the transatlantic slave trade, where one of the most moving objects is, unexpectedly and profoundly, a piece of iron ballast that took the place of a human body after a ship’s cargo of enslaved people had been disgorged on the triangular route between Africa, the Americas and Europe. The whole strikes a fascinating balance between an unflinching gaze on systems of oppression, and a sense of Black achievement and cultural richness that has nevertheless effloresced.Lonnie Bunch, the founding director of the museum, gave a talk at the House of Lords in 2011 about the institution, which was still in the planning, and would open five years later. I can still recall how moving it was to hear about the difficulties of making a museum – a place where a story is told through objects – from communities traditionally poor in material things. The institution had put out a call for loans and donations. Precious, carefully treasured objects – a bonnet embroidered by someone’s enslaved grandmother, for example – were arriving into the new collection.Fast forward to the present, and Bunch is in charge of the entire Smithsonian Institution. This is a man who believes, as hetold Queen’s University Belfastlast year, that history can be used to “understand the tensions that have divided us. And those tensions are really where the learning is where the growth is, where the opportunities to transform are.” That compassionate vision of the past, as a means through which the citizens of the present can better understand each other, is completely opposed to the monolithically triumphalist spirit of Trump’s executive order, in which history is reduced to “our Nation’s unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness”. How much easier it is, to sink into this pillowy, comforting notion of glorious progress than to grapple with the kind of knotty, often upsetting and confronting history that the Museum of African American History offers its visitors. But it makes me wonder: can the museum survive this government?I visited, too, the American Art Museum, whose show The Shape of Power is targeted in the executive order as emblematic of the Smithsonian’s decline into “divisive, race-centered ideology”. The exhibition, which wasyears in the careful making, points out what is surely obvious, once it has been given a moment’s thought: that race is not an inherent and prepolitical category, but rather a constructed set of ideologies that served (and still serve) a set of economic and political interests. (One way to tell that race is a socially constructed category, in fact, is by looking to the Greeks and the Romans – the people who established, in the minds of many on the US right, “western civilisation”. They were xenophobic in their own way, and enslavement was a fact of their societies. But as is obvious from their literature, whiteness and Blackness were for them simply not operative categories.) The exhibition is an eye- and mind-opening look at how race ideology has translated into and been reinforced, or deconstructed, by sculpture – that peculiarly lifelike and thus “truthful”-seeming artform.The catalogue quotes Toni Morrison, who once wrote that “I want to draw a map, so to speak, of a critical geography and use that map to open as much space for discovery, intellectual adventure, and close exploration as did the original charting of the New World.” Such intellectual adventuring is not what is wanted by the White House now. Trump’s world is more like Viktor Orbán’s, under whose government theschool history curriculum has been rewrittento glorify Hungary, or Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey, where the novelist Elif Shafak, as she recalled in aGuardian Liveevent last week, was prosecuted for “insulting Turkishness”, her lawyer obliged to defend in court the views of her fictional characters. The Smithsonian and all who work there have an unenviable choice, one that has already been put before other great or formerly great institutions such as Columbia University: to comply with Trump’s dark demands; or to find ways to defy them.Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writerExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionMuseumsRaceSlaveryCensorshipTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Yet instead of stepping up, the United States is dismantling forest protections and undermining global progress – highlighting the dangers of global forest policy that fails to hold the wealthiest, most powerful countries accountable.Unsustainable logging is one of the global north’s best-kept secrets. Each year, millions of acres of old-growth and primary forests across North America, Europe and Australia are clearcut under the guise of “sustainable forest management”. International policy, by design, looks the other way, focusing attention instead on deforestation in the tropics. This double standard allows the world’s wealthiest nations to evade accountability for industrial logging’s catastrophic consequences.It is a system built on the false assumption that the global north behaves responsibly, while scrutiny is reserved for tropical countries. But the latest actions by the US highlight just how dangerous and unbalanced this paradigm is.Donald Trumphas taken an axe to forest protections in the US, announcingtwoexecutiveordersthat aim to strip away foundational checks on destructive logging. Under the pretense of national security, the president’s orders aim to gut environmental safeguards and fast-track industrial clearcutting in some of the US’s most precious and climate-critical forests. This aggressive expansion will degrade irreplaceable forests like Alaska’s Tongass national forest – one of the world’s largest intact temperate rainforests. It will also increase carbon emissions and make communities more vulnerable to climate disasters.Trump orders swathes of US forests to be cut down for timberRead moreMeanwhile, as Europe strengthens forest accountability, US state officials arepushing to exempt the countryfrom new deforestation protections. These officials, echoing industry talking points, are urging the EU to exclude US wood products from a law requiring due diligence to prevent imports or exports tied to deforestation or forest degradation. Their argument? That the US doesn’t need oversight.The global north has long dictated the terms of international forest policy, supporting stricter environmental standards on tropical nations while sidestepping accountability at home. Canada, for example, clearcutsover 1.3m acres of forestevery year yet claims near zero deforestation through regulatory loopholes. Sweden has marketed its forestry sector as a climate leader whilelogging threatens its last remaining old-growth forests.But Trump’s latest action clearly shows the current model needs to change.The world needs a more equitable, partnership-driven model of forest protection. In August 2023, the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment called for the creation of a framework to drive more equitable global forest policy. More than 100 environmental organizationsechoed this callahead of last year’s UN climate conference in Dubai.With the next UN climate meeting taking place this year in Belém, Brazil – the gateway to the Amazon rainforest – Brazil has an opportunity to work with other countries to create this new reality.There are some signs of change. TheEU is strengthening trade policiesto exclude deforestation-linked products. Investors and corporations are aligning with international commitments to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. In Illinois, legislators haveintroduced a billto eliminate state procurement tied to deforestation and forest degradation. United Kingdom policymakersrecently acknowledgedthe need to avoid incentives for logging primary and old-growth forests.A fragmented system that arbitrarily evaluates risk differently in the global south and global north is bad for the climate and bad for business. Markets need consistency, and environmental policies should apply universally.For decades, the global north has molded international forest policy to benefit its logging sector. After marking the International Day of Forests, on 21 March, in this critical year, the global community must seize this moment to shape a new, more equitable, form of global forest governance. The world needs unified standards for all forests that hold all countries, including – especially – the most powerful, accountable.Jennifer Skene is director of global northern forests policy for the Natural Resources Defense CouncilExplore more on these topicsDeforestationOpinionTrump administrationConservationTrees and forestsLogging and land-clearingcommentShareReuse this content"

It is our refusal to be erased, our determination to remain and exist on our landMon 31 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 12.16 EDTShareOn the 17th night of Ramadan – a time meant for prayer, reflection and mercy –Gazaburned. Once again, our screens fill with images too harrowing to describe: tiny bodies wrapped in bloodstained cloth, fathers carrying their children’s remains in plastic bags, mothers screaming into skies that rain death instead of mercy. In less than an hour, Israeli airstrikes killed more than 350 Palestinians, including 90 children. Entire families wiped out as bombs fell on areas Israel itself had designated as “safe zones”, turning supposed sanctuaries into mass graves.This was not merely a resumption of violence. This is the continuation of a genocide that never truly paused, only ebbed enough to vanish from headlines while Palestinians continued to die by the dozens daily. The heaviness of this moment is unbearable, bringing back the brokenness of the past year that has not yet healed. For this slaughter to continue while the world watches reveals how deeply indifferent global powers have become to Palestinian suffering, how thoroughly dehumanized an entire people must be for their massacre to be debated as a matter of “security concerns”.These newest atrocities underscore the ongoing reality that Palestinians have faced for months now. In the ruins of Gaza, amid thecountlesslyviolated “ceasefire”, Palestinians confront not only the monumental task of rebuilding but also a struggle for who will control their future. Since 2 March, Israel has not allowed inanyaid, most importantly food and reconstruction resources, while Palestinians starve through Ramadan. As families return to find neighborhoods reduced to rubble, they face competing visions for Gaza’s reconstruction – including proposals that threaten their very existence on the land.Donald Trump recently suggestedtransformingGaza into a “riviera of the Middle East” by resettling its 1.8 million Palestinian residents elsewhere. This proposal reveals a profound misunderstanding of our connection to our homeland, a connection that transcends mere residence and forms the core of Palestinian identity.When outsiders ask why Palestinians don’t leave Gaza, or the increasinglygenocidalviolence in theWest Bank, they fail to grasp that this land isn’t just where we live – it’s who we are. Our relationship with this soil has been cultivated through generations. Since 1967, Israel hassystematically uprootedat least 2.5m trees in the occupied Palestinian territory, including nearly 1m olive trees. The olive trees that dot our landscape embody our history, resilience and indigeneity to the land – cultivated over generations of displacement.The question isn’t why Palestinians return to destroyed neighborhoods – it’s why anyone would expect us not to. Palestinians return because Gaza is home. The rubble beneath their feet isn’t debris; it contains memories, histories and the foundations of homes where generations were born and buried. Where the rubble has become amass gravefor50,000Palestinians.According to the UN’s latest assessment, rebuilding Gaza and the West Bank will require$53.2bnover the next decade: $29.9bn for physical infrastructure and $19.1bn for economic and social losses. These reconstruction efforts the result of 85,000tonsof bombs beingindiscriminatelydropped over the total area of Gaza. Behind these staggering figures lies a more fundamental question: will Palestinians be allowed to rebuild, or will they be rebuilt over?The answer must be Palestinians themselves. The future of Palestine will be determined by, with, and for Palestinians – no matter the form we choose. It is not for the United States, Israel, or the Arab states, who stood by as our people died, to decide what is best for us. Without Palestinians, rebuilding efforts merely perpetuate the cycle of violence and dispossession. We are not pieces on their geopolitical chessboard. We are a people with an inalienable right toself-determination, and reconstruction must serve that right – not subvert it.The immediate challenges are overwhelming. Over 80% of Gaza’s physical infrastructure has beendecimated– roads, power plants, water facilities, schools, universities andeveryhospital, in contravention of international law and basic morality. The removal of more than 50m tons of rubble and unexploded ordnance will requiredecadesto clear and restore semblance of normalcy.Yet amid this devastation, Palestinians demonstrate remarkable resilience. Journalists have documented peoplereturningto northern Gaza, setting uptentsin demolition sites, and even beginning construction work on new buildings. The “ceasefire” stipulated that 60,000 trailers and 200,000 tents should have entered Gaza to help house the forcibly displaced Palestinians – only 20,000tentsand no trailers have entered as Israel obstructs aid. However, Israel did deliver bombs as children slept; 70% of thosemurderedsince Israel resumed its violence have been women and children. In Jabalia, men were seen building the walls of theirdestroyedhome – a powerful symbol of determination to remain. There has been total destruction, but Palestinians remain steadfast like firm mountains. Palestinians are rooted in the land, there is no alternative.Does Israel think when it destroyed the stones, Palestinians will leave? As if theircitieswere not already built on the bones of our ancestors.This determination isn’t naive optimism, it is a recognition that to exist is to resist. We will not ask permission to narrate our pain. We will not wait for perfect victimhood to earn our humanity. Gaza is the site of resistance, rooted in every olive tree, every seed, every grave. We don’t build because we’re certain our homes will stand forever; we build because to stop building is to surrender. After previous bombardments, Gazans would collect concrete from destroyed houses to be crushed into gravel for new structures. Others extracted rebar from damaged walls to reinforce new construction.In the sameinterview, Trump also suggested Palestinians should leave so they no longer have to be “worried about dying”. Palestinians aren’t afraid of death – we’re afraid of being killed systematically. The solution isn’t removing the victims but stopping those doing the killing. Gaza doesn’t need redesigning as if it were an empty hotel room; it needs an end to the cycle of destruction.When I think about what Palestinians hope for, I’m struck by how basic their dreams are. Palestinians want to get jobs, build homes, visit the beach, perhaps travel knowing they can return. Palestinians dream of an airport, a seaport, welcoming tourists, praying at Al-Aqsa mosque, and returning to villages where their grandparents lived.What Gaza needs now is immediate: it needs life restored, urgently and unapologetically. It needs teachers for children who have been denied not just classrooms, but childhood itself. It needs dignified burials for the dead, those whose names are scribbled on their limbs so they might be recognized beneath the rubble. It needs seeds and soil, not just to replant crops, but feed those forcibly starved. It needs hospitals where women are not forced to give birth without anesthetics, where the wounded are not condemned to die for lack of electricity.And above all, Gaza needs the world to see Palestinians as people – people deserving of life, freedom and solidarity.While international support is crucial, it cannot come with strings that undermine Palestinian sovereignty. Foreign aid should not be conditioned on accepting foreign control. It should not be leveraged to force political concessions or normalize relations with an occupying power. True solidarity means supporting Palestinian-led reconstruction without imposing external agendas.The February letter from Arab foreign ministers to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, speaks of implementing “a plan to realize the two-state solution”. However, any plan must begin with recognizing Palestinian agency. Without meaningful Palestinian participation, without respecting our right to choose our own political future, such plans remain hollow gestures. And expecting Palestinians to accept a solution from those who attempted to erase them completely is like asking the wounded to trust the hand that still holds the bloody knife.The challenges ahead are enormous, but so is Palestinian determination. As Israel continues to bomb starving Palestinians, their refusal to abandon our land isn’t stubbornness but existence itself. As Israel continues to murder Palestinian journalists, likeHossam Shabat, we will make sure the world not only sees their crimes, but remembers them. In the face of those who would make our lives impossible, we will continue to find ways to remain. We will rebuild not according to someone else’s vision but according to our own needs and aspirations.This rebuilding is more than reconstruction – it is resistance. It is our refusal to be erased, our determination to remain and our unwavering belief in our right to exist on our land. Nothing is more important than staying. Nothing is more revolutionary than returning. And nothing is more certain than that we will rebuild Palestine with our own hands, for our own people, on our own terms.Ahmad Ibsais is a first-generation Palestinian American, law student and poet who writes the newsletter State of SiegeExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaUS politicsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

While White House policy pronouncements have come with flair and political theater – such as the presidentsigning orders on a Jumbotron– inCongressthere are quieter but equally pernicious efforts aimed atsilencing the votesand voices of communities across the country.One such piece of legislation is the so-calledSafeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or Save Act, which would require Americans seeking to register or re-register to vote to prove US citizenship. This dangerous bill would in effect strip millions of Americans of their access to the vote, while making the voting process more difficult and burdensome for everyone else. Rather than make our elections more secure, the Save Act would disenfranchise millions based on nothing but a series of debunked conspiracy theories.The US government is effectively kidnapping people for opposing genocide | Moira DoneganRead moreLast week, meanwhile, the White House issuedan executive orderthat would upend voter registration and our elections – requiring additional proof of citizenship on federal voting forms; seeking to block states from from processing mail-in ballots after election day; paving the way for funding cuts to states that refuse to fall in line; anddirecting Elon Musk and his so-called “department of government efficiency”to review voter information. It’s a blatant, brazen and unlawful attempt to try to remake our election system by fiat that represents a direct attack on the checks and balances that have secured our elections for generations. The order is sure to face legal hurdles and should not stand up to scrutiny by the courts or the American people. Now, at the same time as we are calling out this attempted power grab by the Trump administration, we must also prevent Congress from making the mistake of disenfranchising millions of voters.According to research by the Brennan Center for Justice,more than 21 millionUS citizens of voting age don’t have easy access to proof of citizenship documents, and only about half of American adults have a passport, while millions do not have access to paper copies of their birth certificates. Married women whose legal names do not match their birth certificatescould be disenfranchisedby the Save Act, and folks looking to obtain lost or misplaced birth certificates would face financial and logistical hurdles.The Save Act would restrict voters’ ability to register to vote online and through the mail while also severely limiting the ability of non-partisan civic organizations to conduct voter registration drives, which have been crucial to civic engagement for more than a century. That’s because, despite voters’ ability to register to vote at the DMV and registration efforts by political parties, data shows that voter registration drives from non-partisan organizations can account forabout one-fifth of voter registration applicants– roughly equal to the political power of California, Florida and Texas combined. We simply cannot sit back and allow Congress or the White House to destroy the infrastructure of our elections by disenfranchising so many voters.Voter registration drives by non-profits have arich and powerful history, dating back to the League of Women Voters and other civic groups encouraging women to register in the 1920s after the passage of the 19th amendment. During the Freedom Summer of 1964 in Mississippi, students from northern states traveled to Mississippi to canvass the state and register Black people to vote as the civil rights movement pushed back on centuries of racist voter suppression. And in more modern elections, voter registration drives have become a critical vehicle for driving community engagement among communities of color and marginalized groups that the traditional political system has left behind. Historically, political parties categorize voters based on their likelihood to vote, and “low propensity” voters are sometimes considered unworthy of political candidates’ time and resources. Without non-profit organizations and civic groups stepping in to spur engagement, we risk a vicious cycle in which marginalized communities are completely ignored.US government cuts imperil life-saving gun violence research. As doctors, we fear for the future | Jessica Beard and Elinore KaufmanRead moreAtState Voices, the nation’s largest non-partisan civic engagement network responsible for collecting more than 840,000 voter registration applications and contacting more than 66 million voters in 2024, we see first-hand the impact of voter registration drives to reach communities that are overlooked and underserved. Last year, our affiliate in Nevada, Silver State Voices, sent staff to help register tribal members from the Duck Valley and Pine Nut Reservations – carrying downloaded maps to register applicants who live in rural areas without a street address. In Wyoming, a network of civic organizations helped a county clerk to register hundreds of high school seniors. And in Nebraska, the Nebraska Voting Rights Coalition helps register newly eligible voters who have completed probation and parole requirements due to past felony convictions. These stories represent only a tiny fraction of the impact of nonpartisan voter registration efforts in communities across the country – and they’re all under threat should the Save Act become law.Our nation faces huge questions in the coming elections about the future of our economy, our healthcare system, our children’s education, the environment and more. For our democracy to thrive, we must allow voters to have their say – not restrict who has a voice based on logistical hurdles. As this bill moves forward, it is imperative for people to make clear to their members of Congress that they must reject the Save Act permanently.Alexis Anderson-Reed is the president of State Voices, a non-partisan organization that coordinates hyper-local election registration, education and mobilization across 24 states with 1,200 partners in Bipoc and working-class communities across the countryExplore more on these topicsUS voting rightsOpinionRepublicansUS CongressTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

And they won’t stop at foreign studentsMon 31 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 14.34 EDTShareThe defining feature of American democracy, you could be forgiven for having thought, is that you can say what you think without having to fear that you will be arrested, locked up or deported for it.The United States isn’t unique in its commitment to this idea, but this country has taken it unusually seriously. No law has been repudiated as decisively by the US supreme court as the Sedition Act of 1798, which made it a crime to publish false or scandalous criticism of government officials.American newspapers, unlike their counterparts in most other nations, can print governmental secrets without fear that the security services will ransack their newsrooms. The first amendment has been understood to protect a very broad range of political speech, including, importantly,by immigrants. As a consequence of all of this, there are – or there were, until very recently – many things one could say in New York that one couldn’t say in Istanbul or Mumbai, or even in Berlin or London.The US government is effectively kidnapping people for opposing genocide | Moira DoneganRead moreTheTrump administration’s roundup of students who protested Israel’s bombardment of Gaza marks an astonishing, radical break with what one might justifiably think of as the central American idea. Immigration agentsforce a PhD studentinto an unmarked van in Somerville, Massachusetts,arrest a recent gradin front of his eight-months-pregnant wife in the lobby of a Columbia University-owned building in New York City,seize a Georgetown University postdocfrom his home in Washington DC – all, it seems, for their lawful political speech. These are the kinds of scenes we expect to see in the world’s most repressive regimes; it’sgenuinely shockingto see them unfolding here.Thus far the arrests haven’t generated widespread outrage in the United States, perhaps because the students are foreign, or because pro-Palestinian protesters have been vilified by both major political parties, many universities and much of the media.But an administration that imprisons and expels foreign students for their pro-Palestinian advocacy is unlikely to stop with foreign students or, for that matter, with pro-Palestinian advocacy. Trump’s student roundup has already progressed from visa holders to legal permanent residents, and administration officials have said they intend to come after naturalized citizens as well. And the argument the administration is advancing to justify thecancellationofstudents’ visas– that the students’ advocacy undermines US foreign policy – could as easily be made with respect to those who advocate in support of any other cause the Trump administration happens to disfavor.It’s difficult to convey how profoundly these arrests have transformed American universities in just a few weeks. In alegal complaint filed earlier this week, professors describe a “climate of fear and repression” on university campuses across the United States, with international faculty and students stepping back from groups that engage in political advocacy, forgoing opportunities to publish their work, scrubbing their webpages of references that immigration authorities might find provocative, and no longer engaging with political topics on social media or even in private texts. (The case was filed by the American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association; the Knight First Amendment Institute, which I direct, is counsel.) Many international students and faculty are genuinely terrified that masked government agents might show up on their doorsteps at any moment.Donald Trump is moving fast and breaking things, but that may result in a better US | Simon JenkinsRead moreAll of this is likely to get worse. The arrests of student protesters are just one manifestation of the Trump administration’s broader campaign against democratic institutions and freedoms. As students are being disappeared into Ice’s detention centers, Trump is speedrunning the rest of the authoritarian playbook –threatening the media,extorting universities,imposing sanctions on lawyerswhom the president perceives to be his political enemies, andintimidating judges. If he continues on this path without encountering more resistance than he has encountered thus far, full-fledged authoritarianism is just around the corner.And yet it may be the arrests of protesters that pose the gravest threat to our fast-fading democracy.Protesthas been the engine of social change in this country for many decades, and it is difficult to envision any way for Americans to reclaim their democracy now that doesn’t involve millions of people taking to the streets. The arrests of student dissidents are a warning to anyone who might be tempted to try it: if we can do this to them, we can do it to you too, and we will.The students are being persecuted for exercising a right that all of us need now more than ever.

The Trump administration’sdisdain for Europeis deep and the transatlantic fracture is structural. While our leaders publicly play down the significance of the unravellingthat is manifestly under way, few actually sound as convinced in private.Hopes persist that Europe can prevent the most extreme manifestation of the collapse in the relationship, be it an invasion ofGreenland, the withdrawal of US forces from Europe’s Nato member states or an all-out trade war. Most urgently, European leaders are focused on ensuring that if (or perhaps when) the US throws Kyiv under the bus, it is Europe collectively that will somehow succeed in securing a free, independent and democratic Ukraine. But there should be no illusion that this will happen by working in synergy with Washington or even with its tacit approval.Signalgate was both unsurprising and shocking. It was unsurprising because the personal animosity towards European countries on display in the US national security team’s supposedly confidential group chat is not very different to what administration officials have said publicly. Think of JD Vance at theMunich Security Conferencein February, the US special envoySteve Witkoff, in his interview with Tucker Carlson, or Donald Trump himself in his ceaseless declarations and social media posts. There is remarkable consistency between the private and public pronouncements: Washington considers Europe to be obsolete, arrogant and parasitic.What is shocking, nevertheless, is that the US does not just viewEuropeas moribund. Trump’s officials seem to want to contribute to its death. Regardless of what one thinks of the Houthi threat in the Red Sea, it is US policy that attacking the pro-Iranian militia is in its national security interest. But as Vance and Pete Hegseth made clear on the group chat, the US also thinks that attacking the Houthis would benefit Europeans, and this is reason enough to question any attack. Helping Europeans, in other words, is seen as such a downside it could outweigh the direct upside for the US itself of dealing with a perceived threat. It is the visceral hatred of Europeans contained within this twisted train of thought that is shocking.This active disdain has three major policy implications for Europe. First, trade. This week, Trump is set to launch his trade war on countries he believes are “screwing” the US economy. No amount of sympathy or historic friendship will mitigate the US-EU dimension of this war. Quite the opposite. However, managing trade policy for the 27 governments is the EU’s legal responsibility and the bloc has a combined economic weight the US cannot ignore. Therewill be pain, but in a tit-for-tat conflict it will be reciprocal. If Europeans stick together on trade, as on the regulation of technology, the US will be unable to behave in a predatory way, however irrational its hatred. Washington will be forced to act transactionally when it comes to Brussels and it will eventually make a deal.Second, Greenland. Here, the US will not stop. Trump has said time and time again that Greenland will be his. Vance’sprovocative tripto the Arctic island, and his scolding of Denmark for having “not done a good job” in looking after Greenland’s security over decades, indicate that Washington’s attempted coercion will only intensify.But the controversy also suggests that European pushback, in this case starting with Greenland itself, also works. After a chorus of criticism, the trip was hastily rejigged to leave out the capital Nuuk and include only a “troop visit” to the remote US military base in the far north of the territory. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, while initially timid in her reaction to the Trump administration’s encroachments, has startedspeaking outmore volubly; last week accusing the US of “unacceptable pressure”.Now, against the backdrop of what we know about the Trump administration’s disdain for Europe, it is up to other European leaders to speak up in support of Denmark. The more that Europeans come across as weak pushovers, the worse the US pressure will become.Finally, and most importantly, Ukraine. The willing and able countries led by Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer, with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, are now moving forward on plans to support Ukraine. But it is increasingly clear they will have to do so not just without the US, but possibly against it too. US military support cannot be relied on. As Europe’s biggest powers plan increasedeconomic and military supportfor Ukraine, as well as a“reassurance force”to train and assist Ukrainian forces in the protection of cities, civilian and military infrastructure, they will have to come to terms with the reality that there will be no US “backstop”.So many souvenirs for JD Vance to take home from Greenland: oil, gas, minerals – and that’s just the start | Marina HydeRead moreThey should, of course, continue to engage Washington in discussions, notably on intelligence sharing and logistical support. But if Washington continues to balk, Europe andUkrainemust figure out how to do without it.When it comes to sanctions on Russia, Europe will probably need to work against the US. Vladimir Putin’s game is obvious. To dodge implementing a proposed ceasefire, he makes it conditional on the end of western support for Ukraine and thelifting of sanctionson Russia. It is highly likely that the US administration will not only play along with the Kremlin, it will also start pressuring Europeans to follow suit. Europeans will be depicted as the obstacle to peace.So far, European governments are standing firm. The EUemphatically rejectedRussian demands that financial sanctions on the agri-food sector be suspended as a precondition for a ceasefire in the Black Sea. Europe should be prepared to withstand US pressure in this regard.Withstanding US bullying, whether on Ukraine, Greenland or trade is not just good policy. It pays off politically as well. The approval ratings of those world leaders who are seen as standing up to Trump, from Zelenskyy and Canada’sMark Carneyto Mexico’sClaudia Sheinbaum, and Macron and Starmer in Europe, are rising. The US administration will continue to be consumed by its hatred for Europe. With firmness, courage and politeness, Europe should simply go its own way.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionTrump tariffsEuropeDonald TrumpUkraineGreenlandSignal group chat leakcommentShareReuse this content"

They also inherited a set of alliances and relationships that underpinned the largest economy in world history. This too they are breaking.The American vice-president, JD Vance, visited a US base in Greenland forthree hours on Friday, along with his wife. National security adviser Mike Waltz and his wife also went along. Fresh fromusing an unsafe social media platformto carry out an entirely unnecessary group chat in which they leaked sensitive data about an ongoing military attack to a reporter, and thereby allegedly breaking the law, Waltz and Vance perhaps hoped to change the subject by tagging along on a trip that was initially billed as Vance’s wife watching a dogsled race.The overall context was Trump’s persistent claim that America must take Greenland, which is an autonomous region of Denmark. The original plan had been that Usha Vance would visit Greenlanders, apparently on the logic that the second lady would be an effective animatrice of colonial subjection; butnone of themwanted to see her, and Greenland’s businesses refused to serve as a backdrop to photo ops or even to serve the uninvited Americans. So, instead, the US couples made a very quick visit to Pituffik space base. (Pete Hegseth, another group chatter, stayed home; but his wife was in the news as well, as an unorthodoxparticipant in sensitive military discussions.)At the base, in the far north of the island, the US visitors had pictures taken of themselves and ate lunch with servicemen and women. They treated the base as the backdrop to a press conference where they could say things they already thought; nothing was experienced, nothing was learned, nothing sensible was said. Vance, who never left the base, and has never before visited Greenland, was quite sure how Greenlanders should live. Hemade a political appealto Greenlanders, none of whom was present, or anywhere near him. He claimed that Denmark was not protecting the security of Greenlanders in the Arctic, and that the US would. Greenland should therefore join the US.It takes some patience to unwind all of the nonsense here.The base atPituffik(formerly Thule) only exists because Denmark permitted the US to build it at a sensitive time. It has served for decades as a central part of the US’s nuclear armoury and then as an early-warning system against Soviet and then Russian nuclear attack.So many souvenirs for JD Vance to take home from Greenland: oil, gas, minerals – and that’s just the start | Marina HydeRead moreWhen Vance says that Denmark is not protectingGreenlandand the base, he is wishing away generations of cooperation, as well as the Nato alliance itself. Denmark was a founding member of Nato, and it is already the US’s job to defend Denmark and Greenland, just as it is Denmark’s job (as with other members) to defend them in return.Americans might chuckle at that idea, but such arrogance is unwarranted. We are the only ones ever to have invokedarticle 5, the mutual defence obligation of the Nato treaty, after 9/11; and our European allies did respond. Per capita, almost as many Danish soldiers were killed in the Afghan war as were American soldiers. Do we remember them? Thank them?The threat in the Arctic invoked by Vance is Russia; and of course defending against a Russian attack is the Nato mission. But right now the US is supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine. No one is doing more to contain the Russian threat than Ukraine. Indeed, Ukraine is in effect fulfilling the entire Nato mission, right now, by absorbing a huge Russian attack. But Vance opposes helping Ukraine,spreads Russian propagandaabout Ukraine, and is best known for yelling at Ukraine’s president in the Oval Office. On the base, Vance blamed the killing in Ukraine on Joe Biden rather than on Vladimir Putin, which is grotesque.Vance claimedthat there is now an energy ceasefire in place between Russia and Ukraine; in fact, Russia violated it immediately. Russia is now preparing amassive spring offensiveagainst Ukraine; the response of Musk-Trump has been to ignore this larger reality completely while allowing Biden-era aid to Ukraine to come to an end. Denmark, meanwhile, has givenfour times as much aidto Ukraine, per capita, as the US.Greenland, Denmark and the US have been enmeshed in complex and effective security arrangements, touching on the gravest scenarios, for the better part of a century. Arctic security, an issue discovered by Trump and Vance very recently, was a preoccuption for decades during and after the cold war. There are fewer than 200Americans at Pituffiknow, where once there were 10,000; there is only that one US base on the island where once therewere a dozen; but that is American policy, not Denmark’s fault.We really do have a problem taking responsibility. The US has fallen well behind its allies and its rivals in the Arctic, in part because members of Vance’s political party denied for decades the reality of global warming, which hasmade it hardfor the US navy to persuade Congress of the need to commission icebreaker ships. The US only hastwo functional Arctic icebreakers; the Biden administration was intendingto cooperatewith Canada, which has some, and with Finland, which builds lots, in order to compete with Russia,which has the most. That common planwould have allowed the USto surpass Russia in icebreaking capacity. This is one of countless examples of how cooperation with Nato allies benefits the US. It is not clear what will happen with that arrangement now that Trump and Vance define Canada, like Denmark, as a rival or even as an enemy. Presumably it will break down, leaving Russia dominant.As with everything Musk-Trump does, however, the cui bono question about imperialism in Greenland is easy to answer: Russia benefits. Putincannot contain his delightwith US imperialism over Greenland. In generating artificial crises in relations with both Denmark and Canada, America’s two closest allies these last 80 years, the Trump people cut America loose from security gains and create a chaos in which Russia benefits.View image in fullscreenPeople protest over JD Vance’s visit to Greenland in front of the US embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark, 29 March 2025.Photograph: Nils Meilvang/APThe American imperialism directed towardsDenmarkand Canada is not just morally wrong. It is strategically disastrous. The US has nothing to gain from it, and much to lose. There is nothing that Americans cannot get from Denmark or Canada through alliance. The very existence of the base at Pituffik shows that. Within the atmosphere of friendship that has prevailed the last 80 years, all of the mineral resources of Canada and Greenland can be traded for on good terms, or for that matter explored by American companies. The only way to put all of this easy access in doubt was to follow the course that Musk-Trump have chosen: trade wars with Canada and Europe, and the threat of actual wars and annexations. Musk and Trump are creating the bloodily moronic situation in which the US will have to fight wars to get the things that, just a few weeks ago, were there for the asking. And, of course, wars rarely turn out the way one expects.Much effort is spent trying to extract a doctrine from all this. But there is none. It is just senselessness that benefits America’s enemies. Hans Christian Andersen told the unforgettable tale of the naked emperor. In Greenland, what we saw was American imperialism with no clothes. Naked and vain.As a parting shot, Vance told Greenlanders that life with the US would be better than with Denmark. Danish officials have been too diplomatic to answer directly the insults directed at them from their own territory during an uninvited visit by imperialist hotheads. Let me though just note a few possible replies, off the top of my head. The comparison between life in the US and life in Denmark is not just polemical. Musk-Trump treatEuropeas though it were some decadent abyss, and propose that alliances with dictatorships would somehow be better. But Europe is not only home to our traditional allies; it is an enviable zone of democracy, wealth and prosperity with which it benefits us to have good relations, and from which we can sometimes learn.So consider. The US is24th in the worldin the happiness rankings. Not bad. But Denmark is No 2 (after Finland). On a scale of 1 to 100, Freedom Houseranks Denmark 97and theUS 84on freedom – and the US will drop a great deal this year. An American is about 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than a Dane. Danes have access to universal and essentially free healthcare; Americans spend a huge amount of money to be sick more often and to be treated worse when they are. Danes on average live four years longer than Americans. In Denmark, university education is free; the average balance owed by the tens of millions of Americans who hold student debt in theUS is about $40,000. Danish parentsshare a year of paid parental leave. In the US, one parent might get 12 weeks of unpaid leave. Denmark has children’s story writer Hans Christian Andersen. The US has children’sstory writer JD Vance. American children are about twice as likely as Danish children to die before the age of five.Timothy Snyder is the Richard C Levin professor of history at Yale University, and the chair in modern European history supported by the Temerty endowment for Ukrainian studies at the University of Toronto.

We are either at the gym or scrolling through our streams or doing both at the same time.But much as common law has its man on theClapham omnibus, the pub test remains our default jury of political commonsense, invoked to determine whether a perk is reasonable, whether a policy makes sense and whether the bloke in charge is fair dinkum.Guardian Essential poll: Albanese’s approval rating takes a hit but Labor inches ahead of CoalitionRead moreElections have been won and lost on these crude assessments that work to shortcut the ideological and policy contests into a user-friendly binary: think Beazley’s ticker, Latham’s inexperience, Morrison’s artifice.This election cycle Peter Dutton has been at pains to define the pub test through the prism of his strength and Albanese’s weakness. The election had barely been called and there he was, downing a XXXX and accusing Albo of being “weak as water” while his opponent supped on a non-alcoholic ginger beer just a few suburbs away.Will it work? Leadership attributes in this week’sGuardian Essential Reporthighlights the logic behind his approach.Which of the following describe your opinion of the Prime Minister and Opposition LeaderWhile the findings reinforce our low regard for politicians as a species, there are differences that Dutton wants to draw out. He is rated less likely to change his opinion, more decisive and more likely to stand up to vested interests. Squint and you can see the outline of a strong leader who will just get things done.At the same time, Dutton is seen as much more aggressive than Albanese, a quality that is constantly reinforced by his rightwing media cheerleaders. In contrast Albanese is perceived as the more reliable and calm of the two.Dutton is a little harder for Labor to pin down. Is he the former Queensland cop who still walks the thin blue line, or themulti-property investorwho has made himself a very wealthy man?When it comes to his policy agenda to wind back climate action and cut a swathe through the public sector, is he a menace or is he a flake? Or is he menacing because he is a flake?To answer these questions, we may need to delve deeper into our leaders’ souls, with our irregular Essential pub test, a series of more homespun character attributes we have been exploring since 2017.Which party leader would you…?To be clear, on all these measures more than a third of respondents see no difference between the two (we have removed these from the table to capture the points of contrast).On everything except investment advice, where Dutton’s property portfolio clearly trumpsAlbo’s holiday house, the PM is preferred: from offering a loan, to breaking bread, to giving advice to the kids and in keeping a secret.But it is the literal pub test where Albo stands out. Maybe that’s no surprise as he has a beer named after him while craft brewers are still trying to come up with a bitter that would do Dutton justice.Is this just polling froth? Looking back over our series, there is a credible story behind each Essential pub test.Most like to go to the pub for a beer withBill Shorten almost upset Malcolm Turnbull by portraying him as the last person anyone could relate to over a quiet drink, although, to be fair, his own side landed the issue when Abbott’s former chieftain Peta Credlin dubbed him “Mr Harbourside Mansions”.Scott Morrison’s daggy dad construct “ScoMo” then wrong-footed Labor, convincing a majority that he would be better company at Cronulla Leagues. By 2022 Morrison had pulled out of his shout one time too many, but he still had a narrow advantage over Albo.So where does this leave Albo and Dutton? Being a preferred drinking companion does not win you an election, but it does speak to who the electorate is more willing to spend their time engaging with.Middle names, music and mutts: less likely ways Albanese and Dutton can sway the 2025 Australian electionRead moreThe problem for Peter Dutton is that he is defined by what he opposes: clean energy, workers, migrants, public servants, the woke. He’s like the bloke who is always having a gripe about the world with nothing much to contribute. They get tiring.Donald Trump is unwittingly offering a handbrake on Dutton’s more boorish tendencies. After a few false moves, the decision to stand with the PM on tariffs by criticising but not retaliating was the smart move. It does, however, take a bit of the gloss off the strongman persona.Dutton’s other drinking buddies are a less positive influence. The Advance Australia zealots and Clive Palmer’sTrumpet of Patriots’ determination to ramp up the anger may have the same repellent effect as GetUp! and Bob Brown’s bus had on the 2019 election.It remains to be seen whether Dutton will try to harness these vibes. As we showed with theEssential “lad report”, there are new friends out there to be made, but the ensuing chaos makes for a ratty night on the tiles.In contrast, with his low-fi, low-alcohol, heaps normal schtick, the prime minister might prove to be the more reliable drinking partner who convinces us that while he is not the life of the party, at least he won’t spill the drinks.Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company.

European leaders can seize this moment to show voters they will fight for themMon 31 Mar 2025 13.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 13.57 EDTShareThe French justice system chose courage over surrender. The law was clear, and so was the court in its sentencing:no special treatment for Marine Le Pen, no deference to the powerful, no using a candidacy for office as an excuse to break the law with impunity.For more than a decade, from 2004 to 2016, Le Pen’s reactionary rightwing party – named the Front National until 2018, when it became the Rassemblement National (RN) – operated an organised scheme to embezzle public funds by creating fictitious parliamentary assistant jobs at the European parliament, and to break other financial rules, in effect using European public money to finance a debt-ridden party domestically. Under a French anti-corruption law passed in 2016, the guilty verdict rendered against Le Pen comes with a sentence of ineligibility to run for office. The ban is for the next five years, effective immediately, which means that the sentence will hold all the way through an appeals process and will almost certainlytorpedo any chanceof her running for president in 2027.Many will see parallels between the RN’s response to this verdict and the way that Donald Trump rallied the anger of his base last summer, after a court in New Yorkfound him guiltyof a criminal hush-money scheme during the 2016 election. Indeed, Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old likely successor to Le Pen (who led RN during the summer’s unanticipated legislative elections), is already playing the victim card,declaringthat French democracy has been “killed”.There are a number of important differences, though. First, this is a much more serious case and conviction than the one against Trump: a hush-money payment might seem salacious, but this involved more than a decade of systematically defrauding the public of millions of euros and had real implications for French politics. During the time that the embezzlement was under way, the FN/RN was heavily indebtedto a Kremlin-connected Russian bank. Paying off the debt helped the party claim it no longer maintained inappropriate links to Vladimir Putin’s power circle – would it have been able to do so without the misused funds? And would it have been as competitive in the elections it contested without the unfair advantage of fraudulent finances?Second, with Le Pen herself ineligible to run in 2027, an angry base will have to transfer its support to Bardella or another potential challenger. As might be expected, many on the right are decrying the immediacy of the ineligibility sentence – but so is Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whobroke from the rest of the leftby declaring that the “impeachment” of a politician should be “left up to the people”. The Communist party, Greens and Socialists have, in various statements, underlined the importance of the rule of law and judicial independence.We will never know what would have happened if the US justice system had not totally failed at protecting the rule of law against an attempted coup d’etat. On the other hand, we know the consequences ofnotacting: the destruction of the rule of law and state capacity, the creation ofa parallel systemof prerogative and privilege from proximity to political power, and a slide towards outright fascism.But the law cannot be a substitute for politics, and the next judgment must be political. The far right has to be made to face its contradictions. It tells voters that the government is full of corrupt elites, or that immigrants are stealing social benefits – yet here are Le Pen and 24 other members of RN, convicted of the massive fraudulent use of public funds. It demands harsher sentencing from courts, and then plays the victim when it is handed harsh sentences. It superficially speaks the language of power, but what it really offers is weakness and submission – to Putin, to Trump. It doesn’t seem like this verdict will substantially change the far right’s message, or strategy; it was always going to claim victimhood at the hands of “the elites”. But it is here, in this third contradiction – what the parties reallyareand what their vision is to remake society – that there is the greatest opportunity to beat it politically.The RN makes no secret about which company it keeps and attracts. The French court’s verdict was decried by such paragons of the rule of law asthe Kremlin(“a violation of democratic norms”), Elon Musk (of course), whodenouncedan “abuse” of the judicial system, and Viktor Orbán,who posted: “Je suis Marine!”Exactly. Orbán is Marine; Putin is Marine; Trump is Marine.By trying to link their illiberal behaviour across borders, leaders of the reactionary right have given defenders of liberal democracy a playbook to follow. It strikes me as odd that, so far, few European politicians have seen the explosive benefit to be had in positioning themselves as a kind of “anti-Trump”, as the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, has doneto such effect, despite his country being far more vulnerable to US aggression than most of Europe is. Perhaps, in fact, that vulnerability has allowed him to see the stakes more clearly – or at least,to be more honestabout them with the Canadian public.Inpolling from February, a worrying 48% of French people said “nothing moves in democracy, there should be less democracy and more effectiveness”. I don’t think peopleactuallywant less democracy, though; I think they want to feel like someone is standing up and fighting for them, and it’s well past time that liberal democracy became as vociferous in defence of itself as its critics are against it. Trumpism is the perfect foil, in part because it’s so deeply unpopular with European voters, who see it in action and who in response support the EUmore than ever before, including broad popular support (even in the UK) for aEuropean defence union.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This might come as a surprise. If you live in London, you probably see one of the15,000 or socouriers like me zooming past you several times a day. And with Covid triggering a takeaway boom five years ago, you’d reasonably assume that these apps are raking it in.But while companies such asDeliverooand Uber have been pumped full of cash by investors, many have been losing money year after year, as they tried to squeeze competition out of the market. Twelve years into its existence, Deliveroo has finally made good on the promise to its investors and turned into a moneymaker, recording a £3m profit.Deliveroo makes annual profit for first timeRead moreWant to know how they’ve done it? I’m proud to tell you that it’s all down to me – and thousands of other riders like me. I’ve worked for Deliveroo for much of its existence, and in that time I’ve gone from being a recognised employee with full rights on a fixed wage to being technically self-employed with no rights, and my real-term, take-home pay squashed.I’ve been knocked off my bike eight times since I started as a courier in 2016. After my worst collision, in 2020, I couldn’t afford to stop working. I had to drag myself back on to my bike and carry on with my shift. I’ve heard countless similar stories from other riders. If I’m honest, almost everyone I know who delivers on a bike has been hit by a car at some point. Many suffer bumps and bruises and just dust themselves off and continue. One rider told me he broke his finger recently. Another broke his arm and still suffers mobility issues with his shoulder many months later.The dangers we face when riding are not recognised in our pay. Base rates were cut in 2019,resulting in widespread protests, withcouriers in London reportedly earningas little as £2.90 a delivery.Researchby Possible, in partnership withmy union, the IWGB, suggests that about one in five couriers in the gig economy make the equivalent of the London living wage.All of this falls disproportionately on those people who are already marginalised. Gig economy workers are more likely to be from a minority ethnic background compared to the labour market as a whole, and further, as Focus on Labour Exploitation (Flex) notes inits 2021 report, migrant workers are overrepresented in urban settings.In addition to the downward pressure on pay, the 2023 UK supreme court ruling that Deliveroo riders are to beconsidered independent contractorswas a guillotine to our benefits and rights, with no access to paid leave, rest breaks or a whole host of other normal entitlements for most employees.And over recent years, our working environment has been deteriorating. In London, traffic levels have been rising since the lockdowns of 2020, making roadsbusier and more dangerous, especially for people walking and cycling. Therewere nearly 23,000reported road accidents in London in 2023, and 80% of the peoplekilled or seriously injured were pedestrians, cyclistsor motorcyclists.Unsurprisingly, very few of us feel safe on the roads when working under these conditions. Research suggested that more than90%of us say we feel threatened by road hazards such as drivers when navigating the city roads, and that 80% of us prefer to ride on low-traffic routes. In far too many places, such routes just don’t exist. In inner-city London, where about one in 10 cycle journeysare undertaken by people like me delivering food, investment in protected bike lanes equates to investment in workers’ safety.On the other side of the coin, the solidarity you see among couriers is amazing. I’m part of a WhatsApp group where we all chip in what we can afford to support injured riders while they can’t make deliveries. Many more of these mutual aid groups are popping up in cities across the country.Ultimately, this is what has turned the first ever profit for the shareholders and bosses at Deliveroo: couriers’ pay being slashed; our rights being ripped up; working harder and harder for less and less. Meanwhile, the CEO of Deliveroo celebrated the news by sellingshares to the value of £15m, while retaining 95.8m shares in the company. For me to make that sort of money, at a base rate of £2.90, I’d have to cycle to his house and drop food on his doorstep about 5m times. I’d better get on my bike.Shaf Hussain is a Deliveroo rider and chair of the couriers branch of the IWGB unionExplore more on these topicsDeliverooOpinionGig economyLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

Do young women really think so poorly of men?Rachel ConnollyThe cliche of the loutish, emotionally inadequate boyfriend is everywhere. The truth is more complicatedMon 31 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 04.29 EDTShareHow is the ideal heterosexual girlfriend supposed to behave? This played on my mind after I watchedCompanion, a film about a loutish millennial man named Josh with a robot girlfriend named Iris. Iris was designed to be the perfect girlfriend, and so she regards Josh with total devotion and admiration, and prioritises their relationship above all else. She has a head full of fake memories, such as the one of the day they met, when they were both in the same supermarket and he clumsily upended a display of oranges, sending them rolling across the floor. This caught her attention. She has been programmed to regard this as the best day of her life.Like so many things you watch and read now, Companion is intended to reflect a familiar trope back at the viewer in an exaggerated but unchallenging fashion. It’s a pantomimed version of a wildly imbalanced heterosexual relationship, a portrayal that will be familiar to anyone who has come across “heteropessimist” discourse recently. Men, in this telling, are broadly akin to useless, unappealing Josh.Womenfeel deeply disappointed and embarrassed about dating them but are still committed to doing so, like a self-aware version of Iris. Crucially, heteropessimism shows no desire to reform the very real disparities between men and women, but the opposite: it takes as a given that women are sheepishly resigned to heterosexual relationships reflecting the worst of these inequities.As a millennial woman with a phone, I have felt bombarded by social media content expressing this sentiment for a while, and it seems to be reaching a crescendo. In a recent thoughtfulpiece for the New York Times, Marie Solis analysed the growing popularity of heteropessimist declarations from relatively young women since 2019, when the term was coined, through to a fresh spike coinciding with Trump’s second election win. “In the last year alone there has been an explosion of young women who say they are deleting dating apps,” she wrote, along with female celebrities declaring vows of celibacy or identifying as “self-partnered” (the state of being happy and fulfilled alone); a rash of divorce memoirs thattake a view of marriageas essentially barely altered since the 1970s; and TikToktrends like “boysober”, where women focus on self-improvement and friendships rather than men.I have found the strident “boysober” and “self-partnered” iterations of this trend cheering. The shrugging passivity of heteropessimism always struck me as mystifying. What do women, in the 2020s, need relationships with men for? Financial stability? We don’t marry people for their salaries any more,but their inheritances, and these are spread across the genders. Sex? Babies? Companionship? These things may be more difficult to attain outside a committed relationship, but how much more so? If men truly are as loutish as Companion’s Josh, then avoiding relationships with them entirely seems prudent.In the absence of a mass movement of women actually doing this, though, I’m not convinced that heterosexual relationships really are so irredeemably unsatisfying. Online communication is inherently performative. It is not a metric of how people truly feel, but more what they think they will be rewarded for saying. Heteropessimism mirrors other forms of progressive discourse over the past decade, which have placed a high premium on declaring self-awareness about participating in oppressive systems – capitalism, say – and describing their problematic elements without necessarily doing anything about them.Strip away these progressive furnishings and the underlying sentiment of heteropessimism feels incredibly trad. The idea of women straining to be good girlfriends for men who won’t put their dirty socks in the washing basket is an amazingly conservative view of the kind of relationships we could be having. Companion does not send up these tropes or even play with them. Iris is the film’s hero, and we’re supposed to sympathise with her. She is beautiful, great in bed, always obedient to Josh. But she is an incredibly cloying and annoying construction, no more likable or relatable than Josh. I spent most of the film wishing someone would take her batteries out. In fact, even Josh is often visibly exasperated to the point that he switches her off. I left Companion feeling irked. Perhaps the only thing more annoying than Iris herself was the idea that I should see myself in this hopelessly committed robot. It came as no surprise to me that Companion was written by a man.Happily, though, there are some small signs that this discourse is shifting. I was pleased to find, for example, that Shon Faye’s recently published memoirLove in Exilegracefully sidesteps this trend. The book feels like the start of the truly progressive mainstream conversation about heterosexuality that we could be having. Faye writes about resisting the temptation to see her partners as the only flawed or emotionally underdeveloped party in past relationships. And she offers an expansive view of heterosexuality as an institution under strain due to major social change.We’re in a relationship recession – and a lot of women are absolutely fine with that | Emma BeddingtonRead moreIn a recent interview Faye paraphrased the psychotherapist Esther Perel’s idea that we expect one partner to be many things: a confidant, a sexual partner, a coparent, someone to run finances by. Faye argued that millennial men have not been socialised to provide the emotional reciprocity that women are looking for. “But women are looking for that,” she said. I found myself wondering why this is. If it is true that men are not capable of relating to women in an emotionally sophisticated way, should we be asking why we need them to?That question of what women, in the 2020s, need men for is not a facetious one. In my experience, the lives of those in my generation often take different shapes to those of our parents and their friends. We don’t invest almost all our time in one romantic relationship. If expecting one person to provide all the things Perel lists hopelessly strains a relationship (and I agree it does) or makes it impossible to find an appropriate person, do we need just one person to do everything? Can a relationship simply be having fun with someone kind, while deep, emotional conversations are had with your friends? Or do we instead want a profound intellectual connection with a boyfriend while our friends are fun? As increasing numbers of us decide we don’t want children, do we need monogamy? Maybe a romantic partner is someone to have great sex with, whom you could never live with.We have more freedom to determine our own answers to these questions than we ever did. It may be true that the answer, for some women, is to be just like Iris: a good, obedient girlfriend to whichever man she ends up with. But even if we accept this, I would gently submit that the struggles of this particular type of person are overrepresented in the culture right now.Rachel Connolly is a writer and author of the novel Lazy CityDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He also argues that lowering the price of gas would lower the price of electricity. Such an apparently simple and appealing proposal deserves serious assessment.Bowen says Dutton ‘making it up as he goes’ on gas plan as experts question lack of detailRead moreThree key facts need to be considered:There is now not enough gas available outside the production of Queensland LNG producers to meet demand on the east coast, and that position is getting worse as long-term production in Gippsland in Victoria declines.East coast wholesale gas prices per gigajoule have risen from $8 to $10 in the second half of 2017, to about $14 today.Gas is needed to meet electricity demand when the mix of coal, hydro and renewables is not enough to meet demand. When this happens, the high cost of gas tends to push up the wholesale price of electricity.The current market mechanisms, notably the Australian domestic gas security mechanism, introduced in July 2017 by the then prime minister, Malcom Turnbull, have ensured that the east coast has not run out of gas. If producers do not voluntarily provide sufficient gas to meet any shortfall, the federal minister for resources can limit or prohibit exports. So far this has not been necessary.The depletion of gas resources on the east coast was always going to lead to higher prices. The war in Ukraine then dramatically lifted global LNG prices, with domestic wholesale prices reaching almost $30 a gigajoule. The Albanese government introduced a $12 price cap in December 2022. The impact has been limited by the way the price cap is managed, with the result that average producer prices in late 2024 were about $14 a gigajoule.It would surely be easier to place an obligation on the LNG producers to meet domestic contracts at a [fair] priceThe Coalition’s view is that the price of $14 is unacceptable for Australian consumers, and generates unfair windfall profits for the producers. Recent history provides some support for this argument.A Coalition government would impose some form of pressure on the LNG producers to meet any projected shortfall on the east coast, as they do now, but at a “fair” price decoupled from the international price.The central proposal is to force gas into the domestic market such that oversupply drives down the price. This proposal is superficially attractive, but the Coalition has not explained what the process would be or how it would work in practice. Oversupplied markets do not tend to remain that way.Further, demand and supply in the east coast market are quite dynamic, and the opposition has not explained how what appears to be a static process could respond to such market changes. Without more clarity, it is impossible to assess whether the Coalition’s idea would – or even could – meet what is a sound objective.That objective for both sides of politics would seem to be for the domestic market to be supplied at a price that is fair to consumers – that is, no windfall profits, and at a price which producers would have been satisfied with before the war in Ukraine. Additional gas could then be sold overseas at whatever price the producers can get.But it would surely be easier to place an obligation on the LNG producers to meet domestic contracts at such a price. The spot market would need to be maintained to meet unexpected circumstances. This price could then be reviewed and adjusted according to market developments.The opposition’s announcement includes other mechanisms to free up large sources of gas and get them to market. But there is little detail on what gas, located where, and transported how.Whichever side wins the May election will need to deal with the looming gas shortfall in Australia’s south-east. But short-term, superficially attractive ideas are not enough. Australians are owed a future gas strategy that looks to the role of gas in a net zero economy.Tony Wood is the energy and climate change program director at the Grattan InstituteExplore more on these topicsEnergyOpinionGasAustralian politicsPeter DuttonCoalitioncommentShareReuse this content"

What little we know so far paints a picture of a city ravaged by unimaginable horror.The war has sentSudanhurtling into the largest humanitarian disaster in the world, triggering genocide in the west of the country, and starvation there and in other areas. Previously allies in power, the RSF – formalised and expanded from the remnants of the Janjaweed militia – and the Sudanese military went to war when their partnership fell apart. The victims have been the Sudanese people, whose lives were trampled beneath. Khartoum’s centrality in the war, both in its prosperity and in terms of what it represents for the RSF as the seat of power, has meant the city has been subjected to a particularly intense and vengeful campaign: the RSF seized it and then proceeded not to govern the city, but strip it and terrorise its inhabitants.Those hesitantly leaving their homes to greetthe Sudanese armed forces’ (SAF) soldiers are hollowed out with hunger, thirst, disease and fear. They recount a siege of theft and murder, as a trigger-happy RSF militia shot those who resisted their demands. Afraid to carry their dead to graveyards, people buried those killed in shallow graves in their own streets and back yards. Elsewhere, corpses have been left to decompose where they fell. Widespread sexual violence against the civilian populationhas been reportedfrom the early days of the war. It is an indication of the total siege that Khartoum was under that there isn’t yet a reliable estimate of the death toll.In the areas of the city where the fighting was most intense, civilians fled, leaving behind a ghost town. The scenes are apocalyptic. Khartoum’s buildings and iconic landmarks are reduced to burned out shells, its streets overgrown with weeds and vegetation. In a striking encapsulation of the arterial severing of the country, the airport, functional until the very first hours of the war, with flights preparing for takeoff,was burnedto a black shell. Pieces of those planes grounded by the war remain on the runway.View image in fullscreenDamaged planes at Khartoum international airport, 27 March 2025.Photograph: APKhartoum airport’s rapid destruction speaks to the most remarkable feature of this war – how precipitous it was. How quickly Sudan was snatched from normality and plunged into a war that didn’t escalate over time, but exploded overnight. Millions grabbed whatever they could and fled as the RSF advanced. What they left behind was swiftly claimed. What occurred in Khartoum is the biggest looting of an African city, if not any capital city, in modern history. From the country’s cultural heritage to the belongings of its people, nothing escaped. Sudan’s National Museum, housing precious artefacts from Nubian and Pharaonic civilisations, has been emptied. What could not be carried awaywas destroyed. Homes and businesses were ransacked, with everything from furniture to personal belongings carted away. Even electric wiring was not spared: dug up and stripped to be sold. Images from the city feature the remains of cars, all with their wheels and engines removed.Atrocities mount daily. Promised aid does not arrive. Why has the west turned its back on Sudan?Read moreThe scale of the heist and destruction that is emerging marks the end of the siege of Khartoum as both a jubilant and profoundly sad moment. To be released from the pain of a brutal occupation is cause for relief and celebration, but the measure of the losses, of what is required to rebuild, is immense and goes to the foundations of the city’s physical and administrative capacities. The restoration not just of people’s homes and livelihoods, but the capital’s very infrastructure would be a vast endeavour for any country, let alone one still in the throes of war. What becomes apparent now is that so much of what has been lost is gone for ever.And then there is the matter of nation building and bringing an end to the war in the whole country. Sudan has unravelled along military lines, and people have rallied behind the SAF to restore the country’s territorial integrity and deliver them from the RSF. But a question about ejecting all military bodies from governance, a demand thwarted by the SAF-RSF partnership after the 2019 revolution that removed Omar al-Bashir, has become suspended in the process, pushing Sudan further into militarised rule and consolidation under the SAF. Proxies and mercenaries and arms suppliers have been drawn in, most prominently the United Arab Emirates, which has backed the RSF. These players have extended the life of the war and sunk so much cost in the conflict that their involvement will probably render large victories by the SAF indecisive in the short term. The international community has all butabandonedSudan to its fate, with hundreds of millions of dollars in pledged aid that never materialised and abysmal political engagement.The RSF militia has now decamped to a stronghold in the west of the country, where it controls almost every major city. The scale of the violence there against racial groups and tribes not aligned with the RSF has amounted to the sort of ethnic cleansing and mass murder that echoes the genocide of the 00s, and the SAF, with its deadly bombings, is responsible for numerous civilian casualties and has its own share of accusations of crimes against humanity. What has ended in Khartoum and eastern Sudan continues to rage, with even more intensity, elsewhere. The RSF may have lost its jewel in the crown, but the war is far from over.In the meantime, being in a position to count the losses, rather than be actively experiencing them, is the best one can ask for. And what losses they are, not just for its inhabitants, not just for Sudan, but for a world that has lost a beautiful, historic, storied city. Khartoum was taken apart and its pieces scattered across Sudan. What remains resides in the hearts of its people.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As a clan, we were old hands at trying to free Mandela, having done our fair share of marching and boycotting over the years, and this concert felt like the culmination of all that. There was a lot of excitement in the room: we squeezed on to the sofa and opened the windows wide. (If the wind’s blowing in the right direction, you can hear a Wembley audience roar from Willesden.)Many world-famous musicians played that day. Most of them I don’t remember, but one I will never forget: Tracy Chapman. I think a lot of people feel that way, though when you rewatch the footage you realise what she was up against at the time. Nobody cheers as she takes the stage. In fact, the crowd seem hardly aware she’s arrived. People are chanting, chatting or just partying among themselves.She looked like our mother: no make-up and the same three-inch dreadlocksDrafted in as replacement for Stevie Wonder – who had last-minute technical issues – it must have taken a lot of courage for an unknown 24-year-old to play in front of 90,000 people, not to mention a worldwide television audience of 600 million. And on the first line of Fast Car, her voice does break, a little. For a moment, you spy the Harvard Square busker she’d so recently been, demoralised by all the commuters and the students rushing by …But a second later, she has everybody’s full attention. Now there is only her guitar, the melody, the words.I want a ticket to anywhere / Maybe we make a deal / Maybe together we can get somewhere.It’s such an intimate, unexpected performance. Bombastic music was in style, and Wembley in particular was the home of spectacle and theatrics. Chapman was something completely different: a protest singer with an acoustic guitar. It’s wonderful to watch that mammoth crowd fall into an awed silence.Back in Willesden, we were pretty stunned too, although perhaps for different reasons. For us, it was the shock of the familiar. She was dressed just like the young activists you saw on the marches – black cowlneck T, black jeans, black boots – and she even looked like our mother: no makeup and the same three-inch dreadlocks. She was so … familiar. We also recognised the musical lineage. That rich alto timbre. It was like listening to the daughter ofJoan Armatrading.But what was such a person doing on television? That really felt unprecedented. And she didn’t just look like the people on our side of the screen, she was singing our songs. Songs of everyday struggle, working-class experience, poverty, drink, political protest, domestic troubles, thwarted dreams. She was talkin’ about a revolution. On the BBC!View image in fullscreen‘No fat, no filler’ … the debut albumIn 1988, we lived in a monoculture. By the end of that summer, it seemed like pretty much everyone who had any interest in music at all had made a pilgrimage to Woolworths or Our Price and bought her debut album, Tracy Chapman. By autumn, those 11 songs had buried themselves deep into so many people’s lives, affecting our political thinking, romantic dreams, existential beliefs, Top 10 lists. All because of that one performance.None of this was typical. Most artists of that period had juggernaut PR machines around them, but with Chapman the communication was singular and direct, from singer to eardrum, and nothing could get in the way of it, and nothing extra was needed to amplify it. For years after that concert, I don’t recall reading a single interview with her, and I don’t think I saw her perform again until she sang Fast Car with Luke Combs at the 2024 Grammys.For years, the only photograph I’d ever seen of her was the one on the front of that first album. Yet despite knowing next to nothing about her, I and millions of others have been listening to her for decades. When you write songs like Tracy Chapman does, you don’t really need to do anything else but that. Her debut is the articulation of this principle: 11 perfect songs, with no fat and no filler, driven by a clear unity of purpose that announces itself from the get-go and never lets up.View image in fullscreen‘A reclamation of unity’ … Chapman in Los Angeles, circa 1988.Photograph: Lester Cohen/Getty ImagesThis is an album about “the people”. They are addressed directly in Talkin’ Bout a Revolution, and kept in mind throughout: the labour they perform, their hopes and aspirations, the loves they’ve gained and lost, their mistakes and shames, even their crimes. Lyrically, they are known but never idealised. They are certainly the working poor but they are more than the “proletariat”. They are also human beings. Full of human contradictions. Sometimes, for example, they want “mountains of things” instead of freedom. Not infrequently they do dangerous or dumb things, or make poor decisions that make their already hard lives worse. Behind the wall, a man beats his wife. Love ennobles the people, as it ennobles everybody, but love also just as often gets disrupted or crushed by the pressing demands of sheer survival.What is never forgotten, not even for a line, is how the American game is rigged against them, at every turn. Working them half to death for the minimum wage, or creating division where solidarity is required:Across the lines/ Who would dare to go /Under the bridge/Over the tracks / That separate whites from blacks?Black women were soul- singers or pop stars. Folk was another country. But Chapman went across all these linesOne of the things that most moved me about this album was not only its challenge to the segregated politics of American life, but its reclamation of the unity of American music. Now thatBeyoncé can top the country chartsand we have musicians such as Rhiannon Giddens performing with equal expertise at the Newport folk and jazz festivals, it’s sometimes hard to remember how rigidly binary the American music business was in the 1980s and 90s. It was incredibly difficult back then to imagine a folk singer with a guitar existing outside of the paradigm set by Bob Dylan. Hip-hop could be and often was “protest music”, but black women were soul singers or pop stars. We could sing the blues and jazz, but folk was another country. Chapman went across all these lines, singing passionately about one country and the working people who live there, employing a stripped-down production that still feels profoundly radical.There’s never a good moment, I’d imagine, for a young artist to explain to their record label that they want to record an a cappella lament about domestic violence. But somehow, on Tracy Chapman, there it is: an unforgettable human voice, untampered by anything else, singing an excruciating truth.It won’t do no good to call / The police always come late / If they come at all.The poor people described in Tracy Chapman do not have all the answers, but they are hungry for truth. They don’t want to be lied to any more, not by politicians or employers or neighbours or lovers. The truths they want to hear are not particularly complex but they are essential. That’s the job of a protest singer, in my view: to remind technocrats and politicians and all those who hold power of the fundamental concerns of the people.Listening to the track Why? now, as this masterful album is rereleased, it’s astonishing how few answers we presently have to Chapman’s basic questions:Why do the babies starve? / There’s enough food to feed the world / Why when there are so many of us / Are there people still alone? // Why are the missiles called peacekeepers / When they’re aimed to kill? / Why is a woman still not safe / When she’s in her home?That simple, honest language is the tool of the protest singer. The Orwellian doublespeak that follows, meanwhile, is all too familiar, and continues to be employed at the highest levels of American power:Love is hate / War is peace / No is yes /We’re all free.Chapman’s sheer melodic beauty and committed, generous lyrics are a gift to her listeners. But I feel that her career – which started with this extraordinary album – has also served as a startling and humbling example to artists. She reminds us that an artist can pursue an individual course without being individualistic. That she can speak to many without necessarily speaking to the press. That there is such a thing as privacy, and that every human being has a right to it.Finally, and most vitally, that a soul is something worth holding on to. In fact, it’s pretty much all that you have.Tracy Chapman’s debut album is rereleased on vinyl on 4 AprilExplore more on these topicsMusicFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Reams of headlines have suggested that they have come from nowhere – yet the grassroots regional drama schools that trained them say this overlooks their hard work.To find undiscovered talent for the show, Adolescence’s casting director, Shaheen Baig, visited two northern drama schools that work with children from underrepresented and deprived communities.Baig recently posted on Instagram that she wanted to give a “special shoutout” tothe Drama MOBandArticulate Drama School and Agency, because: “There’s not enough praise for drama teachers up and down the country doing great community work with very little financial support or recognition.”Yet other reporting of the show’s breakout star, Owen Cooper, has emphasised the narrative that “Owen had ‘done nothing and came from nowhere’”, as though he had been spotted on the street, says theDramaMOB co-founder Esther Morgan.In reality, Cooper attended a weekly drama class at the Drama MOB inManchester.View image in fullscreen‘It simply isn’t true that he came from nowhere … Owen Cooper as Jamie Miller in Adolescence.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix“We have been frustrated with the narrative … this simply isn’t true,” says Morgan. “He was a drama student and represented by our casting agency. Owen was a fantastic actor when he started with us and we are incredibly proud to have provided Owen with the skills and training he has needed to enter the industry, audition-ready.”She feels this plays into the performing arts’ London-centric focus. “It’s not so much north/south but London/everywhere else. The north is underfunded and often ignored as a creative space.”The Drama MOB has provided training for more than 500 children a week in Manchester since it was established in 2013, including fully funded places to children who can’t afford drama training and free workshops for local primary schools.Morgan says that Baig approached the Drama MOB directly, and auditioned a number of boys for the lead role of Jamie.View image in fullscreenTina O’Brien (left) and Esther Morgan, co-founders of Drama MOB in Manchester.Photograph: Dom BrophyCoronation Street star Tina O’Brien, who co-founded the school, says Owen’s performance is “outstanding”, and reflects the school’s mission to train “the next generation of northern talent”.Adolescence has become the first streaming show to top the UK most-watched television charts since launching in early March, and has sparked a public conversation about the relationship between online “incel” culture and real-world harm.As a result, Netflix is making the series available to all secondary schools across the UK through Into Film+, with the healthy relationships charity Tender providing guidance and resources. Keir Starmer also met children’s mental health charities on Tuesday to discuss the issues raised in the series, such as social media misogyny and online safety.Baig also approached Articulate in Yorkshire, which has helped its students work in Hollywood as well as in the UK television industry. Like the Drama MOB, it offers scholarships for children who can’t afford classes, and says the majority of its students are from working-class backgrounds.Stacey Burrows, Articulate’s managing director, says her team has worked with Baig for years, including to cast students in shows such as theupcoming Peaky Blinders movieand theNetflix series Toxic Town.Baig’s team sent briefs for each character in April 2024 and the school suggested suitable children for many roles. The process spanned a couple of months and included self-taped auditions, Zoom recalls and in-person meetings, as well as a final chemistry read with other actors.View image in fullscreenStacey Burrows, managing director of Articulate Agency.Photograph: Lorne Campbell/GuzelianThe actors chosen include Amélie Pease, 18, who plays Jamie’s sister, Lisa; Fatima Bojang, 18, who plays Jade in episode two; and Austin Haynes, 16, who plays Fredo in episodes two and four.Burrows says it was an “absolute joy” to watch them in the show. “We were so thrilled with the final result of Adolescence – all three of our artists were shining brightly and it gives us a real sense of pride and accomplishment because we’re not just agents who book jobs, we are mentors and teachers, too. Those kids worked so unbelievably hard for those opportunities and they deserve all the praise they are getting,” she says.Stephen Graham: the ‘working-class, mixed-race kid’ who cares deeply about the workRead moreBut she agrees that some of the narrative around talent coming from “nowhere” was frustrating for schools like hers. “We have heard a lot from Stephen Graham that Owen came from ‘nothing’ or ‘nowhere’, which fits with the narrative they seemed to want at the outset. This has caused wide upset among many grassroots drama schools, helping working-class kids to break into the industry,” she says.“Not only that, but to disregard early training sends out the message that young people don’t need to work hard at their craft. It also risks preventing people going to grassroots training grounds and getting into the arts.”Another drama school, The Boury Academy in London, posted on Instagram that “to pretend he was simply discovered on the street is to erase the work of the very people who made that opportunity possible”.A spokesperson for Stephen Graham says that he has “simply been emphasising that Adolescence is Owen’s first professional acting credit in order to showcase what an amazing, raw and brave talent he is” and that he has previously mentioned his drama training.Burrows wants to see more recognition of how drama schools like hers have a “life-changing” impact on their students, from resilience to communication skills, and for this to fuel greater support. “Regional drama schools are crying out for funding,” she says.Articulate receives no funding from external sources and all scholarships are self-funded from its small profits, she says. Some children drop out because they can’t afford the bus fares, and she regularly drives students to auditions when they can’t pay for transport.“What we need is the support of actors like Stephen Graham, encouraging kids to come to drama schools like ours that are doing incredible things, and not dismissing them as coming from ‘nowhere’,” she says. “We need casting directors to keep coming to us to keep offering life-changing opportunities and we need huge directors like Shane Meadows and Clio Barnard to take the time to reach out, come and see us and see what our kids can do and how talented they truly are.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAdolescenceDramaDrama and danceArts in schoolsManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

Farewell Richard Chamberlain, TV eye-candy extraordinaireFrom vestment-ripper The Thorn Birds to the steamy Dr Kildare, the actor – who has died at 90 – was known for playing devastatingly attractive and unattainable menMark LawsonMon 31 Mar 2025 13.39 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 13.41 EDTShareRichard Chamberlain,who has died at 90, achieved exceptional television celebrity by playing devastatingly attractive men whose professions made them unavailable to women.In The Thorn Birds – a 1983 miniseries that achieved huge ratings for ABC in the US and BBC One in the UK – he was Ralph De Bricassart, a Catholic priest whose vow of celibacy is tested beyond breaking point over four decades by Meggie, a young woman whom he meets on an Australian sheep farm.Based on a 1977 bestseller by Colleen McCullough, the drama benefited from finding a way of making attraction dangerous again in a post-60s era of sexual freedom. Watched by almost 60% of the available American TV audience – an extraordinarily high score – it got 16 Emmy nominations, winning six. Unusually, its British TV premiere – on 8 January 1984, between ratings hits Hi-De-Hi! and That’s Life! – was given a standalone preview programme in the previous week. Comprising an interview with Chamberlain, it was a tribute to his fame and the international impact of The Thorn Birds.View image in fullscreenMaking attraction dangerous again … Richard Chamberlain with Rachel Ward in The Thorn Birds.Photograph: Warner Bros. Television/AllstarRepeated in 1988, the vestment-ripper became one of the most resonant TV memories for the Boomer generation. Chamberlain’s performance may have influenced the dashing celibate who became known as the “hot priest” in Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag.The Thorn Birds required Ralph to be irresistible to women and his casting reflected a previous triumph as TV eye-candy – in 191 episodes of the NBC medical drama Dr Kildare, from 1961 to 1966. For Chamberlain’s Dr James Kildare, who rose from intern to resident at the fictional Blair General hospital, the throbbing hearts he heard through his stethoscope were mainly caused by him, not cardiac conditions. Patients were as off-limits as Bricassart’s parishioners would be later, although publicity pictures showed Chamberlain flushing a syringe that may have been suggestive. While Kildare was a good enough doctor to have removed his own appendix when caught in an emergency without a surgeon, the point of the character was his looks.View image in fullscreenHeart-throbbing stuff … Chamberlain as Dr Kildare.Photograph: NBCUPHOTOBANK/Rex FeaturesChamberlain’s facility for acting out the tensions of forbidden love may have been helped by the fact that the actor playing these famous objects of female desire was gay, a fact he did not confirm until a 2003 memoir. Recounting a relationship with the actor-producer Martin Rabbett that endured across five decades until Rabbett’s death, the book also reflected on the psychological cost of passing as straight on and off screen, with one lie perpetuating another. The Thorn Birds, for example, led to his casting as the legendarily heterosexual Casanova.Some among younger generations of gay men may lament Chamberlain’s reticence about his sexuality, but there seems little doubt that lifelong honesty would have disqualified him from those career-making roles as Kildare and Bricassart at a time when, at least theoretical, sexual availability was seen as a crucial part of superstardom.The third standout TV role of Chamberlain’s career is overshadowed by different sensitivities. In the 1980 version of Shōgun, the actor was typically charismatic and dashing in a five-part adaptation of James Clavell’s novel about John Blackthorne, an English sailor captured by samurai and forced to adopt Japanese identity, butthe more culturally precise 2024 remakewill outrank it in TV history.A skilled enough actor to have played Hamlet to good notices on stage in England and on TV in the US, Chamberlain was at his best on television. His particular success in miniseries spoke to a rare ability to encourage viewers to come back night after night, week after week. His impact was shown by a steady flow of late-career cameos in shows including Nip/Tuck, Hustle and Will & Grace.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dignity began life during a holiday in Crete in 1985. I bought Sounds magazine at the airport. Morrissey was on the cover and the headline “Home thoughts from abroad” got me thinking about Glasgow. I was living in a tenement flat in Pollokshields, from where I’d see the cleansing department guys sweeping the road. So I started writing about a “worker for the council, has been 20 years” who dreamed of sailing away on a “ship called Dignity”.I made the boat a dinghy because it felt like something a cleaner might afford. The “Sunblest bag” mentioned was a reference to a popular make of bread, while “raki” was the local drink on that holiday. I softened the line “he takes no crap off nobody and dog shit off the gutter” to “litter” because we realised radio would never play it otherwise. At a time of mass unemployment, the song was more about what employment does for people: the dignity of labour.When we play Dignity live now, I hardly sing the first verse because the audience does itIt hung around on a cassette tape through various early lineups of the band, but once we started playing it as the settled band, it gelled. When we demoed it, a band had been in the studio the day before and had hired a piano. Our keyboard player Jim Prime was working in a bank, but I’ll always remember he said: “I’ll come in and play the piano before someone takes it away.” Then he came up with this brilliant cascading melody that alludes to Nick Lowe’s I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass, which brought the song to life. That demo got us our record deal. Then we recorded it with Jon Kelly, playing live in Air Studios in London. The wall of guitars at the end is a nod to Lloyd Cole and the Commotions’ Forest Fire, which I loved.I remember Jon asking: “Do you have any songs that appeal to 12 to 14-year-old girls? Because they’re the ones who buy singles.” I said: “No.” Dignity’s highest chart position was No 20, but it’s become a sort of folk song. It’s played at weddings, funerals. Dundee United play it when we win and I’ve met people who’ve told me, “I was a worker for the council for 20 years” – just like the guy in the song.Lorraine McIntosh, backing vocalsWhen I first heard Dignity, I was in the audience. It was 1986 and Deacon Blue were playing Queen Margaret Union in Glasgow. I wanted to join in. Ricky had asked me to sing on some demos but I was away on holiday so they used another backing vocalist. When I got back, they asked me to do some more demos and a gig. So I was in.Dignity was obviously a special song, but I was 21 or 22 and couldn’t relate to the lyrics. I’d not worked for the council for 20 years and didn’t need a dream because at that age I had everything ahead of me. However, at gigs I realised that people really related to it, so I picked out the bits that I felt the audience would want highlighting, to sing along with.We never do it at soundchecks except for once, at a gig in Glasgow after some council workers with shovels asked for itI sing more on Dignity live now than I do on the original record. When we recorded it, I was more interested in London’s brilliant cafes and sausage sandwiches down the road. I was an innocent abroad and when we stayed in the Columbia hotel there was a fantastic coming together of Deacon Blue, Prefab Sprout and Noddy Holder in the hotel bar.We did a second recording, with Bob Clearmountain, and Ricky did the new vocals in New York. There was so much re-recording and different videos because the record company were determined it would be a hit. Eventually it crawled into the charts, but then it took on a life of its own. When we play Dignity live now, I hardly sing the first verse because the audience are singing it. A while back, people asked if the lyric was “sail it up” or “set it up”. When Ricky said “sail”, I realised I’d been singing the wrong word for 30 years.Once, when we were soundchecking for a Hogmanay gig in Glasgow’s George Square, the ground was frozen and there were council workers with shovels working in front of the stage. One of them shouted: “Ricky, do Dignity!” But we never do it at a soundcheck. Ricky said: “Actually, I think we owe you one.” And we played Dignity for them.Deacon Blue’s new album, The Great Western Road, is out now.

Ahead of a major Tate show, we meet the shapeshifting artistMon 31 Mar 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 05.23 EDTShareWhen he was younger and his parents were out of the house, Ed Atkins used to sit on the landing and force himself to imagine all the ways they might die. “My thinking was that if Iimaginedit first, then it would be very unlikely to actually happen,” says the 42-year-old artist.Atkins’ parents didn’t succumb to any of the ways he had invented. But during the final year of his master’s course, his father, Philip, was diagnosed with cancer and died six months later, during Atkins’ degree show, in 2009. “It’s a huge thing, obviously, losing your father,” says the artist. “And it started to feed into what I was reading and was interested in. His death, and death generally, is in all of my work.”That fact may not be immediately apparent to those encountering Atkins’ work. He has spent the last two decades at the forefront of digital art, creating strange videos that are humorous, creepy – and likely to leave you feeling a little untethered. Atkins likes to inhabit CGI avatars and perform as them. In 2014’s Ribbons, he became a bare-chested, tattooed smoker known as Dave with a penchant for singing maudlin Randy Newman songs.View image in fullscreen‘A slightly unmoored feeling’ … Atkins’ avatar Dave, from Ribbons.Photograph: 2014 Ed Atkins/Courtesy of CABINET, London and Galerie Isabella Bortolozzi, BerlinIn Pianowork 2, from 2023, he took on the role of himself – albeit an uncanny valley version of himself. We watch the virtual Ed trying to pick out the notes of Klavierstück 2, an experimental composition by the Swiss musician Jürg Frey. His sighs, his facial hairs and his pained expressions all appear to be amplified. Atkins’ films are often interspersed with poetic soliloquies, cryptic subtitles and intrusive sounds – a burst of tinnitus here, someone farting there. They’re both moving and confusing.You’re not really supposed to “get” them, says Atkins. Even he can be unsure of what they mean. What he wants, instead, is to create certain emotional sensations within the viewer – “a slightly unmoored feeling”. And what could be more unmooring than grief?Note perfect: Ed Atkins’s daily Post-it drawings – in picturesRead moreAtkins’ career highlights are about to appear in a survey show atTate Britainin London. Alongside the digital works will be self-portraits, text pieces, embroideries and a series of Post-it notes he drew on for his daughter’s packed lunch boxes during the pandemic. There is also a new work that addresses his dad’s death more directly: a two-hour film in which the actor Toby Jones reads aloud the cancer diary Philip wrote during his final months.View image in fullscreen‘This is me’ … one of Atkins’ pandemic Post-its.Photograph: © the artist, courtesy of The TateIn the “beautifully written” journal, Philip discusses fellow patients on his ward, adjusts to life under the care of others and comes to the startling realisation that he had been loved, and that nothing could be more important. “A lot of weeping and truth,” is how Atkins describes it. “It’s a lot. But it’s also universal. Many people are going through that same thing. One of the last lines in the diary is, ‘When and how does one begin to think about dying?’ That’s literally days before he dies. You can never come to terms with it.”People at the very end of life can experience extraordinary clarity. In his final TV interview before he died of pancreatic cancer, the writer Dennis Potter talked about witnessing the “blossomest blossom”. Atkins hopes he can attain such wisdom before he’s dying himself. Perhaps having someone read the diary out loud is an attempt to get there.We meet in Tate Britain’s auditorium, a week before the show opens. Atkins – who’s wearing a trenchcoat, pinstripe shirt, Adidas three-stripe joggers and a gold hoop in each ear – is extremely affable. But he tends to respond to questions with ideas rather than answers. Talking to him can be like experiencing his art: easy resolutions remain forever out of your grasp.Having a kid is like suddenly your heart is living outside your body. It’s the most vulnerable thingAnother way to get to know Atkins is to read his new memoir, Flower. Be warned, however: it is unlike any memoir you’ve read before – 89 pages long and written as one long paragraph of observations, it reveals its author through a series of likes, anxieties, routines and what he calls “sexless kinks”. Among other peculiar facts, we learn that Atkins has an inordinately strong bladder, enjoys eating wraps from pharmacies and has a failsafe method for stealing expensive wine from big shops.It can feel thrillingly intimate and honest, even though it is patently absurd. “Nobody talks about having a strong bladder in their autobiography,” laughs Atkins. “Not unless their bladder exploded or something. What an insane place to try to find truth! So I was interested in what people qualify as worth telling.”For someone who has long operated behind avatars and technology, Atkins admits that putting this book out there is unnerving, especially as, buried within the stream of mundane information, are morsels of shocking revelation – not least his disordered relationship with food and his hatred of his physical appearance. “It’s hard to say out loud,” he says, tentatively, “but I don’t like my body or the way I look at all. I think about it too much. Some of that is an inheritance, I think, from family stuff.”View image in fullscreenCopenhagen #6, 2023, by Ed Atkins.Photograph: Mark Blower/© Ed Atkins. Courtesy: the Artist and Cabinet Gallery, London.Was it a struggle to make the self-portraits (his head rendered in red pencil on yellow legal paper, say) that appear in the show? No, he replies. “What’s hard is leaving the hotel this morning. It’s got an annoying array of mirrors, so I’m seeing angles of myself where I’m bulging in ways that are just awful. Whereas fastidious attention, trying to capture a bit of razor burn on the cheek, that’s really exciting.” He pauses. “They’re going to do photos for this piece in a minute and I will not look at them. I will never look at them.”One thing that does come through in Flower is Atkins’ utter adoration for his children (he has a daughter and a son). It’s a love so strong not even the memoir’s deliberately monotonous and flat tone can mask it. “A received wisdom is that having children is maybe the end of something,” Atkins says, “but my best work has all been made since I had children.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His mum taught art and his dad was a graphic artist, so it’s unsurprising that he displayed a gift for drawing and painting. “All artists start out because they’re good at drawing,” he says, “and then art school unmoors everything. It takes a long time to get back, if you ever do, to that point of pleasure.”He says having kids helped him get there: “I love how every gesture that my daughter or son makes on a piece of paper is better than most art, just by dint of its complete freedom.” That’s why the 700-odd Post-it notes he drew on for his daughter during lockdown have ended up forming the centrepiece of the show. He never intended these cartoonish missives to go on display, but then he realised: “It’s the thing I can really hang my hat on and say, ‘This is me.’”Shortly before this interview, Atkins found himself crying after showing a curator a shot of his son on his phone. Photographs do that to him. “Maybe this is at the core of some [of the work], the sense of representations being grotesque in relation to the real thing – in relation to a living, beautiful two-year-old.”In Flower, he describes the images he keeps on his phone as pictures of his “dead children” – a bracing description, given they are very much alive. He says he used that term because looking at flat images of them, when they’re not around, makes him spin out. “My brain immediately reaches for this horrible morbidity: what if they’re dead? Even the presence of a phone in my pocket makes me worry it’s about to ring with some news. It’s sort of ridiculous. And it’s not a way to live!” He laughs, then adds: “Having a kid is like suddenly your heart is living outside your body and it’s the most vulnerable thing, you know?”View image in fullscreen‘That was difficult for me’ … The Worm, 2021, by Ed Atkins.Photograph: © Ed Atkins. Courtesy of the Artist, Cabinet Gallery, London, dépendance, Brussels, Galerie Isabella Bortolozzi, Berlin, and Gladstone Gallery.I do. I tell him I’m also prone to morbid thoughts – that sometimes I will look at a photomontage that my phone has generated featuring my kids and feel as if I’m watching it after they’ve died. Atkins nods. “The mechanisms used, such as the slow cross-fading and the nostalgic music, is the language of remembrance. It’s an ‘Oscars in memoriam’ situation. It’s charged with loss even if no loss exists.”There’s something very Ed Atkins about this whole conversation: two men who’ve just met, sitting in an auditorium talking about their deepest anxieties. I can’t tell if it’s his manner or something about his work, but Atkins is an easy person to open up to. In fact, it reminds me of one of his most affecting works: The Worm, from 2021, in which we hear a real-life conversation between the artist and his mother.I say real-life although, in the video, Atkins is inhabiting the avatar of a sharply dressed chatshow host from a bygone era, smoking Silk Cut. During their conversation, Atkins’ mother talks about her struggles with depression and how it also affected her own mother. She reveals that she’s never really felt like a “bona fide woman” and adds that Atkins’ father was never comfortable with the way he looked either. It’s delicate stuff: raw and tender.“That was difficult for me,” laughs the artist, referring to the process of making the video, “because I was wearing a Lycra onesie and there were two German men in the room next door listening in.” The piece raises all sorts of questions about emotional inheritance, human connection and what constitutes a life.This, really, is the heart of what Atkins does. When he started out, Atkins was often called upon as a spokesperson for digital art – and he was happy to oblige, aware that it provided opportunities to show his work. But the emotional side of what he did was often not at the forefront of these discussions. “The truth is, technology in and of itself is not interesting to me,” he says. “I don’t actually care at all about computers. Which is tricky because people are always asking, ‘What do you think about AI?’ And, honestly, I don’t think about it.”Atkins actually believes that, for all the giant leaps being made right now, technology will never come close to replicating what it means to be human. “It sounds almost religious,” he says, “but I don’t think any machine, even in a million years, will be like the real thing. It will never be a person. That’s really my faith.”Ed Atkins is at Tate Britain, London, 2 April to 25 August.Floweris published by Fitzcarraldo Editions.Explore more on these topicsArtTate BritainExhibitionsVideo artDrawinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

Of course Bond was born of reactionary attitudes and only a bore would point out what the DBE stands for in Mirren’s title. If you doubt the truth of what she says, watch the cringeworthy moment in Goldfinger when Sean Connery’s Bond dismisses his poolside masseuse Dink (played by Margaret Nolan) because he needs to discuss important stuff with Felix Leiter, and as Dink obediently leaves he slaps her behind and says: “Man talk …” Obnoxious.Perhaps a further and even more uncomfortable point is that the Andrew Tate/JD Vance contingent would broadly agree with Dame Helen: yes, the wokery of casting a woman as 007 is unthinkable for precisely the reasons she says but on which they have different views – and, incidentally, the female-casting topic is a clickbait talking-point never seriously considered by anyone in any relevant position of authority at any time. Jeff Bezos (himself a stereotypical Bond villain) may countenance all sorts of product variations, perhaps even continuing to have a female agent with the notional “007” rating. ButJames Bondwill be a separate bloke.View image in fullscreenCringeworthy … Margaret Nolan as Dink with Sean Connery’s Bond in Goldfinger.Photograph: Danjaq/Eon/Ua/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockHelen Mirren’s denunciation of Bond is part of a long-standing exasperation which began with Paul Johnson who in 1958 famously denounced the Ian Fleming books in which 007 displayed “the sadism of a schoolboy bully, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a frustrated adolescent, and the crude snob cravings of a suburban adult”. As the movie franchise has developed, it is of course the second of these three qualities which has taken over; the movie Bond has not been sadist or a snob for many decades – but his sex-obsession and his status as an object of sex-obsession, has grown and metastasised. Everything around him is sexy: cars, luxury watches, weapons, explosions, women. And as Nigel Tufnel says in This Is Spinal Tap: what’s wrong with being sexy?But there is something else to be noticed in what Dame Helen says: she uses the antique term “sexism” and not “misogyny” which has long since supplanted “sexism” in the discourse. Maybe it is a generational thing. But in fact Helen Mirren is using her words correctly: “sexism” and “misogyny” are not interchangeable: however antediluvian most have been in their attitudes, the Bond films do not encourage hatred of women, at least partly because of the comedy and absurdity, and thecase has been madefor a sex-positive reassessment.View image in fullscreenVin Diesel and Helen Mirren in Fast 8.Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarAnd of course now the Bond franchise has evolved away (a little) from the quaint ladmag archetypes. For a while, M was a woman, in the form of Dame Judi Dench. In No Time to Die, Lashana Lynch played the separate “007” agent — tough, capable and derisive of the ageing Bond, in a film co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.But what the Bond films need is the most progressive innovation of all: not a female Bond but a female Bond villain. We have had figures such as Elektra King played by Sophie Marceau in The World Is Not Enough – but they have never really had the clear status of alpha-villain. For the next Bond film we need a lethally powerful and charismatic woman with a prestigious acting pedigree to play the antagonist, someone who has, say, played the MI6 assassin Vicky Winslow in the macho action comedy Red, and the criminal matriarch Queenie Shaw in the (equally macho) Fast and Furious franchise spinoff Hobbs & Shaw. The next 007 film will be a hit if they can persuade Mirren to be the villain. And the new Bond would certainly have to raise his game.Explore more on these topicsJames BondHelen MirrenGendercommentShareReuse this content"

And she’s not the only oneKaty HesselMon 31 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 03.13 EDTShareWhen you think of the Bloomsbury Group – the writers, artists and intellectuals who congregated at 46 Gordon Square in London in the early 20th century – you might think of Virginia Woolf; the Omega Workshops, which brought fine art to modernist designs;Charleston, a farmhouse in Sussex, frequented by core members who painted every available surface in blazing hues; or the famous phrase about their unorthodox sex lives – they “painted in circles and loved in triangles”.View image in fullscreenBell, circa 1910.Photograph: George C Beresford/Getty ImagesBut do you ever think – or know much – about a woman at the heart of the group, Vanessa Bell, sister of Virginia and co-director of the Omega Workshops? If Bloomsbury member John Maynard Keynes was the economics pioneer, and Woolf its literary star, then Bell was the painter equivalent. Yet it seems Bell has too often been overshadowed by her contemporaries, or pigeonholed by her domestically scaled work. No longer.A new exhibition at Charleston’s gallery spaces in nearby Lewesbrings together the largest number of Bell works in history, 136 in total.Born in 1879 to a wealthy bourgeois family, Bell was raised as a Victorian woman when opportunities for those of her gender were scarce. Whereas her two younger brothers attended school and university, Bell and Woolf were educated in the home. Always creating – Bell once recalled: “I cannot remember a time when Virginia did not mean to be a writer and I a painter” – they made the most out of what they had. As children, they illustrated and wrote the newspaper,Hyde Park Gate News, about everyday family events.But her early life also was full of sadness. In 1895, their mother died, leaving Bell’s older stepsister, Stella, tasked with looking after their “emotionally brutal” father (as described by Wendy Hitchmough, in a new biography). Two years later, Stella died, leaving Vanessa – who had been thriving at the Royal Academy (a refuge from the stifling family home) – to take up a maternal role for her siblings and father, before his death in 1904. The four orphans swapped Hyde Park Gate for Gordon Square and – now free to do as they wish – organised intellectual and artistic discussions (spearheaded by Bell), which pushed Victorian London into a realm of modernist thinking. The Bloomsbury Group was born.View image in fullscreenA gateway to modernism … The Coffee Pot, c 1917.Photograph: © Estate of Vanessa Bell. All rights reserved, DACS 2024They organised the first exhibition of the Parisian post-impressionist painters to show in London in 1910. Bell was also the first British collector to buy a work by Picasso. Hugely influenced, she also turned to working in abstract forms, as one of the first artists in Britain to do so. Bear in mind, she was now a mother to two young children, too.Nothing stopped her. As demonstrated by this exhibition, Bell was continuously, as curator Darren Clarke says, “looking at what’s next rather than what’s past”. From reworking renaissance or Byzantine art through a modernist lens, to never limiting herself to one medium, form, language, or lover, she painted on fans, shelves, books and, from 1916, her entire house at Charleston. Bell thus forged a modernist language that set the tone for modern British art, and modern British living.A great moment in the show is Bell’s painting Tea Things, of a Victorian porcelain tea set, from 1919. It might not sound radical but, for me, it sums her up: a bridge between two worlds (a modernist take on a traditional object). Both in her life and art Bell was a gateway to modernism. So it is interesting that many works are views through windows and doors, or actual painted doors. As if to show the old and new world as two different spaces within one image, it seems Bell used painting as a threshold, and she was the conduit between them.View image in fullscreenNo surface left unpainted … a screen at Charleston.Photograph: CharlestonAs a modern woman who didn’t live according to the conventions into which she was born, she also had a huge influence on her more celebrated sister. One has to remember, Bell was experimenting with modernism in the early 1910s, whereas Woolf established her style in the mid-1920s.It is thrilling to see an exhibition that puts Bell front and centre – and there is more of this sort of thing to look forward to. Major exhibitions in 2026 will be showcasing artists who were once overshadowed by their more famous male counterparts, ridiculed by the press and not taken seriously for their addressing of female-heavy narratives or not working on “grand” scales. FromFrida Kahlo,Ana MendietaandTracey Eminat Tate Modern, to Rose Wylie at the Royal Academy of Arts (the first ever female painter to show in the main galleries in an institution founded in 1768). All this programming leads me to ask: are we finally reaching a turning point in celebrating great artists who just happen to be women?The last decade has seen exhibitions of work by Lee Krasner, Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, Carolee Schneemann and Lubaina Himid. And this June,Jenny Savillewill be filling the National Portrait Gallery. It seems that major female solo shows are no longer anomalies, but fully fledged headliners. Let’s hope it stays this way – celebrating all genders for their greatness and differences, and as the central figure rather than on the side.Explore more on these topicsArt and designThe great women's art bulletinPaintingArtBloomsbury groupVanessa BellWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)featuresShareReuse this content"

Kennedy’s murder has been attributed to lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald.Stone’s 1991 film JFK faced harsh criticism from historians for its suggestions that Kennedy’s death was the result of high-level conspiracies. Stone has said Kennedy was not killed by a single assassin and believes certain elements within the US intelligence community were involved.The Justice Department and other federal government bodies have reaffirmed the conclusion in the intervening decades that Oswald acted alone. But polls show many Americans still believe his death was the result of a conspiracy.Also testifying on Tuesday are journalist and author Jefferson Morley and author James DiEugenio. Morley said on social media he will focus on the CIA’s complete pre-assassination file on Oswald during the hearing.Trump promised on the campaign trail to provide more transparency about Kennedy’s death.Explore more on these topicsFilmOliver StoneJohn F KennedyHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Only 15 black women have ever been in contention for the prize.Speaking on upcoming documentary Number One on the Call Sheet, Berry said that the 23 years since her victory have “forced me to ask myself, did it matter? Did it really change anything for women of colour? For my sisters? For our journey?”Number One on the Call Sheet review – a spectacular tribute to black excellence in HollywoodRead moreBerry adds that she felt the tide would turn in 2021, when both Andra Day and Viola Davis were nominated, for The United States vs Billie Holiday and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom respectively.“I felt 100% sure that this was the year one of them was gonna walk away with this award,” she says, adding: “For equally different and beautiful reasons, they both deserved it, and I thought for sure.”However, both women losing out to Frances McDormand for Nomadland made Berry reconsider, she said.“The system is not really designed for us, and so we have to stop coveting that which is not for us.

And by using pirated material,Metaare stealing from us twice over. I don’t think it’s at all surprising that we’re outraged.”Earlier this year, acourt filingalleged that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergapproved the company’s useof a notorious “shadow library”, LibGen, which contains more than 7.5 million books. On 20 March, the Atlantic republished asearchable databaseof the titles contained in LibGen, through which many authors discovered that their works may have been used to train Meta’s AI models without their permission.The letter claims this is a “clear infringement” of copyright law. “There can be no question that the scraping of authors’ works for the purpose of generative AI training is unlawful in the UK, yet tech giants like Meta are operating in the UK without sufficient enquiry being made into their practices,” it reads. “Authors are almost powerless given the enormous cost and complexities of pursuing litigation against corporate defendants with such deep pockets.”For writers, “and all those who make a living by their hard work, originality and imagination, this is another David and Goliath moment,” said Mosse on why she signed the letter. “Copyright exists, the terms and licensing provisions are robust, the law is clear. This is theft on a large scale and it must stop. Fair is fair.”The statement, written by the Society of Authors (SoA), was published on Change.org in the form of a petition, and has since garnered nearly 5,000 signatures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But more than a telling off, he needs a face-offSian CainSun 30 Mar 2025 20.05 EDTLast modified on Mon 31 Mar 2025 09.57 EDTShareHelen Mirren has said that James Bond should never be played by a woman, as the spy franchise is “born out of profound sexism”.The future of 007 is currently up in the air, after Amazon MGM Studiosstruck a $1bn (£770m) deal for creative controlover the character with Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, the British-American heirs to the film producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli and longtime stewards of the Bond films.Yes, Helen Mirren, James Bond is profoundly sexist. But more than a telling off, he needs a face-offRead moreSpeaking about her MobLand co-star and former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, Mirren said that though she was a “massive fan” of Pierce, Bond was “not [her] thing” due to its portrayal of women.“I have to say I was never a great ward [of Bond],”Mirren told the Standard. “I’m a huge fan of Pierce Brosnan, I mean massive fan. I mean, oh my God. Obviously, he’s gorgeous and everything, and I think he’s fabulous in MobLand, but he also happens to be one of the nicest people you’ll ever have the pleasure to work with. And indeed Daniel Craig, who I’ve met and know a little bit, again – a very lovely, gracious person.”But she added: “The whole series ofJames Bond, it was not my thing. It really wasn’t. I never liked James Bond. I never liked the way women were in James Bond.”She told the Standard that she was opposed to the idea of addressing the spy’s historic sexism by casting a woman in the lead role, and that she believed that women would be better served by portrayals of real female spies.“The whole concept of James Bond is drenched and born out of profound sexism,” she said. “Women have always been a major and incredibly important part of the Secret Service, they always have been. And very brave. If you hear about what women did in the French Resistance, they’re amazingly, unbelievably courageous. So I would tell real stories about extraordinary women who’ve worked in that world.”Amazon confirms producers to steer next James Bond film: ‘greatest sense of responsibility’Read moreIn the wake of the Amazon deal, much of the concern among former Bonds has not been over his future gender but his nationality.Brosnan had previously said it was a “given”that Bond should remain a British character despite now having American owners, whileTimothy Dalton said the deal had left him “kind of sad”, adding: “It is one of the few wonderful stories we’ve got in film that is British.”With creative control, Amazon will have the power to move forward with new films and potentially spin-offs without approval from Wilson and Broccoli, who have overseen the integrity of the character originally created in 1953 by the author Ian Fleming.There have reportedly been fierce rows over 007’s future, withBroccoli branding Amazon executives “fucking idiots”, according to the Wall Street Journal, over ideas to expand the franchise with spin-offs and a TV series.James Bond nightclubs, vodka, aftershave: 007 writer on the spy’s future with AmazonRead moreWilson has said he and Broccoli had been “very reluctant to delegate” the intellectual property to a television series, with Broccoli adding: “It’s not something we’ve ever wanted to do.”While there is no script, director or lead actor in place for a new Bond film, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James and James Norton are currently all favourites for the role.Mail Online reported a source from Amazonhad said the actor “has to be British or from the Commonwealth – and he has to be male”.Explore more on these topicsJames BondHelen MirrennewsShareReuse this content"

A work of often startling originality, it was hugely admired in its day and still hovers on the fringes of the repertory in the French-speaking world. Elsewhere, however, its outings have been sporadic, soChelsea Opera Groupcannot be too highly commended for tackling it in a very fine concert performance conducted by Paul Wingfield.The opera derives from theBreton legend of the city of Ysthat vanished, Atlantis-like, beneath the ocean. The king of the title, however, is not its central protagonist, and Lalo focuses on his two daughters, gracious Rozenn and imperious Margared, both in love with the soldier Mylio, initially believed a casualty of the recent war between Ys and the forces of the enemy prince Karnac. A pawn in her father’s politics, Margared is to marry Karnac as part of their peace treaty. But her refusal to do so on discovering that Mylio is both alive and loves Rozenn, leads first to the resumption of hostilities, then to her conspiring with Karnac to open the floodgates that protect the city from the sea.The work has often been dubbed Wagnerian, in part thanks to its dark, brass rich orchestral colouring and the echoes of Elsa and Ortrud in Lohengrin that inform Lalo’s depiction of the relationship between Rozenn and Margared. Yet the description is also in many ways wide of the mark as Lalo’s absolute conciseness of expression and avoidance of symphonic development are the antithesis of Wagnerian expansion. Reiterated rhythmic patterns, at times turning obsessive, drive the music forwards. The choruses, extensive and exacting, oscillate between ritual and violence. And the extraordinary vocal writing for Margared, clipped, neurotic and declamatory, fatally undermines the lyricism of all those round her.The performance was thrilling. Wingfield drove the score hard, its moments of edgy nervousness and the disturbing excitement of Lalo’s war music contrasting with the beauty of the love scenes between Mylio and Rozenn. Choral singing and playing were characterised by furious energy and commitment. Etching words and phrases in her lower register, Maria Schellenberg’s Margared was all hauteur and barely repressed rage. Rozenn has sometimes been depicted as gentle and timid, though Hye-Youn Lee portrays her as a woman of great moral certainty and strength. This is a beautiful voice, too. Mylio’s music lies high and Luis Gomes, though admirably heroic and lyrical, had a couple of moments of strain towards the end. Alexey Gusev, on the other hand, made a terrific Karnac, deeply attractive yet implacably malign. Thomas D Hopkinson was the dignified king. ChelseaOperaGroup at their best – and we need to hear the work itself much more frequently than we do.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hart’s direction is strong, but it’s better than his script; for me the movie, having established its realist credentials, is let down by a completely unreal and silly ending.Nicky, played by Lyndsey Marshal, is a hard-working agency nurse who is all alone, a single mum to a son away at uni. She lives a lonely but reasonably content life, listening to classical music, doing yoga and vaguely dating a clueless but nice man called Kevin, played by Barry Ward. But all this is utterly destroyed when a lairy and aggressive guy moves into the property next door and has loud parties with his mates every night until four in the morning; this is the unspeakable Deano (Aston McAuley), who responds with hostile contempt to Nicky’s timidly polite requests to turn the music down – along with some belligerent self-pity: “I’ve had a tough couple of years with my mental health.”Things escalate from there and Nicky discovers that the police won’t help because it’s a matter for the council, who themselves have very limited power to intervene, and other neighbours can’t or won’t get involved as the noise doesn’t affect them. This is a horror-film situation that really does happen in real life, and Hart certainly gives a sense of how it oppresses the victim but the wish-fulfilment finale, involving a very convenient discovery, is just too glib. Still, Hart’s direction is fluent and confident.Restless is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

Two Jewish lawyers who got out early were instrumental in creating the legal concepts of crimes against humanity and genocide that were introducedat the Nuremberg trials.His follow-upThe Ratlinewas focused on the Nazi Brigadefuhrer Otto von Wachter who died in mysterious circumstances in Rome after the war while trying to escape to South America. It is a haunting story of the feats of denial that enable otherwise “normal” people to perform or excuse the very worst deeds.38 Londres Streetfollows the Nazis metastasis to its sordid death throes in Chile, the fascist safe haven Wachter failed to reach. Here we meet Walther Rauff, a former SS commander who played a key role in the development of mobile gas chambers and was directly responsible for the deaths of more than 90,000 Jews.The title of the book refers to a building in Santiago that was turned into an interrogation and torture centre by Pinochet’s secret policeHaving escaped from an Italian internment camp, he settles first in Syria, where he helps reorganise the country’s intelligence service, before being recruited by an Israeli intelligence officer as a Syrian informant – the Israeli was unaware of Rauff’s past and, presumably, his unabashed and lifelong antisemitism.After a brief return to Rome, he heads for Ecuador, where he meets a Chilean officer namedAugusto Pinochet, before taking his new friend’s advice and relocating to Chile. The book intertwines Rauff’s shadowy existence with Pinochet’s rise to dictatorial power, and examines the rumour that Rauff participated in the torture and disappearances that characterised Pinochet’s rule.An epistemological problem bedevils any effort to summarise Nazi war crimes, and even those of their Chilean imitators, insofar as their scale and sadism defies understanding. But one of Sands’s strengths as a writer is that he resists the impulse to demonise. He can find signs of humanity in the most unpromising cases, which serves, paradoxically, not to mitigate but to aggravate their crimes. These perpetrators of monstrous acts did not always take the form of monsters: both Pinochet and Rauff are described in avuncular terms by some who met them.The one time Sands’s rational composure deserts him is when he stays overnight at Colonia Dignidad, aGerman colonyset up by a depraved paedophile called Paul Schäfer, a crony of Pinochet who enthusiastically hosted and partook in the torture and murder of the regime’s opponents. Sands barricades himself in his room with chairs and is relieved to leave the “grotesque” site of so much horror.Running through the book is the unprecedented case, eight years after the end of his presidency, of Pinochet’sarrest in Londonin 1998 on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. While Pinochet remained under house arrest for almost 18 months in the comfortable surroundings of the Wentworth estate, Sands advised the prosecution in his role as a human rights lawyer.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators outside Belmarsh magistrates court in London, 11 December 1998, where Augusto Pinochet appeared to face extradition to Spain.Photograph: Toby Melville/PAThe legal principles and political manoeuvring that led to the granting of the old tyrant’s extradition to stand trial in Spain, a series of appeals, and finally his repatriation to Chile on dubious health grounds are not without interest but are told in rather too much detail. Sands the lawyer may havefelt a professional obligation to do justice to the complexity of the wrangling, but the effect is to slow the momentum of the narrative.By contrast the book comes vividly to life in Chile, where Sands methodically follows the various strands of Pinochet’s and Rauff’s separate histories to expose their cynical claims of innocence – Rauff stuck to the familiar line that he was only a soldier following orders, while Pinochet affected ignorance of the atrocities committed by his subordinates in what he insisted was an existential fight against communism.The title of the book refers to a building in downtown Santiago that once housed the Socialist party but was turned into an interrogation and torture centre by Pinochet’s secret police, the DINA. There is hearsay that Rauff had some link to Londres Street, but Sands encounters shut doors, closed mouths and missing documents before eventually establishing the disturbing facts.As with the previous two books, a personal motivation helps propel the author’s inquiry. In this instance Rauff almost certainly extinguished the life of one of Sands’s (then young) relations in eastern Europe, and there is also the plight of Carmelo Soria, a Spanish UN employee brutally tortured and murdered in 1976 who was distantly related to Sands’s wife.These connections are not used for emotional purposes but as a means of establishing the victims as real people, with lives and family, who were killed in their thousands because of their leftwing sympathies. Part of a South America-wide and US-backed campaign, known asOperation Condor, this reign of terror aimed to crush all opposition to the continent’s rightwing dictatorships.There were those in the Tory party, such as Norman Lamont and Margaret Thatcher, who visited Pinochet in Wentworth, who preferred to see him as a misunderstood cold warrior, despite ample evidence that he was personally involved in the selection of the victims and approved the brutal methods employed to extract information. Moreover, for all his posturing as a patriot, he stashed away in foreign bank accounts many millions of dollars that he had stolen from Chile.But what of Rauff? He lived for much of his time at the country’s southern extreme in Patagonia, working as the manager of a crab-canning factory. He won protection from extradition in a landmark case, put together by a Jewish lawyer, and yet managed to slip back to West Germany for a visit in the early 1960s.Myths enshrouded this odd character in his isolated cottage with his resolutely bad Spanish. Both Bruce Chatwin and Roberto Bolaño referred to him in their work, though neither was able to create a picture quite as damning as Sands achieves with his understated doggedness.He writes of the impunity with which the old Nazi and Pinochet acted but also the immunity they managed to attain from laws they otherwise held in contempt. They may have avoided justice, but thanks to the courageous testaments of survivors and perpetrators alike, not to mention Sands’s own commendable efforts, they could not escape the truth.38 Londres Street: On Impunity, Pinochet in England and a Nazi in Patagoniaby Philippe Sands is published by W&N (£25).

But even amid fear and funding cuts, it remainsimpossible to imagine postwar classical music without him. There is, in theory, a Boulez for everyone: revelatory conductor, director of a majorFrench research institute,rhetorical troublemaker– “blow up the opera houses,” he famously suggested – and, of course, composer ofintricate, horizon-shifting scores.Boulez’s own music was centre-stage for the BBC Symphony Orchestra’s latest total immersion day, the audience modest but passionate. (“To start, find 200 fanatics,” he once urged on the question of engaging people with new music.) The closing concert crackled abruptly into life, the first of his Deux Études – Musique Concrète for Tape griping and whirring from overhead speakers with the stage still empty. In the second, semi-recognisable pitches rush past in flurries, all attack and ending. More than 70 years since Boulez created them, such sounds remain refreshingly alien.PianistTamara Stefanovich’s back-to-back performances of 12 Notations and Incises should be required listening for anyone still concerned about the “mathematical” qualities of Boulez’s music. Yes, she captured minute details, her tone utterly lucid. Her hands executed their own mesmerising ballet, while her pedalling was impossibly subtle. But it was the performance’s overwhelming musicality that made it unforgettable: Stefanovich’s absolute sense of line and direction, with melodic riffs clicking into a groove and complex textures gifted perspective.The rest of the programme struggled to reach that high bar. Under Martyn Brabbins,BBC Singerswere fearless (and armed with tuning forks) in Cummings ist der Dichter, but the orchestral texture lacked shape and drive. Pli Selon Pli – Boulez’s largest work – suffered similar problems. Soprano Anna Dennis provided a much-needed focal point and real communicative urgency, her upper register slicing laser-like through its instrumental surrounds. But too many of the orchestral passages felt like a battle with the barline: the challenges of simply keeping up, keeping together and getting the notes right left too little space for enchantment, never mind the momentum and musicality of the bigger picture.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanPierre BoulezBBC Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

Despite one or two sweet touches and game performances, it never comes close to matching the gentleness, subtlety and charm of the original.The action is transferred from Rome to Dublin and the gay theme perhaps effectively replaces the importance of food in the Italian film. James McArdle is Edward, a YA author and gay man on the verge of major literary stardom, for which an upcoming US publicity tour is vitally important. But he has to take care of his widowed mum Alma (Fionnula Flanagan) who cannot speak after suffering a stroke, and there is some droll comedy with the Stephen Hawking voice enunciating her crisp commands from her iPad.‘Just wait until Trump takes away our unions’: Fionnula Flanagan on America, Ireland and acting silentRead moreAnd then Edward’s three gay male friends (he appears to have no female friends, gay or straight), dump their elderly mums on him because they all want to head off for a dissolute Pride weekend abroad; they are Maude (Stella McCusker), Jean (Dearbhla Molloy) and Rosie (Paddy Glynn). And so Edward, decent guy that he is, does his best to look after these formidably opinionated and difficult four ladies while dealing with his own private heartbreak and issues with anxiety, as well as his unresolved anger about his late father. There are moments when it comes to life and there’s a nice cameo for Niamh Cusack, but for me, the film is at once bland and cartoony.Four Mothers is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsOlder peopleLGBTQ+ rightsComedyIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

Scurrying on to screens months behind the similarly motivatedThe Mouse Trap, Steven LaMorte’s bloody pastiche opens with a quote coyly ascribed to “Walt D” before plodding mirthlessly in the pawprints of those recentWinnie-the-Pooh carve-ups, demonstrating no greater brio, invention or wit. Its mock Mickey is a genetically modified super-violent pipsqueak (played by Terrifier breakout star David Howard Thornton, in mangy rodent costume), let loose from the sewers by blundering engineers; rather than the jaunty steamboat his predecessor commandeered, he wreaks murderous havoc on a grimy approximation of the Staten Island ferry, whistling while he works.The whole never recovers from its leaden opening half-hour, devoted to lugging potential corpses onboard leaving us to wonder who, if anyone, will survive the lacklustre carnage. (Hopes are lowered like a flag for the airheaded bachelorette party.) LaMorte notionally expands the scope of his non-satirical attack by having the critter’s victims mouth familiar Magic Kingdom phrases. “Can you feel the love tonight?” says one topless passenger, shortly before being hosed down with gore. One point in favour of these cheap-and-cheerless cash-ins: in an era of dead-eyed data scraping, they may yet radicalise a generation of sleepover attenders to pursue ways of toughening up copyright law.Arterial spray fans won’t feel short-changed, but many of the kill scenes are torpedoed by poor lighting, clumsy-to-inept camera coverage and cutting, and effects that only erratically match the action. Amid a number ofSharknado-level performances, and accidentally serving the public by muffling dialogue that wasn’t exactly sparkling to begin with, Thornton gives his Mickey a certain bouncy malevolence – but we get the idea after only a few minutes of watching the actor tap dance on a pop culture grave. These tacky novelty films have been unlucky to land at a moment when mainstream horror has seriously raised its game, but something as cut-price, retrograde and reactionary as this really does deserve the damning label of Mickey Mouse fare.Screamboat is out in US and UK cinemas on 2 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fitzgerald’s tale of obscure origins, extreme wealth and obsessional romantic desire appeared too unlikely, too contrived and, perhaps, too uncomfortable a reminder of class and financial inequality and its consequent social schisms to be recognised for what it was: a masterly exploration of delusion, self-delusion, myth-making and complicity.Fitzgerald himself died 15 years after its publication believing it to have been a worldly failure and unconsoled by any hint of its future cultural ubiquity. But literature, as we know, is studded with these anomalies, burials and rebirths and now, in an age of recycling and rebooting, it seems perfectly natural, if ironic, forThe Great Gatsbyto spawn a number of tribute acts.Nonetheless, it’s striking that Jane Crowther’sGatsbyand Claire Anderson-Wheeler’sThe Gatsby Gambitare debut novels, suggesting that the original is an artefact that feels fundamentally available, not forbiddingly off-limits; that both writer and reader might feel they have absorbed enough of Gatsby’s internal workings as well as its superficial detail to find variation productive and interesting. (This is, of course, a generous interpretation; familiarity is also commercially attractive.)Well-written and pacy, The Gatsby Gambit romps along in rather happier vein than Fitzgerald might have recognisedCrowther’s approach is both straightforward and, in execution, intricate. She brings Gatsby to the very recent past, just pre-pandemic, and messes with gender; Gatsby becomes a female influencer, her apparently limitless funds provided not by bootlegging but invisible arrangements with beauty brands and real estate companies. Her love object is not Daisy but Danny Buchanan, the decent enough but none-too-deep husband of T, a far more savvy and implacable operator. Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald’s implicated insider-outsider, is Nic, a young woman seeking to make her name not on the money markets but in the more cut-throat world of lifestyle journalism.These narrative switches take up a fair amount of energy to manifest, as Jay herself might describe it in one of her Instagram posts, and keeping track of how Crowther maps old on to new can eclipse some of her more interesting choices: that Tom’s lover Myrtle, for example, becomes Miguel, an undocumented worker from the Dominican Republic with an interest in baseball andWarcraft, and a passing acquaintance with “some guys out in Queens” who sell drugs at Gatsby’s parties. For Nic, who has swallowed whole her new friend’s bone-broth-and-vitamins persona, this is information to be brushed under the carpet, as is the suspicion that camera surveillance is a key part of those gatherings, and of Gatsby’s modus operandi. But despite the novel sometimes over-signalling its ingenuity in reimagining the cultural landscape, Crowther still does well to portray its central figure as a tragic over-reacher, impelled by what she imagines to be love to enter into a social stratum in which preservation of the status quo is prized above all else.The Gatsby Gambitis a different affair altogether; a thoroughly enjoyable mystery story with all the tropes and pleasures of a golden age detective story. Our sleuth is Jay Gatsby’s invented little sister Greta, who arrives for a summer at his West Egg home poised on the brink of adulthood and chafing at her much-loved brother’s overprotectiveness. When Tom Buchanan is found dead – apparently by his own hand, in the face of spiralling debts – on Gatsby’s boat, Greta’s quiet persistence and powers of observation mean that she must exonerate Gatsby himself, who rapidly becomes the chief suspect. Well-written and pacy, inflected by the original characters and setting but otherwise unconstrained by them,The Gatsby Gambitromps along in rather happier vein than Fitzgerald might have recognised.As for the novel celebrating its centenary, the literary wheel keeps turning: Sarah Wynn-Williams’sexposé of the Zuckerberg empiretakes its title,Careless People, directly from Fitzgerald; switching on Radio 4 this week,I heard Alexei Sayledeliver the novel’s final line – “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past” – to bathetic comic effect. That past does indeed remain another country, but one we love to visit.Gatsbyby Jane Crowther is published by the Borough Press (£16.99).

I’m waist deep in the swell and suck of The Kattegat sea off the Danish island of Læsø, armed with a plastic tub and some kitchen scissors, gathering seaweed.“Ten years ago I went to a lecture on Japanese seaweed. The expert was talking about the best place in Denmark to harvest seaweed – and it was Læsø. I’m so lucky it was Læsø,” says Ladefoged.View image in fullscreenThis coastline is rocky, with shallow reefs that provide a high surface area for seaweed to grow, she says. It’s also a very salty sea, about 3% (further south the salt concentration is half that). “Seaweed thrives in saline environments, and the clean, cold water that flows from Norway,” says Ladefoged, who loves introducing people to the joys of the “seaweed safari”. Back on dry land, we toast bladderwrack over a campfire and sprinkle it with local salt. She serves us seaweed and coconut soup, and we try pickled bladderwrack, rhubarb and seaweed jam, sugar kelp pesto, and seaweed-infused beer.The island of Læsø is just 14 miles (22km) long. Despite its small size and declining population, it’s a gastronomic haven famous for its langoustines, salt and, increasingly, its seaweed.Læsø is easy to reach by public transport, with buses from Aalborg to the ferry port at Frederikshavn, from where it’s a 90-minute crossing. On the island, a free bus links the three main villages of Østerby, Byrum and Vesterø, with stops along the main road. Many people hire bikes and enjoy the quiet roads. There are no roundabouts or traffic lights, and the road rule is: “You have to wave at every car. People will worry you’re angry at them if you don’t,” Mette Thuesen, my host at Guest House Læsø, tells me.While the men were away fishing, the women discovered that seaweed could be used as a thatch, creating durable roofing that has lasted more than 300 yearsThe guest house is a new business working to bring more year-round visitors to Læsø. The island population swells in summer, thanks to an influx of mostly Danish holidaymakers who stay in summer houses. Guest House Læsø is a former youth hostel a five-minute walk from the ferry terminal. While the rooms have had a revamp, the space retains a relaxed communal atmosphere with a spacious internal courtyard perfect for small gatherings. Self-catering is possible, but the generous breakfast spread heaving with local produce is well worth paying a little extra for (though, to my shame, I didn’t brave the breakfast aquavit).View image in fullscreenA Læsø house thatched with thick, heavy bundles of seaweed.Photograph: The Food Project/Visit DenmarkLæsø salt is found in top kitchens across Scandinavia and it’s a key industry on the island. Unusually, the salt is extracted from groundwater from the Rønnerne salt marsh. The first records of Læsø salt date back to 1150 when it was gifted to a king. Production ended in 1652, when the island ran out of trees for firewood to heat the water, and the process and traditions were forgotten. In 1991, a school project used archaeological discoveries to try out the ancient process, and it was such a success that the industry was revived.The groundwater has 8-10% salinity, far higher than the sea, and the brown, salty water is rich in algae and minerals. It’s gently heated to separate the salt from the water, then cleaned and processed. The result is a delicious crunchy salt with a high mineral content that is highly regarded by chefs and locals. “When you taste Læsø salt, you taste Læsø’s soul,” salt-maker Flemming Larsen tells me.View image in fullscreenA family at the island’s summer langoustine festivalPhotograph: Kjetil Loiteq/Visit DenmarkAt the saltworks, I meet Thomas W Olsen, a former mayor of Læsø and former mink farmer. The coronavirus pandemic ended the controversial mink industry here and Olsen now leads conservation tours of the Rønnerne salt marsh sanctuary on a converted tractor and trailer called the “Rønnerbus”. The Rønnerne spans 1,741 flat and boggy hectares (4,302 acres). Its scale is hard to comprehend – when the tide is out it’s almost impossible to see where the sea meets the land – but there’s little risk of getting stranded: at high tide the water is only 10cm to 20cm deep.With Olsen, we identify and taste edible flowers and coastal herbs. He encourages us to crouch down to catch an ant with a blade of grass. “The yellow meadow ants taste of orange and lemon – they’re popular at Noma in Copenhagen,” he says. This may be the closest I get to a table at one of the world’s most famous – and expensive – restaurants, so I go with it, luring my unsuspecting prey up my makeshift chopsticks. I falter and the ant bites me first, which I think is fair enough.The yellow meadow ants taste of orange and lemon – they’re popular at Noma in CopenhagenThomas W OlsenUsing all of the island’s wood for salt production in the 1600s had an additional consequence: the islanders ran out of building materials for their homes. This led to an innovation that, in conjunction with the salt industry, has inspired a bid for Unesco world heritage status: Læsø seaweed houses. While the men were away fishing for long weeks, the women on the island discovered that washed-up eel grass could be used as a thatch, creating durable, watertight roofing, some of which has lasted for more than 300 years.At Læsø Museum, thatcher Henning Johansen explains: “You need a community to make a seaweed roof. The women worked together to gather, dry and weave the seagrass.”Much of the wood for the walls of the houses came from shipwrecks. “Læsø was known as an octopus island,” says Tom Andersson from the tourist office. “There are low-lying reefs up to 12km out, which led to many shipwrecks. You’ll also see a lot of brown eyes from all the foreigners who ended up stranded here,” he jokes. “The men were used to finding a few more children when they came home after a long fishing voyage.”View image in fullscreenLæsø saltworks.Photograph: Kjetil Loiteq/Visit DenmarkIt’s hoped that gaining Unesco status will help protect and preserve these unique homes, with their heavy fringed roofs, for future generations.My final stop isHummerens Hus, a popular seafood restaurant by the harbour. Læsø is famous for langoustines, which can be bought by the bucket at the harbour in late summer. The busiest day on the island is the first Saturday in August, when chefs from across Denmark come to compete for the “Golden Claw” at Jomfruhummerfestival, Læsø’s celebration of the langoustine. Today it’s a simpler affair: fresh langoustines, Læsø salt and seaweed butter.

Add more stock when reheating, because the soup thickens in the fridge.Prep15 minCook30 minServes41 medium fennel bulb(about 320g)1 heapedtbsp coconut oil700g carrots, peeled and cut into ½cm-thick rounds3garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely sliced1tsp red chilli flakes3spring onions400ml tin coconut milk400ml boiling vegetable stock2 heaped tbsp smooth peanut butter100g white crabmeat1 handful peanuts, roughly chopped1red chilli(optional), slicedJuice of1 limeUsing a speed peeler, pare a quarter of the fennel bulb lengthways into a bowl of cold water, then set aside. Roughly chop the rest of the fennel, and put it in a large, deep saucepan with the coconut oil, carrots, garlic, ginger and chilli flakes. Put the pan on a medium-low heat, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for six to seven minutes, to soften the veg.Meanwhile, finely slice the spring onions, put them in the same bowl of cold water as the fennel, and set aside.Pour the coconut milk and stock into the pan of softened vegetables, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer, half covered, for 20 minutes.Stir in the peanut butter, then use a hand blender to blitz the soup until smooth. Taste and adjust the salt as needed. Drain the soaked fennel and spring onions really well.Divide the soup between four bowls and top with the crabmeat, sliced fennel and spring onions, peanuts and red chilli, if using. Spritz with the lime juice just before serving.Explore more on these topicsSoupQuick and easyFoodStarterMain courseVegetablesSeafoodShellfishrecipesShareReuse this content"

At about nine on any given morning, he may well be in the back section of the stall, which is visible through glass, his hands steadying the tabletop machine that feeds the minced pork into opaque casings. If ordered in advance, Andrea will also prepare sausagesal punto di coltello(point of the knife) – that is, the meat cut by hand, which, paradoxically, manhandles it less and makes a colossal difference, producing a juicier, chewier sausage. One customer, who has been a regular for decades and with whom I am on dog-walking-nodding terms, quite regularly orders 3kg of hand-cut sausages for his family.Andrea is a third-generation butcher: his grandfather took on the stall in the late 1950s, when Testaccio was still a slaughterhouse district, and passed it on to his son, Franco, who was later assisted by his own son, Alessandro, Andrea’s brother. While Andrea grew up around the stall, skill and trade, and worked there at weekends from the age of 18, he trained as a mechanic. Everything changed in 2018, though, when Franco, a central figure at the market, passed away, and the brothers reorganised: Alessandro took on a role at another butcher, and Andrea, who had just turned 30, took over the stall. Also in the back section, above the ventilator, is a small frame containing family photos, while on the worktop is a recipe book titledIl Macellaio di Roma Capitale Suggerisce(A Butcher of Rome Suggests), which includes Franco’s recipes and was produced by the guild of butchers in the early 1980s, with all profits going to families in need.The recipe for sausages, however, is in Andrea’s head. He uses a 2:1 mixture ofcapocollo(pig’s neck) andarista(pork loin) that, for him (and his customers), provides the correct amount of fat: about 10% a kilo. To every kilo of pork he adds 10g salt, pepper and very finely minced garlic, plus about 60g of sparkling mineral water, the carbonic acid in which acts as an extremely effective preservative. Andrea produces long, fat lengths of sausage, which can be cooked in a whirl or cut into whatever length you like. Rather like Cumberland sausages, which would also be excellent in today’s dish, although any good meaty sausages will do for what I am not going to call a recipe but “a way” of cooking sausages and chicory that sees a fabulous transformation of leaves from crisp to floppy, full of flavour and sweet. Working on the principle that the average weight of a sausage is 80g, and I calculate for two per person, you either want about 640g cumberland or other long sausage, or eight individual ones.Mashed potato would be good here. And make sure there is at least four inches of sausage left over to be eaten cold the following day.Sausages and chicoryServes4Olive oil8 sausages2 heads of radicchio, or 4 of white chicory100mlwhite wineBalsamic vinegar, or grape must saba, to finishHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and choose an ovenproof dish that’s large enough to hold the sausages and radicchio in more or less a single layer. Rub the dish with olive oil. Cut the radicchio into quarters lengthways; if using white chicory, cut them in half.Put the sausages in the dish and turn a few times to coat them with the oil. Put the dish in the hot oven and, after about 10 minutes, turn the sausages, pour the wine over the top, and give them another five minutes in the oven.Pull the dish from the oven, turn the sausages again, then arrange the radicchio or chicory wedges all around the sides (don’t worry if they cover the sausages a bit). Return to the oven for another 15-20 minutes, in which time the leaves will collapse and the sausages take on some colour. Take out of the oven, then, depending on how sweet the leaves have become and your own taste, decide how much (little or no) balsamic vinegar or saba to splash over them. Serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsSausagesA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkMeatVegetablesMain coursePorkrecipesShareReuse this content"
