It was not clear why.In a statement the IDF said there was a violent confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis after “terrorists” threw rocks at Israeli citizens.“IDF and Israeli Police forces arrived to disperse the confrontation, at this point, several terrorists began hurling rocks at the security forces,” the statement said.“The forces apprehended three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at them, as well as an Israeli civilian involved in the violent confrontation. The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israel Police.”Basel Adra, another of No Other Land’s four directors, who are all from Israel and Palestine, told the Guardian he thought the escalating settler violence might be a response to the international recognition won by the documentary.“Palestinians in the village have been under physical attack by settlers almost daily. The settlers’ violence is increasing here. Maybe it’s a revenge for the movie and the Oscar,” he said.Adra, who witnessed the attack in Susya described the violence as “horrific”. “There were dozens of settlers together with the Israeli soldiers and they were threatening us with weapons,” he said. “The police were there from the beginning and did not intervene. While the soldiers were pointing their weapons at us, the settlers started attacking the houses of the Palestinians.“Hamdan tried to protect his family and the settlers attacked him. Soldiers started shooting in the air to prevent anyone to help Hamdan. He was shouting for help. They let the settlers attack him and then the army abducted him.”Nasser’s Israeli co-director Yuval Abraham posted on X: “A group of settlers just lynched Hamdan Ballal, co director of our film no other land. They beat him and he has injuries in his head and stomach, bleeding. Soldiers invaded the ambulance he called, and took him. No sign of him since.”This is not the first time that directors and member of crew ofNo Other Landhave been attacked by settlers.Last February,Adrawas also surrounded and attacked by masked Israeli settlers.Earlier on Monday,Adrawrote on X that “armed and masked settlers” were “leading a terror attack onMasafer Yatta” as he was writing.“Dozens of settlers arrived at my friend Naser’s house in Susya, throwing stones at his home, smashing his vehicle, and slashing [the vehicle’s tyres with knives],” he added.“We risked our life to film,” he said, noting that “soldiers are ordering us to stay inside our homes in the village, while those who attack and could’ve slaughtered the residents in their homes roam freely, masked, around the village”.Israel’s culture minister has called the Oscar win for the joint Palestinian-Israeli documentary “a sad moment for the world of cinema”.Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelNo Other LandDocumentary filmsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The barrister said his client denied the existence of the video and asked Whyte if she had ever seen it. Whyte replied that she had not, but added: “I’ve had it described to me accurately.”Williams also asked Whyte about her communications with Clarke, including inviting him to her play, suggesting it “didn’t add up” if she believed he had a naked video of her. “I didn’t want him to know that I knew,” replied Whyte.Another witness, Naome Morris, told the court that she was a “starstruck” 18-year-old virgin with agoraphobia and selective mutism, an anxiety disorder, when she responded to a request from the Doctor Who actor on X for “naughty or cheeky” pictures.Giving evidence from behind a screen, Morris said she initially messaged him saying “I will” but was shocked when she realised he actually wanted nude images and later began asking if they could have sex.After she sent photos requested by him he then suggested she could come to London for a film screening and hinted they could have sex, the court heard. Morris said she told him about her experiences with bullying and absence from school and a period of time in which she had self-harmed.In her witness statement she said that Clarke subsequently asked her: “How about me being first to fill you when you hit London?”Morris told the court she felt “anxious” at the prospect as she “wasn’t ready”.She said: “I was just enjoying the attention of an actor from Doctor Who … I felt like I had to impress him and not let him down, that he was putting a lot of effort into talking to me and making out he would be the perfect person to be my first [sexual partner].”She did not attend the London screening but met him in May 2010 when he was in Birmingham for promotional events.“He grabbed my leg under the table and squeezed my thigh – he put his hands in-between my legs in a sexual way,” Morris said in her statement, adding that she “froze up” in response as she was “totally inexperienced”.Williams said that his client had been “sympathetic” towards Morris but she had been upset when he had not had sex with her and she had “stalked” him, threatening to spread rumours about him. Morris denied stalking him or that she wanted to have sex with him and said she felt angry at the way she had been treated by Clarke.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

But uncertainty remains over how and when the partial ceasefire would take effect – and whether its scope would extend beyond energy infrastructure to include other critical sites, such as hospitals, bridges and vital utilities.US officialsheld initial talks with Ukraine on Sunday eveningand negotiated separately with Russia on Monday, with most meetings taking place at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh.The US is expected to shuttle between the two countries to finalise details and negotiate separate measures to ensure the safety of shipping in the Black Sea. “The ultimate goal is a 30-day ceasefire, during which time we discuss a permanent ceasefire. We’re not far away from that,” said the US special envoy Steve Witkoff in a podcast with the far-right commentator Tucker Carlson over the weekend.As the Russia-US talks began in Riyadh, Trump said he expected Washington and Kyiv to sign a revenue-sharing agreement on Ukrainian critical minerals soon.Trump also told reporters the US was talking to Ukraine about the potential for its firms to own Ukrainian power plants.Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump listed issues he said were on the table: “We’re talking about territory right now. We’re talking about lines of demarcation, talking about power, power-plant ownership.”Ukrainian officials have backed the signing of a minerals deal, but Zelenskyy has publicly rejected the idea of US firms owning Ukrainian power plants.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy meeting with commanders of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Ukraine and Russia have agreed in principle to a one-month halt on strikes on energy infrastructure.Photograph: Presidential Press Service Handout Handout/EPAThe lead-up to the talks was marked by a series of pro-Russian statements by Witkoff – tapped by Trump as his personal envoy to Putin – in which he appeared to legitimise Russia’s staged referendums in four Ukrainian regions.Speaking with Carlson, Witkoff claimed that in the four regionswhere Moscow held widely condemned referendumson joining Russia, “the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule”.The referendums in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces were widely rebuked in the west as illegitimate and are viewed as a thinly veiled attempt to justify Russia’s illegal annexation of the regions. Their annexation marked the largest forcible seizure of territory in Europe since the second world war.In the interview with Carlson, Witkoff also claimed Putin had commissioned a portrait of Trump “by a leading Russian painter” that the envoy had brought back with him after a trip to Moscow.Witkoff went on to say that after the assassination attempt on Trump last July, Putin told him that he visited his local church, met his priest and prayed for Trump. “Not because he was the president of the United States or could become the president of the United States, but because he had a friendship with him and he was praying for his friend,” Witkoff said.“I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy. That is a complicated situation, that war and all the ingredients that led up to it,” he added.Witkoff’s willingness to echo Kremlin talking points and his praise for Putin are likely to heighten anxiety in Ukraine and across European capitals.In an interview with Time magazine published on Monday but conducted before Witkoff’s remarks, Zelenskyy said some US officials had begun to take Putin at his word even when it contradicted their own intelligence.“I believe Russia has managed to influence some people on the White House team through information,” he said. “Their signal to the Americans was that the Ukrainians do not want to end the war, and something should be done to force them.”Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on what would be acceptable terms for a peace treaty, with no sign that Putin has relinquished any of his maximalist aims in the war against Ukraine.Moscow has set out several maximalist conditions for any long-term settlement – most of which are non-starters for Kyiv and its European allies. These include a halt to all foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, restrictions on the size of its armed forces, and international recognition of the four Ukrainian regions Russia illegally annexed following staged referendums in 2022.The Kremlin has also signalled it would reject any presence of western troops in Ukraine – something Kyiv views as essential to securing lasting security guarantees.Ukraine remains deeply sceptical of any Russian agreement, pointing to past instances where Moscow failed to honour its commitments.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

But in some of these situations that’s the only course once you’ve gone through everything else.”Wicking also criticised the west London airport’s communication. He said it was “appalling” that airlines had to wait until midnight on Friday to confirm terminal 2 would open on Saturday.Wicking added the situation was “not justifiable given the amount of money that has been spent on Heathrow over the years and the fact that it is the most expensive airport in the world”.By mid-afternoon on Friday, the airport had told all airlines tobegin preparations for a full schedule on Saturday, the Guardian understands.Wicking also called for an independent investigation into what happened and the length of time it took for flights to resume.An internal review of the airport’s crisis management plans and its response will be undertaken by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, who is an independent member of Heathrow’s board.On Saturday, the energy secretary, Ed Miliband,ordered an investigation into the power outagewhich will be led by the National Energy System Operator.A Heathrow spokesperson told the Guardian on Monday: “This was an unprecedented issue which began with a fire at an off-airport substation, in less than 24 hours the entire airport was rebooted from a standing start and we delivered a full schedule from Saturday onwards.“There are two reviews into the systems and response both at Heathrow and with the wider grid infrastructure.“We will support these and lessons will be learned where needed. Every penny we invest in our airport infrastructure is approved by airlines and our regulator. On a project-by-project basis, they oversee and influence how we build and maintain Heathrow.”Heathrow is Europe’s largest airport, with more than 83.9 million passengers travelling through its terminals in 2024.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportAir transportTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

Therefore, we are withdrawing it from the removal programme.“We understand the importance of maintaining reliable communication options, especially in areas where mobile service is lacking. The payphone has proven to be a vital resource for residents, ensuring that they have access to emergency services and can stay connected.“Our decision reflects our commitment to supporting the community’s needs and ensuring that essential services remain accessible.”Harris was born in 1935, the same year that the K6 style of red phone box was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. It went into production in 1936, becoming a familiar sight across the UK in just a few years.Linda Jennings, from Brinton and Sharrington parish council, said: “It’s fantastic, the ‘normal man’ has won over the big company. We are all very pleased. It’s really good that BT has backed down.“The mobile phone signal is really poor, it’s a lifeline for people. If you can’t get a signal there, you need these phone boxes. We have a parish council meeting on Thursday, Derek will get a big pat on the back.”Last month,Harris told the Guardian of the need for the phone box to remain.“We live next to perhaps the most beautiful part of Norfolk, the tranquil Glaven Valley with a pure chalk stream running through it,” he said. “It attracts ramblers, walkers, the lot, and everyone knows that there’s a working kiosk.”In the event of an emergency and the mobile network being down, he added, “Wouldn’t it be awful if someone said: ‘If only they had kept that working kiosk’?“What you have to bear in mind is the few calls that have been made have been vital, they’ve probably saved someone’s life. Not that long ago, there was a snowstorm.”On that occasion, the mobile network was down and the call someone made from the phone box “was the only way that rescue came to save this driver whose car was completely covered in snow – it fell off the top of the hedgerows on to his car, and he was trapped.”Explore more on these topicsNorfolkEnglandBTHeritageCommunitiesTelecommunications industryTelecomsnewsShareReuse this content"

Most starkly,removing someone’s Pipwill mean their unpaid carer losing carer’s allowance – in effect pulling away two main strands of a family’s income at once.The Guardian speaks to three readers who could be affected.‘So many of us would love to work if we could’Before Will Evans fell ill with fibromyalgia and arthritis, he dreamed of using his film studies degree to launch a career as a film-maker. Then disability hit and he had to move back to live with his father in Wallasey, Merseyside.Now 29, Evans has his father as his carer. After his father’s council job was cut during the Covid pandemic, the two of them rely on Pip, universal credit (UC) and carer’s allowance to get by.But he fears he will not qualify for Pip under its new, tightened criteria. “The system is already stacked against people with invisible or variable disabilities. I may have one ‘good day’ followed by three when I can barely get to the bathroom,” he says.View image in fullscreenEvans fears losing access to free prescriptions.Photograph: Will EvansIf Evans stops being eligible for Pip, he would lose £593 a month. But, in a domino effect, his father would also lose his entitlement to carer’s allowance and with it, £307 a month – money that goes on food, fuel and car fees.When the work capability assessment is scrapped by 2028 and the only way to get the health component of UC is through Pip – Will could lose another £400 a month.The result would be devastating: the family’s total income would drop by more than two-thirds. “That’s an amount which is absolutely not possible to sustain us,” he says. “We’re barely making ends meet now. We already had to move in with my brother because we can’t make rent on our benefits.”Losing Pip would also mean losing his entitlement to free prescriptions. Before Evans became eligible for these, the bills from his pharmacy were mounting: “It got so bad that the NHS sent me a penalty charge.”Thanks to Pip and its “passport” to more help, Evans has been able to manage his health well in recent years – from orthopaedic bedding to travel to hospital appointments – but he fears the proposed cuts could cause a “catastrophic relapse”.“Being dismissed as a young person refusing to seek work, or someone who finds it ‘easier’ to live off benefits, couldn’t be further from the truth. In reality, so many of us would love to work if we could,” he says. “These cuts will just make a vulnerable group suffer even more.‘We live in fear of the whims of successive governments’Back in the 1990s, before an onslaught of ME, arthritis, fibromyalgia and a heart condition hit, Rebecca Jenkins was a care worker. Now too sick to work and relying on disability benefits, the 56-year-old is still caring – this time for her elderly mother, Susan.At 88, Susan Jenkins has multiple disabilities: she uses a wheelchair because of arthritis and is currently in hospital after a hip replacement as well as being assessed for dementia. In their bungalow in Gloucestershire, Rebecca helps her mother with all aspects of daily living: getting her in and out of bed, using the toilet, cooking and shopping. The physical toll of one disabled person caring for another is heavy. “It’s knackering,” Rebecca says. “If I overdo any physical effort, I’m in agony for days.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because her mother often stays in hospital, Rebecca was advised by the Department for Work and Pensions that any caring payment would be stopped each time. Instead, the two of them live off Rebecca’s Pip alongside other entitlements.Disabilityis expensive, so the cash does not stretch far. Hiring an adapted taxi to get Susan to the hospital in her wheelchair, for example, costs £70.If Rebecca loses Pip, it would have a “huge knock-on effect” for the family, she saysd. She would have to search for work to pay the bills, meaning she would have to pass her caring responsibilitieson to the local authority. “If I lose my disability benefits, my mum will lose her unpaid carer. Then she’ll have to go into a nursing home. In my case, the cut will actually cost [the government] money.”Pip is also a gateway for Rebecca to a catalogue of other help: from free dental care, free prescriptions and council tax reductions to car tax exemption to a railcard. “I’ll lose all of them when I’ll be miraculously cured,” she deadpans.The gallows humour masks her dread. “It’s like we live in fear of the whims of successive governments. I can’t sleep at the moment, I’m so scared.”‘Pip made my son’s life so much more bearable’When Nicola Herring heard about the upcoming disability cuts, she wrote to the social security minister, Stephen Timms, asking for help. Herring cares 24/7 for her 18-year-old son, Francis, as well as her young daughter. Cerebral palsy means Francis can only use his right hand, while his brain injury leads to regular seizures. “I go everywhere with him because he can’t be left alone,” she says.View image in fullscreenNicola Herring, who says Pip enabled her son to learn to write and swim.Photograph: Nicola HerringFrancis’s father works full-time at a magazine but the family rely on Pip and Nicola’s carer’s allowance to – as she puts it – “pay for the things Francis would not need if he was fully healthy”.No help is available on the NHS for his conditions so disability benefits are the only way Francis can access treatment, such as osteopathy, physiotherapy and oxygen therapy. “Pip has made his life so much more bearable. It’s helped him learn to write and swim and make music,” says Herring. “All these things bring joy to his life. And as a family, it’s enabled us to hold on to hope for his future.” Both benefits are gateways to other support: Pip helps the family get accessible concert seats “if we ever brave going out” – in the accessible area, staff are trained to respond to seizures – while carer’s allowance means Nicola is able to collect pension credits.Due to caring for Francis full time, Nicola has been unable to take on paid work. “I did try before and loved being a dinner lady for a while, but even that was impossible to sustain because school kept ringing me to collect my son after seizures,” she says.But without benefits, she would have to find work again “to pay for everything Francis needs” and ask the local authority to care for him full-time. “If the government goes ahead with these cuts, then new care homes are going to have to be available,” she says.Nicola tells me what she emailed the minister: “I love my son very much but caring is emotionally and physically draining. We can’t take any more.”* Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsBenefitsWelfareKeir StarmerLabourDisabilityCarersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Twenty-four private rooms with en suite bathrooms and French doors leading to individual terraces were designed to make the final days of a patient’s life as peaceful as possible. Medical equipment was concealed, beloved pets were welcome to visit, and a drinks trolley came round each evening.The hospice had cost almost £20m to build and equip, every penny raised by donations, legacies, charity events, trusts and foundations. The land was a gift from a local businessman.Fifteen months later, half the rooms are mothballed and 40 jobs have been lost. Patients have to meet a higher threshold for admission, and a 24/7 helpline for those caring for dying people at home has been reduced to eight hours a day, Monday to Friday.The cuts are the result of a funding crisis shared by most in the palliative care sector. “Hospices are in retreat,” said Giles Tomsett, the CEO of St Catherine’s for the past 11 years. This is happening, he pointed out, just as the baby boomer generation is about to need end-of-life care on a significant scale.According to Hospice UK, a body that represents more than 200 hospices, many have had to make “tough decisions” about the services they provide. Last year, one in five hospices warned of service cuts, and 300 beds have been taken out of commission.In recent months, St Michael’s in Basingstoke has said its future is uncertain because of “unprecedented financial pressures”. The26-bed Marie Curie hospice in Liverpool closed temporarilylast summer, but may never reopen. Three hospices in North Yorkshire have warned thatjob losses and cuts to services may be needed. St Giles in Lichfieldclosed eight beds and cut 21 jobs. Dorothy House in Somerset has said that without support for staffing costs, it willbe forced to cut services.Although hospices are a crucial provider of care for dying people, government funding averages at 30% of their total costs, according to Hospice UK. The sector is forced to rely on fundraising, charity shops, donations, legacies and grants for the rest. And the proportion of state money received by individual hospices varies significantly, resulting in a postcode lottery of provision.View image in fullscreenGiles Tomsett: ‘We have 12 beds empty while dying people are being nursed in hospital corridors.’Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianIn December, the governmentannounced a £100m investmentto fund improvements in hospice buildings and equipment rather than running costs.Hospice UK welcomed the move. “It will ease some of those pressures and allow hospices to invest in their infrastructure,” said Toby Porter, the organisation’s CEO. But, he added, “the fact remains that hospices are still in very challenging financial positions”.In recent months, the funding of end-of-life and palliative care has been highlighted in the debate on whether assisted dying should be legalised.A palliative care commission, set up by MPs to identify strengths and shortfalls in provision, is expected to report soon.Sean O’Sullivan had direct experience of the hospice sector when his wife, Christine, was admitted to Katharine House in Banbury, Oxfordshire, last autumn in the final stages of cancer.The day before she died, she was moved to a private room. O’Sullivan stayed with her, lying alongside her as she took her final breath. “It gave me great comfort. She died very peacefully,” he said.The care provided by the hospice was superb, said O’Sullivan. “It was very personal, never rushed, attentive to the individual. I am for ever grateful.” A hospital ward would have been “noisy and distracting, with staff rushed off their feet”, he added.But it was “pure luck” that a bed was available for Christine. “There is so much pressure on places. I feel that the experience we had should be an option for everyone,” O’Sullivan said.View image in fullscreenSt Catherine’s costs about £12m a year to run, with just under £3m coming from the state.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianIn contrast, Paul Harwood has been unable to find any hospice care for his father in Pembrokeshire. “We are paying huge amounts for a home care because there are no other options and no one can give us any help. As far as I can tell, there is no hospice-type care in west Wales for hundreds of miles. The system is broken and only getting more broken,” he said.Emily, a clinical nurse specialist who assesses and refers patients for transfer from a big city hospital to local hospices, said: “Every hospice in my area has cut beds, and some have lost senior clinical roles. It’s a huge postcode lottery. While I’ve been doing this job over the past three years, your chances of getting a hospice place have got lower.“A lot of my job is about expectation management. I have to caveat everything I say. Families become really distressed when they are told there’s no bed available. These conversations are really difficult.”At St Catherine’s, the cutbacks have been heartbreaking, said Tomsett. “We have 12 beds empty while dying people are being nursed in hospital corridors. We see fewer patients in the hospice or in the community, which means theNHShas to pick up the slack.”Shelley Goshawk, the hospice’s ward matron, said: “We always have a waiting list. Patients end up dying before they can get a bed. It’s very difficult knowing that for every patient we look after, there are others that we can’t care for.“I really feel for the families. The ones that do get a bed can take a deep breath, it’s such a relief. People say they can go back to being a husband or daughter again rather than a carer.”St Catherine’s costs about £12m a year to run, with just under £3m coming from the state. “Last year, for the first time, we could see a deficit was likely to emerge this April,” said Tomsett. “Our running costs have increased significantly over the past five years, and the cost of living crisis has impinged on people’s propensity to donate.”The increases in employers’ national insurance contributions and the living wage that come into effect next month will have a further impact on the hospice’s budget, although Tomsett hopes that improved pay will help recruit people to do essential jobs such as cleaning, housekeeping and catering. “I think the increase is right,” he said.But the reliance on donations to fund hospices is unsustainable, he added. “The NHS is looking to hospices, which are charities, to provide essential end-of-life care. Yet by underfunding palliative care, we are forced to cut back on services and get involved at a later stage.” In the end, it costs the NHS more, he said.“Few hospices will actually close, but many will provide fewer and smaller services. And this is at a time our ageing population needs us more than ever. Baby boomers are about to swamp the whole of the NHS, hospice and palliative care system.”Hospice UK hopes the government’s 10-year plan for the NHS in England, due to be published this spring, will provide a joined-up approach to end-of-life care alongside more consistent funding.“The plan must overhaul our approach to palliative and end-of-life care and ensure hospices like St Catherine’s have the sustainable funding they need to support their local communities long into the future,” said Porter.Explore more on these topicsHospicesSocial careHealth policyNHSDeath and dyingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But this extraordinary film meets the people still riddled with guilt and heartbreak – and paints beautiful portraits of those they lostRachel AroestiMon 24 Mar 2025 18.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 18.03 EDTShare“Remember the pandemic?” In 2025, it’s something you might say after spotting a person wearing a face mask on the street, or being temporarily stunned by the sudden recollection of the 2-metre rule, or people hosing down their weekly shop. Of course, few adults will have forgotten about a global pandemic that officially ended only two years ago – not least because, for many, Covid-19 infections still cause significant health issues. But, generally speaking, the world has moved on, and you can see why it might seem that the nation is experiencing collective amnesia about an event that resulted in the highest death toll since the second world war.For some, this feels like a betrayal. Families who lost loved ones to the virus are not just incapable of putting the pandemic out of their minds, they are determined not to. As Covid fades from our lives and our lexicon, they worry that the victims are at risk of being forgotten too.This feature-length programme from documentary-maker Catey Sexton is an attempt to ensure that doesn’t happen. Love and Loss: The Pandemic 5 Years On is dedicated to remembering people who died from Covid, including Sexton’s mother, who died in a care home. We hear about nurses, carers, bus drivers, young people, elderly people, those with disabilities, fathers and mothers. The film gives bereaved families the chance to pay tribute to their late loved ones, not with overblown praise but by talking about their hobbies, their values and their quirks, and sometimes even gently ribbing them (for their dad dancing or love of a good moan).Sexton’s subjects are from every corner of the UK and a variety of backgrounds. Those who died were adults of all ages, and they caught the virus in different ways: some as key workers, some in care homes, some when lockdown was lifted. The point is to show that Covid was, to a certain extent, indiscriminate, but it is also to humanise the statistics we were fed during the height of the pandemic, when most of us were numbed – perhaps necessarily – to the acute individual suffering they represented.Each portrait is full of love, and predictably heartbreaking. Yet they are also insightful. The more we hear about the nature of these deaths, the more we can understand the shades of grief that are particular to the pandemic. Relatives are not only traumatised, but left suspended in a state of disbelief – some due to being denied a funeral service, others because they could not be at their loved one’s side when they died.Bound up with the enduring shock is a sense of guilt and regret – misplaced, of course, but so understandable. Some of this has to do with listening to medical advice: when the parents of 21-year-old Chloe were told by paramedics not to worry about her condition because young people weren’t dying of the virus at that time, they felt reassured. She died the same day. When Femi caught the virus, his GP told him to stay at home. He died on the sofa. When his daughter talks about his death, she addresses him directly: “I’m really sorry, Dad, I really wish that we did more.”The idea that anyone blames themselves for these tragedies – especially considering that this was a time when our freedoms were almost completely curtailed – is extraordinarily sad. Blaming the state might be a more rational option. The final stretch of the programme briefly covers the continuing inquiry into the country’s handling of the pandemic. Although detailing the specific mistakes and compromises made by the government is largely outside this documentary’s remit, it does explain how important it is for the bereaved to dredge meaning from the mess. Sexton admits that her search for answers about why so many died in care homes is a coping mechanism. For others, trying to protect the UK from another botched response to a future pandemic gives them purpose amid such senseless loss.Occasionally, this programme recounts the pandemic narrative in an over simplistic way, but Sexton is not aiming to provide a rigorous history. Instead, she has focused on capturing an emotional reality. For most of us, the pandemic was like a bad dream from which we have woken. But not for these families. At one point, a bereaved father says he wishes he could go back in time and warn people about Covid. It is magical thinking about a surreal period in our history that, as this programme evocatively shows, has left so many permanent scars.Love and Loss: The Pandemic 5 Years Onaired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Your life won’t be worth living if you start talking about austerity. Anything but the A word. Anything except tax breaks for tech oligarchs.These are a tough few days for theLabourparty. All anyone outside government wants to talk about is Rachel Reeves’s spring statement. What it means. How many promises broken. The cabinet aren’t quite so keen. Their aim is to bunker down and try to ride out the storm. They can already smell the incoming disappointment.So they are desperate for distractions. That was why Keir Starmer was out and about on Radio 5 Live first thing on Monday morning to talk about potholes. Not that there was anything wrong with wanting to fix potholes. Every motorist and cyclist wants that. It’s just that when potholes are leading the government’s news agenda you can sense the kiss of death.No wonder then that the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has been thanking her lucky stars. She’s been seen doing cartwheels down the corridors of her department. Because she has her very own crisis-not-really-a-crisis to deal with: theshutting down of Heathrow airportfor the best part of a day because of a fire in a nearby electricity substation.A crisis-not-really-a-crisis that caused a great deal of disruption. But one in which no one died. And, best of all, it was a crisis-not-really-a-crisis for which no one could possibly blame the government. It wasn’t her fault that someone had accidentally plugged in another heater to an overloaded socket. It wasn’t her fault that a dopey engineer had reattached the brown wire to the blue terminal. Or whatever had happened. All you really need to know is that Heidi doesn’t give a toss what happened as long as it wasn’t done on her watch.These are the days that cabinet ministers dream of. All too often these things are their fault and they have to send a junior minister along to the Commons to sheepishly admit that something has gone wrong while they barricade themselves into their office. But for this statement, Heidi had no reason to hide. She could hold her head up high and deliver the statement herself.First thing was not to smile. Always tempting when you have dodged a potential bullet and even the opposition realise this is a crisis-not-really-a-crisis. Heidi passed this with flying colours. She has the air of a woman not possessed of a great sense of humour. Mostly she just stares at her phone, as if waiting for the next potential disaster to derail her. A face carved out of misery.She also has a voice made for AI. If a career in government doesn’t work out there will be alternative employment as a consumer complaints operative. Thank you for phoning the Department for Transport. Your call is not important to us. All our lines will be busy for the rest of the day. Please continue to hold until you give up and kill yourself.Heidi began with a word of thanks. To the firefighters for containing this “unprecedented” event. To the maintenance worker who botched the job and caused the power outage. For turning what could have been a disaster into just an inconvenience. Last Friday, when the incident was still going on, you could hear the disappointment in the media that the fire wasn’t down to the Russians, a terror group or Just Stop Oil. It was just one of those things. An honest mistake.View image in fullscreenThe North Hyde electrical substation, which caught fire on Thursday night. Labour could not be blamed for the blaze.Photograph: Maja Smiejkowska/PANot that this was going to stop Alexander threatening retribution. Heidi said ominously that there would be “learnings”. Probably best not to cross her. There would also be a review that no one would read, chaired by Ruth Kelly, that would report in six weeks. I’m not sure quite why it would take that long.We all know what happened. There was an accidental fire and Heathrow didn’t feel there was enough backup supply to safely power down and power up the airport. A hassle for everyone planning to fly in and out, but not the end of the world. Flights are always getting delayed. Better than crashing, you would have thought.The shadow transport secretary, Gareth Bacon, could barely stay awake throughout his reply. Not even he could manage the futile gesture of trying to pretend that the crisis-not-really-a-crisis was somehow the government’s fault. He wasn’t even that bothered that thethe Heathrow chief executive had nipped back to bedafter the fire had broken out. Enviably calm, or maybe he doesn’t reckon he gets paid enough to pull an all-nighter. He only earned £3.2m last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Step forward, Richard Tice. Rapidly advancing himself as the prime contender for this parliament’s Idiot’s Idiot award. And that is a hotly coveted title given some of the quarter-wits on the benches. But Our Dicky is a collector’s item in quarter-wittedness. Someone who believes himself to be super-smart and has no idea of his limitations.On Friday, Dicky was parading himself as the man with the inside knowledge on Heathrow. Mainly because he is a not-so-frequent flyer to Dubai to visit his on-off girlfriend. But Dicky had managed to solve the question of who and what was to blame for the outage long before the police had started their own investigation.“IT’S NET ‘STUPID’ ZERO,” he yelled to the Daily Telegraph, who duly printed his story. Heathrow had been closed because it was too woke to use any backup diesel generators. Which might have been an interesting angle, if any of that had been true. But it wasn’t. None of it was true. Heathrow had several backup diesel generators. They just weren’t enough to safely restore full power.So you’d have thought the pale orange Dicky might have at least turned up to correct the record. To say sorry for providing misleading information when the police and fire brigade were already overstretched. But Dicky was nowhere to be seen. Nor was Nigel Farage, who had been dim enough to retweet Dicky’s nonsense. Instead, all we got was the Reform outcast, Rupert Lowe, who showed no signs of knowing where he was or what was going on. Perhaps Lowe and Farage have taken out mutual restraining orders and they can’t be in the chamber at the same time.Otherwise, there were just a few grumblings. Something must be done. It was because there were too many runways. Or not enough. It must never happen again. But something like it probably will. Humans make mistakes. Things fall apart.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportThe politics sketchHeidi AlexanderLabourReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

As a 10-year-old he had played the lead in a TV series called Circus Boy, but the former child star began to notice something odd about the jobs his agent was now sending him to: every one was for a series “about kids in a band”. He says: “One was called The Happeners, about a little folk trio like Peter, Paul and Mary. One was about a surfing band like the Beach Boys. Another was about a big family folk ensemble. Something was in the air, obviously, because of the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Four Seasons, Motown. Young people, who had disposable income, were being targeted.”None of those shows got made but a fourth audition proved more fruitful: it called for “folk’n’roll musician/singers … four insane boys” who looked as if they might hang around a hip Sunset Strip coffee shop calledBen Frank’s. Dolenz got a leading role, happily acquiescing to learn to play drums. “It was kind of the same as when I was in Circus Boy and they told me I had to learn to ride an elephant – ‘Great! When do I start?’”The series was green-lit and the Monkees proved so successful at parting young people from their disposable income that, within a year, Dolenz was unable to visit the shopping mall near his parents’ home in San Jose without causing pandemonium. “I go through the big glass doors and all of a sudden there are people running, screaming. I thought it was a fire. I hold open the big door and I’m going, ‘Slow down! Don’t run! Don’t panic! It’s all right!’ And suddenly I realised they were running at me. I was like, ‘Oh God!’”View image in fullscreenChild star … 10-year-old Dolenz in Circus Boy.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIt was, he concedes, a very strange kind of fame. He was playing a character clearly based on himself and also called Micky – the drummer in a luckless fictional band called the Monkees. “We lived in a Malibu beach house,” he wryly notes, “and every episode had us trying to get a record deal or trying to get a gig and never making it – which does beg the question of how we could afford a Malibu beach house.”But in real life, the band became one of the biggest in the world, at one juncture selling 6m albums and 5m singlesin four months. Or rather, they were actors pretending to be a band, in order to front a succession of records that they hadn’t actually played on. Initially at least, everything but the vocals was handled by crack session musicians. When their second album, 1967’s More of the Monkees, was released, the first they knew about it was when it appeared in the shops.It seems a deeply peculiar blurring of fantasy and reality, guaranteed to mess with an early twentysomething’s head. “Oh boy, oh boy!” chuckles Dolenz, tapping the side of his skull. “You don’t want to be in here sometimes! I think because of my upbringing in the business, I always attempted to separate the person from the persona. I wasn’t always successful, but that’s incredibly important if you want to survive. To some degree, I’ve always known that Micky the wacky drummer on television was who the girls were in love with – not me, Micky Dolenz, who grew up in the Valley. Now that’s easy to say, but sometimes very, very difficult to do. But if you don’t keep that separation, it can be disastrous. We see that happen all the time. An interesting, weird place to be.”It’s even weirder that Dolenz is still talking about the Monkees nearly 60 years later. They weren’t supposed to have such staying power. The TV show was cancelled in 1968 after two seasons. The big hits dried up around the same time. But here Dolenz is, Zooming from his holiday home on the Delaware River a few days after his 80th birthday, the last surviving Monkee, looking jaunty in orange-tinted sunglasses and a rakishly angled trilby. (Davy Jones,Peter TorkandMike Nesmithhave all died.) Rewind TV is now repeating the show in the UK for the first time in years, although in truth, some channel somewhere in the world seems to have been re-running the series almost constantly since it was cancelled. It was a mainstay of children’s TV in the 70s, while MTV’s repeats in 1986 proved so popular, they triggered the first in a series of Monkees reunions.View image in fullscreen‘The wacky drummer’ … with the Monkees.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThere is one sense in which the show’s longevity is surprising. You might have expected the music to last: from I’m a Believer to Daydream Believer, the big hits were exquisitely turned examples of the songwriter-for-hire’s craft. But the show is a kind of period piece, a last transmission from a more innocent era of 60s pop that was about to be overwhelmed by psychedelia and more serious-minded artistic ambition.Dolenz, however, stopped being surprised at the show’s durability decades ago. “It was about a fictitious band that wanted to be the Beatles, or the Stones, or whoever. That struggle for success is a classic theme in Hollywood movies and Broadway shows. It was more like a little Marx Brothers musical on television than a band – a little romp, laughing, singing, music, shtick. John Lennon first made that comment, ‘The Monkees are like the Marx Brothers.’ He was absolutely right. And the comedy wasn’t topical, nor was it satirical. So it stands up, it has legs.”He chafes a little at the suggestion that the Monkees were effectively a manufactured boyband, saying: “It was not a boyband. It was the cast of a television show, like when the cast of Glee made albums.” But Dolenz admits he was the member most comfortable with whatever the Monkees were: a showbiz pro, unbothered when albums appeared without their knowledge, or when the producers showed so little confidence in their ability to play live that they booked their first gig in Hawaii, “because back then Honolulu was like another planet, so they figured if we really sucked no one would hear what happened”.View image in fullscreen‘You don’t want to be in my head’ … Dolenz today.Photograph: Kat Tuohy PhotographyThis was not a view shared by all his bandmates. When More of the Monkees appeared, a disgruntled Nesmith broke ranks, publicly describing it as “probably the worst album in the history of the world” and bluntly telling a reporter: “I don’t care if we never sell another record … tell the world we don’t record our own music.”“Frankly,” says Dolenz, “I didn’t give a shit one way or the other. I don’t mean I didn’t give a shit about Mike. I did – and I knew what he was going through. He was frustrated because he was misled. He was not an actor, he was a singer-songwriter, and they told him he was going to write and record his own music. And basically, he was not allowed to do that. In the very early days of the show, he went to the producers with his guitar and played them a song he’d written that he wanted the Monkees to record. According to him, they said, ‘Thank you, but no thank you – it’s not a Monkees song.’ He said, ‘Wait a minute, I am one of the fucking Monkees. What are you talking about?’ But they blew him off.“So Mike, in his inimitable manner, gave it to an unknown girl singer kicking around town, Linda Ronstadt. The song was called Different Drum. It was a Top 20 hit. So he was terribly frustrated and I felt for him, and I backed him. He’s the one that told me not to go to New York to record the new Monkees single – and I didn’t. I went to England, where I met Paul McCartney for the first time. He invited me to a Beatles session for Sgt Pepper. So – no regrets.”For all that he viewed himself as an actor first, Dolenz seems to have rather enjoyed the life of a rock star. Some of the 60s pop aristocracy were a little snippy about the Monkees (the Byrds wrote the sarcastic So You Want to Be a Rock’n’Roll Star? about them) but most were not. Neil Young played on their albums. At one bizarre juncture, Frank Zappa asked Dolenz to become his drummer, but the Monkees’ record label wouldn’t give him permission. “I was sort of relieved,” says Dolenz. “I mean, you listen to his stuff and it’s like 7/13 time, you know, these ridiculous time signatures.”Dolenz took full advantage, knocking around with the Beatles, hanging out backstage at the Monterey festival and inviting its star turn, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, to support the Monkees on tour – on the grounds that “he was very theatrical and the Monkees was a theatrical act”. This had disastrous consequences: Hendrix swiftly quit, dispirited by the experience of performing Purple Haze to nonplussed teens screaming for Davy Jones.When Nesmith’s gambit paid off and the Monkees were allowed to write and perform their own material, Dolenz jumped in with both feet. He wrote their fabulous 1967 hit Randy Scouse Git, was the first pop artist to take delivery of a Moog synthesiser, and says his happiest memories of the band were recording their third album, Headquarters. They were finally permitted to have a say: “Pinocchio became a real boy.”‘Now it’s this incredible cult film’ … watch the trailer for the Monkees’ film Head.Dolenz has “absolutely no pains, no regrets, no pangs” that the series was cancelled. You could tell he was tiring of it from the final episode, which he wrote and directed. The plot involved TV controlling people’s minds via a symbol that looked remarkably like the logo of the CBS network. The episode was laced with references to marijuana, anti-war songs, and featured a guest appearance from Tim Buckley, debuting his exquisiteSong to the Siren. None of it seemed designed to part young people from their disposable income.Nor did Head, the 1968 Monkees film with a screenplay by Jack Nicholson, allegedly written under the influence of LSD. “We were looking to move on: we didn’t want to make a film that was a feature-length Monkees episode where Davy falls in love and the girl’s uncle is a crook and we have to save him and we sing her some songs. So Head was a little bit stream-of-consciousness. When they first screened the movie, it was not a typical screening. They had ‘movieolas’, with one of the five reels of the film in each and the idea was you could start watching the movie from any point on any reel.” He laughs. “It was a very, very 60s idea.”Dolenz sees Head as a film about breaking the traditional rules of Hollywood, which its producers and Nicholson would go on to do with Easy Rider the following year. “There’s a lot of breaking the fourth wall, a scene where I start talking to the director and say, ‘I can’t take this any more’ and walk off through the back of the set, through the typical Hollywood backdrop painting.”The Monkees’ Head: ‘Our fans couldn’t even see it’Read moreBut it was also very obviously about the Monkees and their discomfort with being, as one song from the soundtrack puts it, “a manufactured image with no philosophies”. It ends with the band trapped in a glass tank, being stored away in a studio warehouse. “It did terribly at the box office,” says Dolenz. “Nobody seemed to care. I certainly didn’t. But of course now it’s this incredible cult film. Every once in a while, someone comes up to me and tells me it’s great. Quentin Tarantino did, so did Edgar Wright, a wonderful director. It’s a very interesting little film.”View image in fullscreen‘No Monkee business’ … Dolenz in his producer/director role with Metal Mickey.Photograph: Phillip Jackson/ANL/ShutterstockIt more or less ended the Monkees’ commercial career. Tork left, then Nesmith. Dolenz and Jones soldiered on, then split in 1970. Dolenz says he never really had any further ambitions in music. He eventually moved to England and reinvented himself as a producer and director, famously directing the 80s kids’ show Metal Mickey. “No Monkee business,” he nods. “I remember that feeling, that moment when someone interviewed me and the article didn’t say, ‘Micky Dolenz, ex-Monkee.’ It said, ‘Michael Dolenz, producer/director.’ Not that I ever tried to escape the Monkees, but I carved out this different career, so when the Monkees first reunited in 1986 I was fine. I had no problem going back and recreating that character.”He toured, on and off, with various iterations of the Monkees until all the other members died. He still plays live occasionally, describing it as his “day job”, and seems as content with the Monkees’ legacy as he could possibly be. But then, he always was. He thought they were quietly groundbreaking. “Nothing like that had ever happened before,” he says. “We were on our own. We were long-haired weirdos on television. Back then, the only time you saw long-haired weirdos on television, they were usually being arrested.”Micky Dolenz: Live at the Troubadour is out now.

I loved the feeling of making people laugh, but the thought of it being a job had never crossed my mind. A career started to snowball without me even realising and I’ve been delighted and astounded by that ever since. I’ve grown up in this job, and 18-year-old me would never have believed it possible.Who did you admire when you were starting out?Rob Rouse. To this day, if I see I’m on a lineup with him I’m buzzing. I’ve also been in awe of Ross Noble’s ludicrous genius since before I even started comedy.Any bugbears from the world of comedy?Promoters who don’t pay on time. People who act like if you’re not based in London then you don’t matter. People who won’t acknowledge that class is a huge hurdle in the arts. When you find out your train home is actually a rail replacement bus. Three-and-a-half-star reviews – go on, round it up to four. I dare you.What inspired your new show,Big Girl Pants?As some audiences have watched me grow up, I felt I had to recognise the milestone of turning 30. If my last show was about making the best of what you have, this one is about making the best of what is still to come. I wanted to write a show that acknowledges I am too anxious and worry too much, but want more than anything to change that.View image in fullscreenTrying to find the funny side of any situation’ …Lauren PattisonPhotograph: Matt CrockettDo you have any preshow rituals?Try not to have an existential crisis. Check my fly isn’t down and that there’s nothing in my teeth.Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?When I was first starting to get paid weekend spots, there was a particularly heinous crowd where I watched the other much more experienced comedians bomb so I accepted my fate. The whole thing felt like a fever dream. I remember checking my watch thinking I might be nearly done and I was only six minutes into a 15-minute set. I tried to leave without being paid then bought a pack of continental deli meat on the way back and ate the whole thing with shame.What have you learned from standup?To try to find the funny side of any situation. Life feels so much easier to navigate if you can do it while having a laugh. I also know the British rail network like the back of my hand, have learned how to get changed in a green room full of other comics without exposing yourself, and have an excellent knowledge of how to navigate on foot between most train stations, Travelodges and the nearest Nando’s.Who is your comedy hero?Russell Howard. I used to religiously watch Good News every week. He was the first standup I saw live, when I was 15, and I went to see him year after year. I remember I took a selfie with his poster after that first gig because I wasn’t able to stay back and meet him. Fast forward 12 years and we got to work together. I told him the story and asked if I could finally get my picture with him and of course he agreed to recreate the one I took with his poster. He was also lovely to my mam, so that’s a big thumbs up.What are you most excited for?Tonotbe at the Edinburgh fringe in August. I’ve only not been four times in the last 11 years, and two of those were during the Covid years so I could hardly make the most of it. It will be strange not waking up in a panic and checking a ticket sales report, but I am sure I will adjust nicely.You’re in a cab, the driver finds out you’re a comedian and asks you for a joke. What do you say?Even this hypothetical situation has me breaking out in anxiety sweats. I never tell taxi drivers what I do, and instead use it as an opportunity to explore what alternate versions of Lauren would be doing. Some days I am a teacher, others I am a nail technician. I fear the day will come when I get the same driver twice, and I’ll be mid elaborate backstory when he tells me: “I thought you worked in a supermarket?”Lauren Pattison: Big Girl Pants ison touruntil 10 JuneExplore more on these topicsStageComedy Q&AComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalRoss NoblefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I missed out on my death scene in Jurassic Park because a hurricane destroyed the set in Hawaii, so I never got to go down and get eaten by a velociraptor. When Renny Harlin told me he was making a horror movie with killer sharks, and that I was going to be the first person to die, I said: “Great!” It was a good idea – once he’d killed me, it meant any character’s life was up for grabs.I had no idea I was going to be as wet as I was. I was in water for a month: it was kind of wild. For the storm scenes, they were dumping water down on us from towers, like big-ass waves flying everywhere. After Stellan Skarsgård has his arm bitten off and we’re out on the deck trying to get him on the helicopter, we didn’t know they were going to throw that much water. The rehearsals had been very different.By the second week, the water tank had become a giant pool of urineRenny HarlinAs a kid, you go to movies, you watch people die, then you play games where you act out death scenes of your own. You bounce off the walls and stagger around, fall over, pick yourself up off the floor, say something, finally fall down for good - give it a bit of James Cagney. I’ve had very varied deaths in movies, but everyone remembers this one. It was great being at the premiere, having not told any of my friends, and seeing them react. Usually in movies like that, all the black people get killed early, but in Deep Blue Sea, LL Cool J is the last one alive. That felt like a small victory.View image in fullscreen‘Maybe he’ll have the shark regurgitate me’ … Jackson in Deep Blue Sea.Photograph: Album/AlamyI’m making a new movie with Renny, the fourth we’ve done together, but I hear he’s also working on another one involving sharks. I’ve not had the call about that yet. Maybe he’ll bring back the shark that ate me in Deep Blue Sea and have it regurgitate me so I can come back and fight another day.Renny Harlin, directorThe screenplay reminded me of other films I loved, such as Alien and The Poseidon Adventure – people faced with a huge challenge in a contained space. We shot it with the water tanks that had been built for Titanic at Baja Studios in Mexico, constructing sets that could be sunk on a hydraulic platform. We had hundreds of crew and cast working in wetsuits, and for the first week everyone would religiously get out of the tank whenever they needed to go to the bathroom. But it’s horrible climbing in and out of a cold wetsuit, and by the second week, people only seemed to leave the pool for lunch. By then, it had become a giant tank of urine.I wanted the sharks on the screen. We knew about the problems the Jaws crew had with their mechanical shark, which is one of the reasons you see so little of it. CGI was still in its infancy in 1999, but we used it for some of the attack scenes, which now look pretty dated by today’s standards. We also shot some footage of Thomas Jane (who played Carter) swimming alongside real sharks in the Bahamas.A company in San Francisco built us fully remote-controlled sharks that would do almost anything we needed: a seven-metre model and two smaller ones. The big one had a 1,000-horsepower engine and must have weighed a ton, so although it was great to have something convincing that the cast could interact with, we had to make sure no one got in its way.Sam and I had become friends making The Long Kiss Goodnight and made a pact to carry on working together. When he heard I was making Deep Blue Sea, he called and said: “So who am I playing?” I thought: “Now I’m in trouble.” And we had to add the part of the CEO who financed the research facilities and pays a visit when things start going wrong.Sam’s death scenewas inspired by Tom Skerritt’s in Alien. Tom, playing Dallas, appears to be the hero until he suddenly gets killed halfway through. So that’s what we did with Sam – just as it looks like he’s about to lead the other characters to safety, we kill him in the middle of his cliched hero speech. At the test screening, people were screaming, then laughing. I had to fight the marketing team, though. They wanted to put that bit in the trailer. I said: “No! It has to be a surprise.”The 10 best movie shark performances – ranked!Read moreOne thing that didn’t go down well with test audiences was the original ending, where Saffron Burrows, as head scientist Susan, was one of the survivors. Deep Blue Sea presents sharks as innocent creatures of the wild and humans as the bad guys, messing with Mother Nature. Hundreds of test cards came back saying Susan deserved to be punished – despite the good intentions, her genetic engineering had caused the sharks to become smarter, leading to all the chaos. I also wonder if her upper-class-sounding English accent was a factor, in that American audiences felt they were being lectured.We had to fix that at very short notice – one day’s extra shooting, a few new visual effects, the shark gets Susan and LL Cool J ends up the hero. He wrote a song to play over end credits, too, and I directed thevideo, which is something I don’t usually do. We got away with having his character’s foul-mouthed parrot get eaten. I think the reaction would have been different if he’d had a cute little puppy.Deep Blue Sea is out now on 4K UHD and Blu-ray from Arrow VideoExplore more on these topicsFilmHow we madeAction and adventure filmsSharksSamuel L JacksonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The kids have come in during the holidays to be extras in a new BBC comedy drama, Crongton, set on a fictional housing estate.The 10-part series, the first episodes of which air this evening, follows Lemar “Liccle Bit” Jackson (Samson Agboola), a child who, as adults would recognise, is being groomed into joining a gang. But this is nothing likeAdolescence, the Netflix drama that has prompted endless debate about society and toxic masculinity. This is a kids’ TV programme. Adults are not invited.The show is an adaptation of a hit book series by the lauded novelist Alex Wheatle, who won the Guardian children’s fiction prize in 2016 with hissecond Crongton book. The BBC show arrives amid upsetting news for its cast and crew, as it was announced on Friday that Wheatle had died.“It is with great sadness to inform you that Alex Wheatle, our ‘Brixton Bard’, sadly passed away on Sunday 16 March 2025 after his fight with prostate cancer,” his family wrote in a statement posted on social media.The series writer, Archie Maddocks, who adapted the bestselling novels, says the books are darker and grittier than the screen version.It might be a softer version of the story, with bright colours and upbeat music, but the themes need to be hard-hitting to reach children in the digital age, he says.View image in fullscreenArchie Maddocks in Crongton.Photograph: Khuram Qadeer Mirza/BBC/New Pictures“The kids also know much more about the world than they did when I was younger because they’ve got social media,” says Maddocks, a comedian who also plays a teacher in the show.He says Crongton’s job, as well as to entertain, is to reflect the realities of children’s lives. “It’s a good way to get that message through without going, ‘The world is so dangerous. Don’t do this, don’t do that,’” he says. “Because I don’t think kids hear that. You give them room to work out their own conclusions. That’s a better way of teaching lessons.”The show uses a mix of live action and animation to help interpret situations characters find themselves exposed to. Some of them see in cartoons, others in 1940s film noir, while one girl, a wannabe dancer, sees characters dancing instead of fighting.The young cast, some of whom were found during an open casting call for people with no acting experience, echoes what Maddocks says.“It manages to cover different themes while also being funny,” says Seyi Andes-Pelumi, who plays Liccle Bit’s friend Rapid.Another young cast member, Noah Cox, who plays McKay in his first TV role, says: “It’s realistic, like people can relate to it.”Crongton trailer – videoAt the real-life school in Burmantofts where the series is filmed, 70% of the children speak English as a second language. It is in the most deprived ward in Leeds and one of the most deprived in England. For the children here, the themes are a reality. Liccle Bit’s multigenerational household, with a busy mother working to keep a roof over the family’s head, is normal.“Life is about choices, and if you make the wrong choice, it might come back to haunt you,” Liccle Bit says in the trailer, as we see the character offered money to do a favour for a gangster.Kelle Bryan, who rose to fame in the girl group Eternal, plays a family member of Liccle Bit’s, and says she was drawn to the show because of its potential to make a difference. “I took the job because I’m an advocate for social change and I really think this job is at the forefront of that,” she says. “These stories are critical for instigating change and getting in at a point where we can make those changes.“I think by the time they’ve got to 18, we’ve lost our young people. And the time we influence them is at the beginning of things – so while they’re at school, while they’re in education – and we’ve got more adult control at those points where parentally you’re in control of the dos and don’ts, where we’ve got more of a say in what that child can and can’t do.View image in fullscreen‘Programmes like this really seep into the psyche of people at that critical stage, at 12 or 13’ … Sutara Gayle and Kelle Bryan in Crongton.Photograph: Khuram Qadeer Mirza/BBC/New Pictures“I think programmes like Crongton really seep into the psyche of younger people, especially at that critical stage, at 12 or 13, where it’s pre-adult and they’re starting to make decisions that can take their life in one direction or another.”Bryan works with different knife-crime charities, including the Ben Kinsella Trust, named after a 16-year-old Islington boy who wasstabbed to deathby older teenagers in an unprovoked attack in 2008. The charity, set up by his sister Brooke Kinsella, the EastEnders actor, campaigns to end knife crime in the UK,a problem that is increasing.Bryan says it is “vital” that stories like this are being told. “There isn’t anything like it at the moment on television,” she says. “It’s got real credible heart to it. It’s told truthfully, so it’s not been sterilised for television.”She says the show harnesses the “adult voice” in young people’s heads, “where you kind of go ‘Mum wouldn’t like it if I was doing this, but I’m gonna do it anyway’.Alex Wheatle, novelist and ‘Brixton Bard’, dies aged 62Read more“He makes one decision. And he ends up down this pathway. And then when you look back on it, you can see it started then. This is how we ended up here. And that’s what’s important for children to see.”It is not an abstract story for Bryan. Her cousin was also killed in a knife crime. “He went to the shop to pick up the takeaway – it wasn’t even a chicken shop because chicken shops are stereotypically where black people are supposed to hang out, and I’m absolutely against that stereotype – so he’d gone to collect his takeaway, and he never came home,” she says.“He was a teen that never came home. I’m a living witness of the after-effects that have plagued that family and are still plaguing it today. Whatever I can do to shed light and change the narrative, I’m on board.”Crongton is on BBC iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionKnife crimeGangsLeedsCrimeYoung peopleChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Discounts on business rates that hospitality businesses have been entitled to are also decreasing, from 70% to 40%.In theWest Yorkshiremarket town of Otley, arguably the UK’s most well known pub town, afternoon drinkers did not welcome the news.“I think, this summer, it will get to the point where on a nice sunny day people will just sit in the garden because they can’t afford to go to the pub,” said one man. He said though he had retired five years earlier, he had needed to go back to work as a delivery driver to keep up with the cost of living.“Without a doubt, I can feel the cost of living crisis,” he said. “You go to supermarkets and you just see everything going up.”View image in fullscreenGary Swain (right) and John Walasek at the Bowling Green.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverAt the Bowling Green, a large Wetherspoon’s pub with a sunny yard at the front, some people felt the price rises would not affect them too much, because they bought the cheapest pint in the cheapest place they could.“It is what it is. We go somewhere where it’s cheap,” said Gary Swain, drinking a Bud Light that cost £1.89. “It’s a nice pint. You get used to what you get used to.”He said he usually drinks in Wetherspoon’s and in his local club in Harrogate. “You’d always find somewhere to go,” said Swain, who works as a forklift driver at the Heineken brewery in Tadcaster, 20 miles east. “I work so it doesn’t bother me. If you can’t afford it, then don’t go out.”That is something publicans fear will happen.Pubs, bars and clubs have been closing at startling rates, with the number of pubs falling below 39,000 for the first time in December 2024, according to the property data company Altus Group.Otley locals used to say the town had more pubs per person than anywhere in the UK. They currently number 24 with a population of fewer than 15,000 people.It was the first place to have all of its pubs listed as assets of community value, which means they have greater protections against being closed down, and in recent months this has helped the community to take over one that would have otherwise closed. In many ways, Otley is lucky. People travel from far and wide to come to the West Yorkshire town, which borders the Yorkshire Dales and is overlooked by moorland, for a pint in a traditional pub.View image in fullscreenA group of friends who meet every week at the Old Cock in Otley.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverInside the Old Cock, an independent pub that has won awards from the Campaign for Real Ale, a fire roars and old men sup pints pulled by knowledgable bar staff.“[The breweries] have all put their prices up now,” said Lisa Choppen, the pub’s manager. She said customers did not always understand that pubs and bars had already cut back wherever they could.“They think a pint should just go up by 10p. We’ve been taking a big hit, the brewery is also taking a big hit. “Our biggest cost is staffing. We tried to cut hours when we can but if you’re too busy you can’t send people home. And we all want to earn a good wage.”Business rates were also crippling pubs, she said. “It’s cheaper to drink at home. You can get a bottle of wine for the same price as a large glass. But people come here because it’s social. You make friends here.”At the bar, many customers had views as they paid for their pints, some of which were already priced at £5.95, for a 6% beer from a local brewery.“It feels like the government is driving people indoors,” said Wayne Sutcliffe, a punter who had travelled from Sheffield. “That’s how you end up with loneliness, seclusion, isolation.”The woman he was talking to at the bar agreed: “An actual pub is going to be a thing of the past. This is all going to be flats.”Choppen added: “I always say: ‘It’s use it or lose it.’ If you don’t use your local, it won’t be here.”Explore more on these topicsPubsAlcoholWest YorkshireInflationHospitality industryEnglandUK cost of living crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the US, dietaryguidelinesrecommend that at least half of a person’s total grain intake be whole grains, and to “limit the intake of refined grains”. In the UK, theNational Health Servicesays that starches should account for about a third of a person’s food intake, and that a person “choose high fiber or whole grain varieties”.But are whole grains really superior to refined grain products like white rice, bread and pasta?They certainly have health benefits. According to theMayo Clinic, whole grains can help control cholesterol levels, weight and blood pressure, and can help lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes.That doesn’t mean refined grains need to be entirely avoided, experts say. In fact, focusing too much on specific foods and nutrients rather than one’s overall health and lifestyle can have more deleterious effects than eating a slice of white bread.Here’s what you need to know about whole grains versus refined grains.What is the difference between whole grains and refined grains?Grains are the edible, dry seeds of grasses grown for food. Every whole-grain kernel is made up of three components, explains Dena Champion, a registered dietitian at the Ohio State University Wexner medical center: a hard outer coating known as bran, a small core known as the germ and a large, starchy middle layer called endosperm.When a whole-grain kernel is processed to make a refined grain, like white flour, it is stripped of the germ and bran, leaving only the endosperm. The endosperm is the largest component of whole grain, but it also contains the fewest nutrients. Removing the germ and bran from grains also removes significant amounts of fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals.View image in fullscreenGrains of wheat in a mill in Khanna in India’s Punjab state, on 18 May 2022.Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty ImagesGenerally, this processing is performed to create softer flavors and textures, says Champion. Think of the light, fluffy mouthfeel of white bread as compared with the dense texture of whole rye bread.What are the benefits of whole grains?Whole grains contain more nutrients overall than refined grains. And the superstar nutrient? Fiber.The fibre phenomenon: 30 easy ways to get your fill of this life-changing nutrientRead moreThe fiber in whole grains helps improve digestive health by supporting gut bacteria and regular bowel movements, says Dr Lisa R Young, adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University. It also helps the body control blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing one’s risk of diabetes. Fiber also keeps you fuller for longer, Young says.Additionally, as registered dietitian Ashli Greenwald toldJohns Hopkins Medicine, whole grains contain phytonutrients, which are plant-based compounds that can reduce inflammation and may reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Some whole grains can also be “good sources of protein”, she says.What are the risks of a diet high in refined grains?By contrast, one of the biggest risks of a diet high in processed and refined grains is not getting adequate fiber, says Champion. “Most Americans are not consuming enough fiber, and consuming more whole grains can have a big impact,” she says.According to theAmerican Society for Nutrition, only 7% of American adults meet current fiber-intake recommendations: 14g of fiber per 1,000 calories.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Products made with refined grains are also more likely to be highly processed and to contain added sugar, saturated fat and sodium, Champion says – “for example, a packaged pastry”.Due to the lower levels of fiber and higher levels of highly processed ingredients, diets rich in refined grains are more likely to lead to poor gut health, increased blood sugar spikes and increased inflammation, says Young.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they are a staple of many cultural cuisines – sushi rice in Japan, for example, or baguettes in France. Thesecultures“often havebetterhealth markers than the US”, Young notes. She adds that these refined grains are merely one part of lifestyles that tend to include smaller portion sizes, less ultra-processed food, more balanced meals and more physical activity.One’s overall diet is more important for health than any single food, experts say. “No one needs to consume 100% whole grains 100% of the time,” Champion says. In general, she says, a healthy diet contains “whole grains more often than refined, lots of fruit and vegetables and plenty of fiber”.View image in fullscreenWhite rice as part of a seafood sambal dish at a food stall in Malang, East Java, Indonesia, on 16 January 2025.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesThe low-carb diet craze of the 90s and early aughts was “more about restricting than swapping or diversifying our diets”, says Malak Saddy, a registered and licensed dietitian. “If you wanted to have carbs, you could only have whole grains,” she recalls. As wonderful as whole grains can be, you “can also find those nutrients in fruits and vegetables”.It’s important not to oversell the promise of whole grains. As Saddy notes, diet is only one component of overall health.“If you don’t have access to food, or a safe place to sleep, or you’re not financially stable and don’t have a support system, then you can eat as many whole grains as you want and you still won’t receive the benefits of it,” she says. “Those other determinants are impacting you way more.”What’s more, refined grain products can often be more affordable than whole grain foods. A loaf of Ezekiel sprouted grain bread costs about $8, for example, while a loaf of classic white WonderBreadcosts just over $3.Whole grains and refined grains need to be morally neutralized, Saddy says.“It becomes a sense of elitism: because I eat whole grains, I am better than you,” she says. This attitude, she argues, creates a dynamic that can contribute to disordered eating patterns where some foods are deemed good and others bad. “That is much more harmful to our health than just eating the white rice or the white tortilla,” she says.How do you identify whole grain foods when shopping?Terms like “multigrain”, “wheat” or “made with whole grains” can be clever ways companies try to make products seem whole grain when they’re not, says Young.Instead, experts say, one should look at nutrition labels to determine a product’s ingredients and fiber content. Ingredients like “whole wheat” or “100% whole grain” should be named first on the list of ingredients, Young says. And a true whole grain product should contain at least 3g of fiber.One can also buy unprocessed whole grains – for example, quinoa, farro, oats or brown and black rice.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyCereals and grainsHealthFoodBreadRicePastafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sure, she could have bought her own tickets, but how safe would she be in a mosh pit, with her approval ratings at58% against, 17% in favour? I would argue still pretty safe. I personally disapprove quite strongly of Reeves’s performance in the exchequer: her dispiriting, intellectually shonky defeatism (for decisions, apparently, that can’t be helped) and empty boosterism (for the growth she thinks she can conjure). Yet I wouldn’t dream of ruining an evening of bouncy pop by accosting her, which I’m sure goes for most Carpenter fans. I wouldn’t even give her a piece of my mind at some musically appropriate event, like a Billy Bragg concert.Heidi Alexander started a half-hearted attempt to defend Reeves in an interview with Times Radio, which turned into an absolute knee-capping halfway through. “I actually sadly haven’t been to see any concerts at all over the last nine months,” said the transport secretary, “partly because I’ve been very, very busy.”There are two counts against the chancellor. She shouldn’t have accepted the tickets; the fact that she did meant she wasn’t busy enough. On that second point, I’m going to lodge a tiny defence. There is no right amount of busy for the chancellor to be. Any attempt to publicly exert herself in the national interest would look like a stunt, yet keeping her head down inspires no confidence. Really, the only right way to be in this situation is not-chancellor. If, for some reason, you absolutely have to be chancellor, then it is probably safest, whatever you do, never to visibly enjoy it. This strikes out any association at all with Carpenter, and even a covers band in a local pub.Let’s throw in a third count against her: this error was far from forced. After theshambles of last year, with Keir and the Taylor Swift tickets (which hesubsequently paid back), Keir and the “designer” glasses (it’s a red flag when any politician has a “designer” anything), Reeves’s own admission that before the election she’d accepted a cash donation from Juliet Rosenfeld for her campaign trail wardrobe, and the endless discussions all of this sparked about whether the new government was really any different from the old, it should have been obvious that freebies are to be avoided until such time as the public has forgotten every politician who has ever been profligate in the 21st century. Nobody can say how long this will take. I think I’ll be wondering what Boris Johnson’s wallpaper looked like until I die.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves, appears on Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg.Photograph: Jeff Overs/PAThat can all be filed under “optics”, and should have been obvious to this political generation, who were raised to ask “how will this look?” first and “is this important?” some time later, if at all. There’s a whole other vexed area, that of “vibe” – there’s a reason why Tony Blair could ask Noel Gallagher to Downing Street and it smell like the winds of change, rather than frivolous nonsense from a prime minister who should have been concentrating on his government’s minimum wage legislation. When there is optimism in the air, when people are feeling prosperous (never mind for now whether that feeling was warranted or merely a debt-fuelled mass delusion), leaders almost have a duty to echo that by visibly enjoying themselves.Contrast that with the sight of George Osborne at the London Paralympics in 2012. The former chancellorwas booed by spectatorsbecause his austerity measures had already hit disabled people so hard, and the juxtaposition of him then basking in the glory of Paralympians’ achievements was too much to take. But there was an underlying sense, too, that no politician, least of all the chancellor, can talk about tough choices in their day job, then throw on their chinos and enjoy the weekend. There pretty much has to be no visible enjoyment until the tough times have passed. Which is to say, even if Reeves had paid for her tickets, the news of her attending a Carpenter gig would probably still have generated opprobrium, though it may have taken a less verbal, more grunting form.Really there’s no answer to this, except, no rock’n’roll (or country pop) until the good times are also rolling.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Let’s have a clear planJagjit Chadha is professor of economics at Cambridge University and a former academic adviser to HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Treasury select committeeMon 24 Mar 2025 09.27 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 14.00 EDTShareBritain has a severe problem with its sluggish rate of growth. And while Labour wishes to tackle it, it is going about it the wrong way. The trend rate of economic growth has been successively revised down to just over 1%, which is less than half of our postwar norm. Twice-yearly incremental changes to tax and spending policy – such as thespring statement this Wednesday– will not meet the challenges of stimulating a sustained increase in the growth rate, which requires a significant nurturing of our intellectual and physical capital.TheBank of Englandand the government set monetary and fiscal policies respectively, and therefore GDP growth. These institutions, or rather successive bosses of the Treasury, chancellors, must then take much of the direct blame for our stagnation. Policy fails because it is not subject to sufficient timely independent scrutiny. While we are now beginning to understand the errors in policymaking since 2010, a commitment to examine economic performance earlier would help the UK move away from poor policy practice.Let me start with monetary policy. For most of the time since the financial crisis, the Bank of England’s interest rate policy has been ultra-loose. Low interest rates and the bond purchases programme (so-called quantitative easing, or QE) has stimulated a huge escalation in asset prices. And this has skewed wealth distribution towards those with assets, rather than those who live from income alone. Low interest rates have also allowed highly indebted firms, so-called zombie firms, to continue trading – but they do not typically invest in their workers or firm-specific capital. Both of these channels act to lower economic growth.In June 2023, the court of the Bank of England commissioned the former chair of the US central bank and Nobel prize winner,Ben Bernanke, to write a report on the Bank of England’s forecasting processes. Following thepublication of the reportlast April, we now also know that the Bank’s model and model team need fundamental reform as they failed in 2021-22 to understand the buildup in inflationary pressure. There is also the ongoing problem of the clarity and effectiveness of monetary policy committee (MPC) communication, which has meant that there has been excessive volatility in other interest rates as markets have often felt misled as to the Bank’s view. Monetary policy has simply been in the wrong space – too loose and opaque to understand.Simultaneously, government tax and spend policy has failed. Debt to GDP has practically doubled since the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was established in 2010 and the net worth of the public sector has also been in long-term and persistent decline. The basic problem with the fiscal framework is that it disincentivises public investment and research and development (R&D) as it encouraged successive chancellors to trim public investment in order to meet the fiscal rule for debt.Unfortunately, it is precisely these areas of government expenditure that have been systematically shown to stimulate growth in many academic studies. Successive chancellors have basically offered policies that favour existing structures and interests with minimal oversight, where what we need, for example, is regulatory reform of public-good providers and a consolidation in civil service numbers.As a result of these failures and in the interests of transparency, I would support an inquiry into QE, which seems likely to lose us roughly £100bn – and dwarfs the current concern in meeting the arbitrary fiscal rules. This is because the Bank is now selling the bonds it bought at a lower price than their purchase. It is also time to review the fiscal framework that has a fundamental flaw in its design: the use of the instrument of policy (debt to GDP) as the objective of policy. If we really want to bring about a better standard of living with fiscal policy, we cannot at the same time adopt arbitrary restrictions on its use.TheLabourgovernment has declared its aim to bring about a persistent increase in growth, but also to have only one fiscal event a year. But growth has stalled since July’s general election and the March statement is increasingly sounding like a second budget. We need to have a different type of spring statement: one that focuses on our plans and progress towards higher growth and a better standard of living. We do not need yet more incremental changes to tax and spending.The chancellor should commit to an annual spring statement that provides a thorough outline of the economy, which includes an analysis of growth prospects and policies being considered. Also, because economic growth is slow to change and uncertain, we need real-time markers, which are consistent with higher growth, so we can monitor progress.Reeves to reveal biggest UK spending cuts since austerity in spring statementRead moreLate last year, the Treasury finally published anarea of research interests (ARI) document: other departments had done so for years. The ARI sets out the economic issues on which the Treasury is hoping to encourage academic thinking and research. As such, the ARI provides a rather good scheme for the structure of the statement and may encourage the Treasury to commission or invite submissions. The report could easily be turned around by a new unit in Whitehall and ought to be reviewed by the under-resourced Economic Advisory Council, which at last count only had two, albeit excellent, academic members.The final document would be published on the day of the statement and form the intellectual basis for the chancellor’s speech, as well as encouraging a more authoritative debate on policies for growth. But most importantly, it would force the Treasury and the chancellor to take more direct ownership and responsibility for economic growth and living standards.Such an event would set the agenda for the autumn budget and have the considerable benefit of encouraging longer-term thinking on public policy. The advantage of an annual commitment to such a statement means that we will hear about progress since the previous year and so track success or failure.The clock is already ticking on a government pursuing growth; according to the latest numbers, the economy has stalled once again. We need to adopt a fundamentally different approach to our growth problem: open the windows at the Treasury and let in light and air.Jagjit Chadha is professor of economics at Cambridge University.

But then one comes to operational matters, the category in whichlast Friday’s eventswould fall.“The business accepts that absolute operational, system and infrastructure resilience is impossible,” it starts, adding vaguely that it will work to mitigate impacts “within the risk/return balance set by the company”. In summary: “In the pursuit of its objectives,Heathrow airportis willing to accept, in some circumstances, risks that may result in some financial loss or reputational exposure.”So one question is whether Heathrow regarded the risk of closing the entire airport for a day in response to the loss of power from a single substation as one of those things that would simply have to be taken on the chin. Did “the risk/return balance” judge that it wasn’t worth spending a large sum of money to lessen the impact of an event judged unlikely to occur?That would not be inconsistent with how Thomas Woldbye, Heathrow’s chief executive,has described the airport’s response. The backup systems “worked the way they should”, he said and he was proud of his staff. The reason it took so long to reopen – despite the airport having sufficient uninterrupted power from two other substations, asNational Grid’s boss was quick to point out– was that internal systems for everything from baggage belts to escalators had to be “reconfigured” and tested.Yet we need to know more. Does the reconfiguration process really have to be that slow and complex? Could investment in slicker systems have make the switch to alternative power supplies quicker and meant that fewer than 1,350 flights had to be stopped? Airlines will be interested to hear how Heathrow’s willingness to accept “some financial loss” was assessed in this context. After all, as Woldbye also said in interviews, it is up to airlines, not airports, to cover hotel bills and other disruption costs to passengers.The point is that the failure of a substation is not an unimaginable event. The blaze at North Hyde may have been unprecedented, but the same risk report says Heathrow modelled contingency plans for major events, including “loss of a critical supplier or service”. If the modelled response was followed, which seems to be gist of Woldbye’s account, the question is whether a full day’s closure was deemed to be acceptable.If so, it also matters who signed off on that judgment. Let’s hope we hear from John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow’s chief executive for 10 years before Woldbye, since he is now chairof Sizewell C, the proposed new nuclear power station in Suffolk, an operation where 100% reliable power in and out of the plant around the clock is very definitely an issue of safety.

Repressive policing, methods of detention and controlling dissent, forcing humans to produce goods and services for overlords in the metropolis, or even mass enslavement and killing: all “boomerang” back into that metropolis. First, they are used against those who are seen as inferior; then, they are deployed even against those citizens with full rights and privileges if they dare to question authority. In short, the remote other eventually becomes the intimate familiar.Donald Trump’s second term has sofar been a case studyin how systems built for those whose rights have been diluted or taken awayeventually devour thosewho were assumed to be safe from such violations. There are three ways in which this process of rebounding happens. The first is through the creation of a domestic caste system that mirrors the one outside a country’s borders, as demonstrated in the recent treatment of those foreigners with permanent US residency and valid work visas whoexpressed dissenting views on Gaza.Under Trump, their actions meet a threshold of insubordination that justifies their arrest, detention and deportation. The human rights of those individuals, such as due process, are cancelled. In allying themselves with Palestinians and against US foreign policy, they are demoted to the level of those Palestinians in their treatment by the US government. The tenuousness of permanent residency, valid work visas, green cards, marriage to US citizens and parenthood to American children starts to become clear. These are all conditional rights that can be stripped away if, in your alliances and solidarities, you identify yourself as a subject of American power. You mark yourself out as a citizen of the periphery daring to ask for the rights of the citizens of the core.Trump’s invocationof the 1798 Alien Enemies Act is an almost too-on-the-nose demonstration of that two-tier system. Laws that were designed centuries ago, and have only been used to create legal vacuums on US soil in order to detain foreigners, create a second class of human. Franklin Roosevelt relied on the act tocreate domestic internment campsduring the second world war, in which more than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were detained. Another order that he issued, and that mandated the internment of US citizens,was only overturned in 2018. If it had not been, Trump would no doubt be using the law to extend arrests and detentions to US citizens for their political opinions as well.I am a Palestinian political prisoner in Louisiana. I am being targeted for my activism | Mahmoud KhalilRead moreThat legal infrastructure, no matter how dormant, is always open to reactivation and capture. A similar process unfolds within the workings of an immigration complex that is already opaque and reflexively punitive. The second rebound mechanism is via this sort of infrastructure. The US immigration system is a vast enterprise of bureaucracy, employment, detention centres and private companies thatchannels and imprisons immigrants. It is also a system that, even before Trump, was one of legal sinkholes and almost infinite licence. Border guards have the final decision-making authority on whether you enter the US, no matter what visa you are issued from an embassy abroad; customs agents have the right to search devices; and, if you are detained and deported,that whole processcan happen without you being given access to a lawyer or standing before a judge. Detention for many is astate of extended limbo.Combine a system so large with a regime that enables it while weakening the judicial and legal proceedings that act as a check on its worst impulses, and you have a recipe for overreach and impunity. On his first day in office, Trumpsigned an executive orderthat gave even more power to border officials to “identify all resources that may be used to ensure that all aliens seeking admission to the United States, or who are already in the United States, are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible”. With increased deportations of undocumented migrants being a flagship policy of Trump’s campaign, and the empowerment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to achieve that end, a practical and political dragnet has been cast so wide that it’s catching a lot more than intended. It is no longer only those whose skin colour, paperwork or political opinions throw them into uncertainty.Over the past few weeks,German tourists were arrestedwhen they tried to enter the US entirely legally through the southern border, and detained for weeks before being deported. Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen with a work visa, wasarrested and detainedfor two weeks but told to “mentally prepare” herself for “months”. AFrench scientist was denied entryto the US when his phone was searched and messages critical of Trump were found. Those who have been added to the immigration detention prison population, from Mooney toMahmoud Khalil, a green-card holder and recent graduate of Columbia University, testify to the state of detainees they met there. “Justice,”Khalil wrote from detention, “escapes the contours of this nation’s immigration facilities.”Which brings us to the third way in which the boomerang effect takes place – through the erosion of norms and standards, a cannibalisation of the very political systems meant to govern and protect those at the centre. On 18 March, Trump called for theimpeachment of a federal judgewho issued a temporary ban on deportations as ordered by the administration. The confrontation between Trump and the judiciary has precipitated aconstitutional crisisthat is shaking the foundations of US politics. The system of checks and balances – the equality of the legislative, executive and judicial branches under the constitution – is threatened by Trump’s open defiance and desired subjugation of all to the executive office. This is against a backdrop of thelimiting of academic freedom, theviolation of the first amendment, and a disregard for the US constitutiondescribed by expertsas a “blitzkrieg on the law”.In this, there is something that can be seen everywhere in regimes that either have or crave absolute power. In order to seize authority and run a whole country according to the interests of a sovereign, more and more parties must be disenfranchised and repressed. The imperial form of governance is the prototype of what is required to exert control in the presence of mass dissent. But all political systems with large components that subdue a significant portion of the population cannot continue without those components overtaking the entire machine. It is a simple, almost elegant fact; something like a law of nature. But a nation that withholds its best ideals from some will end up losing them for all.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS constitution and civil libertiesUS immigrationTrump administrationMahmoud KhalilUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Why can’t the CPS see it?Nels AbbeyAnother ‘hate crime’ case against a person of colour has collapsed. The fact it even got to court reveals an alarming ignoranceMon 24 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 07.33 EDTShareIt was summer 2014. Driving back to London with my baby daughter after a day out in Waltham Abbey, I was waiting for a traffic light to turn green. Pulled up beside me on my right-hand side was a long-haired, long-bearded man on a classic motorcycle. He looked around my car, and shook his head in seeming disapproval. Suddenly – with absolutely no provocation – he roared out “FUCKING NIGGERS”. Then he jumped the red light and sped off.Every decent person could see that as a credible hate crime. But there are exchanges less clear cut, with motivations more arguable. How should society – and the law – deal with those?Earlier this month, without scrutiny or fanfare, theCrown Prosecution Serviceabandoned a lengthy attempt to prosecute a recent university graduate for her use, in a jovial conversation on social media, of the word “nigga”. The case turned on an exchange on X (formerly Twitter) on 27 August 2023, after Newcastle United had been beaten 2-1 by Liverpool. Jamila A, a 21-year-old Black British woman, in conversation on X with an African American friend and referring to the Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, quipped:“@******** i’m so pissed off let me get my hands on that fuckin isak nigga.”The tweet was picked up by a data monitoring organisation hired by the Football Association, and months after the tweet was posted, the police were at her door.She was taken into custody for questioning, subsequently arrested and charged with being in violation of theMalicious Communications Act 1988. After media interest, the CPS “downgraded” the charge to a violation of theCommunications Act 2003: to be heard in a magistrates’ trial, where a conviction was more likely.Would Sam Kerr have been charged if she were a man – or white – or straight? | Anna Cody and Giridharan SivaramanRead moreWhen contacted about the caseby the Independent newspaperJuly of last year, the CPS responded: “Hate crime has a profound impact on victims and communities. Being from an ethnic minority background does not provide a defence to racially abusing someone. Our commitment to tackling these abhorrent crimes through fair and impartial prosecution is unwavering.”But on5 March, after a year of causing Jamila A needless anxiety, thecharges were dropped. There was brief mention of the outcome on social media and among interested journalists. The world moved on.Still, there is an issue here, for Jamila was just the latest in an ever-growing line of Black and brown people to be targeted by a state that absurdly fails or refuses to understand the difference between stark and hurtful racism and the use of terms that have become common intra-communal parlance.Racism is a terrible blight. All robust effort should be made by citizens to protect their fellow humans from it. But context is important. As I see it, the authorities made the conscious decision to ignore the glaringly crucial context that these were just two young Black people conversing like two young Black people about another young Black person. They were not hosting a Klan rally, and there was nothing obscene or out of the ordinary in their conversation. It’s clear to me that the player was not subject to any incitement to hate at the hands of Jamila A. As her lawyers said in a statement, “No evidence of any party finding the tweet offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing had been provided”.For the benefit of the police and the CPS: the substantial difference between the biker screaming racism at my daughter and me, and Jamila referring to Isak as she did is not a matter of spelling or semantics but intent, history, culture and community. The biker subjected us to the words – and mannerisms – of white supremacy and dehumanisation. But that experience and the experience of a Black friend or even a Black stranger referring to me as or calling me the N-word are galaxies apart.There have been other misapplications of outrage and concern. Last year’s so-called emoji trial ended in the crown court acquittal of a Black man charged aftersending a raccoon emojito a Black Conservative politician on social media. The word “coon” has long been a viciously racist slur directed by white racists towards Black people. But there is also, among Black Britons and African Americans, the term “cooning” – a form of critique directed at Black people alleged to be collaborating with or pandering to racism in order to curry favour. Last September, Marieha Hussain,a teacher of south Asian origin,was acquittedof a racially aggravated public order offence after she carried a placard depicting Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman as “coconuts”: one of many forms of satirical critique used about visible minorities (and formerly colonised people) alleged to over-identify with the tastes, cultural practices and behaviours of their historical colonial overloards. District Judge Vanessa Lloyd ruled that the placard carried by Hussain was “part of the genre of political satire”. So, a heavily pregnant woman faced trial for obvious satire.All the instances involved the weaponisation of terms that are sometimes controversial, sometimes satirical, sometimes unpleasant and sometimes loving, but widely recognised and accepted as intra-communal language – and, therefore, have an entirely different communal resonance.They show the very hate crime laws that were designed to protect minorities are now being used to persecute them. For some, that may be the intention. But it erodes the credibility of the state to protect and police a multicultural society such as our own. The words and images in question may not have been kind, but neither were they reason for intervention by police officers and courts.Just as the word “queer” has been reclaimed by the LGBTQ+ community from the speech of homophobes, there has been a wider reclamation of oppressive, denigrative and dehumanising language. It comes from a place of community, kinship, shared characteristics and a history of oppression.And it is interesting, is it not, that there is no sign of such intrusive policing when the N-word as deployed by rappers is being used to generate billions in profits for large, predominately white-owned companies?There should be a conversation about this. Certainly, there should be a prosecutorial rethink. The law is based on statutes and interpretation, but surely its root is in common sense. There is enough real hate crime around.

Organisation upheaval must not distract us from what matters mostMon 24 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 08.04 EDTShareIwas the health secretary when NHS England was set up. Although there are advantages to depoliticising operational decisions, it has led to massive and counterproductive overcentralisation. The NHS has become the most micromanaged healthcare system in the world. Hospital chief executives are frequently working to more than 100 operational targets, making innovation and longer-term change impossible. GPs have about 80 of them. So as long asscrapping NHS Englanddoes not mean replacing bureaucratic overcentralisation with political overcentralisation, Wes Streeting is on the right track.But I am worried about something else being missed. In the huge blizzard of organisational change, there is a risk of eyes going off the ball when it comes to broader patient safety risks. In December, the charity I set up,Patient Safety Watch, published a report put together by a team of people at Imperial College London led byProf Ara Darzi. It suggested that if our standards were as high as the top 10% of OECD countries, every year fewer patients would die. Twelve out of 22 patient safety metrics have been going in the wrong direction in the past two years. It is a wake-up call about the tragedy of avoidable death, highlighted magnificently by Merope Mills in her successful campaign forMartha’s ruleafter the tragic loss of her daughter.Why is this a concern? Because right now, tens of thousands of civil servants are starting the process of reapplying for their jobs after the axing of NHS England. In 2013, I saw with my own eyes the upheaval this kind of structural change causes. So my plea to Streeting is not to let organisational upheaval distract him from the gritty business of making sure we improve standards of patient care on the frontline.A figure of 13,500 avoidable deathsa year isn’t just a statistic, it is 37 patients lostevery single day. Thirty-seven families whose lives are tragically and needlessly ruined. And a massive cost for the NHS because,according to the OECD, about 10% of the cost of modern healthcare systems is putting things right that should not have gone wrong. That is £15bn of savings no one would disagree with right in front of our eyes.The biggest area of risk is NHS maternity units. The bill for settling litigation claims for maternity issues has risen tonearly £2bn a year. In the decade up to the start of the pandemic, the NHS made real strides in reducing baby deaths and stillbirths, but the latest data suggests that they are going back up. Particularly worrying are the ethnic disparities involved: black women giving birth are nearly three times more likely to die than white women.A major investigation by the midwife and community activist Donna Ockenden intomaternity services at Nottingham University hospitals trustis uncovering some harrowing failures of care. But even more worrying is that those failures appear to be part of a pattern: she found the same issues at Shrewsbury and Telford in her 2020 report. Dr Bill Kirkup found similar things going wrongin his reports on East Kentin 2022 and Morecambe Bay in 2015.8:48‘Fix poverty, fix health’: A day in the life of a ‘failing’ NHSEvery one of those reports has identified preventable deaths, staff shortages and deep-rooted cultural failings such as an overemphasis on so-called “normal births” which in practice lead to delays in vitally needed interventions by obstetricians. It is true that overall staff numbers have been going up and theNHS long-term workforce planhas doubled or nearly doubled the number of doctor, nurse and midwife training places. But if we are going to stop babies dying or becoming disabled because of medical error, we cannot wait for the decade it will take them to come onstream.What then needs to happen? First, it is essential that improving maternity safety is part of the new 10-year plan as it was in the last one. That worked: between2013 and 2019, extended perinatal mortality fell by 18%– from 6.04 per 1,000 total births to 4.96 – equivalent to about 770 fewer baby deaths a year. We also need a system to make sure that recommendations from public inquiries, the independent Health Services Safety Investigation Body (HSSIB) and coroners are actually implemented. There needs be a central repository of recommendations with public accountability as to who is responsible for implementing which ones by an agreed date.Poor NHS maternity care in danger of becoming normalised, regulator warnsRead moreIt is also critical to put in place a turnaround programme for the 10% of trusts where maternity safety is rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). After theMid Staffs scandal, which saw hundreds of patients die as a result of poor care at Stafford hospital,Bruce Keoghled a national review of 14 NHS trusts with high mortality rates, leading to11 being placed in special measureswith high-level central support. Most of them were turned round fast. Maternity services need a similar intervention based on robust, independent inspections by a reformed CQC we need to see back on its feet.Finally – and most challengingly – we need a renewed focus on dismantling the blame culture that makes it difficult for clinicians to be open about mistakes and failures, and therefore make sure the system learns the necessary lessons. This problem has beenlargely cracked in the aviation industry, which has made dramatic progress in improving passenger safety. It has proved much harder in healthcare systems where death is inevitably a more normal occurrence. But no system has thought harder about the ethical issues involved than the NHS – if anyone can solve this, it is surely us.Tackling these issues cannot wait until after new and better NHS structures are put in place. If England had the same maternity safety levels as Sweden,1,000 more babies would live every year. Nothing would demonstrate better that the NHS really is turning a corner.Jeremy Hunt served as secretary of state for health, later secretary of state for health and social care, from 2012 to 2018Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s not a picture I recogniseMon 24 Mar 2025 13.26 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 19.23 EDTShareI’ve started watching this great fantasy series from the mid-90s and early 00s – it’s calledFriends. It follows a group of humanoid characters who treat childbirth as a social occasion, wear full makeup postpartum and never look after their babies. The fantasy element is very clever – so subtle in fact that it is only now, watching it decades later, as a parent myself, that I even noticed it.Perhaps back in the 90s the otherworldly nature of Phoebe Buffay waiting to give birth to triplets in a room chock-full of her wise-cracking friends, despite it being a high-risk pregnancy, was understood. Maybe the way that Ross Geller’s baby Ben is delivered under a sheet, by an obstetrician apparently working blind, was a well-known speculative fiction trope back then. Possibly when it originally aired, parents were simply amazed by the special effects involved when Rachel Green was shown sitting in a coffee shop gossiping about her love life, three weeks after giving birth, in full makeup and blow-dry, high heels, a pair of size 10 jeans – and entirely without her baby. Whatever was going on, no one at the time seemed fazed by this uncanny valley where babies breastfeed just once in their life, never get ill and are put behind glass in hospital nurseries to be glanced at by visiting relatives who then have sex in cupboards.Luckily, television depictions of birth and parenting have come a long way since I was a child. And I was paying attention, even then. For instance, I remember the scene from Cold Feet in which Karen stormed into her husband David’s office demanding that he hire her a nanny (nannies are a big feature of these shows, you will notice). What I didn’t remember, and only spotted on a recent rewatch, is that in a preceding scene Karen is shown tearing her hair out at the kitchen table, while trying to feed porridge to her toddler. Except the toddler has a dummy in his mouth, rendering him entirely unable to eat any porridge even if he wanted to.This sort of continuity error might seem small-scale to some of you, but it’s the sort of glaring misunderstanding of early parent life that makes me wonder if anyone on that writing, directing and production team was regularly feeding their own child.In recent years, the number of television shows showing something a little closer to what I recognise as pregnancy, birth and early child-wrangling have exploded:Motherland, The Letdown,Trying, Catastrophe, Better Things and Breeders have all made some effort to involve a little domestic labour in their plotlines. Some of them let the babies actually cry and breastfeed. Occasionally the parents look tired and can’t make social arrangements. Sometimes, the children in these shows even have lines.I have no doubt that this is, in part at least, because there are more women writing, directing and producing television today. And before you say it, yes, I know Marta Kauffman createdFriendsand I also know that she has three children. But as I’ve already pointed out, Friends is a fantasy series. It’s magical realism. Kauffman knows that, I know that and I’m sure Lisa Kudrow, who got pregnant during season four, knows that too.I’m not so oblivious to the needs of television drama and comedy to think that you can make a 20-minute episode showing a woman sitting in a dark room at 3am trying to guide a nipple into her baby’s ear, in a delirium of exhaustion while wondering idly if she’s got threadworms again. But as books such asBecky Barnicoat’s new graphic novelCry When the Baby Crieshave shown, the comedy and drama involved in pregnancy and parenthood are right there, in heart-rending, breathtaking detail, if we just allow people to show them.Maybe books have always done it better. About 40 years after they were published, the classic Jill Murphy children’s books Five Minutes’ Peace, Peace at Last and Whatever Next! still speak more directly to the experience of being a parent than many film and television depictions we’ve had since.Mrs Large from Five Minutes’ Peace may be a bipedal marmalade-eating elephant living in the suburbs. But she’s still a more realistic parent than Rachel Green.Nell Frizzell is the author ofHolding the Baby: Milk, Sweat and Tears from the Frontline of MotherhoodExplore more on these topicsFriendsOpinionTelevisionParents and parentingChildrenFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Britain,we’re told, must tighten its belt. Welfare payments for the sick and disabled will beshrunk. Public services from transport to criminal justice faceleanertimes. The language is that of necessity. There is no money. The choices are hard, but unavoidable. So runs the script.The idea that painful cuts are inevitable is political theatre. Either Rachel Reeves knows the constraints are self-imposed – or, more troublingly, believes they are real. Last October, she announced £190bn in extra spending, £140bn in additionalborrowingand £35bn more in taxes than previously forecast. The Treasuryviewis “you can’t pour that amount of money into the state and call it austerity”.Yet you can – if tens of billions are siphoned off in debt interest to uphold economic orthodoxy rather than meet social needs. The UK now spends more than£100bna year on debt interest – a postwar high – not because it is bankrupt, but to a substantial degree because the Bank of England is offloading vast amounts of gilts, bought during quantitative easing, at a loss. The Treasury must cover those losses, while the flood of gilts drives up interest rates on new borrowing. This isquantitative tightening(QT), with the state left to foot the bill for soaring interest costs and Bank payouts. Yet the Office for Budget Responsibilityassumesthat it will continue, locking in high costs.This isn’t prudence – it’s ideology posing as policy. No money forfree school mealsor youth clubs, ministers warn, yet billions pour into the pockets of bondholders, for the sake of “stability”. Ending QT could redirect that money to public services – a better priority than reassuring markets withsymbolicgestures.If the Bank won’t stop on its own, it must be pushed. Gordon Brown granted it independence in 1998, but included asafeguard: in “extreme economic circumstances” ministers can override the Bank in the public interest. If £100bn in spending isn’t extreme, what is? QT should be paused. The Bank standsaloneamong G7 peers in actively selling bonds and demanding Treasury cash to cover paper losses. This is self-defeating in a dangerous world. Gilts could be managed strategically. Before New Labour,Kenneth Clarkeoftenignoredthe Bank’s advice – and was often right. But such thinking is now heresy in a political culture that treats Bank independence as sacred, even when it deepens public hardship.Here lies the deeper irony. The chancellor won’t raise taxes on thewealthy, relax her fiscal rules or borrow more. So she claims that there is no alternative to cuts. But these are self-imposed constraints – combined with deference to an unelected monetary authority – that sustain the illusion of necessity. Labour has been here before:Philip Snowdendid the same in the 1930s, and nearly destroyed his party.Ms Reeves’s spring statement is a performance. She asks the public to accept a diminished state as the result of external forces, when it’s the result of internal dogma. Worse, she may believe the script – failing torecallthe tools once used to steer interest rates, debt and public investment. Austerity isn’t the price of prudence but the cost of forgetting. The chancellor wears the mask of tough decisions, but on a stage built on myths. The better choice would be to trim the Bank’s power, even if the spotlight has been carefully trained away from its damaging role.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Such connections are associated with access to resources and opportunities of various kinds. Do governments do enough to influence this aspect of our lives and encourage net upward social mobility rather than perpetuating inherited wealth and status? A new British-American study suggests not, and makes some striking recommendations for change.Using data from Facebook alongside public sources and a survey, the researchers – some of whom work for Facebook’s owner, Meta, and others for the UK government’s behavioural insights team (known as the “nudge unit”) –mapped friendships across the UK. Their finding is that children from poorer backgrounds who live in less economically segregated communities have higher incomes as adults. Those who grow up in the 10% least-connected local authority areas can expect to earn £5,100 less annually than those in the 10% most-connected ones. There are big regional variations, with more connectedness in big cities and the south-east, and much less in deprived parts of Wales and Northern Ireland.Such findings are intuitive and unsurprising to anyone with progressive politics. A commitment tobreaking downthe rigid class distinctions and prejudices of the past, to distribute opportunities more evenly, is what lies behind the left’s traditionalsupport for comprehensive education, the NHS andmixed communitiesin which people who own their homes live alongside less wealthy renters.The intermingling that the sharing of neighbourhoods and institutions encourages brings benefits to everyone by promoting social cohesion and trust. Importantly, it protects vulnerable households from neglect and social exclusion due to the lack of transport links, leisure facilities and shops that can afflict poor areas. It is encouraging to learn that, despite theshameful levelsof poverty andworsening social mobilityof recent years, the poorest half of the UK population have about half (47%) of their friendships with the higher-income half (in the US the figure is 39%). Such ties can be seen as a form of resistance to the further entrenching of privilege.Future research will probe the role of schools and health. This study notes that poorer people make more friends in their neighbourhoods, while richer ones make them at university. And it points to the “unique” role of universities in exposing young people to wealthier peers – highlighting thesocial-mobility function of higher education. More unexpected, perhaps, is a proposal for policies to promote hobbies and clubs, because the friendships made in these settings are especially likely to cross class boundaries.Those at the top and bottom ends of the wealth scale have fewest friends from other groups – a finding that backs up existing knowledge about thesocially corrosive effects of inequality. Opportunities to boost the social capital of those who need more of it must not be allowed to distract from their pressing needs for higher incomes and better housing.There is an irony in having Meta as a partner in this research, given the weight of evidence that attention-greedy and underregulated social media businesses are themselves degrading social life in key respects, andfuelling social and political polarisation. All the same, this is a valuable study.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter fromElizabeth AtkinsonMon 24 Mar 2025 13.40 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 13.47 EDTShareYour report says Rachel Reeves “has few options left” (How did it come to this? Labour’s journey from landslide victory to ‘deep unhappiness’, 22 March), but in fact she has numerous options. Patriotic Millionaires, alongside Tax Justice UK, hasproposed 10tax reforms to raise £60bn for public services. And on 18 March, it told MPs that a tax of 2% on wealth above £10m could raise £460m a week for our country’s crumbling finances.Prof Richard Murphy hasidentifiedat least seven alternatives for Reeves, saying that to pretend the only options are higher taxes or austerity is wrong. And Prof Helen Goodman (Letters, 21 March) even identifies around £35bn in savings from three simple taxation reforms.Both Reeves and Keir Starmer cite morality to justify their cuts. But where’s the morality or justice when the UK has the highest proportion of billionaire wealth derived from monopolies and cronyism among G7 countries and UK billionaires saw theircollective wealth increaselast year by £35m a day to £182bn as four new billionaires were created, taking the total to 57, and the queues for food banks continue to grow?Unequal societies, theIMFandOECDhave found, grow more slowly than more equal nations, and social mobility collapses in countries riddled with inequality. Tax reform can address inequality, so is better for growth, and it will raise the money that Reeves says Britain needs. What’s stopping her?David MurrayWallington, LondonDespite what the chancellor might think, the Office for Budget Responsibility’s updated forecasts do not provide her with “ammunition to justify the welfare cuts”, especially when she has other options (Reeves under pressure as UK borrowing sharply exceeds forecasts, 21 March).Rejecting a wealth tax because it is easy for the rich to move their assets offshore is simply another attempt to deflect attention from this government’s outright refusal totackle inequality.Reminding MPs about Liz Truss’s disastrous fiscal statement and that it was working people who paid the price is also shameful. That mini-budget focused on reducing taxes and increasing borrowing, neither of which is necessary in this week’s spring statement.Does the country want to hear about hedge fund managers celebrating again after Rachel Reeves’s fiscal announcements, as they didlast October? At the very least, capital gains and income tax should be equalised, tax loopholes enjoyed by limited liability partnerships closed, anduncollected billions from loopholestargeted.Labour MPs must not accept any cuts. Have they not read about families beingworse off in 2030or modern economists discrediting trickle-down economics, or even seen the polls? They are sleepwalking into disaster, which will start inRuncorn and Helsby.Bernie EvansLiverpoolI read John Harris’s account of shadowing a personal care provider in Bury (Opinion, 23 March) with tears in my eyes for the 93-year-old woman who stands to lose her daily care visit if, or when, the care agency is forced to withdraw its services for lack of funding. The tears are still flowing, but now they’re prompted by anger at the assertion, in an editorialon the same day, that Rachel Reeves is making “enthusiastic noises” about substantial help in funding Manchester United’s new stadium, 15 miles from the woman whose negligible human contact looks set to be a casualty of spending cuts.Elizabeth AtkinsonLondonDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

But there’s a solution: desperate rich people, 11 March) interesting. And we concur with Prof Roger Bayston’s views on the problems getting innovative devices into commercial production, through regulatory hurdles, and into clinical use (Letters, 17 March).These problems are compounded when the novel device is aimed at treatment for a rare disease or a small subsection of a more common problem, in our case the development of a haemodialysis device for treating small babies. This device, the Newcastle infant dialysis and ultrafiltration system (Nidus), was invented in response to parent pressure to “do something” when newborn babies undergoing major surgery (often for congenital abnormalities like abdominal or heart conditions) went into kidney failure and needed haemodialysis to keep them alive and allow time for their own kidneys to recover.This is an unmet area of clinical need for babies who require dialysis but can’t be treated with peritoneal dialysis, and in the UK there are no haemodialysis devices to do this safely. Thus, faced with no alternatives, machines designed and only licensed for adults and children over 8kg are used, despite manufacturers’ warnings and known potential serious problems in doing so. There is no register of devices used off-licence and any problems arising.The new Nidus device has been developed over 20 years from manual circuits through various prototypes to the current device, with the time, expertise and skills of NHS medical engineering, nursing and medical staff. It has undergone a successful clinical trial funded by the National Institute forHealthand Care Research (ie the taxpayer). However, it is now stuck, lacking relevant expertise and funds to get through regulatory approvals. Nobody is going to make money out of this device and manufacturing companies are limited in what they can spend to aid development.In the UK, while there are pathways for “orphan” drugs used in rare diseases, there aren’t for “orphan” devices like this. We clearly need regulatory systems for patient safety, but with pathways for breakthrough technology.Dr Heather Lambert and Dr Malcolm CoulthardRetiredpaediatricnephrologists, Newcastle upon TyneHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It would have turned the game upside down so we decided to take him out straight away. You could see the huge effort Jude put in the first game and he didn’t seem so fresh. I didn’t want to take the risk so took him off.”If England’s performance against an opponent attempting a brick-wall defence was not always easy on the eye, Tuchel was otherwise happy enough following his second win to follow thedefeat of Albaniaon Friday.“The organisation of the camp was top,” the head coach said. “The players make the difference, they reminded me instantly why I was excited to take the job. You need these type of matches and the tension that not everything falls into place in the first minute.”James scored a first-half free‑kick in his first England start since September 2022 and came in for high praise from his former Chelsea manager. “I know Reecey [James] and the quality the boy has is amazing,” said Tuchel, who added that he had been in “close contact” with a player he declared was of the “highest level”, and “in a good space mentally”.Tuchel said: “He has every right to be proud and happy with his performance.

After he and his teammate, Charles Leclerc, were disqualified from theChinese Grand Prixon Sunday, he may have to consider taking up residence again, as a rocked Ferrari deal with a disheartening opening to the season.Ferrari have never endured a double disqualification before in the 75 years they have participated in F1, an embarrassment for which they held up their hands. They conceded that the skid block on the floor of Hamilton’s car had been worn 0.5mm below the limit, while Leclerc’s ride was 1kg below the minimum weight requirement. The F1 governing body, the FIA, said Ferrari acknowledged a“genuine error”and the team said it was a “mistake” they would endeavour not to repeat.McLaren teammates Norris and Piastri ‘nervous and excited’ by F1 title duelRead moreWhat made the events even more striking was the extraordinary turnaround they represented; that what had started so well could come clattering down about their ears with such calamity. Hamilton had taken pole andthe win in the sprint race on Saturdaywith absolute elation at his first success with the team. Finally, here was the Ferrari that had been expected this season, a competitive car mixing at the very front.Twenty-four hours later, the picture had changed drastically.Ferrarimade changes to the set-up of the car before the race, which Hamilton said he believed were a mistake. It is hard to argue.After a strong sprint,Hamilton and Leclerc qualified fifth and sixthand the race did not improve from there. Hamilton struggled for pace almost from the off, to the extent he offered to move over for Leclerc and duly let his teammate through. New tyres made no appreciable difference to Hamilton’s pace and the pair never came within a sniff of the leaders.The disqualification three hours later brought the curtain down with bleak finality. It cost the team 18 points. They are 61 behind the leaders, McLaren, after only two meetings and, almost unthinkably, equal with Williams. Ferrari called it a misjudgment. It is the sort of misjudgment they can ill afford if they intend on challenging for a title any time soon. Nor should it be one they take easily, not least because we have been here before.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton leads Charles Leclerc early in the race.Photograph: Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty ImagesIn 2023, Hamilton, driving for Mercedes, and Leclerc, for Ferrari, weredisqualified at the US Grand Prixfor excessive wear to the skid block, or plank as it is commonly known. The plank – not made of wood but of glass-reinforced plastic – sits beneath the car. Its purpose is simple: to prevent teams from running their cars too low, a limit imposed to maintain some control on the top speeds because the lower they run the quicker they can go. Excessive wear is a straight disqualification, there are no grey areas.Both teams offered mitigation at the time. That the track was bumpy, that it being a sprint weekend minimised the time they had to set up the car. China, too, was a sprint weekend but no other team suffered excessive wear, while the track, just resurfaced, was praised for its smoothness, making such a miscalculation even more egregious.It may as much have been the result of a team pushing every margin. “We have to be at the limit on every single item of the car,” the team principal, Fred Vasseur, told the Race last year. “We have to be aggressive and it’s a challenge to be at the limit of the weight, to be at the limit of the plank, to be at the limit of the cooling, to be at the limit of the fuel. It’s a challenge because in the end you are taking more and more risk.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A notable feature of his time in charge is calm, stable management. He has made a point of eliminating blame culture and ensuring the team do not swing from highs to lows, to protect team members and allow them to flourish. Those strengths, Leclerc believes, have made a huge difference.The reaction to this setback will be key, both understanding why it happened and how to deal with it. Were the team trying too hard, aware they weren’t close enough to McLaren, Mercedes and Red Bull? Was pressure applied to find solutions for a car the team admit swings in and out of the performance window according to the vagaries of its tyres? The debrief may be painful.In the past, similar circumstances have led Ferrari into injurious internal contortions and even bloodletting so this difficult opening to the season is a tremendous test. They will need to refocus and restart but crucially remain unified. Pulling together will surely be Vasseur’s goal and doubtless Hamilton’s too.Explore more on these topicsFerrariFormula OneLewis HamiltonMotor sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

She will return to the top 50 for the first time since her eight-month layoff in 2023 after undergoing surgery to both wrists and her ankle. Raducanu will next face Jessica Pegula, the fourth seed, after she defeated Marta Kostyuk 6-2, 6-3.Emma Raducanu races through in Miami Open as Kessler pulls out injuredRead moreOn paper, this was supposed to be a fiercely difficult match. Anisimova is a former teenage prodigy who reached the French Open semi-finals at 17 in 2019 before taking a break from professional tennis in 2023 to address her mental health and burnout. This season has signalled her recovery, winning a first WTA 1000 title at the Qatar Open last month and then reaching the fourth round in Miami by beating the Indian Wells champion Mirra Andreeva.In this match, however, it was Raducanu who produced another faultless performance. Over the past week, she has demonstrated some of the best tennis of her career outside her 2021 US Open title run. Her serve and forehand, with which she has struggled for the past few years, have been excellent and she has frustrated opponents with her solid defence and cutting backhand slice.At her best, Anisimova is one of the cleanest ball-strikers in the world, her timing and hand-eye coordination the driving force behind her teenage breakthrough. From the start of this match, however, she simply could not put the ball in court. She had some understandable excuses. Her tough three-set win against Andreeva ended late on Sunday night and she had received a medical timeout for blisters on her right hand, which led to criticism from Andreeva.The writing was on the wall for Anisimova as she ended the first set by essentially tanking the final game. Between the sets, the American received a medical timeout, eventually returning to the court with her right wrist taped after the trainer had massaged her forearm. Although Anisimova’s level slightly improved in the second set, Raducanu refused to let her focus and intensity drop.“I felt something was maybe going down on the other side,” Raducanu told Sky Sports. “It’s really difficult to stay focused when your opponent is making some errors and then all of a sudden just blasting the lines and winners and you have no idea what’s going on. Those matches are almost tougher to stay focused the whole time. When things are, in a way, more normal, it’s just like you know you have to be locked in every single point. I’m really proud of how I came through that.”At the end of another brilliant win, Raducanu’s performance earned her a standing ovation from the newest temporary member of her team, the British coach and commentator Mark Petchey, alongside the former player Jane O’Donoghue. The timing of Raducanu’s breakthrough this week has been fascinating considering she had opted to end her trial period with the Slovak coach Vladimir Platenik on the eve of the tournament.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s extremely important I think.“For me, who’s very expressive, when I play my best I’m definitely authentic, true to myself and creative. I feel when I’m boxed in into a regimented way, I’m not able to express myself in the same way.

Although Sunderland is 15 miles away many Millwall fans are expected to change trains at Newcastle central station en route to Wearside.Newcastle fans reacted positively to the news that there will now be an open-top bus parade but remain concerned that anyone wanting to attend the Town Moor event had to register by Sunday night, with no guarantees of admission on the day. Moreover it is a “standing only” party with no facilities for car parking. Admission will be free and the event will run from 4pm until 8pm.Eddie Howe and his playersare expected to take to the stage at about 6pm but many older fans feel the need to stand for so long means it is unsuited to their needs, let alone those of children. Then there is the problem of what happens if it rains on a site prone to turning muddy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That certainly applies to Steve Clarke, who has raised levels withScotlandto the point where qualifying for tournaments has become reality as opposed to a pipe dream. Clarke has been the head coach to end years in the international wilderness.There is, however, a slightly ominous feel around the Scotland setup once more.Defeat by Greece– a rising force – can happen. What should not transpire is the comprehensive thumping dished out at Hampden Park on Sunday. Scotland looked utterly unprepared for what they faced. Theirs was a ragged, disjointed display.Scotland relegated in Nations League as Karetsas leads Greece demolition jobRead moreClarke has made it pretty obvious he views the World Cup campaign as his last. Another shot at club management is in his thoughts. Having been in the role since 2019, that familiarity consequence has the Tartan Army glancing towards a fresh start. Clarke’s employers have no excuse for not having a succession plan; in the absence of an available Scotland-based head coach of the calibre required to lead the national team, it is going to have to broaden horizons. Clarke’s raising of the bar has consequences for his replacement. The Scottish Football Association is going to have to break with tradition and think big.The Greece debacle felt like a line in the sand. It was similar in that respect toScotland’s final game at Euro 2024, where the lack of attacking intent against Hungary angered supporters. Clarke had recovered from that night in Stuttgart courtesy of a strong finish to the Nations League. Greece at Hampden ate up a lot of that goodwill. If Scotland start World Cup qualifying poorly, the mood will quickly turn toxic.Clarke’s reference to a lack of “energy” and “legs” in his team meant something went awry in the planning stage. A Thursday-Sunday two-leg tie is unusual, with the level of travel required inevitably affecting players. Scotland needed to get fine details right afteran arduous 1-0 win in Piraeus.It was apparent at half-time of the second leg that Scotland desperately needed change. Clarke did not implement it; 15 seconds into the second period,Greecehad put the tie out of reach. The head coach curiously refuses to deploy Ryan Christie in the midfield role in which he excels at Bournemouth. Lewis Ferguson earns rave reviews captaining Bologna but was left out of that midfield as Kenny McLean started. This is not to decry McLean, a fine servant for his country, but picking a Championship player ahead of someone tipped to move to one of Serie A’s top clubs feels nonsensical.View image in fullscreenSteve Clarke selected the 18-year-olds Lennon Miller (left) and James Wilson to face Greece.Photograph: Russell Cheyne/ReutersGrant Hanley, Clarke’s go-to centre-back, had been a very late substitute in Birmingham’s past three League One games. Yet he was relied upon to play 180 minutes against Greece. Anthony Ralston, the right-back, does not start regularly at Celtic.It would be wrong, however, to focus on Hanley and Ralston. Scotland needed so much more from supposed star turns. Andy Robertson was woeful in the second leg. Che Adams, the centre-forward, has a rather unfortunate habit of not looking remotely dangerous near to goal. John McGinn has flattered to deceive in Scotland colours for a while. Wild excitement over Billy Gilmour is undermined by the fact he is, aged 23, already at club No 3 in search of regular football.Gilmour is neat and tidy but too much of his play goes backwards or sideways. He also lacks the physicality to adequately screen a defence; a significant problem for Scotland given Christie, McGinn and Scott McTominay want to chase the game. Greece gleefully exposed how open Scotland became.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This team, who have generally served him so well, may have run their race. Whether he is of a mind to make changes, especially with his time in post apparently ticking down, is open to question.There is a lack of pace, which leads to overemphasis on Ben Doak. The 19-year-old will have a decent career; some in Scotland portray him as a tartan Messi. Clarke’s ability to shake up personnel is undermined by a glaring lack of emerging talent. That much was true when Scotland were qualifying for back-to-back European Championships, it is just that nobody wanted to hear it.There was wild noise when the 18-year-olds James Wilson and Lennon Miller were selected for the Greece tie. Other countries would think nothing of such a move. Indeed, in the 17-year-old Konstantinos Karetsas, Greece had the most eye-catching player on display at Hampden. Scotland are in the shameful position of not having a goalkeeper deemed capable of replacing the 42-year-old Craig Gordon.The path towards the World Cup will be rocky for Scotland. Greece have just shown how formidable an opponent they will be. Denmark are seasoned tournament campaigners. Belarus will bring logistical challenges. Clarke has two dicey June friendly matches to lower the temperature around his position. Given the progress of the recent past, this may well be an unjust situation. It is, though, a realistic one. Memories are short in this business.Explore more on these topicsScotlandGreeceanalysisShareReuse this content"

It is understood, however, that Farrell has since made a move for Wigglesworth to join his staff in Australia and he will go with Borthwick’s blessing.The move is a significant step in Wigglesworth’s coaching career. When Borthwick left Leicester to join England in December 2022, ­Wigglesworth took charge of the Tigers for the rest of the season before joining his former boss in the buildup to the 2023 World Cup. Initially he was responsible for the attack and last October, after the shock resignations of Felix Jones and Aled Walters as defence coach and head of strength and conditioning respectively, Wigglesworth was promoted to senior coach.He will be reunited with Walters, who has already been announced as part of the Lions’ backroom staff along with David Nucifora, who has been appointed general manager.

There’s so much more to it and moving forward now, it might look a little bit different. I don’t think the way that we’ll play will be different but we want to win games.“For me, those two months in India and Pakistan, they hurt me so much. I want to win everything, I do.

He is currently under close observation at the hospital’s coronary care unit.”The BCB president, Faruque Ahmed, who has reportedly visited the batter in hospital after cancelling a board meeting, said: “We are very thankful to all the medics and specialists for their swift actions in this critical situation. The outpouring of concern for Tamim reflects how much he is loved and appreciated by the nation.“The BCB is closely monitoring his health and continues to remain in contact with the hospital’s medical team.

It was not long before the complaints began to arrive – from some British trainers, at least.Kim Bailey and Dr Richard Newland, both past winners of the world’s most famous steeplechase, voiced concerns that the race is now dominated by the biggest stables in Ireland, and two trainers – Willie Mullins and Gordon Elliott – in particular. Sara Bradstock, meanwhile, expressed frustration that Mr Vango, the star of her small stable near Wantage, is unlikely to make the cut despite having plenty of form – and a handicap mark – that would make him a very live contender.Gold Cup winner Inothewayurthinkin withdraws from Grand NationalRead moreTheir comments echo widely shared concerns among many jump-racing fans that the Grand National is either turning into, or has already become, “just another race like all the others”, with the essential qualities that made it unique stripped away in the name of progress. The fences are easier, the distance has been (slightly) reduced, andlast year’s racewas the first to be runwith a maximum field of 34, making it ever more difficult for smaller yards and owners to get a piece of the action with an honest, homespun staying chaser near the bottom of the weights.The essential complaint is that while the Grand National we all grew up with is still there in body – Becher’s, the Chair, the spruce-topped fences – it is no longer there in spirit. By several measures, the critics have a point. Seven of the 32 starters in last year’s National were trained in British yards and six of the first seven past the post were saddled by Mullins, Elliott or Henry de Bromhead.In terms of the increasing dominance of Irish-trained runners, though, the National is simply reflecting the overall state of play in jumps racing as a whole.Ireland had 20 of the 28 winners at Cheltenhamthis month, when Mullins’s 10 winners included a 100-1 shot in the Triumph Hurdle, one of a remarkable 11 runners from the yard in the 17-strong field.Newland and Bradstock have expressed support for a three- or four-horse limit on the number of runners a trainer can saddle in the National (Newlandwent even further last yearand seemed to suggest a blanket ban on Irish-trained runners in Britain or, failing that, a limit of one-per-stable in major races).“Why can’t they put a limit in place?,” Newlandsaid in the Racing Postlast week. “There are three or four really big players and it’s killing our sport. Spreading those horses around more yards benefits so many more and makes the sport healthier.”A limit on the number of runners representing a particular owner or trainer is penalising success, which would be a very odd way for any competitive sport to go about its business. It would also effectively mean telling the sport’s biggest owners how and where to spend their money, which is hardly going to incentivise them to keep playing what will always be a numbers game. Mullins’s 11 contenders in the Triumph were running for eight different owners.It is also fair to ask whether the situation is as desperate as some like to claim. Eighteen of the 34 runners currently guaranteed a run in this year’s race are trained in Britain, including the second-favourite, Iroko, from Oliver Greenall and Josh Guerriero’s (relatively) small stable in Cheshire. Another British trainer with a guaranteed run is the Newmarket-based Michael Keady, who bought Horantzau D’Airy for £52,250 in an online auction, and has yet to saddle a winner over jumps.The favourite is Intense Raffles, one of about 20 horses at Tom Gibney’s yard in County Meath. Gibney is, in other words, a classic example of a small trainer tilting at the biggest prize in jumping, in the manner of so many others down the years. He just happens to be based in Ireland, not Britain.It is also just less than two years since Corach Rambler, whose owners included a student who bought a share in Lucinda Russell’s chaser to give him something to look forward to during lockdown,landed the spoils at Aintree.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Behind Intense Raffles, at 7-1, there are 13 horses 33-1 or shorter, every one of which has at least one run to their name that gives them a chance.The changes to the Grand National over the past 10 years in particular were made for a reason. The British Horseracing Authority andAintreeconcluded that a situation in which the most-watched race of the year, by far, also carried measurably higher risks for horses and riders was not sustainable for either the National itself or the sport as a whole.While it is undoubtedly a pity that Mr Vango is unlikely to squeeze into the field at Aintree next month, he is good enough and young enough to be a serious contender in 2026 . His probable absence this time around is no cause for a rethink about the race or its conditions.Explore more on these topicsSportTalking HorsesGrand NationalHorse racingAintreefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Such lawsuits can succeed directly in changing corporate and state behaviour, but they also shift public discourse and catalyse broader changes in policy. Lawsuits are increasingly targeting organisations that fund and invest in fossil fuels, including public and commercial banks, pension funds and credit agencies.“A targeted legal intervention that increases the costs of doing business for fossil fuel firms could foreseeably have significant system level knock-on effects, for example, making renewable energy technologies cheaper than fossil fuels,” says the handbook.“A focus on financial actors offers a rare opportunity for systemic impact that could be unrealisable through the targeting of individual fossil fuel firms.”There is precedent for faith-based legal interventions on climate. Alawsuit brought by residents of an Indonesian islandthreatened by rising sea levels against the Swiss cement producer Holcim, for example, is supported by the NGO Swiss Church Aid (HEKS/EPER).“We hope to see a proliferation of legal action across the world on moral grounds,” said Frederique Seidel, the senior programme lead on children and climate at the World Council of Churches.Work on future lawsuits is under way. Susan Lea Smith, a professor emeritus at Willamette University in Oregon and an experienced environmental litigator, has been working with the council to develop strategic litigation in the US. She is exploring a potential damages case against big greenhouse gas emitters for smoke damages associated with recent wildfires in Oregon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But she hoped the threat of litigation pricks the conscience of some people to make changes before any legal shots were actually fired.The handbook was not intended to be political, said Seidel, noting that the council represented a wide spectrum of conservative and liberal churches covering nearly 600 million people in more than 110 countries.But she recognised that litigation came with a risk of backlash. “We take these concerns very seriously. We are essentially leaving it to our constituency to choose the means and the mechanisms that are most viable and comfortable for them in their own political and social context.”The handbook also outlines a number of possible non-litigious actions including questioning financial organisations about their investments or reporting concerns about companies to regulators or bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Churches are also encouraged to keep divesting from fossil fuels.In a foreword,Vanessa Nakate, the Ugandan climate justice activist and a born-again Evangelical Christian, said the handbook pushed back against the notion of exploiting resources for individual gain and encouraged a more “eco-centric approach”. “This is a call for the church to rise against injustices,” she wrote.Explore more on these topicsChristianityReligionClimate crisisFossil fuelsFossil fuel divestmentRenewable energyEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

A broad trough – an area of locally lower pressure – has been moving across northern Australia, dragging in warm, moist air from the Gulf of Carpentaria and providing the perfect ingredients for the formation of severe thunderstorms, and evensupercells.More than 70mm (2.75in) of rain fell in an hour under the slow-moving storms over the weekend in what is usually an arid, low rainfall zone with a desert/grassland climate classification. Some parts of the region have sparse observation data, but some local stations have been able to record more than 100mm within 24 hours, with 132mm of rain at Marion Downs, Queensland.The high rainfall to such dry ground heightens the risk of flash flooding, with flooding also often occurring after the weather events have passed as river catchments merge. While minor flood watches are in place, a more moderate flood watch is likely to be issued later in the week as water transports through various river catchments, with the potential for communities and transport links to be cut off. As the trough moves further east into Queensland through Monday and Tuesday, some models are predicting that central/southern parts of Queensland will receive 200mm of rain within a 24-hour period, with perhaps another 100mm or so into Wednesday, exacerbating the flash flood risk for the remainder of the week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Daily maximum air temperatures will continue to reach the low to mid 30s celsius across large swathes of southern and eastern China this week, up to 18C above the average for the time of year. A maximum temperature of about 35/36C is forecast in Shanghai on Wednesday, while the daytime maxima may struggle to reach the teens celsius by Friday. Yet the most impressive temperature change could be in Lanzhou in the northern Gansu province, with a daily high on Tuesday of 25C plummeting to just above 0C by Thursday. The climate average for this time of year is normally about 16C. While swings in temperature in the spring months are not unusual, the scale and speed of the change from unusually hot to cold conditions is impressive.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsWeather trackerFloodingChinaAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

In September, the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen,declared Australia“the green hydrogen capital of the world” with “50-plus companies on the ground” and a pipeline of investments worth $200bn.The nascent industry has been touted as the start of a renewable energy revolution, with more than $8bn in support promised across federal and state governments. But just months on from Bowen’s announcement, several major proposals are either shelved or in serious doubt, prompting the question: is green hydrogen’s race over before it began?In New South Wales, Origin Energybacked out of plansfor a hydrogen hub in the Hunter Valley. In Queensland, theCrisafulli government withdrew$1bn in financial support from the Central Queensland Hydrogen Project, a large-scale hydrogen production, ammonia and export facility near Gladstone. In South Australia, plans for a hydrogen plant at Whyallawere put on iceas the state government reallocated nearly $600m in funding to support the continued operation of the steelworks.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThis has not curbed the Albanese government’s belief in, or support for, green hydrogen development. On Thursday, Bowen announced $814m in support for a major hydrogen and green ammonia export project in midwest Western Australia.Some have suggested the fuel has been over-hyped and“failed to fire”. But experts say the challenges in getting a new, green industry off the ground are unsurprising – and don’t necessarily mean it has no future.Climateworks Centre has tracked hydrogen’s role in the race to net zero for more than a decade. The organisation’s Kylie Turner says the shift from high levels of speculation to a focus on practical possibilities should be seen as a sign things are getting serious.Labor’s new ‘renewable hydrogen’ targets aim for Australia to produce 15m tonnes by 2050Read more“As you roll out the solution, the barriers become clearer, but also the ways that you might address those barriers also becomes a little bit clearer,” Turner says.Tennant Reed, the Australian Industry Group’s director of climate change and energy, says lots of emerging technologies follow a “hype cycle” from high levels of excitement to a period of disillusionment, where things turn out to be harder, slower, and less applicable than first thought. Some manage to make the slow climb to commercial success.Renewable hydrogen is currently in a trough, Reed says, after five years of high expectations where many considered hydrogen as the “Swiss army molecule that could do anything”.3:28What is hydrogen energy? And what's the difference between blue and green hydrogen? | News glossaryAustralia’s first national strategy in 2019 foresaw hydrogen being used in everything from home heating and energy storage to transport and steel making, and underpinning an export industry “shipping sunshine” stored as liquid hydrogen.“It has become increasingly clear that we’re not going to do all of those things with hydrogen, for the same reason that you don’t use a literal Swiss army knife for all the purposes that it has attachments for,” he says. “It’s not actually the best tool for every job.”The expense, complexity and slower-than-expected deployment – in Australia as well as globally – has narrowed the list of plausible applications for renewable hydrogen in reaching net zero emissions.The only way you get to cheaper hydrogen is by doing expensive hydrogen and learning along the wayTennant Reed, Australian Industry GroupAlison Reeve, Grattan Institute’s deputy program director for energy and climate, says cost remains a key barrier. Producing green hydrogen – by running an electric current through water, which splits it into hydrogen and oxygen – is expensive because it uses a large amount of electricity.Making hydrogen cheap enough to compete with natural gas and coal, requires “really, really cheap” power, she says.But then, as wind, solar and battery technology costs fall, it also becomes possible to do more with electricity instead. “So a lot of potential uses of hydrogen have just been falling away because electricity has out-competed them.”Just asbattery electric vehicleshave dominated the car market, Reeve anticipates electric technologies could prevail in other areas originally slated as applications for hydrogen, like long-distance trucking.Mild winters and trend towards electrification will push back gas shortage until 2028, Aemo saysRead moreUsing electricity directly has other advantages. “It’s just a lot less complicated,” Reeve says. “The supply chain is already there. The generators are already there. The power lines are already there.”The thinking on exports has changed too. Back in 2019, people thought liquid hydrogen could be shipped like LNG.But hydrogen turns out to be “a tricky gas to handle”, she says. “You’re just fighting with the physics of it the whole way.” A better option would be to make and use the hydrogen domestically to produce energy intensive products like steel or ammonia, and then export those.Despite all of that, many analysts still see renewable hydrogen playing a limited but valuable role in addressing industry emissions, particularly in the production of chemical ammonia and iron and steel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Replacing fossil gas with renewable hydrogen is the only way to decarbonise, Denis-Ryan says.There are other reasons to think ammonia might be a first mover, says Denis-Ryan. Existing facilities are located near strong renewable resources, she says, and green hydrogen can progressively replace gas up to about 30% without major upgrades to infrastructure.Simon Nicholas, Ieefa’s lead analyst for global steel, says together with scaling up recycling, using hydrogen instead of metallurgical coal or gas in iron and steel production is a promising way to limit the sector’s emissions, which some estimate isresponsible for 7% to 9%of global totals.“It’s not a question of if it’s going to happen in the steel sector,” he says. “It is actually happening.”The first commercial-scale green steel plant using hydrogen is already under construction in Sweden, he says, and is expected to start production in 2026.It’s a question of timing, Nicholas says, and whether Australia will seize the opportunity.Rio Tinto’s solar power and battery purchase for Gladstone aluminium operations praised as ‘right direction’Read moreSouth Australia remainswell-positioned, he says, with access to high grade iron ore, a power grid dominated byrenewable energyand a proactive state government.“The silver lining to the slowdown in global green hydrogen development is that we’re now realising that we need less green hydrogen than was being forecast several years ago. Because there were all sorts of crazy uses being put out there for green hydrogen where there are much better alternatives.”Fewer use cases means less green hydrogen, he says, meaning less renewable energy will need to be built to produce it.The Climateworks Centre modelling estimates 16 terawatt hours of additional renewable power – equivalent to 9% of Australia’s national electricity market – would be required to produce enough hydrogen for existing industries like ammonia and alumina production in Gladstone.There are good reasons to think some applications for renewable hydrogen will be “doable”, Reed says, but it will take a sustained period of policy and financial support, an enormous amount of new electricity infrastructure, and managing expectations.“The initial projects will be quite expensive, and the only way you get to cheaper hydrogen is by doing expensive hydrogen and learning along the way.”We’ve done it before, Reeve says. Australia successfully built a renewable energy industry “out of nothing”, through support for both demand and supply. Now the industry is meeting 40% of electricity generation.“We did it by accident, but we managed to get a lot of things right to build up that industry,” she says. “So we could do it again.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentAustralian climate and environment in focusHydrogen powerChris BowenEnergyRenewable energyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some have been unable to move out of the marital home until their assets have been divided.Lawyers acting for the union claim the failures may be in breach of European convention on human rights as women and children could be stuck in abusive households.The problem involves the processing of requests for cash equivalent transfer values (CETV) which are required to calculate the value of a pension pot. CETVs are legally required to be issued within three months of request, but TPS, administered by Capita Pension Solutions on behalf of the Department for Education (DfE), has reportedly left thousands of current and former teachers waiting more than six months for a response. In some cases, it has taken up to 18 months.The delays stemmed from a 2018court judgmentthat government changes to public sector pensions in 2015 breached age discrimination laws. As a result, a new system had to be introduced to calculate pension valuations and a four-month embargo on CETVs was imposed in 2023.The DfE claimed last year that the majority of outstanding cases would be resolved by the end of February 2025, but it backtracked last November and announced this only applied to straightforward requests.Luisa Stuart said she was left in emotionally draining limbo after requesting a CETV last year. “I got an unclear letter from TPS saying that my request could not be actioned due to delays caused by changes to the ways pensions are calculated,” she said.“When I called for clarification I was told that there was no timeframe in which they expected to get the correct form out to me and that I could not finalise my divorce without it unless my partner waived his right to half my pension.”Teacher Beth Fiddes said her life had been put on hold because of the issue. “TPS couldn’t give me any estimate of how long I would have to wait,” she said. “I cannot progress my divorce without the CETV information. We are still cohabiting and this jeopardises the sale of the marital home and my onward purchase.”Capita declined to comment on the legal action.Stuart and Fiddes both received their CETVs the day after the Guardian contacted Capita.The law firm Leigh Day, which is acting for NASUWT, said that it has been approached by more than 50 teachers, some of whom have been forced to remain in marital homes with their children despite a complete breakdown in their relationship.Ryan Bradshaw, solicitor at Leigh Day, said: “This backlog must be cleared immediately, and those affected deserve compensation for their financial losses and the stress endured. Without proper accountability and reform, this situation sets a dangerous precedent for how we value and treat our public servants.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We understand the disruption this has had for some teachers, and we are working closely with Teachers’ Pensions to resolve this issue as soon as possible.“Good progress has been made on reducing the number of outstanding cash equivalent transfer values since October and the majority have now been cleared. This issue continues to be a priority for the department and scheme administrator.”Capita has managed the TPS for 27 years, but in October 2025 the contract will transfer to Tata Consultancy.Explore more on these topicsTeachingPensionsDivorcenewsShareReuse this content"

When she got the call with the news, she felt both a “sense of disbelief” and “weirdly buoyant – that floating sense of something happening”.After her son moved to Brisbane, Larkin had been “really taken aback” by how much she missed him. “I rarely write about my children, I think they’ve maybe got one poem each now,” said Larkin. Her son hadn’t read the poem until Larkin found out she’d won the competition. “He’s delighted for me. I reckon he’s probably a little bit embarrassed as well.”The poem incorporates the Finnish language, which Larkin had begun reading about before going to Helsinki last summer, around the time that her son moved. Her poem plays with the abessive case, which is used to express absence and involves adding the suffix-ttaor-ttäon to nouns. “I’m really interested in the way knowledge of other languages shines a light on English,” she said.Larkin’s debut collection, Rope of Sand, was published in 2023. She has also published two pamphlets, Vital Capacity and A Dovetail of Breath. Winning the competition “will give me more confidence with my writing going forward in terms of experimenting and trying out new things”. She is working on a second collection.All the poems were read anonymously by a judging panel comprising Romalyn Ante, John McAuliffe and Stephen Sexton, who described the winning poem as “very impressive, ingenious and affecting”.Matt Barnard was named as the runner-up, winning £2,000, while third place went to Sorrel Briggs, who receives £1,000. The top three poems will be published in the spring 2025 issue of the Poetry Society’s journal,The Poetry Review.Seven commended poets, winning £500 each, are Yong-Yu Huang, Lee Knapper, Hannah Perrin King, Lesley Sharpe, Chris Beckett, Kit Buchan and Andrew Dennison.Past winners of the competition include Carol Ann Duffy, Sinéad Morrissey, James Berry and Tony Harrison. Last year, Imogen Wadewon the awardfor a poem inspired by her experience being mugged in New York. The competition will next open in June.Absence has a grammarI am learning to use the abessivecase as if I were Finnish,to indicate that what I missis so much a part of methat its loss is structural.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She told the BBC: “We’ve got to get the balance right, and those discussions at the moment are ongoing.”Labour MPs have voiced their concern about the prospect of the government dropping the DST under pressure from the Trump administration. Rachael Maskell said this weekend: “I would be concerned if relief was granted in what would be seen as a dash to let the US tech companies off the hook, while at the same time as making disabled people pay for the revenue loss, with their lifelines being cut.”Another Labour MP said: “This would be the very worst optics: dropping a tax on big tech companies in the same week we announce more departmental spending cuts and give the details about our welfare cuts.”Reeves already faces political pressure over spending cuts to meet the government’s fiscal rules,including a £5bn welfare overhauland 10,000 job losses in the civil service. Scores of Labour MPs voiced significant doubts about thegovernment’s welfare changesin a tense meeting last week with the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A company’s first £25m of UK revenues are exempt from the tax, meaning X would theoretically have been in line to pay around £3.6m under the DST that year, but its results do not explicitly state that such a payment was made.According to the National Audit Office, 90% of DST revenues in its first year of operation in 2020-21 came from five businesses. Amazon, Google, eBay and Apple have publicly acknowledged paying the tax, and Facebook’s parent, Meta, is widely presumed to have done so.The tax is expected to raise £800m this year, rising to £1.1bn by the turn of the decade,according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.Neidle said the DST was a “diplomatically complicated” tax, with the UK having pledged to abolish it when an internationally agreed tax regime for multinationals is introduced, brokered by theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD). Failure to introduce the so-called pillar 1 regime so far has left the OECD and DST “in a bit of a limbo”, he said.Explore more on these topicsXElon MuskTrade policyEconomic policyTax and spendingDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

The government is expected to take a similar approach to rail.Most of the job cuts are likely to be in back-office roles. Among organisations that could be abolished are Transport Focus, a watchdog for transport users, and the Rail Ombudsman, which will become part of a new Passenger Standards Authority.Ministers have promised a “unified, simplified railway”. The plansinclude rewiring of the railwaysto “end decades of poor service, waste and timetable chaos”.Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, has suggested that renationalising train companieswill not necessarily bring cheaper rail faresfor passengers but should reduce train cancellations and delays.Services will return into state hands as remaining contracts expire over the coming years – or possibly earlier if lawyers advise of potential grounds for breach of contract.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The valuation could be affected by a ban on resale in the UK, one of the world’s biggest markets for events.In 2019, a CMA report found that Viagogo and StubHub sold 1.9m tickets in the UK that year, with a value of £350m. More than 50% of their tickets were sold at above face value.StubHub International, the part of the business that was not sold to Viagogo, said: “Research, conducted by Bradshaw Advisory, shows that jurisdictions which enforce resale bans or price caps, such as Victoria, Australia, and Ireland have ticket fraud rates almost four times higher than in the UK. If UK rates were to match those levels, consumers could face £1.2bn in fraud-related losses annually.“We look forward to working with the government to ensure any proposed policy changes are focused on protecting fans and providing access to the events they love.”Explore more on these topicsCompetition and Markets AuthorityTicket pricesRegulatorsConsumer affairsMusic industryViagogoTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

Members of parliament, brace, brace, brace.Dominic Cummings– the political weather-maker behind the tide that delivered Brexit and raised and drowned Boris Johnson – is eyeing up a Westminster come back, of sorts.“I might spend more time on SW1 depending how things play out,” Cummings told the Guardian after speculation about his intentions in the Westminster postcode, “but I do not want a job there. My efforts will only be helping people of any party pushing in what I consider a good direction, I’m happy living away from SW1 and SW1 for sure feels the same about me.”The trigger for a renewed interest in the beanie-wearing politico from Durham, memorably portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in Brexit: The Uncivil War, has been the recent revelation of a secret dinner withNigel Farageshortly before Christmas.It has prompted much excitement in Westminster. The two men were daggers drawn for a number of years, partly as a result of a clash between their respective organisations (Cummings’ Vote Leave of which he was campaign director and the Farageist Grassroots Out) over which would be the official Brexit campaign group.Farage described Cummings, who went on to be Johnson’s chief adviser in Downing Street, as a “horrible nasty little man”. Last summer, Cummings said the re-emergence of Farage on the political scene was “depressing”, adding that “15% of the country [is] pretty much like Farage and hates everybody else”. He warned that Farage did not offer solutions.It was something of a turn-up, then, for the two men to break bread. Of the dinner, the Reform leader has said only that they talked “about the blob and what were the practical problems of coming into government and not being able to do what you wanted to do”.In his first public comments about the meeting, Cummings said it had been a “friendly chat”.The focus, the 53-year-old added, had been “the core problems that we have a broken Whitehall, a disgraceful and shattered Tory party clogging up the party system, how to shake it all up most effectively. And how to bring some of the great people in this country now excluded from government into it to replace the shitshow we all have to live with every day.”“The current crop of MPs and officials by definition can’t fix themselves,” Cummings said. “It needs an outside force – just as the vaccine taskforce or rapid tests or sewage monitoring did in 2020, successful only because of forces external to Whitehall forcing Whitehall to act differently against its default mode.”Cummings had pressed on Farage the need for him to build credible policies in order to recruit top-quality candidates and attract donors, it is understood.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage, pictured, once dismissed Dominic Cummings as a ‘horrible nasty little man’.Photograph: Nathan Howard/ReutersIn turn, Farage, 60, is said to have made a nod to his own mortality. Reform may be on a trajectory to win 100 seats at the next election in 2029, putting the party in the position where it could execute a reverse take over of the Conservative party.But Farage would be nudging at Lord Palmerston’s record as Britain’s oldest first-time prime minister should he be successful against Keir Starmer in 2035. He would be into his 80s by the end of a second term, should that come to pass.Farage said “he didn’t want to wait until 2035 so wanted to win a majority in 2029”, Cummings said.Not everyone who knows the maverick political strategist is convinced that he would turn down an opportunity to be part of that.“Farage is – much like Boris, although in different ways – a deeply flawed individual,” said a friend. “So the question is, do you just throw your toys out the pram and say all of the lead actors are shit, I don’t want to work with them, plague on all their houses? Or do you try and work with the cranks that the political process has chucked up? I think he’s probably found himself in the latter camp.”A second source said Cummings was insistent in private as well as in public that he would “never work for Farage”. But everyone can agree that he has got his old vim and verve back over the past 12 months.After being fired by Johnson in November 2020, he helped engineer the Partygate scandal that brought his former boss down but then became something of a recluse, friends said.In line with the image of a tortured genius in exile, he purchased a £161,000 home on Lindisfarne – the Holy Island just off the Northumberland coast.A friend added, however, that it was in Cummings’ nature to disappear only to dramatically re-emerge. That he did in October 2023 to give evidence at the Covid inquiry and chew up what was left of Johnson’s reputation, describing the former prime minister as “a symptom of the system’s sickness”.He still holds Johnson in contempt, friends say. Cummings also believes the Conservative party is moving towards extinction – something he would be pleased to nudge along.In May last year, before the general election, he floated the idea of a startup party and started talking to potential figureheads, it is understood, including those who are former members of the armed forces, although that plan appears to have been dropped.Cummings is now “hedging his bets”, suggested a friend.He retains a few disciples within the parliamentary ranks of the Conservative party, including Katie Lam, the MP for Weald of Kent, a former Downing Street colleague who got on the wrong side of Johnson’s wife, Carrie Symonds, after nudging the family dog, Dilyn, away from her handbag over which he had cocked his leg.Of late, though, Cummings has been focused on helping a cross-party movement led by the academic Dr Lawrence Newport, who first came to public prominence with his successful campaign to ban XL bully dogs.The two men are understood to have bonded over their respective tales of receiving death threats for their campaigning efforts.Newport has moved on to champion a tougher approach to crime and, more recently, a plan for economic growth, including the implementation of a fully fledged infrastructure bill. Cummings has opened up his contacts book and is said to be a constant source of advice.“The hope very much is that it’s a movement that grows in size, and the more it grows, the noisier it can be,” Newport said. “The idea is to create something that politicians have to listen to so that they understand that there is a constituency of people who actually really care about prosperity.”At the first Looking for Growth (LFG) event in December, Cummings was a keynote speaker. He then led a policy “workshop” on Saturday at an event attended by about 200 people, including the Labour MP Chris Curtis and the shadow business secretary, Andrew Griffith.“I’ve talked more to Labour MPs and spads [special advisers] than Tories in last year [because] they are more interested in why Whitehall is broken, what we started doing in 2020 to fix it etc,” Cummings said. “Almost zero Tories are interested in this as 2021-24 showed. And broader Tory ecosystem is also not interested in how power really works in Whitehall.“I’ve been helping Lawrence Newport on crime and LFG because he’s trying to push things in good directions and LFG is partly about finding talent outside politics and getting it involved in politics.”Cummings wrote recently on his Substack blog, for which he has more than 60,000 subscribers, that such campaigns could be the “‘third force’ that could help influence things one way or another at a crucial moment”.Should such a crucial moment come, who would bet against him being in the thick of it?Explore more on these topicsDominic CummingsNigel FarageReform UKConservativesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But factory owners were more downbeat and registered a fall in activity to 44.6 from 46.9 in February, where a figure of 50 separates contraction from expansion.Manufacturers said they faced “severe headwinds” including tariffs and rising global economic uncertainty. They reported the weakest degree of confidence since November 2022, contrasting with the confidence levels shown by service providers, which edged up to a five-month high.The report said: “Weak international demand resulted in the fastest decline in manufacturing export sales since August 2023. Moreover, manufacturers reported the steepest downturn in production volumes for nearly one-and-a half years.”Businesses across the manufacturing industry fear a further downturn as the global economy reacts to the next round oftrade tariff measurespromised by the White House.Most manufacturers rely on imports of components and raw materials, and they expect to export finished goods to countries that could be hit by tariffs, raising costs and possibly causing delays.Trump was expected to announce sector-specific tariffs on a range of goods, including cars and semi conductors. However, they are now not likely to be announced on 2 April – which Trump has dubbed “Liberation Day” for the US – the Wall Street Journal reported.The White House is still planning to announce reciprocal tariff measures on that day, although “planning remains fluid”, the paper reported. Trumphinted last weekthat he could take a flexible approach to tariffs.S&P Global said factory owners were reducing investment and cutting jobs as the outlook for the sector appeared to weaken this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said that while services companies offered the chancellor some respite from the recent flow of predominantly downbeat economic data, “that just as one swallow does not a summer make, one good PMI doesn’t signal a recovery”.Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at the consultants Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the PMI data was too downbeat about the state of the economy.“The PMI readings for first quarter appear too pessimistic,” he said. “We expect to see [economic] growth pick up in the first quarter, despite January’s small fall.”Looking ahead to the rest of the year, growth is likely to remain modest, he added.“Overall, growth this year looks likely to be steady rather than spectacular as the impact of past interest rate rises, tighter fiscal policy, and geopolitical uncertainty weigh on activity,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsServices sectorManufacturing sectorRachel ReevesSpring statement 2025Trump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

He then resumed work at about 7.30am and was in his office shortly after 9am. Woldbye, whotook the reins at Heathrow in October 2023and previously ran Copenhagen airport for 12 years, was paid £3.2m last year, including a £2.2m bonus.Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, declined to say whether she had confidence in Woldbye. She told LBC radio: “I’ve had to deal with some pretty stressful situations in my time. I probably would struggle to sleep, to be honest.”Alexander added: “It’s my understanding that he placed his chief operating officer in charge. He will have also known that there was going to be a huge number of very difficult decisions the following day.“I’m not going to justify decisions that Heathrow leadership did or didn’t take. I wasn’t sat at the table. I didn’t have the information that he had available to him at that time.”She was asked later on Monday in the Commons whether expansion at Heathrow – which is expected to submit plans for a third runway to the government in the summer – would risk a greater meltdown in the future.Alexander replied that it was “an unprecedented event of very significant magnitude” and that she still believed Heathrow could “continue to be a trusted partner for the government in the longer term”.Europe’s busiest airport had more than 1,000 flights cancelled on Friday after the fire at the substation in Hayes, west London. Flights restarted on Saturday andthe airport was back to normal by Sunday, albeit with some slight delays.Alexander told ITV’s Good Morning Britain on Monday: “If he [Woldbye] had trust in the chief operating officer to take that decision, and if his judgment was that he was going to have a whole number of critical decisions to be taken in the following 24 hours, then I’m not going to second-guess why he came to the conclusion that that was the right thing for him to do.”The chief executives of British Airways and Virgin Atlantic worked through the night as the Heathrow shutdown forced flights to be diverted and grounded, the Sunday Times reported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The head of National Grid said on Sunday thatthere was enough power for Heathrow to remain openduring the entire period it was shut down on Friday, with electricity provided by two other substations.But a spokesperson for the airport said on Monday: “As the National Grid’s chief executive, John Pettigrew, noted – he has never seen a transformer failure like this in his 30 years in the industry. His view confirms that this was an unprecedented incident and that it would not have been possible for Heathrow to operate uninterrupted.“Hundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted. Given Heathrow’s size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge.”The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has ordered theNational Energy System Operatorto investigate the power outage. An internal review of the airport’s crisis management plans and its response to the disruption will be undertaken by the former transport secretary Ruth Kelly.Heathrow said it was running a full schedule on Monday, with more than 1,300 flights planned. It managed more than 2,500 flights over the weekend, serving more than 400,000 passengers.A spokesperson said: “We apologise for the inconvenience caused by Friday’s closure, following a significant fire at an off-site power substation.

Bradford Live, a new 3,900-capacity, city-centre entertainment venue, was splashed over the pages of local newspapers, made the subject of Facebook groups andeven afforded national headlines. Unfortunately, it was for the wrong reasons.The exceptionally well-restoredWest Yorkshireconcert hall was brimming with possibilities, but was unable to open in November as planned because there was no operator in place to run it.To make matters worse, it had been funded with £50m from the public purse – most of which was paid for locally by a council with a budget crisis.However, that chapter in the 95-year-old building’s history looks finally set to close, after a deal was struck with Trafalgar Entertainment, which runs 19 other venues in the UK including the Glasgow Pavilion and London’s Trafalgar and Olympia theatres, and Theatre Royal Sydney in Australia.Acts are being confirmed, staff are being hired, and there is a new sense of optimism in the city that the venue really will open within the next six months.“Generations of people have been coming here for shows, for the ballroom, when it was a bingo hall, when it was a cinema,” said councillor Alex Ross-Shaw.“Literally generation after generation has their own memories of this venue, and that’s why there was such a huge public campaign to save it. Being able to do that and secure its future so that the next generations can build those memories, it’s been really fantastic.”View image in fullscreenBradford Live was refurbished with £50m from the public purse.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe Midlands-based NEC Group pulled out of the original deal to run the venue in September last year, just months before it was due to open. Locals who had fought to save it from demolition were frustrated, and Ross-Shaw said it became “the biggest talking point” in the city.He was unable to say anything while the tender process was ongoing – and while the council dealt with a budget crisis and unpopular council tax rises. “But it’s great to be able to talk about it now and it’s all very exciting,” he added.Bradford has taken a beating when it comes to local authority cuts. Since 2011, £350m has been cut from its budget, and rising demand for council services has created a “perfect storm”, Ross-Shaw said.About two-thirds of what the council spends goes on social care for children and adults. The city is home to some of the most deprived wards inEnglandand poverty is on a scale rarely seen in other parts of the country. According to Ross-Shaw, the investment in Bradford Live amounted to 0.4% of the council’s overall budget.“If we don’t want to be completely relying on central government for the future of Bradford, we have to be able to generate our own revenues and business rates, grow the economy, grow housing,” he said. “Having a regeneration programme is inevitably going to be part of that, and Bradford deserves that investment.View image in fullscreenDarren Moore is confident the seats will be filled when the doors finally open.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“We saw that there was a need for the council to step in and provide that when the private sector wouldn’t. And obviously by doing that, we give the private sector confidence it can come in and invest in Bradford.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The late opening will also prevent the venue from capitalising onBradford’s status as this year’s UK city of culture.However, Darren Moore, the venue director at Bradford Live, is confident that the seats will be filled when the doors finally open.“There’s not another indoor venue of this size in WestYorkshire,” he said.“There’s a circuit of [similar mid-size venues] appearing. There’s one opening in Derby, there’s one in Hull, you’ve got one up at Stockton. So it’s a developing market.”For Sir Howard Panter, joint chief executive and co-founder of Trafalgar Entertainment, it is a project with something of a personal connection. He says he was brought up to believe the city was “the centre of the universe” by his Bradfordian father.Panter described the building as “world-class” and said: “The phone has been off the hook ever since it was announced that we were the operator.”He added: “I think it will unquestionably generate far more for the local economy than the local economy has invested in it,” citing research showing that a minimum of £1.40 is expected to be made for every £1 invested.“So I think, over the years, Bradford will be a brighter and wealthier and happier place because of Bradford Live.”Explore more on these topicsBradfordYorkshireUK city of cultureEnglandLocal governmentNorth of EnglandWest YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

She has denied all wrongdoing.Now MPs fear that Britain’s efforts to assist Bangladesh could be further clouded by an apparent smear campaign against Mansur involving news articles by fake journalists.MPs in the 47-strong all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on responsible tax and corruption received emails before a session on Monday with Mansur. The sender, who claimed to be a journalist, sent links to a website called International Policy Digest, featuring articles about apparent displays of wealth by Mansur’s daughter and questioning why she was not being investigated.Neither of the articles’ supposed authors appears to have any other profile as a journalist. The Guardian found that pictures of them were actually stock images.Mansur and MPs in the group raised concerns that the emails were part of a concerted disinformation campaign.Mansur, a former IMF official, who previously lived and worked in Washington, said he believed that people under investigation for money laundering were trying to “diminish my reputation and target me in various ways”.He added that his daughter was a US citizen who had little to do with Bangladesh.One APPG member, Rupa Huq, received a separate email from a UK public relations firm called Palatine Communications, also linking to International Policy Digest.The email said that if Mansur was prepared to “impugn the integrity of Tulip Siddiq” then he and his family should also face scrutiny.Mansur said he had never made any comments about Siddiq.However, he is a key figure in the transitional government led by Mohammad Yunus, whoseACCaccused Siddiq, along with her family members, amid an investigation into a 2013 deal with Russia that allegedly overinflated the price of a nuclear power plant.Huq said it was “highly unusual” to receive such an email and compared it to demonstrations that have targeted her speaking about Bangladesh in parliament. She said both were “designed to intimidate and interfere with parliament and MPs’ normal work”.Members of the APPG are understood to have referred the emails to parliamentary cyber security advisers, as well as to the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, which isinvestigating disinformation.“If it is the case that this communication is an attempt to mislead UK politicians when it comes to a very serious corruption scandal, then I think we should be very concerned,” said APPG member Phil Brickell.“I urge the relevant parliamentary authorities to investigate thoroughly – we must get to the bottom of who paid for this, and why, in order to understand how we can best protect ourselves.”A spokesperson for Palatine Communications said: “Our client instructions are confidential. In sending the email in question, we acted on our own initiative.“We have nothing to do with, and know nothing of, the authorship of this article, but nor did we ever claim it represented the gospel truth. Like numerous articles from many media outlets, it raises legitimate concerns about the current situation in Bangladesh that we believe are worthy of MPs’ consideration.”A spokesperson for International Policy Digest said the person who had actually written the articles had “wished to remain anonymous”, adding that they were confident that the content was “fairly accurate”.Explore more on these topicsHouse of CommonsBangladeshSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The protests have resulted in increasing pushback from the Turkish authorities, with police now readily deploying pepper spray, teargas and armoured water cannon trucks against crowds gathering in Istanbul as well as other major towns and cities across the country.On Monday evening, crowds of students filled streets in the Beşiktaş neighbourhood, but were quickly hemmed in by lines of riot police.View image in fullscreenPolice officers use pepper spray on a demonstrator wearing dervish clothes in Istanbul, Turkey, on Sunday.Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/ReutersThe Turkish interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, said 1,133 people had been detained in five days, starting with the dawn raid in which İmamoğlu and tens of municipal officials were taken into custody. Many of those detained in the days since were arrested for breaching a city-wide ban on protests in Istanbul. The city’s governor also restricted entry to Istanbul over the weekend in an attempt to curb the demonstrations.Yerlikaya added that “some circles have been abusing the right to assembly and demonstration, attempting to disrupt public order, inciting street events and attacking our police. Such actions are aimed at disrupting the peace and security of our people.”.Turkish authorities deny that the charges against İmamoğlu, a rival of the president, are political. Even so the crackdown on the Istanbul mayor as well as the protests have proven costly to the Turkish state, as economists estimate the Turkish central bank spent up to $25bn (£19.3bn) propping up the lira in three days last week.Financial analyst Haluk Bürümcekçi said while the Turkish central bank had enough reserves to sustain the interventions, these “would not be adequate for similar ongoing demand”.Turkey has struggled for years with an economic crisis that has driven up the cost of living, fuelling criticism of the government long before the demonstrations began.The Turkish capital markets board said over the weekend that it had banned short selling for one month because of “recent developments”, at the Istanbul stock exchange, as the markets reeled from the impact of the crackdown on protests and İmamoğlu’s detention.2:29Protests continue as Istanbul mayor jailed on day of likely presidential nomination – videoEvin Barış Altıntaş, who heads the Media and Law Studies Association, a free speech organisation that supports journalists detained in Turkey, said it was notable that most of the journalists detained overnight were photographers.“The main aim is to cut off the number of people taking photos at protests,” she said, pointing to threats from Ebubekir Şahin, the head of Turkey’s media regulator, RTÜK, to suspend broadcaster’s licences for broadcasting live footage of the demonstrations. Şahin later denied any threats or that RTÜK’s actions threatened media freedom in Turkey, saying simply “the state will do what is necessary”.Altıntaş said the arrests and threats to broadcasters were part of the government’s efforts to stifle coverage of the growing protests in the hope of quelling the demonstrations entirely.“The protests are huge in number, so the authorities are trying very hard to contain that,” she said. “There’s an obvious attempt to stop the dissemination of news reports about protests, but I’m not sure how they will manage that as these are growing every day.”The global government affairs team from the social media platform X said they “object to multiple court orders from the Turkish Information and Communication Technologies Authority to block over 700 accounts of news organisations, journalists, political figures, students, and others within Türkiye”.“We believe this decision from the Turkish government is not only unlawful, it hinders millions of Turkish users from news and political discourse in their country. We look forward to defending these principles through the legal system,” they added.Altıntaş said that despite claims by the X boss, Elon Musk, that free speech was defended on the platform, it was clear X was allowing at least 110 accounts to be blocked in Turkey, according to her records. These included journalists covering the protests, as well as feminist organisations and student groups, she added.“There is a clear attempt to censor images and videos of the protests, and this is obviously a part of that,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyProtestRecep Tayyip ErdoğanFreedom of speechPress freedomXnewsShareReuse this content"

Dozens of protesters had gathered outside the courthouse and shouted: “Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you.”After confirming his date and place of birth, the actor told the panel of three judges that he was prepared to answer the court’s questions. He is expected to testify on Tuesday.Depardieu – one of France’s most famous actors, who has made more than 200 films and TV series – is the highest-profile figure in the French film industry to face allegations of sexual assault since the #MeToo movement.Depardieu is charged with the sexual assault of a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant director during the shooting of the feature film Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in Paris in 2021. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000) if convicted.He is accused of sexually assaulting the set dresser on 10 September 2021 on the film set, allegedly trapping her between his legs before grabbing her buttocks, pubis and chest. She has said the actor also used obscene language and had to be pulled away by bodyguards.The set dresser’s lawyer told the court that several people had witnessed her being grabbed and “trapped against her will”. The set dresser had immediately spoken to senior colleagues who had suggested at the time that she go to the police. Her lawyer said a production manager recounted receiving a call from Depardieu at the time, saying he was sorry and it was “no longer the era to do that”. Depardieu’s lawyer denied this.Depardieu isalso charged with assaulting an assistant director both on set and in the street on 31 August and in September 2021, allegedly grabbing her buttocks and chest. The woman’s lawyer said she had told friends at the time that Depardieu had been touching her.Depardieu’s lawyer, Jérémie Assous, said the actor denied all charges. He told the panel of three judges: “Truth is on our side.”The judges dismissed demands by Depardieu’s defence that the case should be thrown out. They rejected Depardieu’s lawyer’s argument that the investigation was biased and aimed solely at “bringing Depardieu down”. The state prosecutor and the lawyers for the complainants told the court that the investigation into Depardieu was solid and the case must be heard.The trial had been postponed last Octoberafter lawyers warned of Depardieu’s ill health, saying he had undergone a quadruple heart bypass and had diabetes that was aggravated by the stress of the trial.Depardieu arrived in the courtroom looking strong and healthy. While waiting for the hearing to begin, he smiled, blew kisses and winked at friends and supporters. He smiled at the French actorFanny Ardant, who appeared briefly to confirm that she would give evidence later in the trial. Ardant, who acted in The Green Shutters, will speak in favour of Depardieu. Before the trial, she said she supported him because he was a friend.Medical experts subsequently ruled that Depardieu was well enough to stand trial this month, but with special provisions for his health: his court appearances would be limited to six-hour stints, with a 15-minute pause and snack every three hours. He would be seated but allowed to stand up if needed, must have private access to toilets, must be able to regularly control his blood sugar and eat a sweet snack if necessary.The trial is the first case against Depardieu to come to court. Overall, about 20 women have accused Depardieu of improper behaviour, but several cases have not been pursued because they exceeded the time limit for bringing a legal complaint.The French actor Charlotte Arnould was the first woman to file a criminal complaint against Depardieu, in 2018, alleging he raped and sexually assaulted her when she was 22 and Depardieu, a friend of her father, was almost 70. Last August, the Paris prosecutor’s office requested a trial for rape and sexual assault, but a trial date has not yet been set. In an open letter to Le Figaro in 2023, Depardieu denied the allegations, saying any encounter with Arnould had been consensual.Arnould watched from the public benches on Monday. Also among the public was the actor Anouk Grinberg, who appeared in The Green Shutters. Grinberg told Agence France-Presse before the trial that Depardieu had constantly made “salacious remarks” during shooting, and producers who hired him knew they were “hiring an abuser”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsGérard DepardieuFranceParisEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The compounds can be made by lifeless chemical reactions, but are crucial constituents of cell membranes in all living organisms on Earth.The researchers do not claim to have found a biosignature – a “smoking gun” indicating life was once present – but one expert said the material represented the best chance that scientists had ever had for identifying remains of life onMars.“These molecules can be made by chemistry or biology,” said Dr Caroline Freissinet, an analytical chemist who led the research at the Atmospheres andSpaceObservations Laboratory in Guyancourt, near Paris. “If we have long-chain fatty acids on Mars, those could come – and it’s only one hypothesis – from membrane degradation of cells present 3.7bn years ago.”The Curiosity rover has trundled more than 20 miles (32km) across the Gale crater since landing on Mars in 2012. Six years into the mission, itdetected traces of organicsin the ancient mudstone, but all were relatively short carbon-chain molecules.For the latest study, Freissinet and her colleagues developed a new procedure to test more of the sample drilled from the mudstone. This time, Curiosity detected much larger organics, namely decane, undecane and dodecane.Work on Earth showed that the Martian rock sample, known as Cumberland, probably contained carboxylic acids, or fatty acids, that converted to alkanes in the heating process. “Although abiotic processes can form these acids, they are considered universal products of biochemistry, terrestrial, and perhaps Martian,” the scientists wrote inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Did the red planet once have sandy beaches? – podcastRead moreFurther analysis of the organics only deepened the intrigue. When organisms on Earth make fatty acids, the compounds tend to contain more even numbers than odd numbers of carbon atoms. This is because some enzymes build fatty acids by adding two carbon atoms at a time. The scientists saw hints of this in the Martian organics, too. “Cumberland is teasing us,” Freissinet said. “The one in the middle with 12 carbons is more abundant than the other two. We have the same trend on Mars, but a trend drawn from three molecules is not a real trend. Still, it’s very intriguing.”The finding suggests, at the very least, that organic signatures of life can be preserved in Martian rock for billions of years, bolstering hopes that should life ever have emerged on the planet, its remnants might still be found.The pressing question is what to do next. Curiosity is carrying a second sample of the rock that scientists want to analyse for even larger organics. This might boost evidence for more fatty acids containing even numbers of carbons. But that would still not be conclusive.John Eiler, a professor of geology and geochemistry at the California Institute of Technology, said analysing the different isotopes of carbon and hydrogen in the organics could reveal their origins. However, the tests require equipment found in only a handful of labs on Earth. “At present, there is no plausible path to making such measurements using an in-situ instrument on Mars,” he said. That will have to wait for a Mars sample-return mission.“The findings reported in this paper present the best chance we have seen for identifying the remains of life on Mars,” said Eiler. “But sealing the deal absolutely requires return of such samples to Earth.”Explore more on these topicsMarsCuriosity roverAlien lifeNasaSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

Contraceptive injections are already available but they have limitations, including that they last for only three months.Now scientists say they have completed proof-of-concept experiments for a new type of long-lasting implant that self-assembles in the body.While not yet tested in humans, the researchers behind the work say the approach could bring benefits beyond the field of birth control, offering a simple way to administer long-acting drug delivery systems without the need for invasive procedures – an appealing prospect for parts of the world with poor medical infrastructure.“It’s suitable for any poorly soluble hydrophobic drug, especially where long-acting delivery is needed. This includes treatments for HIV, TB, schizophrenia, chronic pain, or metabolic disease​,” said Dr Giovanni Traverso, a co-author of the study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s hospital in the US.The approach involves injecting micro-crystals of a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone contained in a solvent that does not mix well with water.Once in the body, the solvent exchanges with bodily fluid. However, the micro-crystals prefer to clump together than interact with this water-rich environment. This, together with the formation of further crystals as the solvents exchange, results in the development of a solid implant, capable of releasing the drug slowly over time.The team, whose study was publishedin the journal Nature Chemical Engineering, tested the approach in rats, allowing them to refine the choice of solvent in the injection. The drug release in rats was sustained for at least 97 days, although Traverso said there was potential for longer durations depending on formulation adjustments​.“The dosing and volumes of drug are compatible with multi-year dosing,” he said, adding that the formation of a solid implant means it can be removed if required, while the approach is also compatible with the use of small needles.However, the research is still in its early stages, with the efficacy of the approach yet to be tested. “It lays the groundwork for future human studies which we hope will start in the next three to five years,” Traverso said.Dr Janet Barter, the president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said the approach could be an exciting advancement.“This innovation has the potential to be convenient option for individuals in low-resource settings, where access to contraception and healthcare services can be limited,” she said. “We welcome further research into the safety, efficacy, and the accessibility of this promising technology and encourage the authors to work with potential users in future to ensure they meet the needs and preferences of those who will rely on it.”Explore more on these topicsContraception and family planningWomen's healthHealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

In January, itssales across Europe fell 45%, from 18,161 in 2024 to 9,945.Elon Musk tells Tesla employees to hold on to their stock amid harsh selloffRead moreHowever, in the UK the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported analmost 21% risein the number of new Tesla cars registered in February, with the Model 3 and Model Y proving the second and third most popular after the Mini Cooper.Analysts and investors have been attempting to assess what impact Musk’s political interventions are having on the carmaker, where he is chief executive, amid signs that his senior role in Trump’s administration is leading to a consumer backlash bysome Tesla ownersor prospective buyers. Tesla dealerships have also beenthe target of protests.The tech billionaire and close Trump adviser hasshown support for Germany’s far-right AfD party, theatrically brandished a “chainsaw of democracy” at a conservative conference, and accused Keir Starmer and other senior politicians ofcovering up the scandal about grooming gangs.However, analysts have said that the volatile sales are also likely to have been affected by Tesla’s overhaul of the Model Y.Felipe Muñoz, a global analyst at Jato Dynamics, said: “Tesla is experiencing a period of immense change. In addition to Elon Musk’s increasingly active role in politics and the increased competition it is facing within the EV market, the brand is phasing out the existing version of the Model Y – its bestselling vehicle – before it rolls out the update.“Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover.”The research company’s figures for February show that Tesla’s rivals powered ahead in Europe last month.Volkswagen reported a 180% increase in sales of battery electric vehicles to just under 20,000, while BMW and Mini sold a combined 19,000 such models last month.The Chinese-owned BYD recorded a 94% increase in sales in Europe to more than 4,000. Separate figures show that BYD’s global sales topped $100bn (£83bn) last year, overtaking Tesla as the world’s biggest electric car company by revenue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson for the Danish police confirmed on Monday that they had sent extra personnel and sniffer dogs to Greenland as they step up security measures before the visit.Local media also reported the arrival of four bulletproof cars in Nuuk city centre, delivered by plane from the US.Trump told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Monday: “I think Greenland is going to be something that maybe is in our future.” He has previously pledged to make the autonomous territory part of the US “one way or the other”, and has refused to rule out using military or economic force to do so.Greenland is part of the kingdom ofDenmark, which ruled the island as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy.René Gyldensten, the Danish police spokesperson, said the extra officers, deployed on Sunday, were part of regular steps taken during visits by dignitaries but declined to specify the number of extra police flown in on a chartered aircraft. News reports put the figure at dozens.Greenlandic parties are in coalition talks after an election less than a fortnight agoin which the country voted for a complete overhaul of its government, with the Democrats replacing Egede’s party, Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), as the biggest party in the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament.1:06Greenland: opposition parties react to surprise election result amid Trump threats – video report“It should be said clearly that our integrity and democracy must be respected without foreign interference,” Egede said. He added that the US delegation’s visit “cannot be seen as just a private visit”.In further comments he accused Greenland’s allies of “hiding” and “almost whispering” their support. If the international community did not step up its support for Greenland, he warned, the situation would escalate.“Yes, the western allies stood together and helped each other through thick and thin, but it has turned upside down now with the sitting president in the USA,”he told the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.“But the fact that our other allies in the international community feel like hiding in a small corner and almost whispering that they support us has no effect, and if they do not speak out loudly about how the USA is treating Greenland, the situation will escalate day by day, and the American aggression will increase.”He added: “So we need our other allies to clearly and distinctly come with their support and backing for us.”The most pro-Trump and pro-US party in the Greenland coalition talks – Naleraq, which came second in the vote – left the negotiations on Monday, according to the leader of the Greenland Democrats, Jens Frederik Nielsen.“It has always been my intention to form a broad coalition, as I believe it is the right thing to do in the situation our country finds itself in,” he said. “But it requires that one is able to agree on the conditions for entering into an agreement. And that has proven to be too difficult in the negotiations with Naleraq.“Our country needs a coalition to be formed as soon as possible that can pull together and work for the entire population and for our common future. The time has come to stand together.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He accused the US of a “lack of respect” in planning the visit while coalition talks were still happening.“The visit, which is said to be ‘private’, is pure charm offensive, and if we allow ourselves to be influenced by it, for example by rushing to form a new coalition, we may become even more vulnerable to pressure,”Nielsen told Sermitsiaq.“So let’s cool our nerves and maintain our common goal of showing the outside world that our country is not a commodity, and that we have sovereignty over the country, which must be respected and no one can take it away from us.”Vivian Motzfeldt, the chair of the social democratic party Siumut, which was in coalition with IA in the last government but suffered its biggest ever defeat in this month’s election, said she understood concerns about the upcoming US visit. But she said she believed it was time to look at what opportunities increasing cooperation with the US might offer Greenland.She wrote on social media: “The United States wants a closer relationship with our country, and if that had happened a year ago, we would have had a very different reaction in our country. The president’s words, which change everything, are the basis for our assessment today, and it is understandable, since the words used should not be used among countries that are allies.“Instead of worrying, we should examine how the opportunities that arise can benefit our country.”The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said on Sunday that the planned visit “cannot be seen independently of the public statements that have been made”. She added: “In the kingdom, we want to cooperate with the Americans. But it must be a cooperation that is based on the fundamental values ​​of sovereignty and respect between countries and peoples …“This is something we are looking at seriously. The dialogue with the US regarding Greenland will take place in close coordination between the Danish government and the future Greenlandic government.”Announcing the trip on Sunday, the second lady’s office said Vance would visit Greenland together with her son and a US delegation from Thursday to Saturday this week. The White House later announced that Waltz and Wright would visit the US military base in Greenland, Pituffik, for briefings from US personnel. They are expected to join Vance to visit historical sites and attend a dog sled race.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDonald TrumpTrump administrationJD VanceDenmarkUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now, we need to do extraordinary things for ourselves.”Residents of Gander opened their arms to nearly6,600 airline passengersdiverted there when the US government shut down airspace during 9/11.In a matter of a few hours, the town population of 10,000 in 2001 was overwhelmed by 38 planeloads of travelers, yet locals went to work in their kitchens and cleaned up spare rooms to offer space and food to the newcomers.Flight crews quickly filled Gander’s hotels, so passengers were taken to schools, fire stations, church halls. The Canadian military flew in 5,000 cots. Stores donated blankets, coffee machines, barbecue grills. Unable to retrieve their luggage, passengers became dependent on the kindness of strangers, and it came in the shape of clothes, showers, toys, banks of phones to call home free of charge, an arena that became a giant walk-in fridge full of donated food.Once all the planes had landed or turned back to Europe, Gander’s air traffic controllers switched to cooking meals in the building nonstop for three days.On Monday, Carney visited the home of Beulah Cooper, who opened her home and comforted many including Dennis and Hannah O’Rourke, an elderly couple whose New York firefighter son, Kevin, went missing at the World Trade Center and was later confirmed to have died there.The O’Rourkes remained friends with Cooper long after and went back to Gander, saying they felt eternally indebted.“More than 6,000 passengers. Overnight, the town’s population almost doubled,” Carney said during a speech to residents. “You showed friendship to people who were fearful. In a crisis, you showed your character. When people needed help, you gave it.”Carney noted the story of that day became legend, immortalized in the Canadian-made Broadway hit musicalCome From Away.“It became yet another example of the unbreakable bond between Canadians and Americans. Because when Americans are in need, Canadians have always shown up,” Carney said.Carney noted Canadians have always been by Americans’ side whether it was during the Iranian hostage crisis, or more recently during the California wildfires or in Afghanistan, whereCanadalost 158 members of the armed forces and seven civilians.Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbor and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that hasinfuriated Canadians. The US president has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested the border is a fictional line.Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products – as well as all of America’s trading partners – on 2 April.Carney said Canadians were over the shock of the betrayal but now had to look out for themselves. He said Canadians and Americans had traditionally been like brothers.“But that’s changed. And it wasn’t us who did the changing. Unfortunately, President Trump’s actions have put that kinship under greater strain today than at any point in our storied history,” Carney said.Carney and his Conservative opponent, Pierre Poilievre, said Trump must respect Canada’s sovereignty as they kicked off their election campaigns on Sunday. Carney announced afive-week election campaignbefore the vote on 28 April.Carney still has not had a phone call with Trump and suggested that might not happen until after the election. “I’m available for a call. But you know we are going to talk on our terms as a sovereign country, not as what he pretends we are,” Carney said.He said the Americans were making a “fundamental mistake” in the trade war.“They think they will weaken us. They think that they can own us, quite frankly, that’s what they think,” he said. “We are going to get stronger. We are going to wait this out. They are going to come to the table and we are going to negotiate a good deal for Canadians.”Explore more on these topicsMark CarneyCanadaDonald TrumpAmericasUS foreign policySeptember 11 2001newsShareReuse this content"

He will finally speak.”Depardieu walked past reporters and into the courtroom without saying a word, his hand on his lawyer’s shoulder, before the start of the trial around 1:30pm (1230 GMT).The proceedings, which are expected to last up to three days, were initially scheduled to start in October but were postponed because of Depardieu’s ill-health.Prosecutors allege that assaults against two women, whose full identities have not been revealed, took place during the 2021 filmingLes Volets Verts, or The Green Shutters.They accuse Depardieu of groping one of the women on the film set, pulling her towards him and trapping her with his legs before touching her waist, hips and breasts while saying obscene words. Three people witnessed the scene, prosecutors say.They say Depardieu groped the second woman on set and in the street.A lawyer for one of the women said before the trial that her client had been scared to come forward against Depardieu.“There’s a fear, because he’s a cinema giant,” said Carine Durrieu-Diebolt. “It’s a struggle between David and Goliath and they are afraid of retaliation as they all work in cinema but at a much lower level than Depardieu.”The lawyer for the second plaintiff did not reply to requests for comment.If found guilty, Depardieu could face a sentence of up to five years in jail and a €75,000 (£63,000) fine.Depardieu’s trial is the highest-profile #MeToo case to come to court inFrance.Explore more on these topicsGérard DepardieuFrance#MeToo movementEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

If the examination suggests the tumour has been removed, the nerve-containing outer layer of the prostate can be left intact, reducing the patient’s risk of erectile problems.Prof Greg Shaw, the trial lead and a consultant urologist at University College London hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “This procedure gives surgeons feedback during the surgery to give them the certainty they need to spare as many nerves as possible and give men increased hope of recovering their sexual potency after their cancer is surgically removed.”Prostate cancer is themost common form of cancer in men in England, with 50,000 cases diagnosed each year. Worldwide, nearly 1.5 million men are diagnosed and 375,000 die annually. The disease is most common in over-50s and is often called a silent killer because it causes no symptoms in the early stages.Black men in England more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer, analysis showsRead moreRecent developments in robotic surgery have allowed doctors to perform precision “nerve-sparing” operations in prostate cancer patients. This involves removing the diseased prostate while leaving the outer layers and the nerves running through them.However, doctors must be sure that no cancer cells are left behind, and this can be difficult to assess. If the cancer is advanced, surgeons will err on the side of caution and remove the prostate with its outer layers to reduce the risk of missing any tumour cells and the disease returning.In the NeuroSafe procedure, doctors remove the prostate while preserving as much nerve tissue around it as possible. Slices of the prostate are then frozen, stained and examined for cancer cells. If the tumour reaches the surface of the prostate, the outer layers and its nerves may need to be removed. But if the tumour stops short, the surgery is considered complete.The trial assessed 344 men with prostate cancer who had no history of erectile dysfunction. Half received the NeuroSafe procedure and half underwent standard surgery. A year later, 56% of men who had standard surgery reported severe erectile dysfunction, compared with 38% who had NeuroSafe surgery.Less than a quarter (23%) who had standard surgery reported no or only mild erectile dysfunction, compared with 39% who had the NeuroSafe procedure. Details were presented at the 2025 European Association of Urology congress in Madrid and are published inthe Lancet Oncology.Dr Matthew Hobbs, the director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Prostate cancer surgery is a life-saving option for lots of men, but it’s a major procedure that can cause side-effects like erection problems. A major challenge we face is how to cure men but also ensure they can live life to the full afterwards.“This study is promising and provides evidence that innovative types of surgery can reduce erectile dysfunction in some men. However, more research is needed to prove whether NeuroSafe is as effective as traditional techniques at delivering a complete cure.“We also need to understand exactly which men could benefit from this new technique and, crucially, whether this technique could be delivered at scale across the NHS to make it accessible to men across the UK.”Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerCancer researchMedical researchHealthCancerHospitalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The battle between the government and the press, said Clooney, is a “fight for the ages”.“You see it happening at the LA Times, you see it happening at the Washington Post,” he said, in reference to protests by staff at the two titles at their rightwing owners, both of whom clamped down on the papers choosing to endorse a candidate at last year’s election.Clooney drew parallels between the events Good Night, and Good Luck dramatises and the difficulties faced by reporters in pursuit of truth today. The actor cited Trump’s $16m recent defamation settlement with ABC News, as well as the$20bn “voter interference” suit Trump filed against CBS last Octoberin which he claimed 60 Minutes had “deceptively edited” an interview with his rival, Kamala Harris, to present her in a more flattering light.View image in fullscreen‘A fight for the ages’ … George Clooney in the 2005 film version of Good Night, and Good Luck.Photograph: YouTubeSaid Clooney: “When the other three estates fail, when the judiciary and the executive and the legislative branches fail us, the fourth estate has to succeed.”“ABC has just settled a lawsuit with the Trump administration.

They never have. And that goes for whether you are a conservative or a liberal or whatever side you’re on. They don’t like the press,” he added.Trump took to Truth Social to combat Clooney’s arguments, and to offer a broadside against the show.“Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total ‘puff piece’ on George Clooney, a second-rate movie ‘star’ and failed political pundit,” wrote Trump.“He fought hard for Sleepy Joe’s election, and then, right after the Debate, dumped him like a dog. Later, I assume under orders from the Obama camp, pushed all out for ‘Kamala,’ only to soon realise that this was not going to work out too well.”He then reiterated his earlier claims against the show, saying: “60 Minutes even fraudulently inserted Fake answers into her disastrous interview, aired just before Election Day, in one of the most embarrassing and dishonest events in broadcast history … And now George Clooney again? His press agent should be making a fortune!!!”Asked about his article asking Biden to step down as he felt he simply “cannot win”, Clooney, whose father was a journalist, said: “I’ll make it kind of easy. I was raised to tell the truth.‘George Clooney – who cares?’ Did celebrity endorsements actually harm Kamala Harris?Read more“I had seen the president up close for this fundraiser, and I was surprised. And so I feel as if there was a lot of profiles in cowardice in my party through all of that. And I was not proud of that. And I also believed I had to tell the truth …At the time, Trump hit back at Clooney for his article, calling him a“fake movie actor”who “never came close to making a great movie”.“What does Clooney know about anything?” Trump added. “Clooney should get out of politics and go back to television. Movies never really worked for him!!!”Appearing on Stephen Colbert’s talkshow last week to promote his play, Clooney was asked about his feelings about the defeat of Harris last year.“Well I don’t know, what am I supposed to do? Storm the fucking Capitol?” he said in reference to the 6 January insurrection, to applause from the audience. Without saying Trump’s name, Clooney also had a message for the new president, saying: “Good for you.

Goodbye Shep on the spoons! It’s the sad end of an era for Blue PeterAfter 67 years and many wild incidents etched on Britain’s collective memory, the world’s longest-running children’s TV show will stop going out live. Will it ever go viral again?Stuart HeritageMon 24 Mar 2025 10.05 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 10.16 EDTShareLife has changed beyond all recognition over the last 67 years. The way we live, the way we communicate, the things we eat; if you were to grab someone from 1958 and bring them forward in time to 2025, the sheer scale of change would blow their minds. Except, perhaps, for one thing. Everything else might be unrecognisable, butBlue Peterhas always been broadcast live. Until now.It has been reported that the last live episode of Blue Peter has aired, ending a tradition that has endured for nearly seven decades. It isn’t the end of Blue Peter, which will continue, albeit in a prerecorded format, but it is the end of an era. The show may be an institution, but even the longest-running children’s programme in the world isn’t immune to change.The BBC has cited changing viewing habits as the reason for the switch, but that feels like code for something sadder. Blue Peter used to be watched by millions of children, all excited and eager to learn. But there are so many other choices today – not just on streaming platforms, but the monolith that is YouTube – and the staid, earnest, eat-your-vegetables approach taken by Blue Peter no longer holds the same appeal. In other words, it isn’t financially sustainable to put on a weekly live show for a declining audience that is more likely to watch it on iPlayer anyway.The BBC says that viewers are unlikely to notice much difference, because the show has been mixing live and prerecorded segments for decades, but plenty of people have pointed out that the show might lose some of the magic you only get with live TV. What they mean, I suspect, is that elephants won’t poop all over the floor any more.View image in fullscreenJohn Noakes with Shep, the Blue Peter dog, in 1978.Photograph: Photoshot/Getty ImagesThis, to some, is the quintessential Blue Peter moment; the episode in 1969 when a baby elephant called Lulu started acting up in the studio. Afterdragging John Noakes and Peter Purves around the floor, Lulu narrowly missed Valerie Singleton’s shoes with a stream of urine, crapped everywhere, then caused her keeper to slip on it and fall over.There have been other live catastrophes. In 1971, someone had the smart idea of having a campfire singalong, despite the show being filmed indoors. Dozens of Guides and Brownies looked increasingly worried as the flames grew higher and the studio filled with thick black smoke before someone rushed in with a fire extinguisher. A year later,Roy Castle’s attempt to play the spoonswas frustrated and derailed by Shep the dog leaping up at him and trying to join in on the drums. Also, let’s not forget the show’s 1966 attempt ata Dalek cake, the result resembling a sort of floppy sponge dildo. All these moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.View image in fullscreenLive in 2000 … opening the Blue Peter time capsules buried in 1971 and 1984, presenters from left: Janet Ellis, Simon Groom, Simon Thomas, Konnie Huq, Peter Purves, Valerie Singleton, John Noakes, Katy Hill and Matt Baker.Photograph: BBCExcept they won’t. One pile of elephant poo every 67 years hardly justifies keeping Blue Peter live and, besides, most of its indelible moments were prerecorded anyway. When John Noakes climbed Nelson’s Column in 1977 – without a harness, on some rickety tied-together ladders, on a windy day while wearingflares– it had been recorded. It’s also worth pointing out that prerecorded segments don’t have to be sanitised. In a filmed piece in 2008, presenter Andy Akinwolere was tasked with putting the star on top of the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree.He dropped the star,which fell 70ft to the ground. Blue Peter still kept it in the final broadcast.That is extremely heartening. Blue Peter may not be live any more, but it is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the show to leave all the accidents in anyway. If a presenter is recording an episode and there’s a power cut or a fire, or a zookeeper starts skidding around in piles of animal excrement, Blue Peter is smart enough to keep all that stuff in. After all, nothing gets more eyeballs than a cock-up gone viral. This might be the end of an era, but Blue Peter is going nowhere just yet.Explore more on these topicsBlue PeterChildren's TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nunez “can make us care about anything”, wrote Sam Byers in aGuardian reviewof The Vulnerables. “The concerns of the moment are rendered not as clumsy drama, but as living subjects of conversation; sites of intimacy and disagreement.”British playwright Roy Williams was recognised in the drama category, describing the award as an “unexpected delight”. His plays include theDeath of England series, co-written with Clint Dyer, andThe Lonely Londoners. Williams’s “nuanced, multivocal portrayals of race and class lay bare uncomfortable truths about British identity, creating an essential and complex theatre of contemporary life”, said the selection committee.A second UK-based playwright,Matilda Feyiṣayọ Ibini, was also chosen for drama. “I am over the moon and currently hurtling through space somewhere near Jupiter,” they said. Their 2023 playSleepova, about a sleepover between four friends, won the Olivier award for outstanding achievement in affiliate theatre. “[Ibini’s] exuberant plays barrel on to the stage with joyful abandon, loosening the knots in the fabric of our socio-political lives with forensic attention to reveal new, hopeful ways of remaking the world,” said the judges.Trinidadian Scottish poet Anthony V Capildeo said that winning one of this year’s poetry prizes “lifted weights that I didn’t even know were oppressing me internally”.

For nearly four years, a fierce debate raged over demolishing the site’s high-rise flatsByWords and pictures byChris LeslieMon 24 Mar 2025 08.44 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 10.08 EDTShareFor nearly four years, a fierce debate raged over the future of the Wyndford estate inGlasgow, dividing residents and sparking wider national controversy. Was the demolition of its high-rises an environmental travesty or the first step toward much-needed regeneration?The dispute began in November 2021, days after the city hosted the UN climate conference Cop26, at which politicians and businesses promised to curb wasteful building destruction.Yet residents of Wyndford soon foundleaflets on their doorsteps heralding a “bright new dawn”– one that involved the demolition of all four high-rise blocks on the estate. The decision set off years of protests, legal challenges and community divisions.The fight came to a head on Sunday, when three of the four 1960s tower blocks were finally reduced to rubble in a controlled demolition.Wyndford estate was built between 1961 and 1969 on the site of a former military barracks. Commissioned by the Harold Macmillan government, it was intended as an exemplar of high-quality public housing, a rebuttal to Glasgow’s legacy of cheap and poorly planned social accommodation.View image in fullscreenThe four high-rise blocks of the Wyndford estate one week before demolition. Three blocks were demolished by controlled explosion on 23 March – the block on the left will be brought down floor by floor because of its proximity to other homes on the estateBut 60 years later, part of that vision had faded. Its one-bedroom high-rise flats had become synonymous with short-term tenancies, and labelled a hotspot of neglect and social deprivation. Wheatley Group, Scotland’s largest landlord, argued that the blocks were no longer fit for purpose and should be replaced with modern family homes.A determined coalition of residents, activists, and conservationists, led by the Wyndford Residents Union (WRU), fiercely opposed the demolitions. At the heart of their campaign was a belief that the destruction of social housing during a housing crisis was not only irresponsible but unnecessary.Bring down these flats and give the people the houses that they have been crying out forHenry MclarenView image in fullscreenHenry McLaren, a Wyndford resident and focus group memberDespite the protests, occupations, and legal challenges, Wheatley Group remained steadfast. Aisling Mylrea, the director of Wheatley Homes Glasgow, emphasised that legal challenges had been shut down every time and that all the permissions had been in place for the demolition to go ahead. She said: “Over 85% of the tenants of the scheme support the demolition and the £100m investment that will follow for the area.”Henry McLaren, a Wyndford resident and member of the Future Focus Group set up by Wheatley, said: “ This will be all good for the community. The words ‘focus’ and ‘future’ are important – everyone needs to stay focused on the end goal.”They’ve run this place down – making it the worst place to live. Now they want to blow up the flats and make it the bestLaura JonesView image in fullscreenLaura Jones, 38, Wyndford residentFrom the outset, Wheatley Group insisted that retrofitting the high-rise flats and making them into larger homes was impossible and continually pointed to the declining popularity of high-rise social housing. However, many campaigners disputed the claim that retrofitting was unviable.A coalition of architects, conservationists and engineers conducted studies suggesting the buildings could have been modernised and repurposed. Malcolm Fraser, a leading architect and campaigner, also called into question the 85% figure cited for support of the demolition, arguing that no alternative to demolition was ever seriously presented. “That number reflects only the few hundred tenants who responded, and they were never given the option of retrofitting,” he said.We’ve been surrounded by rubble for months. The last block nearest to me … is being brought down piece by pieceCazView image in fullscreenCaz, a member of Wyndford Residents UnionAs the demolition date approached, tensions mounted. For many residents, the stark reality of the controlled explosions in their neighbourhood took centre stage. Fears of further protests and block occupations prompted demolition contractors to station 24-hour security at the entrance to each tower. People living near the demolition site expressed concerns for their homes, and were angered after being offered a £100 Tesco voucher as compensation for vacating their properties for up to 10 hours on the day of the blast.This place was beautiful when we moved in here … It’s different now … it all feels like a mad rush just to get us outAngie ThompsonView image in fullscreenAngie Thompson, a Wyndford residentWheatley Group assured the residents that all safety measures had been met, stating: “Safedem are world-leading demolition contractors. They have carried out similar demolitions worldwide, ensuring all asbestos and hazardous materials were removed in advance.”View image in fullscreenNick Durie, an Alba party politician and member of the Wyndford Residents UnionWheatley Group says it wants to replace the 600 one-bedroom and bedsit flats with 400 new family homes, citing an urgent need for larger, modern housing in Glasgow. Yet campaigners remain unconvinced that this will truly benefit the community, given the overall reduction in social housing units. As the dust settled on demolition day, Nick Durie, an Alba politician and WRU member, made it clear that the battle was far from over. “This isn’t the end – it’s just the beginning. Our fight will continue long after the demolition. We will protest and challenge every stage of the new development until they commit to replacing all 600 social homes they’ve torn down,” he said.We will continue to fight their planning application and to politicise itNick DurieBeyond the loss of homes, the demolition has drawn criticism from climate activists and architects alarmed by the environmental toll. With an estimated 47,000 tonnes of embodied carbon released in the demolition process, some argue that the destruction contradicts the climate commitments made at Cop26.View image in fullscreenWilliam Doolan, a Wyndford resident.I won’t be watching the demolition, don’t want to see it happening, it was my homeWilliam DoolanFraser summed up the frustration: “I know that every building we put up today will last about 40 years. These flats, if properly retrofitted, could have lasted for centuries. We need to stop this cycle of waste and destruction.”A UK-wide policy that exempts new buildings and demolitions from VAT has only reinforced the preference for demolition over retrofitting. Critics warn that without policy changes, the cycle will continue: “Big business thrives on knocking down old buildings, landfilling them and starting again. And so it goes on and on.”View image in fullscreenThe four high-rise blocks of the Wyndford estate one week before demolitionThree of Wyndford’s towers have now been reduced to rubble, joining the many high-rise schemes that have vanished from Glasgow’s skyline.

I sat in my coat, woolly hat and fingerless gloves, my breath clouding the air. Before me were nearly two hundred anonymous letters written in 2007, most by hand, reflecting on the “ups and downs” of friendship.Mass Observation is a treasure trove for historians like me. Since 1939, it has sent out loose questionnaires called “directives” to its pool of volunteer writers across the UK, who respond by describing their daily lives, opinions and feelings. Most who replied to the directive on friendship were women over 60. As the hours passed, my fingers grew numb but I didn’t care. It was so absorbing to read their intimate accounts of the pleasures and the usually unspoken difficulties of friendship.There were terrible betrayals in those letters: deceptions, infidelities, backstabbings. But far more common was having a friendship that had become “difficult”. Once enthusiastic friends had now become relentless complainers; once supportive ones, prickly and overcritical. There were friends who always cancelled at the last minute, or only ever called to talk about themselves, or who subtly undermined the writers, leaving them “drained”. It was all painfully recognisable: I have had these friends. More to the point, I have certainly been this friend, too.Each of these writers found themselves with a dilemma: should they end things or keep going? Though they were anxious about being disloyal or causing hurt, what seemed to worry them most was the idea of stringing the friendship out unnecessarily. Most chastised themselves for not “being braver” and making a clean break. They knew there was no legal or even social reason compelling them to keep up their friendships – unlike family or marriage, friendship is an entirely elective relationship with no contractual ties. They described irritated partners, who could not comprehend why they hadn’t cut the person off. They suspected younger readers would be more assertive: “I know what you’re thinking,” wrote one 72-year-old, who had taken to dodging the calls of an endlessly demanding friend, “I must be barmy. I plead guilty!” As a historian of emotions I am interested in how people wrestle with the gap between how they really feel and behave, and how they think they ought to. I want to know where the expectations they are beating themselves up with come from – and whether they still hold true.‘A toxic friend is one who undermines our confidence, saps our strength, feels happy when we fail,’ declares one guidebookPeople have always recognised that friendships can sometimes become strained. Cicero suggested letting go gently, slowly lessening the intensity of the bond; though he also suggested that needing to end a friendship might be the result of choosing badly in the first place – rather than that life’s twists and turns might change two people and their friendship in unexpected ways. But the idea that we “ought” to end a difficult friendship gathered real momentum in the 1980s, hand in hand with a new archetype: the toxic friend. The first mention I have come across of “toxic friends” appears in the psychologist Joel D Block’s 1980 bookFriendship, in which he says: “Most of us bring both nourishing and toxic qualities to our friendships,” and though we might want to minimise the more negative aspects, “perfection in this task is unlikely”.This rather forgiving and nuanced approach was quickly eclipsed as the market for self-help books exploded and the idea of the “toxic” friend caught people’s imaginations. “A toxic friend is one who undermines our confidence, saps our strength, feels happy when we fail, criticises our progress and dogs our steps with prophecies of gloom,” declared the 1993 guidebook How to Survive Practically Anything. A 1996 headline in Teen magazine asked: “Toxic friends: are they poisoning your life?” and three years later, Florence Isaacs’s book Toxic Friends/True Friends terrified readers by claiming the former could threaten your health, happiness, family life and career. The language was vivid and dramatic and the solution seemed obvious: what else do you do with a poison but cut it out?The trend took off partly because it channelled a new spirit in which self-actualisation and self-improvement were king, and partly because, as sociologist Eva Illouz argues in her book The End of Love, “choice – sexual, consumer or emotional – is the chief trope under which the self and the will in liberal polities are organised”. She argues that we have learned to think of ourselves as managing our emotional lives and relationships in very intentional ways. Failing to act decisively, by not exactly ending a friendship but not exactly embracing it either, can, in this context, be seen as a sign of passivity, self-sabotage and a failure of will.In our own age, online talk of “toxic friends” has grown even louder. Self-proclaimed social media experts explain the warning signs, while strangers exhort one another to ditch the friends that are causing such misery. As the sociologistsKinneret Lahad and Jenny van Hoof write, having a “toxic friend” is framed as a victimhood, while dumping them is “promoted as a courageous and healthy action … a desired form of ‘self-care’”. In the letters I read in the Mass Observation Archive, I saw what kinds of feelings might be obscured by this shrill, uncompromising vision. Were the writers really cowardly, avoidant or irrational, as they feared? Or was there something else that compelled them to keep their connection with their “difficult” friend alive? In their letters, I read how painful it is to contemplate ending a friendship. I saw the fear of hurting someone we have been close to, the ways writers had tried to understand the reasons for their friends’ changed behaviour, and the flicker of hope that things might change again: “I love her,” said one writer, trying to explain why she kept the friend around, “and I remember when she wasn’t such a nuisance.” Their experience of the friendship was messy, ambivalent, even tortured – a far cry from the idealised friendship imagined on social media, where even the slightest most subjective flaw or transgression can lead to the judgment that a friend is “toxic”.But if a friend is touching on your sore points, and you on theirs, there are other ways to manage the strain. Though it might be quite intimidating for many of us, there’s the possibility of trying to talk it out. I have a friend who, after a terrible, guilt-inducing experience in her 20s with a friend she never spoke to again, has taught herself to be courageous, talking to people whenever things become strained. In one case, a friend she was trying to end things with ultimately became closer “because we have been through something very honest and raw together, and that friend now trusts me to say things that no other friend has ever told her before”. She believes that learning how to have these difficult conversations – and knowing that they can be survived – has been transformative, partly because it is easier to strike up friendships when you know what to do in the event that things go awry.If the idea of such a conversation fills you with dread, it is also possible to step back gently, without feeling you have to create the kind of dramatic ending the “toxic friend” framework demands. Communications expert Emily Langan points out that, because we live in a culture that glamorises a particular kind of close and lifelong friendship, we can be seduced into imagining our friendships should be sustained at this pitch for ever. But there are many different types of friendships, from long-standing ones that carry on at a low simmer, to quick-boil connections, or more pragmatic, neighbourly relationships. In the same way, a single friendship may cycle through different sorts of intimacy.And we can always, as many of the people I encountered in the Mass Observation Archive were doing, exercise patience, in the hope that the friend in question might recover from the difficult phase in their life, or that whatever distressing feelings we are struggling with ourselves might settle down. As these writers recognised, in a world that encourages us to swiftly end friendships that have been diagnosed as toxic, slower approaches requiring us to sit with ambivalent feelings can seem counterintuitive. Yet, ultimately, the more forgiving, flexible approach they teach can help us keep hold of the friends who are witnesses to our histories, as we are to theirs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Given that both were in the minor mode – the A minor, D784 and the C minor, D958 – together they constituted quite a serious, heavyweight affair for a Sunday morning recital.A pianist of graceful poise and sensitivity, Momen has a highly fluent technique that allowed everything to carry well in this acoustic. And, despite seeming a slight slip of a thing, to use an old-fashioned phrase, in these sonatas she showed that she could unleash considerable power in Schubert’s outbursts of high-volume dramatic tension, sometimes shocking in their immediacy. At the other extreme, her pianissimo was often pianississimo, so that lyrical lines, rather than quietly singing out, sounded understated and as a result curiously underwhelming. It was in the mercurial finale of the A minor sonata and the lilting, dance-like F major theme with its chromatic edge, poignant and piquant at every appearance, that Momen captured most expressively the happy/sad ambivalence of this composer’s musical makeup.That same tendency to play on vast dynamic contrasts was present in the C minor sonata too, the first of Schubert’s final three almost symphonic sonatas in which trauma and foreboding coexist with the consoling beauty of music. Again, it was the Allegro finale – febrile, fast and furious – that communicated best.Three pieces from Janáček’s On an Overgrown Path, No 1 Naše večery (Our Evenings), No 9 V pláči (In Tears) and No 10, Sýček neodletěl! (The Barn Owl Has Not Flown Away!) formed a neat tripartite sequence. In these Moravian-inflected melodies, Momen negotiated the balance of serenity and volatility in a way which resonated with Schubert.Momen has written abouther affinity for the keyboard music of William Byrdand this was manifest in her playing of his Prelude and Fantasia in A minor, MB 12 and 13. Here was fine rhythmic clarity and conviction, but with an element of playful fantasy too. It felt refreshing for being a foil for the big sonatas and, heard in this context was also, for many, an illuminating introduction to the Renaissance master.In recital atWesley Centre, Harrogate, 2 June ; atWigmore Hall, London, 8 JuneExplore more on these topicsClassical musicRoyal Welsh College of Music and DramareviewsShareReuse this content"

In the early 00s, Alonso Ruizpalacios was not the gifted, ingenious director he is today – the man behind A Cop Movie, a slippery psychodrama that breaks the laws of documentary, and the new La Cocina, starringRooney Maraas a waitress at a hectic New York restaurant. Back then, he wore baggy khaki shorts and welcomed customers to the Rainforest Cafe. “Hi, I’m Alonso and I’ll be your safari guide today,” he would say. “You guys been here before? No? Well, this is Bamba, our gorilla. Occasionally there will be rain showers, but – hey – don’t be afraid, you won’t get wet!”View image in fullscreenAlonso Ruizpalacios in February 2024.Photograph: Abaca Press/AlamySitting in a London hotel room with a view of the Thames, the film-maker grimaces at the memory. “You had to give the whole spiel,” he says. “It was fucking horrible.” Ruizpalacios, who was raised in a suburb of Mexico City by parents who are both doctors, is 47, with dense stubble, curly black hair and chunky-framed Harry Palmer-style glasses. Give or take the same lopsided smile, he doesn’t look much like the budding matinee idol in hisRada headshot. “I got into acting because I wanted to be a director,” he says. “And I needed to understand actors.”They’re all nuts, right? “They’re strange creatures for sure,” he replies diplomatically. “Frail, vain, brave. Full of contradictions. I could say many things. I don’t want to say thewrongthing.” After all, he is married to one: Ilse Salas, who starred in his 2014 debut, Güeros, a road movie that goes stylishly in circles, and Museo, with Gael García Bernal as one of the perpetrators of a real-life museum heist.While studying at Rada, Ruizpalacios did crummy jobs to earn his keep, which is where the Rainforest Cafe came in. He can draw a direct line between that experience and La Cocina. For starters, the film is adapted from Arnold Wesker’s 1957 play The Kitchen, which he first read while at Rada. “Wesker’s play made the restaurant seem tolerable. But during my first few weeks in the job, I would have nightmares every night, imagining I was still at work and the orders were running late.” Directors and chefs aren’t so dissimilar, and he concedes that there is a “militarised” hierarchy to film sets and kitchens alike. “But I’m no Gordon Ramsay.”La Cocina is a lively, relentless portrait of American working life, set during one day below stairs at The Grill, with its staff of immigrants, many of them undocumented, from the Dominican Republic,Mexicoand Morocco. Among them is the sous chef Pedro (the director’s regular collaborator Raúl Briones), who is in love with Julia, played by Mara.View image in fullscreenRelentless portrait of American working life … Raúl Briones as Pedro in La CocinaIsn’t there a risk of imbalance when a performer like Mara joins a cast of less feted or recognisable actors? “There is,” he admits, “but I wanted a Hollywood star because that’s how Julia is in Pedro’s mind. Though she’s actually very grounded.” What about Mara herself? Don’t A-listers come with entourages, even their own chefs to rival the fictional ones of La Cocina? “We kept all that to a minimum,” he says with a knowing smile. “We weren’t a big production; we shot all the interiors in Mexico. And Rooney is very grounded, just like Julia. As one of my teachers at Rada used to say: ‘Nobody shits jam.’”La Cocina is shot in a dreamy monochrome, which calls to mind Coppola’s Rumble Fish. As do the film’s absurdist touches: an unseen rat tugging a pizza along the street, or a malfunctioning soda machine that floods the submarine-like kitchen with Cherry Coke as if in some sugary spin on Das Boot.Ruizpalacios chose black-and-white to help render the film timeless. “You don’t know when it’s taking place. That’s why there are no mobile phones. I wanted something beyond realism.” But that approach was also one of several sticking points for potential financiers. “Black-and-white was a big no for everyone we went to.” Even after the success of Roma, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. “Roma is an anomaly, I think, because Cuarón is such a big name. People were also put off because I insisted on Raúl in the lead role instead of a star. And this is a kitchen film with no food porn. And half of it is in Spanish.”Don’t forget it also has one character contemplating an abortion. “A studio we went to said: ‘Can wenothave the abortion storyline?’ I was, like: ‘That’s one of the main parts!’ It’s insane that we’re still talking about a woman’s right to choose.”View image in fullscreenLa Cocina.Photograph: PR IMAGESurely the popularity of other frantic kitchen-based dramas such as The Bear and Boiling Point must have assuaged backers’ concerns. “We were already in pre-production when The Bear came out. I still haven’t seen it: I didn’t want it to influence what we were doing.”Had La Cocina been shot in colour, minus the abortion storyline, and with, say, Jacob Elordi as Pedro, there would still be no expunging the text’s inherent anti-capitalist bent. “It’s about how the capitalist machine leaves no room for dreams,” says Ruizpalacios, alluding to the central sequence in which the kitchen staff are overwhelmed by orders during the lunchtime rush. “At the beginning, they’re talking about other things, little inner conflicts. As it progresses, there’s no room for the personal, and it’s all orders, orders, orders. It shows how relationships are obliterated by the rhythm of capitalism and work, and the pressure to keep the production line going. That was one of the scenes that kept me thinking about the play all these years. But the feedback we got was opposed to this kind of film, which criticises the American working ethos, and the way migrants are treated. That makes it an uncomfortable watch.”If the situation was bad when Ruizpalacios and I met last year, a month before the US election, it has grown immeasurably graver since then. The director has been busy finishing a new script: his adaptation of Juan José Saer’s western The Clouds, about psychiatric patients being led across the desert to a new hospital, which he has transposed to the late 1840s and the Mexican-American war.Since we met, he has also been asked a hundred times for his views on Emilia Pérez, the Oscar-winning musical criticised for exploiting and trivialising the horror of the drug wars in his country. Make that a hundred and one times. “I understand why people in Mexico were offended,” he says now when we catch up by phone. “But I just thought the film was weak. I believe anyone should be able to put themselves in another person’s shoes. But if you’re going to do that, you should be thorough and penetrating with your research. I don’t think Emilia Pérez ever transcends its colonialist view.”View image in fullscreenRendered timeless ... Mara and Briones in La CocinaThere are even bigger problems afoot. La Cocina represents a list of Donald Trump and JD Vance’s pet hates: undocumented immigrants, abortion, anti-capitalism. How does it feel to be releasing the film into such a hostile world? “I think it only makes it more urgent and poignant,” he says. Would it be harder, perhaps even impossible, to finance today? “Oh, definitely. We already made it in an unwelcoming time for stories that were critical of the establishment. I see a lot of caution ahead in the US. I see peers who are careful about what they say, what they put out. As a foreigner, it’s different because I have no skin in that game.”Presumably he still wants to work in the US, though: he recently directed three episodes of the Star Wars spin-off series Andor. “Yeah, but working in Mexico, too, gives you a different perspective. There’s a whole life beyond Hollywood.”I think back to my final question to him last year, when I asked about the pressure to bring home a best director Oscar like his compatriots Cuarón, Alejandro González Iñárritu (who have two each) and Guillermo del Toro. “I reject that pressure,” he told me then. “That isn’t the end of the rainbow for me. Oscars don’t matter. Most people can’t even remember what won last year. I can’t. Can you?” Then we sat in silence for a few moments, racking our brains. The sun twinkled on the Thames.

That my work, in every conceivable way, must be a pleasure. But I get my hands dirty, probing everything from sustainability to sensitive data security to supply chains, to ensure buyers don’t get (non-consensually) shafted. Vibrators are coming out from under the covers. They used to feel shameful and secretive, picked from a mail-order magazine or a poky shop with blacked-out windows; today, we’re infinitely more liberated about toy ownership. We’re putting our hands in our pockets, too: the global sex toy market was valued at approximately $37.5bn last year, and it is projected to climb to $83.85bn within the next decade.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But navigating this sprawling landscape can feel overwhelming. And while “adult appliances” may now be 10 a penny, it’s not uncommon for top-end devices to cost hundreds. Reading a switched-on guide before you buy is a must. Here’s a little insight into some of the things I had to consider when writing mine.Dangerous liaisons:sex toy safetyView image in fullscreen‘Items that might land you in hospital were immediately discounted.’Photograph: Hans Neleman/Getty ImagesErotic gadget retail can be a mucky – even dangerous – business in ways you may not expect. The first international standard for sex toy safety, ISO 3533, was introduced only in 2021. Prompted by studies that showed an increase in emergency room admissions after accidents with poorly designed stimulators, the standard attempts to make toys less perilous.Yet abiding by ISO 3533 is voluntary, not mandatory. Moreover, it assumes toy manufacturers are sufficiently knowledgable and rigorous enough to conduct their own risk assessments. Having toured many factories where men previously in finance “thought it’d be cool” to start a sexy business, I can attest to the alarming number of people who don’t know their arse from their elbow creating items intended for use on the genitals.So: ISO mark or not, the first thing I analysed in myvibrator guide, to the best of my ability, was safety. Items that might land you in A&E or as an anecdote in Adam Kay’s latest book were immediately discounted. One cheap bullet vibe I tested had a loop of fabric cord, so you could “hang it round your wrist or in the shower”. Add residues from lubricant, body fluids and bathroom mould spores to that cord, and it’d quickly get more hazardous to health than Rapunzel’s plait during an outbreak of nits. Big no.Accessibility for allView image in fullscreenRocks Off’s Quest Elevate accessible cock ring.Photograph: Rocks OffThe most impressive toys I assessed usually resulted from multiple rounds of R&D, rather than rushed out to jump on trends. Notably excellent inventions have also emerged from developers actively considering how it’s not just non-disabled, neurotypical people who desire and deserve sexual pleasure. Adult toy brandRocks Offdedicated years to finessing itsQuestrange of accessible toys, collaborating with disability charityEnhance the UK.The entire shopping experience, “from a clearly navigable website to packaging that could be opened easily, even using your teeth – was designed, developed and tested by disabled people”, says charity CEO Jennie Williams. “We had to consider factors such as how sensory issues can impact toy texture for neurodiverse users; how deaf people may worry about vibrator loudness, and being unaware of whether anyone can overhear them masturbating; and how bigger, LED-lit buttons might assist visually impaired people.”I’d wager several of the inventions that emerged from this process could benefiteverybody’s body. Take Rocks Off’sElevate cock ring: it has four hoops around the outside to make it a cinch to pull open and slide on and off, even if your grip or dexterity is limited, or your fingers are covered in slippery lube.There’s a lot more at play with sex toys than first meets the eye, so I hope my reviews prove helpful.

The singer and model (neither of which I am) reportedly became fluent in French within three months of moving toParis. For some hubristic reason, I assumed I’d do the same.But in 2018, two years after arriving in Paris, I was coasting. I could get by, but I was essentially living the life of a digital nomad, speaking English with my partner at home, working remotely for a US company and socialising largely with other English-speaking migrants – something I swore I’d never do.Then, one night, I came across theLe Bar Commun– a volunteer-run bar in my rapidly gentrifying neighbourhood, which aimed to bring the community from all walks of life together. On a whim, I volunteered to work some shifts pulling pints and assembling cheese plates,tout en français(all in French).View image in fullscreen‘The volunteers and customers accepted me as I was’ … Megan Clement.Photograph: Courtesy of Megan ClementThe first nights were terrifying. There were so many nouns I hadn’t yet encountered, most to do with cleaning:mouchoir(tissue),torchon(tea towel),essuie-tout(kitchen towel). When such items were requested, I’d run into the kitchen to “check” if we had them, putting the mystery words into Google Translate before dashing back out with my response. One night, a customer asked for apaille(straw). When I looked back blankly, he began to mime what he was after, a display that quickly became distinctly pornographic, causing us both to blush furiously as I shoved the straw over the counter to him.Then there were the cultural differences from the pubs I’d known in London and Melbourne, such as the weekly “debate nights”, where people gathered to discussthe future of European democracyorprison reforminstead of getting drunk and yelling.Slowly, my language skills improved, and eventually I stopped hiding from customers in the kitchen. When I was first asked to take on a manager shift, I turned it down for lack of confidence, but my colleagues didn’t give up on me. I was soon running the show for three hours on a Wednesday night, walking home through the 18th arrondissement nursing a warm sense of satisfaction. The most important thing I learned at the bar was to stop my infuriatingly British habit of constantly apologising for my French. The volunteers and customers accepted me as I was, which let me accept myself and progress.It’s been a long time since I’ve put in a shift at Le Bar Commun. I moved away and life became busy – I began working for French employers, reporting on the country’s feminist movements, spending my volunteer time moderating bilingual panels at literary festivals and joining a community gardening group. None of it would have been possible without those nights spent behind the bar.Now, I log into the interior ministry website daily to check the progress of my French citizenship application.

So what is on offer and is it worth it?NatWestThe high-street lender is the latest bank to offer a healthy sum to attract people to switch.Customers will get £150 within 30 days of fully switching to the bank’s Reward account. This charges a £2 monthly fee but promises that customers can “earn” the money back by using direct debits and the mobile app.Anyone who opens an account must lodge £1,250 within 60 days. Within a month of that, the £150 will be paid. “Rewards” of £4 a month are offered if customers have two direct debits of £2 or more. Another £1 a month is given for logging into the mobile app. If you get these rewards, you can offset the cost of the account and earn another £36 a year.Anyone who has previously got a switching payment from the NatWest group is ineligible, as are those who want to switch from Royal Bank of Scotland or from Ulster Bank.The offer’s expiry date is not clear, as the bank says it “could be withdrawn at any time”.First DirectSigning up to First Direct’s 1st account can net you a £175 payment.The bank does not charge fees for debit card spending or ATM cash withdrawals outside the UK (although you may still have to pay other fees, such as to overseas card machine operators). There is also an interest-free overdraft of up to £250. Anything over that is charged at 39.9%.Anyone who switches needs to move at least two direct debits or standing orders and deposit £1,000 within 45 days, as well as make five debit card transactions and log on to digital banking. After that, they will get their welcome bonus.The offer is only open to people who have never previously had a First Direct account. Anyone who has opened an HSBC current account since January 2018 cannot apply.LloydsPeople switching to a new Club Lloyds account can get a £175 payment. The deal applies to the Club Lloyds account (which has a £3 monthly fee), the Club Lloyds Silver account (£11.50 a month plus the £3 fee) and the Club Lloyds Platinum account (£22.50 a month plus the £3 fee). The £3 fee on each account is refunded if a customer pays in £2,000 or more a month.You must switch three or more direct debits. Those who have received a payment from a switching offer from Lloyds, Bank of Scotland or Halifax since April 2020 are not eligible, and the offer ends on 1 April.Switchers to the Club Lloyds account can also choose a “lifestyle benefit”: these include a Disney+ subscription, six cinema tickets, a Coffee Club and Gourmet Society membership, or an annual magazine subscription.NationwideAlso finishing soon is Nationwide building society’s offer of £175 for switching to one of three current accounts. This offer lasts until 31 March.New customers must transfer a minimum of two direct debits to the new account, plus pay in at least £1,000 and make one debit card payment within 31 days.They can switch to the FlexDirect account, which has a 5% interest rate and offers 1% cashback on card purchases for 12 months, or to the FlexAccount, both of which have no monthly fee. Or they can choose the FlexPlus packaged account, which includes travel and mobile phone insurance, breakdown cover and commission-free use abroad, but carries an £18-a-month fee.Should you do it?James Daley at the consumer group Fairer Finance says potential customers must look beyond the headline payout and focus on what they will get over the course of the “relationship”, which could last for a number of years.“Some accounts offer great value, with cashback or other rewards built into their offers,” he says. Others have great service but fewer bells and whistles.“For example, Nationwide and First Direct are renowned for their service, but their core accounts are fairly vanilla.“If you can afford Nationwide’s FlexPlus packaged account, and can make use of the insurances, then this is an account that can offer exceptional value. NatWest and Lloyds do not have quite the same level of customer happiness and trust, but they offer accounts with good rewards.”Springall says there are hoops for new customers to jump through to get the bonus payments, so the perks are not always suitable for everyone.“Consumers who spend more than they save would be wise to choose an account that rewards them for using their debit card, whereas savers should look for high interest rates or reward payments,” she says. “Those who might dip into their overdraft would be wise to consider an account that charges a competitive tariff or has an interest-free buffer.”Find an ethical alternativeIn these times of global crisis and the ongoing climate emergency it’s easy to feel overwhelmed about what we can do to make a difference. However, choosing an ethical home for your current account is one of the easiest ways to ensure your money is being used in an environmentally friendly or socially responsible way.Theethical bank Triodos, whose customers include the naturalist and broadcaster Chris Packham, tends to top the best-buy tables in this area: it lends only to organisations making a positive impact for people and the planet. This means it says yes to renewable energy and social housing but no to fossil fuels and fast fashion.View image in fullscreen‘The original ethical bank’ has been taken over by Coventry building society so changes may be coming.Photograph: Co-op/PATriodos offers a current account, though it carries a £3 monthly fee, which may put some people off. It can be operated online and via the app (there are no branches), and comes with a contactless Visa debit card made from recycled plastic. Triodos offers Apple Pay but not yet Google Wallet/Google Pay (it hopes that will come later this year). There are a few other things to know: for example, it doesn’t offer an overdraft, and you can’t pay cash into a Triodos current account.The Co-operative Bank, which calls itself “the original ethical bank” and is known for its customer-led ethical policy, has beentaken over by Coventry building society,so could have changes coming down the track.Nationwide building society is another option. It’s a mutual organisation (owned by its members rather than shareholders) and gives 1% of its profits to good causes. It’ll also win points from some for what it calls its branch promise: it says that “everywhere we have a branch, we’ll still be there until at least the start of 2028”.Rupert JonesExplore more on these topicsCurrent accountsThe ObserverEthical moneyNatWest GroupLloyds Banking GroupNationwideBanks and building societiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Without it, we couldn’t operate – it would be the end of our fishing careers.”He said he had received a letter from the council “many years ago” stating that he was allowed to store his vessels on the site due to an 18th-century covenant, the White Herring Fisheries Act 1771. “It was an old law that said that any fisherman could store fishing gear on land 200m from the high-water mark.”Sea Palling parish council wrote to NNDC to say it would be a “travesty if the boat yard disappeared”.“This matter has aroused considerable indignation from local people,” the parish council wrote. “There have been boats stored … along the Marrams for over a hundred years. The parish council feels that it is iniquitous for people who own only holiday cottages in the village to try to alter something which has been in situ for several decades and is integral to the way of life here.”View image in fullscreenMatthew Fernando, landlord of the Lifeboat Tavern, says the parish council and the village are supporting the fishers.Photograph: Eastern Daily Press/SWNSMatthew Fernando, who runs the Lifeboat Tavern pub, said: “The parish council and the whole village is definitely behind the fishermen.”He thinks people who buy second homes in Sea Palling should expect to be disturbed by fishers transporting their boats in and out of the sea with the tide, during the night. “If you buy a house in a fishing village by the sea, you can’t expect to try to get rid of historic fishermen who have been here for years and years.Fishingis a dying trade and it’s a beautiful thing to see these boats come in and out. If you’re upset about that, go buy a house [further] inland.”He said the dispute was causing unnecessary tension in the village: “How can you want to take away culture and history from a seaside village? These are guys who are just working day to day to get as much as they can to survive and live. When you eat fresh lobster in a restaurant, while you’re on holiday, where do you think it comes from?”Villagers do not find the noise of the boats disturbing, he said, because they have heard it all their lives. “It wouldn’t wake me up. It’s not noisy.”In the complaint submitted to the district council, one objector said: “The landowner appears to want free rein to do anything he wishes –not necessarily related to historical small scale local fishing.”The NNDC planning officer concluded that the owner of the boatyard had provided “insufficient” evidence that the land had been used to store casual boats for fishing and recreation for a “sufficient length of time to enable a lawful development certificate to be granted”.Clarke said he is feeling very uncertain about what this decision will mean for him. “It’s a huge worry at the moment, hanging over our heads. We’ve always fished, it’s in our blood. It’s just second nature.”The Guardian understands that the owner of the site intends to appeal against the decision.Explore more on these topicsNorfolkFishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Keep things relaxed with this mostly make-ahead menuGeorgina HaydenMon 24 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTShareI’m sitting in my kitchen, a pot of coffee by my side and the remnants of yesterday’s passion fruit and saffron creme caramel taunting me (I’ve already convinced myself that it is an acceptable breakfast, so should probably put it away before it becomes an acceptable lunch).When I was younger, I wanted to race through the colder months and get them out the way. However, I’ve learned to love this quieter quarter. To hibernate and replenish my energy, spend time in my kitchen with the radio on. Just peace and quiet and eating.That being said, having people round in the gentle early spring days is easy – diaries are emptier. Everyone appreciates a home-cooked meal, no pressure to be fancy or go out-out. You want to come over for lunch and bring your slippers with you? Be my guest, I’m not changing out of mine.I will make an effort to cook a snack, though – everyone loves a deep-fried, salty nibble with their drink. Panisse hits all these marks. To make life easier, I prepare the chickpea batter in advance, ready to fry at the last minute as I chat to people from the kitchen, handing over the crisp morsels as they’re ready. I apply that principle to all elements of entertaining: what can I do ahead so I am the most present host I can be?The creme caramel will inevitably get you “ooohs” and “ahhhs”, and you can make it the day before. The lamb cooks so slowly that all the hard work is done in the morning. For a vegetarian main, the filling for the cauliflower, kimchi and blue cheese pithivier has to be cooled in advance – you can even make the entire pie ahead, ready to bake. It won’t suffer any ill fate. The only dish I think needs to be cooked just before serving is the potatoes, but it’s surprisingly simple, and the deep flavours are worth it.All of which gives you more time to natter and make drinks (in your slippers, if that’s how you’re rolling). The past few months have been like this at my place, and it has been the tonic we all need. I’m looking forward to warmer days now, but will be happy to have a few more cosy lunches.Panisses with crisp herby capersView image in fullscreenPanisses with crisp herby capers.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverThis is an excellent choice for a snack with drinks as you do most of the hard work in advance. I love a panisse served simply with crisp-fried herbs and capers, but you could also add a spicy chutney on the side, or a drizzle of a sriracha mayo over the top. Just be sure to slice them on the thinner side – the crisp surface area is key.Serves 6-8as a snackolive oil300mlgarlic2 cloves, peeled and finely choppedchickpea (gram) flour250gsea salt and freshly ground black peppercapers3 tbsprosemary and thyme½ pack of each, leaves pickedlemon1, zestedGrease a 23cm square cake tin with olive oil and leave to one side. Pour 800ml of water into a measuring jug. Place 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat and fry the chopped garlic for a minute or two until golden. Working quickly, stir in the chickpea flour, season generously and whisk in the water. Cook over the hob for around 8-10 minutes, beating consistently with a spatula until you have a thick porridge consistency. Immediately pour the mixture into the greased cake tin and smooth the top out as best you can. Leave to one side to cool completely, then chill for at least 2 hours before frying.When you are ready to fry the panisses, turn the set batter out on to a chopping board and cut into 3 rectangles. Then, cut each rectangle into 1-1½cm thick slices and set aside.Prepare the garnish. Place a large frying pan on a medium heat and pour in 100ml of the olive oil. Fry the capers and herbs for a few minutes until golden, then transfer to a kitchen-roll-lined plate with a slotted spoon.Next, fry the panisses in batches: you don’t want to overcrowd the pan or they won’t turn golden and crisp. Make sure the oil comes 1cm up the side of the frying pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden and crisp, then use a slotted spoon to transfer to the kitchen-roll-lined plate.Serve them hot, as they come out of the pan, scattered with the fried capers and herbs, a grating of lemon zest and a generous pinch of sea salt. Repeat until the mixture has all been fried.Cauliflower, kimchi and blue cheese pithivierView image in fullscreenCauliflower, kimchi and blue cheese pithivier.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverKimchi and blue cheese is one of my all-time favourite double acts. For me, it’s up there with gin and tonic, bread and butter, bangers and mash. Usually found in the form of a toastie (known as kimcheese), here I turn it into a vegetarian main and add roasted cauliflower to the mix then envelop it in buttery puff pastry. Even the most vocal blue-cheese haters in my life adore this pie.Serves 6cauliflower1 large, trimmed weight 650golive oil2 tbspsea salt and freshly ground black pepperunsalted butter35ggarlic2 cloves, peeled and finely slicedplain flour2 heaped tbspwhole milk350mlstilton150gkimchi125gegg1 largeready-rolled all-butter puff pastry2 x 320g packsmature cheese50g, such as cheddar, coarsely gratedsesame seeds1 tbspPreheat your oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7. Cut the cauliflower into small, even-sized florets and place in a roasting tin. Drizzle with the olive oil, season generously and toss together. Spread out into a single layer and roast for 18-20 minutes until the cauliflower is tender and charred.Meanwhile, place the butter in a medium-sized saucepan and fry the sliced garlic for a couple of minutes until golden. Stir in the plain flour, fry for a further minute then whisk in the milk. You are making a thick white sauce to coat the cauliflower. As soon as the cauliflower is ready, stir it in and leave to one side to cool.While the cauliflower is cooling, chop the stilton as best you can into small pieces. Finely chop the kimchi. Whisk the egg with a pinch of salt until smooth.Turn the oven down to 180C/gas mark 6. Unroll one sheet of puff pastry and cut an oval shape the same size as the pastry (essentially rounding off the corners) and place on a lined baking tray. Score a 1½cm border inside the circle and then evenly spread out the kimchi inside the border. Stir the cheddar and chopped stilton into the cauliflower mixture, and spoon this into a mound on top of the kimchi. Brush the pastry border with the beaten egg. Roll the second sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface, so it is 2cm larger and cut the same oval shape. Drape it over the cauliflower filling and press down on the edge to seal the sheets together. Then, using a small sharp knife, neaten the border, and score lines in the pastry, starting at the top, all the way to the edge. Brush with beaten egg, and sprinkle the edge with the sesame seeds. Pop the tray in the oven for about 40-45 minutes, until golden all over.When it’s done, leave to cool for at least 5 minutes (or longer) before cutting and serving.Lamb shoulder with charred salsa rossaView image in fullscreenLamb shoulder with charred salsa rossa.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverLamb shoulder needs very little intervention to create a showstopping centrepiece, just a few aromatics – but this charred salsa rossa is absolutely worth the extra effort. Charring the peppers first adds a subtle smokiness and sweetness. And, despite their overexposure in the 1990s, sundried tomatoes do have a time and place, and it is in this recipe.Serves 6bone-in shoulder of lamb2kgtomatoes4, ripered onions2, peeledolive oilsea salt and freshly ground black pepperred peppers2sundried tomatoes75ggarlic1 bulbred wine vinegar2 tbspfennel seeds1 tsp, lightly crushedfresh oregano½ a bunchwatercressto servePreheat the oven to 220C fan/gas mark 9. Take the lamb out of the fridge to come up to room temperature while you get on with the base. Cut the tomatoes into quarters and red onions into eighths and place in a roasting tray that is big enough to hold all the ingredients. Drizzle with olive oil, season well and place in the hot oven to char for about 20 minutes.Meanwhile, char the red peppers over an open gas hob (or under a grill) until blackened all over, then place in a bowl and cover with clingfilm to soften the skin. After a minute, flake away the blackened skin, then halve them, remove the seeds and chop them up (they can have a bit of texture, you don’t want them too fine). Chop the sundried tomatoes. Halve the garlic bulb horizontally.When the tomatoes and onions are ready, add the chopped peppers, sundried tomatoes and garlic to the tray and pour in 200ml of hot water and the red wine vinegar. Make little incisions into the lamb and rub over the crushed fennel seeds. Season well. Place on top of the veg and scatter over half the fresh oregano. Drizzle everything with olive oil and tightly cover the tray with tin foil. Place in the oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 150C fan/gas mark 3. Cook for 4-4½ hours, checking occasionally to make sure there is enough liquid in the tray.When the lamb is tender and easily comes away from the bone, remove the foil and turn the oven back up to 220C fan/gas mark 9 for a final 20 minutes, so that the meat becomes browned and crisp on top, and any liquid in the tray evaporates. Leave the lamb to rest for 10 minutes, then pull the meat off the bone with two forks into the salsa rossa and serve. Serve with dressed watercress and the browned new potatoes (see below).White wine and lemon browned new potatoesView image in fullscreenWhite wine and lemon browned new potatoes.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverThis French-inspired way of cooking new potatoes is a slight elevation from simply tossing them in salty butter and herbs (also tremendous, obviously). You don’t have to dot with spoons of creme fraiche at the end but I really enjoy the way it melts into the nutty brown butter.Serves 6unsalted butter150gsmall new potatoes750g, washedsea salt and freshly ground black peppergarlic4 cloves, crushedwhite wine200mllemon1soft herbs1 x bunch, such as chives, chervil, tarragon, parsley – a mixture might be nicecreme fraiche200g, to serve (optional)Place a wide saute pan or large saucepan over a medium heat. Melt the butter and cook until it starts to smell nutty, then add the potatoes to the pan, ideally in a single layer. Season generously, add the crushed garlic and toss well.Pour in the white wine and bring to the boil. Cover the pan, reduce to a medium heat and cook for 15 minutes. Turn the potatoes over – they should have browned on the undersides. Add 100ml water and cover again, and cook for a further 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes have browned on the other side and are tender (check occasionally that the potatoes aren’t burning, and add a splash of water if necessary). Remove the lid, and fry uncovered for the last 8-10 minutes to glaze all over.Meanwhile, finely chop the soft herbs. Adjust the seasoning, squeeze over the lemon, stir in the soft herbs and serve dotted with creme fraiche.Passion fruit and saffron creme caramelView image in fullscreenPassion fruit and saffron creme caramel.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverWhen I have people round, I ensure that at least one (if not more) of the courses can be entirely made in advance, to reduce stress. I love the cooking part of hosting but I want to be sociable, too. This passion fruit creme caramel is not too heavy, so a perfect after-dinner sweet hit, and it can all be done the day before bar the turning out. Elegant and fancy enough to wow your friends, stress-free on the day for you.Serves 6passion fruit6 large, ripe onescaster sugar275gsingle cream300mlwhole milk300mlsaffrona pincheggs 3 large, plus 2 yolksfine sea salta pinchPreheat your oven to 140C fan/gas mark 2½. Have a 1kg loaf tin ready.Scoop out the flesh of 5 of the passion fruit into a blender with 1 tablespoon of water. Blitz for a couple of seconds, then pass through a fine-mesh sieve into a jug. You need about 100ml of passion fruit juice (if it is not enough, just add a splash of water). Pour into a small frying pan with 200g of the caster sugar. Bring to the boil over a medium-high heat, swirling the pan. Do not stir or it will crystallise. The sugar will melt, and after about 3-5 minutes you will get a deep golden passion fruit caramel. Remove the pan from the heat, then quickly and evenly pour the caramel into the base of the loaf tin. Place the loaf tin into a larger roasting tin that is higher sided.Warm the cream, milk and saffron in a saucepan over a medium heat. It should be warm, but not boiling at any point. Meanwhile, vigorously whisk the whole eggs, yolks, salt and remaining 75g of caster sugar until pale and thickened. When the milk mixture is warm, slowly whisk it into the eggs until smooth. You don’t want too many air bubbles, so leave it for a few minutes for them to subside if needed. Boil a kettle of water.Strain the custard mixture into a large jug through a fine-mesh sieve, then carefully pour into the prepared loaf tin, over the caramel. Place the tins in the oven, then carefully pour enough just boiled water into the larger tin so that it comes two-thirds of the way up the outside of the loaf tin. Bake for around 1 hour, or until the creme caramel is just set in the middle.Remove the creme caramel tin from the water bath and leave to cool completely. Then loosely cover and pop in the fridge for at least 4 hours before serving. Remove the loaf tin from the fridge 30 minutes before you want to serve it, then gently run a knife around the inside of the tin. Place a serving platter (preferably one that has a lip) on top and turn it over. Serve with the pulp of the extra passion fruit scooped over the top, if you like the crunch from the seeds.Georgina Hayden is a cook, food writer and broadcaster.

Yet in recent months, the 25-year-old finance analyst from northern Tehran says that she never knows who could be watching her every move.She says she has received messages from the police before warning her of suspected violations of the country’s strict hijab laws, but last November she was sent an SMS message containing her car registration plate that stated the exact time and place that she had been recorded driving without her head properly covered. Next time it happened, the SMS warned, her car would be impounded.“It was really unsettling,” she says.“When you receive these messages you don’t know who has reported you – and the police never seem to have proof of the violation.”After widespread outcry last year, the Iranian authorities said they would suspend enforcement of the new, strict, hijab laws, which impose draconian penalties – including fines and prison sentences – on women found in breach of the mandatory dress code.Many of us have stopped wearing the hijab, despite these intimidation tacticsDaryaYet women in Iran are reporting that state surveillance has been steadily increasing.Last week, the UN’s fact-finding missionreportedonIran’s increasing reliance on digital surveillancesuch as its Nazer mobile application, a state-backed reporting platform that allows citizens and police to report women for alleged violations.The app is accessible only via Iran’s state-controlledNational Information Network. Members of the public can apply to become “hijab monitors” to get the app and begin filing reports, which are then passed to the police.According to the UN mission, the app has recently been expanded to allow users to upload the time, location and licence plate of a car in which a woman has been seen without a hijab.It can also now be used to report women for hijab violations on public transport, in taxis and even in ambulances.According to the UN report, aerial surveillance using drones has also been used at events such as the Tehran international book fair and on the island of Kish, a tourist destination, to identify women not complying with the hijab law.The government has also increased online monitoring, blocking women’s Instagram accounts for non-compliance of hijab laws, and issuing warnings via text message. CCTV surveillance and facial-recognition technology has also been installed at universities. “This ‘digital repression’ is not only stifling academic freedom but also causing increased psychological stress among students,” says a spokesperson for the Amirkabir Newsletter, an Iranian student media group.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the ranch where they were found is an alleged training camp and killing site forMexico’sJalisco cartel.The discovery by activists ofunderground ovens and 200 pairs of shoes in what they call an “extermination camp”has horrified Mexico, sparking protests across the country.It is the highest-profile such case in years – and has forced the spotlight back on to Mexico’s crisis of forced disappearances related to organised crime. Across the country, more than 120,000 people are registered as missing.Mexico: 200 pairs of shoes found at clandestine crematoriumRead more“These places exist all over the country,” said María Guadalupe Aguilar, founder of Familias Unidas por Nuestros Desaparecidos, who has been searching for her son José Luis Arana since 17 January 2011. “Mexico is full of mass graves.”Authorities have offered few answers about the camp, which was found near the town of Teuchitlán, 60km (37 miles) from Guadalajara, Mexico’s second largest city.They say it may have been operated by the Jalisco cartel,one of Mexico’s most powerful organised crime groups, but have yet to say how many people died there, and none of the remains have been identified.On Wednesday, federal attorney general Alejandro Gertz said the initial investigation had been riddled with omissions, pointing the blame at local authorities.Although the ranch was secured by state authorities in September last year, the ovens and more than 1,000 items of clothing were only reported earlier this month when Warrior Searchers of Jalisco, a collective of relatives of missing people, went there after receiving an anonymous tip. Within a few hours, they found human remains.View image in fullscreenShoes found at the ranch in Teuchitlán, Jalisco state, Mexico, on March 11.Photograph: APGertz said his office is exploring whether failures in the initial investigation were due to incompetence or collusion with organised crime.As shock waves from the case passed through Mexico, several people claiming to be survivorscame forward with testimonies, describing how they were lured to the ranch with fake offers of work.Their accounts coincide with previous reports of forced recruitment in Jalisco, in which young people responded to job adverts online before being kidnapped and held in dire conditions as they were both victimised and forced to victimise others to survive.“The training, the abuse, it’s designed to dehumanise them, to strip them of themselves,” said Alejandra Guillén, a journalist and academic at Iteso, a university in Guadalajara, who investigates forced disappearances.“They promised them work and a salary and none of it was true: they began to train them to besicarios[killers],” said Aguilar, who went to the ranch last week to help classify the clothes.Photos of every item of clothing have since been put online. Relatives of the disappeared across Mexico have poredover the images. Some have travelled to Jalisco.“Your skin crawls seeing everything thrown on the ground, seeing the suitcases, the dreams of these young people,” Indira Navarro, one of the activists who discovered the site, told Radio Fórmula. “To see how they ended up there because they thought they could have a better life.”Training camps and clandestine ovens, often found by search collectives, have been documented across Jalisco for years – including several just a short distance from the ranch.“Just this year they even found one in the same municipality where they freed 36 people,” said Anna Karolina Chimiak, from the Centre of Justice for Peace and Development, a civil society group in Jalisco.But it was the image of the shoes, with its echoes of the 20th century’s darkest chapters, that meant this discovery broke through.View image in fullscreenA protester during a national day of mourning outside the national palace in Mexico City, Mexico, on 15 March.Photograph: Sáshenka Gutiérrez/EPAIt remains unclear what became of their owners. But incinerating bodies is a “known practice” in Jalisco, said Chimiak.It is the latest, cruellest evolution of forced disappearances, said Aguilar: “With ashes, the hope of identifying them is lost.”In response to the scandal, Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, announced measures to strengthen laws around missing people. She promised the discovery would be investigated fully, unlike high-profile cases under previous governments, such as the 43 student teachers from Ayotzinapa who were disappeared in 2014.“There will not be impunity,” said Sheinbaum. “We will never hide anything.”However, Sheinbaum has alsoclaimedthat certain media and opposition figures were weaponising the case to attack her government, and pointed to an alleged bot campaign on social media.Meanwhile authorities havecast doubton the idea that there were clandestine ovens on the ranch, despite acknowledging the presence ofburnt remains.“It is not a setup, it is not an invention,”respondedWarrior Searchers of Jalisco, the collective that found the underground ovens. “It is the harsh reality that we have found in Teuchitlán.”“It feels more and more like there is a deliberate intent to generate a narrative that nothing happened there,” said Chimiak.The crisis of forced disappearances in Mexico casts an enduring shadow on Sheinbaum’s pledge to reduce violence in Mexico, which wasone of the failings of her predecessor and ally, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.Although official data shows a reduction in the number of homicides in recent years, the number of disappearances has risen inexorably.Jalisco alone has almost 15,000 missing people. It is also the stronghold of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which was recently declared a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration.The great number of disappearances in Jalisco might reflect a mix of powerful economic interests, proximity to drug trafficking infrastructure like the port of Manzanillo, and a history of such violence dating back to the Guadalajara cartel and beyond, said Guillén.Aguilar offered a more straightforward explanation: “Maybe it’s because we are in the hands ofthe most powerful cartel in the world.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Guardian US readers told us of their struggles, and how life could be different if there was a better system in place.Kath, 42: ‘Childcare is almost as much as our mortgage’Social scientistWashington DCWe have no family near us, so we rely heavily on our daycare for support. For our youngest, we spend $2,580 a month. We also pay about $500 more a month in after-school care for our seven-year-old.I am in the process of losing my federal job due to the new administration, and childcare is almost as much as our mortgage. It will be hard to manage both expenses. Our house is very old, and it’s already very hard to keep up with the costs of repair because all of our spare change goes to childcare.Anne Wang-Annanie, 34: ‘Every month we are in the negative’Elementary school teacherTacoma, WashingtonView image in fullscreenWe don’t have any family who can watch the kids. I know some people who have their in-laws or parents watch the kids so they don’t have to go to daycare, but we don’t have that, so the kids have to go to daycare.In February, our household income was $8,480, and our bills totaled $11,900. That’s pretty typical. Every month we are negative, and the extra money comes from my savings. Daycare alone is currently $3,472 per month for two children, and we have a third child on the way. My thought is, I just have to make it through the daycare years.I cry all the time. It’s so stressful. I don’t know too much about personal loans or home equity lines of credit, but when the savings runs out, I’m gonna have to figure out something else, because it’s not like I’m magically going to make more money.With free childcare, I would spend that extra money on things for the kids. I would love for them to take different lessons, like taekwondo or swimming. I would pay a babysitter to watch the baby so I could take the older one to a class. My kids have never been able to visit my family in Korea. And, if I had the money, I would get a divorce. The biggest reason we haven’t done that is because we don’t have enough money for us to live separately. I don’t want to be in a marriage I don’t want to be in, but financially, it makes more sense to stay married.Glen Durrant, 54: ‘I’d be putting that money into shoring up his future’Software salesSan Jose, CaliforniaAs an immigrant, you give up your past for your future. It’s a devil’s bargain. You come here and you get a job, get a career, you get settled, you have children, and then you’re hit with these unforeseen costs. In our case, it’s $3,250 for daycare a month. That’s about one-and-a-half times our mortgage.We don’t have provisions set aside. I set up a 529 account for my son, and I hope there will be enough money there for him to go to university. But it’s cheaper to hire a lawyer to get my son’s UK citizenship so he can take advantage of a British education than it is to send him to a good college here. If we didn’t have to pay for daycare, I’d be putting that money into shoring up his future.It’s daunting. My wife and I have both built successful careers in Silicon Valley, but having one child was the only option we couldn’t afford.Keri Hetherman, 37: ‘We would pay off our student loans’Self-employedBangor, MaineOur kids are two and almost four. We pay roughly $3,000 a month for childcare. We love our daycare, but that’s a lot of money. The alternative is that one of us would have to stay home. Either childcare is one of us, or it’s something that we pay for.If we didn’t have to pay for childcare, we would pay off our student loans. To become a physician, my husband accrued over $500,000 in debt from undergrad and medical school. By all measures, we’re doing just fine, but we are not living the big life because we essentially have three mortgage payments: a house, student debt and childcare. Those are fixed costs, and they’re important, but they’re not fun.Marcos Maldonado, 40: ‘$3,000 a month, just so that I can work’CarpenterBrooklyn, New YorkView image in fullscreenWe spend $2,400 a month on a nanny for our 15-month-old daughter, and $500 on after-school care for our son. That’s almost $3,000 a month, just so that I can work.So that we can have a little extra, I pick up extra work on the weekends while my wife is home with the kids. She’s a teacher. But if we want to buy anything, we really have to think about it. I have to plan. I have to budget.My car is breaking down all the time. It needs new tires. But I don’t have the money, and can’t take the time off work to go and get it fixed. I got behind on my electric bill, so now I’m on a payment plan to cover that. I also need shoes for work, but I think a lot before I spend any money on myself.MS, 42: ‘What are we paying all these taxes for?’Data researcherDenver, ColoradoThere are no childcare options in our town for children under preschool age, and there are only preschool spots for 40% of applicants. So, we pay $1,000 a week for a full-time nanny, which constitutes 20% of our household income after taxes. We are extremely unsatisfied with our options. What are we paying all these taxes for? It feels personal. We will likely try to move out of the US and give up citizenship. We can’t spend all our free time coordinating basic services. We want quality of life for ourselves, but most of all for our daughter.Because we worked as academics for so many years, our retirement accounts are only 30% of where they “should” be at this age, so there’s ground to make up. We feel pressure to put away large sums in case of health issues, parents’ healthcare and maintenance, higher education for our daughter, and to make up for the retirement savings we never made while working in research.Explore more on these topicsChildcareUnequal beginningsChildrenFamilyUS personal financeUS work & careersParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The history-loving 23-year-old had returned home from Islamabad, where he worked as a chartered accountant, and had his hopes set on a degree in education. But then in June, he disappeared. A brief phone call to his father came days later.“He told me, ‘I am going to the mountains,’” says his father, Mohammad Akram, who knew that meant only one thing: his son was joining the militant insurgency that had rocked their home region of Balochistan for decades. “I begged him no, asked if it was reasons of money or family that led him to take this step. But he did not give any more details and disconnected the call.” Hasan’s friends also had no answers.Hasan’s story has become an increasingly familiar one in homes across Pakistan’s troubled south-western region of Balochistan, the country’s largest and poorest province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.The insurgency in Balochistan is almost as old as the country itself. It began in 1948 when the region was controversially – some say forcefully – annexed to become part of the newly formed Pakistan. Violent separatist uprisings, which were largely tribal-led, took place again in 1958, 1962 and 1973.View image in fullscreenThe remains of a burnt-out vehicle on a roadside near a key rail bridge that was destroyed by suspected militants in Koolpur, Balochistan, last August. The insurgency in the province has gained new momentum in recent years.Photograph: Fayyaz Ahmed/EPAIn the early 2000s the violence took a turn. Baloch nationalists, who had long accused the Pakistani state and military of exploiting Balochistan’s valuable mineral resources, oppressing its people and rigging its elections, began to mobilise into organised insurgent armies that called for an independent Baloch state.Kidnap, torture, murder: the plight of Pakistan’s thousands of disappearedRead moreFor years it remained a low-intensity operation, marked by sporadic attacks and ambushes. Yet in recent years, the long-festering insurgency has gathered a lethal new momentum. Baloch militants – often in vast numbers – began to carry out sophisticated attacks on high-profile Pakistan military targets and multimillion-dollar Chinese projects . They also started using suicide bombers.Young men and women in their hundreds – some estimate thousands – began to bolster the ranks of militant groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). Increasingly, those radicalised were educated graduates from middle class families with no militant connections. The BLA has also become highly media savvy, sending out coordinated press releases about their attacks and posting videos across X, TikTok, Telegram and Instagram glorifying their violence.Insurgents show a ‘massive escalation’ in military skillThe newfound scale and ambition of the Baloch insurgency became starkly apparent this month, as the BLA carried out one of its most high-profile attacks yet. Hundreds of Baloch militants blew up railway tracks andhijacked a passenger traincarrying almost 500 passengers as it travelled through the remote mountains of Balochistan, taking hundreds hostage.I am haunted by the fear [my son] is among those killedMohammad AkramThe Pakistani government claimed that 31 people were killed overall, and that the military operation took out 33 Baloch insurgents. But the BLA called the claims “a lie” and said they had executed 214 hostages who were mostly military and police personnel onboard the train. With secrecy surrounding the Pakistan military’s operation and very few of the rescued hostages seen in the aftermath, both accounts were impossible to independently verify, leading to questions about the true scale of the death toll on either side.2:12Safe hostages recount horror of Pakistan train attack – videoWatching the news of the train hijacking unfolding, Hasan’s father was unable to sleep for days, fearful that his son was among the militants responsible. “We keep switching on TV and scrolling social media to know about the attackers,” he says. “I am haunted by the fear he is among those killed.”It was followed days later by another deadly BLA attack, as suicide bombers attacked a convoy of paramilitary forces in the city of Noshki. In 2024 alone, the BLA claimed responsibility for 302 attacks, including abombing at Quetta’s main railway stationthat killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.“Since around 2017 we have seen a massive escalation, not just in the levels of violence but the lethality, the complexity, the military skill and the geographical scope of the Baloch insurgency,” says Asfandyar Mir, an expert in South Asia counter-terrorism at the United States Institute of Peace. “It’s clear there is a high level of resolve to sustain the fight.”The surge of violence has helped push Pakistan’s security situation to its most precarious in more than a decade. Baloch militants have become highly visible across the province, frequently blocking roads, setting up checkpoints and attacking police and military posts, forcing the army and paramilitary to stay confined in their camps.A loss of faith in political solutionsThis month, senior government ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to discuss the country’s deteriorating security crisis.View image in fullscreenBaloch supporters in Islamabad protest against the arrest of their leader, Mahrang Baloch, on 22 March. Many have been radicalised by the army’s brutal crackdown on the Baloch people.Photograph: Sohail Shahzad/EPAPublic supportfor the Baloch resistance – both violent and non-violent – has been growing, particularly among the younger generation, with vast numbers turning out to recent protests. Many continue to be radicalised in response to theongoing human rights horrorsinflicted in Balochistan by the army and paramilitary for about two decades – an anti-insurgency crackdown and the crushing of dissent, known as Pakistan’ssecret dirty war, that has led to thousands of activists, journalists, students and civilians in the region being abducted, tortured and then killed or rarely seen again.According to Voice for Baloch Missing Persons, since 2009 almost 1,500 of the “disappeared” have turned up dead, often in a beaten state, and another 6,000 remain missing. Since the insurgency was revitalised, human rights groups have reported an increase in extrajudicial killings and disappearances once again. The military denies any involvement.There has also been a widespread loss of faith in finding political solutions to Balochistan’s problems, after credible allegations of military interference in the last two elections in 2018 and 2024 which brought down popular Baloch nationalist politicians.‘I only protest. I want to go to school’: the childhoods lost in Pakistan when loved ones are ‘disappeared’Read more“Violence has become the dominant form of interaction between the state and the Baloch, sidelining and undermining political avenues for addressing the issues,” says Sajid Aziz, a researcher into the Baloch insurgency.Ayoub Azim was 21 when he was abducted, along with his best friend, by the security forces along in 2017. He was kept in a dark cell and tortured, despite having no links to militant groups. When he was eventually released two years later, Azim tried to get over the trauma and got married, with his wife quickly falling pregnant. But months later, he disappeared to join the ranks of the BLA.“As a family, we tried to stop him but he refused and said he only wanted to take revenge,” says his father-in-law, Uzair. Azim returned briefly to see his daughter two years ago. The next the family heard of him was that he had been killed last March carrying out a suicide attack on a naval base.Benefiting from the return of the TalibanIn 2017, the BLA – now the most prominent Baloch separatist group – also began to undergo a transformation. In the decade previous, the brutality of the military’s crackdown was deemed largely successful in bringing the Baloch insurgency under control. However, this began to shift when the BLA began to reorganise and brought in founder Aslam Achu Baloch as their commander-in-chief.View image in fullscreenA Pakistani security official frisks a man at a checkpoint in Peshawar, capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The province, which borders Afghanistan, has also witnessed an uptick in militant activity.Photograph: Bilawal Arbab/EPAUnder Aslam Baloch’s leadership, the BLA moved away from its powerful tribal leaders to become a more educated middle class movement. He revitalised the Majeed brigade – the elite squad of suicide bombers – and established intelligence and operative wings within the BLA. The infighting and division between the BLA and other insurgent groups was also largely brought to an end after a coalition of separatist groups was formed in 2018.Afghanistan is also seen to have played a critical role in fuelling Baloch militancy. Mir says it had gone “under-appreciated how much the Baloch outfits have benefited from the return of the Taliban”, who came back to power in Afghanistan in 2021 and have an increasingly hostile relationship with Pakistan.It is widely acknowledged that the current BLA commander-in-chief, Bashir Zaib, has been freely living in Afghanistan, just as his predecessor Aslam Baloch did. Afghanistan is also believed to have provided a crucial training ground for BLA militants, with evidence suggesting BLA fighters have trained in camps alongside the Pakistani Taliban.This was reiterated by a senior security source in Pakistan who say they have traced direct coordination and logistic support between the BLA and Pakistani Taliban, particularly in training for suicide bombers. They also allege the BLA militants were using American weapons left behind in Afghanistan. In a press conference last week, the military alleged the train hijacking was coordinated from Afghanistan.Pervez Saleem, the former chief secretary of Balochistan, says the renewed insurgency and its widespread support should serve as a wake-up call for Pakistan’s military.“They think they can keep Balochistan by force but it can’t happen any more. The geopolitical situation has changed and the army needs to change its policies. There’s a new great game at play.”Explore more on these topicsPakistanSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The guns went in the river.Disarming the police officers was a risky move, but the members of the Charip, as the Indigenous guards of the Wampis Nation people are known, were confident that something was amiss.Charip means lightning, and for the territorial defenders it symbolises the way they strike against invaders of their land along the Santiago River, in the far north ofPeruon its Amazonian frontier with Ecuador.View image in fullscreenEdgar Tí looks out over the river from the checkpoint.Photograph: Dan Collyns/GuardianThe three police officers, who weredetainedalongside Ecuadorian and Peruvian nationals in the incident in April 2024, were moonlighting as hired guns for illegal goldminers and were hundreds of miles from where they were based in Piura, a coastal region of Peru.The Wampis refused to release them until the government sent a high-level commission to address the problem of wildcat goldminers plundering and polluting their land.We welcome visitors but will not allow people who come to do us harm. We are very protective of our forestRené Amuan Santiago TíA few days later, a military helicopter carrying the deputy interior minister and the high commissioner against illegal mining touched down in Villa Gonzalo. Thousands of Wampis people had assembled in the village, its Charip warriors adorned in war paint. They demanded respect for their territory and action to expel the invaders.Nearly a year later, the Charip guardians – rather than the state – have exerted control. They use stop-and-search at a checkpoint to thin out the number of mining dredgers upriver, says Santiago Tí, leader of the band of less than a dozen men who work day and night.“We welcome visitors but will not allow people who come to do us harm,” he says. “If they come to extract gold or destroy our forest, then we are fierce. We are very protective of our forest.”View image in fullscreenRené Amuan Santiago Tí was one of the Indigenous guards who detained three police officers caught working for illegal miners.Photograph: Dan Collyns/GuardianThe Wampis people face a conundrum. Theyare the only Indigenous people inPeruto have created their own territorial government – an act of self-determination and a response to the state’s absence in the northern reaches of Condorcanqui province in the Amazonas region.But while they have shown resilience and organisation in confronting illegal miners, they do not have the firepower to take on the criminal gangs behind the gold rush that is reaching ever deeper into Amazon border regions, as the international gold price surpasses$3,000 (£2,300) an ounce this month, a record high.“We are seeing how different criminal economies are expanding their presence, territorial control and political influence in the Amazon,” says Raphael Hoetmer, western Amazon programme director at the environmental groupAmazon Watch. “Organised crime is becoming a major threat to the global climate.”Theautonomous territorial government of the Wampis Nationwas formed in 2017, a 13,000 sq km (5,000 sq mile) stretch of mountain and lowland rainforest across the Santiago and Morona river basins, with a population of about 15,000 people in 22 titled communities.The nation was created under international laws that recognise the self-determination of Indigenous people, such as the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, which was enshrined in thePeruvian constitution.View image in fullscreenMembers of different Wampis Nation communities map the traditional use of territory along the meandering Morona River.Photograph: Jacob Balzani LöövRiver dredging for gold is prohibited in the territory, and the autonomous government has made clear its intention to seize and destroy any equipment found.What the Charip members lack in resources, they make up for in spirit. From a wooden shed that resembles a birdwatching hide perched on the brow of a riverbank, they look out across the river.

One of them, Edgar Tí, is cordial as he inspects a boat that pulls up on the riverbank, registers the details on a clipboard, questions the driver and passengers, and checks for mining supplies such as plastic tubing, motor pumps or jerrycans of diesel.Miners caught for the first time get off with a warning, but the Charip mete out Indigenous justice to reoffenders. They lash them with anishanga,a type of Amazon nettle, or tie them for five minutes to a tangarana tree. This tree has a symbiotic relationship with aggressive fire ants, which attack any perceived threat to their home.View image in fullscreenPrimary schoolchildren are taught about traditional fishing practices.Photograph: Jacob Balzani LöövSantiago Tí says the nettles and ant bites, despite being painful, are used in traditional medicine to treat aches and pains, including arthritis. But chastised miners do not appreciate the punishment and several of the young men say they have received threats on instant messaging apps.Older leaders, such as Alfonso AwananchFlores,the nation’s director of environment and territorial control, have been threatened, too. He says he avoids travelling to the larger towns since he was briefly abducted and interrogated.We don’t need the state’s permission to declare our self-autonomy – we have been here 7,000 yearsAlfonso Awananch Flores“Without territory, we are not Wampis people,” says Flores, 45. That is why, he argues, they have strict management of their territorial autonomy and “cannot allow an activity that destroys our land, pollutes our river and poisons our fish”.“We don’t need the state’s permission to declare our self-autonomy; we have been here for 7,000 years,” he says.“We don’t need their recognition either. We have the right to become a territorial government.”But they do need the armed forces to crack down on the dredgers, Flores admits, as the division between those opposed to mining and those who favour the illegal activity has split communities.“We don’t want to create conflicts between families. That’s why we want the state to enforce the law,” he says.Teófilo Kukush, thepamuk, or leader of the Wampis Nation, says miners are using children as “human shields” on dredgers to prevent the police and navy destroying the craft. “They pay the parents in communities to use their children,” says Kukush, who wears a red and yellow macaw feather crown signalling his status.He is calling on the government to declare a state of emergency in the Santiago River and expel the miners.View image in fullscreenTeófilo Kukush, leader of the Wampis Nation, is calling on the government to declare a state of emergency in the Santiago River.Photograph: Fotoholica Press/LightRocket/Getty Images“They make us fight among ourselves, and the mining groups have hired assassins who threaten us,” he says.Downriver from the Charip checkpoint, some Wampis communities allow miners to work their riverbanks or creeks.

An initial meeting with the village’s deputy leader, Joel Antich, is invaded by several drunk men. As an alarm sounds and the rest of the village gathers, the Guardian is accused of spying and asked to explain the motive of the visit. After an initially stormy reception, calm prevails.The villagers claim the lack of state assistance leaves them with no option but to depend on dividends from miners. Some earn a day rate of 100 soles (£21) working on the barges.“We know it’s illegal,” says Antich.“But we do it out of necessity.”View image in fullscreenA mining pump on the Marañon River.Photograph: J Balzani LöövJuan Carlos Tuchia, a vocal advocate for miners, says the community has a fund that splits gold profits 50/50 with the miners. The income is being used to build a health clinic, build water-filtration plants and support needy families.“We are not exploited by the miners,” he says. “We have no choice but to work with them because the state has abandoned us.”He angrily accuses the Wampis Nation, without providing evidence, of filling its pockets with funds from the international community.View image in fullscreenEdgar Tí inspects a boat and records its details.

Many villages lack electricity and clean drinking water, and crops such as cacao, peanut and cassava cannot compete with the income from a dredger that, they say, can process 100g a day, worth about $8,000.“Indigenous organisations are fundamental in containing the expansion of illegal mining. But at the same time, this work is increasingly dangerous, as seen in the rise ofassassinations of Amazonian Indigenous leaders,” says Hoetmer, calling for more support from the state and the international community.“We want to live harmoniously within our territory without the greed of outsiders,” says Flores. “We are rich in nature.

She traces her ambition to the story of her mother, one of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by Israel to Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and who contracted polio as a toddler. Despite living with the debilitating disease, Mohammad’s mother went on to raise five children and obtain a graduate degree in the US.It’s the story of a woman who “overcame unbearable medical circumstances”, Mohammad said. It also taught the Palestinian American about “the sociological determinants of health”, she said, as Mohammad believes displacement contributed to her mother catching the disease, due to thepoor sanitary conditionsentire communities of Palestinian refugees faced at the time.Mohammad, now 28, was up front in her applications to medical school about her goal of becoming a “physician who speaks up about the social structures of violence that affect health” – and received rejections from most. Emory University, inAtlanta, was an exception. She began a dual program there in 2019 to get both her medical degree and a sociology PhD.The US is poised to use terror laws against students. This could be worse than McCarthyism | Thomas Anthony Durkin and Bernard HarcourtRead moreFour years into her studies, 7 October happened. After watching Israel’s deadly retaliation onGazain horror from afar, in January 2024, Mohammad sent an email to the entire medical school with the subject: “Palestinian blood stains your hands, Emory University and School of Medicine.” She railed against her fellow students and the school’s faculty for being “silent about the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians”.View image in fullscreenA pro-Palestinian protest against the war in Gaza at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, in April 2024.Photograph: Elijah Nouvelage/AFP/Getty ImagesThat spring, Emory’s campus erupted in protests seeking divestment from Israel, prompting Emory’s president tocall in the Atlanta policeon 25 April. It was the fastest show of police force on a US campus at the time. Police used tasers on the students, also a first. As an organizer, Mohammad was in the thick of it.The next day, she gave aninterviewon the Democracy Now! news program in which she spoke of the climate on campus for protesters. She also talked about an Emory medical school professor who had recently returned from volunteering as a medic in the Israeli military. This would lead, seven months later, to her suspension from medical school for a year, after she was found to have violated the medical school’s standard of “professional conduct”.Mohammad’s case has become a tense showdown over expression, mirroringthe conflictplaying outin institutionsacross the US over Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza. It is also emblematic of a specific concern: professors and students beginning to object to the presence of Israelis on campus who are fresh off military service.When Mohammad went into the Democracy Now! interview in April, she was already upset about what she saw as an immoral double standard. Months earlier, an Emory medical school professor, Abeer N AbouYabis, had been fired after posting on Facebook in support of Palestinians after the events of 7 October. Her post included the phrase: “They got walls, we got gliders / Glory to all resistance fighters,” a reference to the way members of Hamas glided over walls in Gaza to enter Israel and stage their attack. According to areporton AbouYabis’s firing by Emory’s committee for open expression, her post was seen as “glorifying” the group.At the same time, Mohammad told her Democracy Now! interviewer: “One of the professors of medicine we have at Emory recently went to serve as a volunteer medic” in the IDF. That professor, she continued, “participated in aiding and abetting a genocide, in aiding and abetting the destruction of the healthcare system in Gaza and the murder of over 400 healthcare workers, and is now back at Emory so-called ‘teaching’ medical students and residents how to take care of patients”.Umaymah Mohamamad’s interview with Democracy Now!Mohammad’s remarks on the program drew complaints from the professor – who she did not name – and a dean, who has since left Emory. The professor told the medical school he didn’t feel safe, as Mohammad’s interview could expose him and his family to harassment. He asked medical school administrators to investigate her for violating the school’s code of conduct.In July, an investigator released their initial findings: Mohammad had violated the medical school’s code of conduct with regards to “professionalism” and “mutual respect” by singling out and disparaging an individual during her Democracy Now! interview.This caught the attention of Emory’s committee for open expression, and that month, its chair, the physics professor Ilya Nemenman, asked the school of medicine to allow the committee to weigh in. But Nemenman was rebuffed: “The School of Medicine Conduct Code does not include a role for the [committee] in a student disciplinary matter,” said the executive associate dean John William Eley in his reply.Nemenman wrote back almost immediately, reiterating his request and insisting that this interpretation broke with at least a decade’s worth of precedent. His reaction was echoed by George Shepherd, a law professor and Emory’s faculty senate president, who also wrote to Eley expressing he was “surprised” at the “terse rejection”. (The faculty senate oversees the committee.)“A student’s right to free expression is implicated most dramatically when Emory disciplines the student for what they have expressed,” Shepherd added.Neither Shepherd nor Nemenman received a reply, and in September, Eley asked Mohammad in a letter which of two routes she wanted to follow: accept the finding and allow a dean to decide on appropriate sanctions, or proceed with a hearing. She chose the latter.“Accepting guilt would mean accepting not talking about Palestine and accepting not talking about genocide, and no career is worth that,” she told the Guardian.View image in fullscreenA view of damage after Israeli army hit the pediatric department of Nasser hospital in Gaza’s Khan Younis on 17 December 2023.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesLater that month, the open expression committee released areportof its own: according to its independent investigation, the content of Mohammad’s interview was protected by Emory’s policy on free expression. In fact, the committee said, the school of medicine had violated Emory’s policy on open expression by conducting the investigation in the way it did.Nemenman wrote in the report that, by ignoring the committee, the school of medicine “violated not just the Policy, but, ironically, also the ‘principles of professionalism and mutual respect’, which they had aimed to enforce with this Conduct Code investigation”.Caught between these two conflicting interpretations, Mohammad faced her hearing on 12 November. The professor and the dean who had accused her, together with a faculty adviser of the professor, “testified for my expulsion”, she said. “They wanted me to never be able to practice medicine … [and] one was spitting across the table, his face red, yelling a lot,” she recalled. They demanded she provide evidence to support her claims about the professor. At one point, the adviser screamed: “Who are you to decide what’s a genocide?”Mohammad said she felt outmatched and that attempts to argue her case fell on deaf ears. She described the hearing as “one of the most dehumanizing two hours of my life”.As Mohammad’s PhD adviser, the sociology professorKarida L Brown, was allowed to accompany her in the hearing. Brown, whose research centers on race and racism, echoed Mohammad’s description. It was “like a Jim Crow court”, she said. “It never felt fair, from the beginning,” she said, citing the school of medicine’s refusal to engage the open expression committee or consider its report.Seven days after the hearing, Mohammad was informed that she had been suspended from the medical school for one academic year, and would be on probation from the time she returned until she graduated. Her appeal of the suspension was denied.Mohammad decided to go public: in the new year she wrote about her case forMondoweissand held a press conference, in the hopes the school of medicine would reverse its decision and change its code of conduct to better align with Emory’s policies on open expression. Her name and photo had already been posted online after her January 2024 email bypro-Israel groupssuch as Canary Mission, and fellow medical school students had also called her a “terrorist” online. In this atmosphere, she decided at one point to leave her Atlanta house for a week – “for safety”, she said.A request for comment to Eley was forwarded to an Emory spokesperson, Laura Diamond, who said: “Emory is unable to discuss student conduct cases.” Diamond also pointed out that Emory released an updatedopen expression policyon 20 March. The new policy states that while a representative from the free expression committee may play an advisory role in disciplinary hearings if requested by the person facing discipline, it has no right to relevant information or records from university officials, nor does it have a right to participate in hearings.“Administrators are still able to ignore open expression policy – [the updated language] doesn’t sufficiently provide protection under open expression policy to students rights,” said a person familiar with the deliberations. The language was updated because of Mohammad’s case, they said.Mohammad has at least a year left on her sociology PhD, after which she was planning to return to her MD program. Instead, her suspension will go into effect then, delaying her MD another year.As she returned to campus this spring, one scene in particular from her hearing played over and over in her head. “I’ll never forget what one of them said to me at the end,” she said. “I’m sorry about your mother, but that has nothing to do with this.”Particularly since the 1967 war that displaced Mohammad’s mother and thousands of others, healthcare for Palestinians in Gaza has beenfragmented and weakened. But in the last 18 months, “Israel has perpetrated a concerted policy to destroy Gaza’s healthcare system,” according to aUN report, which accused the IDF of war crimes includingtargeting medical personneland bombing most of Gaza’s hospitals. More than1,000 healthcare workershave been killed in Gaza since October 2023. Israel hasdeniedthe allegations.View image in fullscreenUCSF students and healthcare workers commemorate one year of the Israeli onslaught in Gaza.Photograph: Youtube via laborvideoIt is in this context that Mohammad and some in the medical field in the US have grownincreasingly frustratedat the lack of outcry from members of their profession – especially since most of those bombs were made in the US. The frustration, in some cases, has become personal, feeding tensions between students and faculty protesting Israel and Israelis on campus who have served in the IDF since 7 October. (Military service is compulsory in Israel, and a number of Israelis in the US traveled back to volunteer in the military after the Hamas attacks.)“What kind of care are medical students learning when these are our mentors and educators?” Mohammad wrote in her Mondoweiss article. “What kind of care are patients receiving from doctors who believe in the legitimacy ofapartheid, and that some human lives are not as important as others?”.At least two professors at US universities have faced consequences in recent months after publicly expressing concern about former IDF soldiers on campus. The Columbia University law professor Katherine Franke said she wasforced outof the school in January after bringing up the issue of Israeli students “right out of their military service … [who have] been known to harass Palestinian and other students on our campus”. She had also been speaking on Democracy Now!Dr Rupa Marya, a professor of medicine and a physician, wasbanned from campusat the University of California, San Francisco, for posting on X about the presence of former IDF soldiers at medical schools specifically: “Med students at UCSF are concerned that a first year student from Israel is in their class. They’re asking if he participated in the genocide of Palestinians in the IDF before matriculating.”In an interview with the Guardian, Marya elaborated on her concern: “How do we integrate [Israeli] reservists into the medical community – with [Palestinian] students who have lost 50 or 60 family members? What is the moral obligation of medicine?”View image in fullscreenUmaymah Mohammad in Tucker, Georgia, earlier this month.Photograph: Alyssa Pointer/The GuardianShe is still undergoing hearings at UCSF to determine her future at the school, she said. UCSF did not reply to a request for comment.Also in January, a scheduled talk by a surgeon and member of the IDF medical corps at the University of Maryland school of medicine, on “advancing care, saving lives and improving outcomes”, wascancelled, after the school received thousands of emails inprotest.Azka Mahmood, executive director ofCair-Georgia, or the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Mohammad’s case was unusual because “we haven’t seen medical students targeted in this way,” she said. “You have a Palestinian medical student who specifically joined the field trying to understand inequities and the role of medicine in violence. To have to work side by side with an IDF soldier is exacerbating, and makes it uniquely painful for her.”Mohammad and Marya have connected and are now part of a small group, including the founders ofDoctors Against Genocide, who are launching a Zoom course aimed at healthcare workers and medical students who want to “speak up about the genocide in Gaza … and build a just future for our health systems”. They called the course “Cultivating Courage”.“It is our obligation as a medical community to do no harm and to protect life,” said Karameh Kuemmerle, a Palestinian American doctor and founder of Doctors Against Genocide, a self-described “global health coalition committed to stopping genocide” that has recently organized healthcare workers to lobby US lawmakers on getting aid to Gaza. “To see our hospitals and medical institutions avoid this issue because it’s ‘too divisive’ … is something we simply do not accept,” Kuemmerle said.Nidal Jboor, another founder, noted that medical institutions such as theRed Crossfailed to speak out against the Holocaust while it was happening. If US doctors and medical students continue down the same path with regards to Gaza, he said, “it’s putting us on the wrong side of history.”The project has been a rare bright spot for Mohammad. “Repression often brings you new community,” she said.Back at Emory, Brown, Mohammad’s doctoral adviser, said she was proud of her student. “She’s doing what she’s supposed to do – holding her field accountable to its stated ideals,” Brown said, adding: “She will be Dr Mohammad, one way or the other.”Explore more on these topicsUS campus protestsAtlantaGeorgiaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesGazaUS universitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

South African Russell Yong, who nominated it for the competition, says: “A lot of people find these isopods disgusting but, like all parasites, theirs is a unique and important niche in the world, and with their interesting biology, sexual politics and iconic status, they’d be a great candidate for invertebrate species of the year.”In the vastness of the ocean, you would be forgiven for hardly noticing tinyCymothoa exiguaas they float around looking for a host to prevent them from starving to death. These tiny crustaceans, which look a bit like woodlice, are on the hunt for a tongue.When they come across a fish – such as a snapper fish or a salmon – they make a beeline for the gills and burrow their way in, clinging to the base of the tongue. This is where the sinister transformation starts.Rather than simply killing the fish, they suck blood from the tissue of the tongue so it withers away. Unlike human tongues, which are flexible and muscular, fish tongues are predominantly bone surrounded by soft tissue. Their job is helping fish funnel down food and get water through their gills.No job is too big for the inventiveCymothoa exigua, which takes over the job of the tongue, clinging on to the withered stump, keeping the fish alive by allowing it to feed. Once ensconced, it taps into the fish’s blood and mucus andcan consumewhat the fish is eating, so it keeps itself and the fish alive (and kind of healthy). It is theonly known parasiteto do this.It is believed they can survive like this for years, with the parasite growing along with the fish.Cymothoa exiguacan grow up to an inch in length, about the size of a cockroach.All these tongue-biting lice start out as males. The first to get inside the host fish changes sex to become a female. The females grow inside the mouth, eventually curling around the tongue and using strong hook-like legs to cling on.She mates with any smaller malesfloating around in the gillsand then spews out tiny new parasites, which seek another host to begin the wonderfully grim process again.New arrivals are prevented from becoming females, possibly by the female excreting hormones that prevent the ability to change sex. It is believed the creatures may be able to survive up tothree yearsand have several broods. If the female dies, the largest male will morph into a female.There are lots of species of tongue parasites with different fish hosts. They damage the tongue in different ways, but all are incentivised to keep their host alive, as most can no longer swim once they have grown inside the mouth.The lifecycle ofCymothoa exiguais a reminder that the natural world is more gruesome than most of us could imagine. This parasite is the most wonderful and devious of them all, which is why it deserves to be crowned invertebrate of the year.Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeInvertebrate of the year 2025AnimalsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

His sister Keri believes the strain of caring and lack of government support contributed to their deathsJosh HallidayNorth of England editorMon 24 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 12.45 EDTSharePeter Lodge devoted his life to his son, David. He cherished every moment with him, even when David’s condition left them effectively housebound. Right up until he was 74, Peter would sleep on the living room floor beside David’s hospital bed. Not once did he see his role as a burden.He was angry, though. He was angry at what he described as the “state exploitation” of family carers. Angry at the pittance paid in carer’s allowance to those giving up their lives to care for loved ones, propping up the UK’s ailing social care system in doing so. It was, he said, “insulting”.In 2005, the year his son was registered blind, Peter felt so strongly about the treatment of family carers hewrote to the Guardian, accusing the government of “paying lip service to the vast contribution being made by such hard-working, selfless, undervalued individuals”.Twenty years on – with the plight of unpaid carers still in the news afteran ongoing Guardian investigationinto the carer’s allowance scandal revealed how tens of thousands have been unfairly treated by the government – this newspaper can now tell the story of Peter and David that charities say should shame the nation.View image in fullscreenFrom left; A poem that Peter Lodge wrote, which his sister Keri had framed and is on her living room fireplace; Peter Lodge and his son David when David was a toddler. David’s artwork which Keri has on her dining room wallComposite: Guardian/HandoutsDavid Lodge was his usual playful self when his sister, Dr Keri Lodge, last saw him on a bitterly cold winter evening three years ago.Both in their forties, they still had the same jokey sibling dynamic as when they were younger: David, the cheeky one; Keri, the protective big sister.David was born with a range of complex health conditions including autism, a learning disability and a coordination disorder called dyspraxia. He was partially sighted and later registered blind. Unable to talk, he became proficient at using a small typewriter, called a Lightwriter, to communicate.They lived nearly 60 miles across Yorkshire from each other – Keri with her young family in York, and David and Peter in the terraced home in Hull where they grew up. But she would visit every Wednesday, giving her father his one weekly window of respite.David so looked forward to Keri’s visits. In the Makaton signing system that he used to communicate, David would make the symbol for sister last thing at night and first thing in the morning before she arrived. Keri saw going back to Hull as “coming home”. She rang them every day.On the night they last spoke, David used his Lightwriter to tell Keri to cut her daughters’ toenails – his usual teasing goodbye. And as she made for the door, he smiled, ruffled his sister’s hair, blew her a raspberry, then waved.View image in fullscreenFrom the Guardian archives. An extract of a letter written to the Guardian by Peter Lodge in November 2005Photograph: The GuardianSeven days later, on 12 January 2022, Keri arrived for her weekly visit to find her brother sprawled on the living room floor. He was barely breathing.Beside him was their 74-year-old father, Peter. At first, Keri thought they were sleeping. Their feet were intertwined. She wondered why they would be taking a nap on the living room floor. Then her eyes travelled to her father’s face. He was dead.A post-mortem examination found Peter had died as long as four days earlier. David had lain undiscovered next to him all that time, unable to call for help. Keri believes he must have fallen to the ground as he tried to come to his father’s aid.By the time paramedics arrived, David was barely conscious. He was rushed to Hull Royal Infirmary where he was treated for pneumonia and severe dehydration, but doctors thought he would pull through and within hours were planning his discharge.Then, in the early hours of the morning on 13 January 2022, his condition worsened and he suffered a heart attack. At around 4am, 13 hours after Keri found him, he was pronounced dead. He had just turned 40.Reliving those heart-rending final hours is as traumatic three years on for Keri as it was at the time. She agonises about how terrified and helpless they both must have felt. Her father’s dying thoughts, she says, would almost certainly have been about how David would get help.Keri has decided to tell their story after growing outrage about the treatment of unpaid carers like her father, which have been exposed by a months-long Guardian investigation.Ultimately, she believes, her father and her brother would still be alive if the state cared more about those who devote their lives to looking after the most vulnerable.“My dad never had a day off, never had sick leave, and was working literally 24/7 when he died essentially at work,” she said.Peter was very fit for his age. He never smoked, never drank, had a healthy diet and went running on the days Keri took over caring for her brother. “He wanted to keep himself fit for David,” she said.He died suddenly from complications caused by a gastric ulcer, which had gone undiagnosed.Keri believes it was caused by the relentless exhaustion of caring around-the-clock: “He died due to a condition that’s brought about by stress, and the stress was from caring.”“If that stress had been alleviated – you can never say never [but] perhaps he wouldn’t have died. And the reason that David died was because my dad died, ultimately. And nobody found him in time.”View image in fullscreenA poem that Peter wrote, which Keri had framed and is on her living room fireplace.Photograph: Keri Lodge/HandoutPeter had been David’s permanent carer since his son was young, when he gave up work to be a stay-at-home dad. It was a role he cherished, but it took its toll. Recently, his only break was when Keri visited, which allowed him to “do basic things, like get a wash,” she said.Keri said her father had been “powered by unconditional love” but he felt the government took advantage of the nearly 6 million people like him who care for a loved one, saving the taxpayerat least £162bna year.“They cherished each other,” Keri said. “But it was a strain on my dad, not least the sleep deprivation. I think the strain of caring contributed to, if not caused, his death.”In his letter to the Guardian in 2005, Peter pleaded with ministers to increase the rate of carer’s allowance, the meagre weekly benefit paid to those who save the state billions a year, then worth less than 50p an hour for someone providing at least 100 hours of care a week. Today that figure would be 82p an hour.He stopped being eligible for carer’s allowance when he reached state pension age but to the end felt “insulted” by the paltry figure, Keri said. The benefit is currently £81.90 a week – the equivalent of 82p an hour for someone providing 100 hours of care a week.“Dad felt very angry about what he saw as state exploitation of unpaid carers,” she said.“I really don’t think many people understand that if you are a full-time unpaid carer like my dad, you are on call 24/7, 365 days of the year, with no rest breaks, no sick leave and no annual leave. It requires superhuman strength and fortitude, but it does come at a cost.”Keri made the difficult decision to share her family’s story to call for urgent changes to a system she believes is failing carers and their loved ones.She wants local authorities and the NHS to be legally obliged to plan for how vulnerable people will get help in the event of an emergency.Although Peter was healthy for his age, this was something that increasingly worried him. He raised it several times as he entered his seventies, Keri said, adding that he had asked David’s social worker how his son would raise the alarm if Peter “dropped down dead”. He never felt there was a plan.In 2022, months after Peter and David died, NHS England created a new code to indicate when a “carer contingency plan” was in place for a family. But this only covers cases where a carer can no longer provide the same level of care due to illness or other reasons. It does not address what will happen to the cared-for person if their carer suffers a medical emergency like Peter.There was never a robust plan for Peter and David despite the family raising it multiple times with Hull city council, said Keri, who is an NHS consultant psychiatrist specialising in learning disabilities and autism.Their deaths have echoes of the harrowing case ofBronson Battersby, the two-year-old who died of dehydration after being unable to call for help when his 60-year-old father, Kenneth, suffered a fatal heart attack at their home in Skegness, Lincolnshire, last year. Bronson was known to social workers and would typically be seen every month.But it is not clear what plans, if any, were in place for how he would get help in the event of an emergency. Lincolnshire county council declined to comment when asked whether any such plans were in place, adding that it would not discuss the case until after an inquest later this year.Technology is available for carers or their loved ones to seek help in emergencies. Lifeline pendants are offered routinely to the elderly. One was considered for David but was deemed unsuitable because his autism meant he was very sensitive to what he wore. Since his death, Keri has discovered apps that can be used to raise the alarm. She thinks David would have been able to use such a device, potentially saving his life and even his father’s.The failure to plan for an emergency was just the final way David and Peter were failed by the state, their family say. “They made decisions about his life which demeaned and devalued him, ignored his communication of distress and, ultimately, led to the social circumstances at the time of his death,” Keri said.By the time David died, he had several traumatic experiences of care settings and being removed from home. All he wanted was to be at home with his father, and that is all Peter wanted too. The family repeatedly asked for David to be given daytime support, allowing Peter some respite, but were told by Hull city council that the only option was a short stay in a care home with a view to moving there long term.An inquest into David’s death concluded in January that he was also failed in his final hours. In apreventing future deaths report, issued in the most serious cases of harm, the coroner Edward Steele found that the “neglect” of clinicians had contributed to his death. Among the failings was that David was never offered any pain relief and that basic examinations were not carried out. The charity MencapsaidDavid’s death highlighted “systemic failings” that were “deeply shocking”.At home in York, Keri proudly shows off a multi-coloured collage made by David that brightens her dining room wall. On the living room fireplace is a framed poem written by their father five years ago about moving David to a care home.“Home,” he writes, is “a place one misses; a place one prefers to any other place; a place one runs back to: a home that cares, not a care home.”The charityCarersUK backed Keri’s call for state bodies to have proper contingency plans for carers and their loved ones in the event of an emergency.Tamara Sandoul, its head of policy, said her charity was “shocked and saddened” by David and Peter’s story.She added: “Despite the vital contribution they make, there is a widespread lack of formal support for carers. Many are extremely concerned about how they will cope in the future. Yet without unpaid carers, our health and social care systems would collapse.”Hull city council said in a statement: “We are very saddened by the death of David Lodge and we offer our deepest condolences to his family. We are committed to ensuring that any learning to prevent future deaths is acted upon as a priority.A council spokesperson said a safeguarding adult review, undertaken in 2022, was being revisited in light of the inquest. A separate review, examining its work with people who have learning disabilities and autism, was also underway. The council said findings from each of these would be published.A spokesperson for the NHS Humber health partnership, which oversees Hull Royal Infirmary, said: “We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Mr Lodge. We always try to learn where processes could be improved and will be responding to the coroner in due course.”"

Now it is over. He discusses his anger with management, his pride in his team – and what he’ll do nextBySimon HattenstoneMon 24 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 08.01 EDTShareStephen Sackur makes no bones about it: he is not going willingly. “I don’t want to leave theBBC, because I still think I’ve got a lot to offer,” the HARDtalk presenter tells me. “And I don’t want the programme to be closed, but that argument has been definitively lost. I’m thinking hard about other things I’m going to do. I’m fine. I’m feeling quite positive.” Maybe. But I think he’s also feeling hurt, betrayed and, though he denies it, a little angry. “It’s definitely a strange period,” he says. We’re talking in February, a month before the show finishes and he’s sent packing by the Beeb.Sackur, 61, is a BBC lifer. He started out as a trainee in 1986, was made a foreign correspondent in 1990, and went on to some of the biggest gigs in journalism – Europe, Washington, the Middle East. For the past 19 years, he’s hosted HARDtalk, the interview show that holds global power to account. The BBC has always lauded it as a flagship programme – thrice weekly, regularly watched in more than 200 countries by up to 70 million people (and, he reckons, with the podcast and World Service radio versions that figure could rise to 170 million). Which is why he got such a shock when he wastold in October that it was being pulled.As you might expect, Sackur has not taken the end of the show lying down. After the announcement, he put out a message on X, explaining why it was sad for him personally but more importantly a depressing day for the BBC.He made his point in a series of uncompromising posts. “At a time when disinformation and media manipulation are poisoning public discourse HARDtalk is unique: a long-form interview show with only one mission – to hold to account those who all too often avoid accountability in their own countries,” he wrote. “Anyone who has seen our interviews with Hugo Chávez, Sergey Lavrov, Meles Zenawi, Lula, Nancy Pelosi, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Emmanuel Macron, Imran Khan, Olusegun Obasanjo and countless others over the years will know HARDtalk was never just another news show. A brilliant team of producers and researchers is being disbanded … My commitment to rigorous exploration of world affairs won’t change. I hope the BBC’s doesn’t either.” Hardly a humble assessment of HARDTalk or his own career, but a fair one.We’re in Sackur’s lovely kitchen – stylish, hi-tech, posh coffee machine on the countertop, gorgeous contemporary art on the walls. He asks where I’d like to sit. The sofa looks good, I say. But he’s already moving towards the table, turning the kitchen into an improvised HARDtalk studio. He sits one side, I’m opposite – the format he’s used to. It’s astonishing how many world leaders have subjected themselves to his interrogations, wrongly assuming they can best him in debate.He is a tall, thin man, straight as an ironing board, with strong arms and a military bearing – undoubtedly officer class. Sackur’s style of interviewing is forensic and barristerial. Rather than getting interviewees to open up, it’s more about putting the case for the prosecution, and watching them squirm or try to worm their way out of it. And he can gets great lines from guests. In 2009, Boris Johnson, then mayor of London, told him that the £250,000 a year he received for writinga weekly newspaper column was “chicken feed”– a quote that has stuck.Sackur tells me he’s not taking voluntary redundancy, which he has been offered, because there is nothing voluntary about it. If the BBC is giving him the old heave-ho, it can at least do it honestly. You’re forcing them to make you redundant? “Yes. I suppose it’s a little bit of obstinacy and just saying: ‘OK, well, you think very hard. You’ve got a journalist here who’s got a lot of experience, who probably has a longer track record of covering international affairs than almost anybody in the BBC.’ I have pretty good contacts, know a lot of people in a lot of places. If they decide that’s not what they want and need, that’s fine, but I’d like them to be clear about that.”Although the HARDtalk budget had been cut in recent years, there was no suggestion that it would be axed. He says he only had one proper conversation with the director-general, Tim Davie, in five years, and that went positively. “I rang him up when he got the job and I said: ‘I just want to say hi and well done.’ And he said: ‘It’s great to talk to you. I appreciate how important HARDtalk is, particularly in terms of our international offer and profile. I look forward to coming down and seeing the team,’ which he never did. He invited me to a gathering of journalists from different parts of the BBC, but otherwise I’ve never spoken or heard from him again. And, since the closure announcement, I’ve not heard a word.”View image in fullscreenStephen Sackur interviews Christine Lagarde, then managing director of the IMF, in Washington DC, in 2016.Photograph: B Christopher/AlamyA few weeks after the decision was taken, Sackur says, he was invited to a meeting with BBC’s head of news, Deborah Turness. “It didn’t yield a change of mind or any hint that there would be a change of mind.” So what was the point of it? “That’s a very good question. I think she felt embarrassed that she had never met me. Because, if you remember, after the announcement was made, there was a massive response in this country and around the world. A lot of very senior journalists expressed their surprise and disquiet about it. And quite a few other people as well. And it did have a bit of an impact.”One of his recent interviewees was the former Washington Post editor Marty Baron. Sackur took a scalpel to him in typical fashion, suggesting that old-fashioned, top-down mainstream media has had its day, and that Baron, 70, was just another white, middle-aged privileged man the world had tired of hearing from. The same could be said of you, couldn’t it, I say. He nods. “Yes, I could have been talking to myself.”Well, you’re slightly posher than Baron, I say. He laughs. “So I’m even more of a problem! Yes, I’m part of the same sort of media elite, and I am white and getting on a bit and all of this applies to me, and HARDtalk might well be better refreshing itself with a new presenter who carries a bit less of that baggage for sure.” But, he says, even if the Beeb thought he should be put out to grass, the show shouldn’t have been. “Take me off HARDtalk? I totally get it. Every old horse at some point has to be taken off to the glue factory. But don’t kill off the programme.”Actually, he says, he has thought for some time he should move on and try something new. The trouble is he enjoyed the show so much. “What’s not to like about travelling the world talking to interesting people? A lot of journalists I respect greatly say to me: ‘You have the best job in journalism.’ In terms of an ability to engage with what’s interesting in this world of ours, there’s no job like it.”It’s lunchtime, and Sackur suggests a visit to his local. “We’re just off to the pub,” he shouts up to his partner, Ana, whom he has been with for five years. He was married for more than 20 years and has three adult children. As we stroll down the south London street, he talks about his own childhood. Sackur grew up in a middle-class family in Spilsby, Lincolnshire. His father, he says, was hard to pigeonhole – a Cambridge University graduate with a degree in agriculture who became a Guardian-reading farmer and stood twice, unsuccessfully, to become a Labour MP in Tory heartlands. His mother came from farming stock. Sackur was a bright boy gifted with a ruthlessly logical mind and an ability to out-argue others. He also went to Cambridge, where he studied history. Desperate to escape the isolated rural environment he grew up in, he realised that journalism was the perfect way to do it.We order Guinness and chips at the bar, and head off to a booth. I ask him whether he’s a nightmare over the dinner table, always arguing his case, always having to win. “I think I was a bit of a nightmare as a kid because I was argumentative and wouldn’t let it drop. Sometimes I didn’t see that the best thing to do was to back down.”What has he learned from interviewing so many significant figures? “I’ve learned a lot about the ego. Human beings are hugely flawed and are desperate to cover up their flaws.” Has it made him look at his own flaws? “Very much so.” What are his main ones? “Selfishness, self-absorption, being preoccupied with my place in things rather than …” He comes to a stop. Did this affect his relationship with his family? “Yeah, that’s where I would go, but I don’t want to talk about personal stuff that is difficult. I think I’m a more rounded human being than I was years ago, for sure.”View image in fullscreenSackur in 1991 covering the Gulf war.How has he changed? “I’m more tolerant. I was something of a control freak: I would expect and look for a neatness – a literal neatness and a sort of figurative neatness – in life. And I’d try to impose it when, as I can see much more clearly now, life isn’t neat and to be rounded up and squared off all tidy. In the past, it would leave me grumpy and intolerant in a way that was completely counterproductive. Now I’m better able to live with the rough edges.”He admits he finds it tough talking about personal things – partly because he’s private and partly because it inevitably involves other people he has no right to talk about. “Some of it is too painful, and painful not just to me, but painful to other people that I really don’t want to hurt.”So we retreat to safer ground. I ask about his most memorable guests on HARDtalk. There are so many, he says –Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, who treated Sackur with contempt before warming to him; Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, the most courageous man he’s met; the tortured Allen Ault, who had beenin charge of executions in Georgia; Bill Clinton, whose magnetism made Tony Blair look “second division” on the charisma front; the brutal Ethiopian dictator Meles Zenawi. It was only when he returned to Ethiopia, he says, that he realised the impact of his interview with Zenawi. “I’d meet people on the street and they’d be quoting from it like it was verses from Shakespeare.” The thing is, he says, they’d never heard Zenawi held to account before.Does he think BBC bigwigs are aware of the significance of HARDtalk? “No. I don’t think at the very senior levels of the BBC there is an awareness of just how big a show HARDtalk is around the world.” Perhaps people like Turness are too removed from the journalism to make important decisions about it? “I’ll tell you what I think. I think it is deeply regrettable that people like Deborah Turness do not spend more time making a point of hanging out with people like me. I think that would be incredibly beneficial for them, given their importance as layers-down of the sort of strategic direction of BBC News and current affairs. Again, I don’t want to sound in any way egomaniacal, but I do have a lot of experience and you would think that that experience would be useful to take advice from, to tap into as a resource for those people who are defining strategic priorities.”View image in fullscreenSackur in Gaza in 1995.Sackur is alarmed at the way news priorities have changed at the BBC. “Programmes like HARDtalk, Panorama and Newsnight have long had a huge amount of autonomy. Increasingly there is a desire at the top of the BBC to centralise and control and that doesn’t fit easily with these programmes. You can see it in the way Newsnight and Panorama have changed and been resourced. In previous rounds of reform and cuts, we’ve had our staff reduced, our money reduced, and now we’re disappearing altogether.” He’s worried that with the focus on live news, journalism is being reduced to “churnalism” at the expense of more studied, groundbreaking work.Presumably, the BBC won’t even save much money by axing HARDtalk, I say. After all, it’s hardly expensive telly. “Don’t even get me started on the money!” Too late. “I think the total sum of money BBC News declared that it had to save in that round of cuts was £24m. HARDtalk represents around 5% of that £24m – £1.2m a year. In total.” The team is tiny, he says – only eight staff. “I can’t prove this scientifically, but I’m pretty sure that HARDtalk is the cheapest content per minute of broadcasting the BBC does. We represent about four middle to senior management salaries.”BBC announces net reduction of 130 news and current affairs jobsRead moreDoes he think it’s a snub to highbrow journalism? “No. They know what they want and we don’t fit it. But I’ve got too much love for the BBC and I’ve got too many colleagues at the BBC who are still doing fantastic work to think that they don’t want serious journalism.”He stops, and says it’s important to get this right. “I’m not leaving, raging with bitterness and resentment and the feeling that the BBC is slashing, burning and ruining the sort of journalism that I believe in. That would be simple. It’s more subtle and more complex than that.”We catch up a few weeks later in mid-March. Sackur has just received his redundancy letter and been served three months’ notice. He is devastated for his “small but perfectly formed team”, and now there is no attempt to disguise his anger. “I feel really, really cross at incredibly dumb decisions made by management that I fear is not doing the right thing for the BBC. I have not been impressed with their ability to deal with this in a compassionate, human way.”He tells me that one of his final interviews was with Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB). “It made plenty of headlines worldwide on Trump and tariffs,” he says. “Like so many recent guests, she told me she was completely baffled by the closure of HARDtalk. ‘Why would they do it at a time like this?’ she said. As a sort of consolation she gave me a jar of ECB honey – apparently they have a hive in the bank’s garden.”On the positive side, he feels energised and liberated by his new freedom. He talks about his plans for the future. He has just signed a deal to write a book about journalist heroes who have risked everything to make a difference. “I’m not a brave person, and part of the reason for writing this book is that, over the years, I’ve been so blown away by journalists whose work is truly brave in a way that mine never was and never will be.” Having it out verbally in a studio doesn’t compare with risking your life taking on the corrupt and powerful, he says.As for his journalism, he’s by no means finished with that. He’d love to do a revamped version of HARDtalk. “As I said at the beginning, if you need people who are steeped in international affairs, who’ve met and reported on so many of the people and places that matter …” In other words, Stephen Sackur is open to offers.Explore more on these topicsThe G2 interviewBBCTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They arrested political opponents, who then vanished without a trace.”View image in fullscreenThe bodies of three priests and two students killed in what became known as the San Patricio church massacre are taken away from the Belgrano, a neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, in July 1976.After the 1976 coup, Argentina’s military set about crushing any potential opposition, and eventually 30,000 people were killed or disappeared. Pregnant prisoners were kept alive until they gave birth and then murdered. At least 500 newborns were taken from their captive parents and given to military couples to raise as their own.A group ofmothers whose children had disappeared began to protest in front of Videla’s presidential palace, going down in history as the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo.View image in fullscreenThe mothers of the Plaza de Mayo at a recent protest in March 2019.With his Nikon F2 AS, Ledesma documented arrests, murders and kidnappings. In his stark black and white images lay the full drama of one of the bloodiest regimes in recent history: bloodied, lifeless bodies riddled with bullets lay strewn along the streets or in basements.“Some were buried in concrete blocks,’’ says Ledesma. “Others washed up on Argentina’s beaches, after having beenthrown from aircraft into the ocean. Among them were some of my friends and a schoolmate – her name was Elena Isabel Barbagallo. She was beautiful, only 18 years old. She was abducted in 1977. They smashed her skull with the butt of a machine gun.”View image in fullscreenMilitary police during a factory takeover in Ramos Mejía suburb of Buenos Aires, May 1974.Press coverage became a dangerous liability for the regime. Dozens of journalists and photojournalists were killed by the military, and Ledesma began to sense that he might be next.“They started tailing me,” he says. “One day, around the end of 1981, as soon as I got off the bus, I noticed a car in the distance. Just as I was about to cross the street, the car began to accelerate – with its headlights off in the night – directly toward me. I leapt back, and it whizzed by within a few centimetres.

I had hidden some of my rolls and managed to preserve them.”View image in fullscreenPeople wait to report the disappearance of family members to the Inter-American Human Rights Commission of the Organisation of American States, September 1979.Ledesma managed to save only some of those photos, especially those dating back to before the coup, when, according to the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons, at least 600 people were kidnapped and at least 500 opponents were executed by death squads.In 1982, before the end of the Falklands war, Ledesma left Argentina and made his way to Milan, where he began his career as a freelance photographer.View image in fullscreenJosé Luis Ledesma withDiego Maradona.That same year, a young footballer from Argentina arrived in Spain.

Among them was Lt Col Carlos Luis Malatto, a former Argentinian army officer accused of murder and forced disappearances during the dictatorship.In 2019, along with a group of journalists from la Repubblica, Ledesma, who had moved to Sicily,found out that Malatto had been living in a tourist village in the province of Messina, even though he was currently on trial in Rome for crimes committed inArgentina, which was also seeking his extradition.View image in fullscreenFormer army officer Lt Col Carlos Luis Malatto is discovered in Messina in 2019.Almost 50 years after the coup, many of the victims of the dictatorship remain missing, and the fight for justice continues.Human rights groups have raised alarm over the far‑right president Javier Milei’s attempts to rewrite history, as hedenies the long-standing consensus over the dictatorship’s crimes.“Argentina is going through a very dark period with Milei,” says Ledesma. “Milei has publicly questioned the crimes of the military dictatorship. He doubts the numbers of the desaparecidos. He wants to erase history. He does this at a very crucial moment in the battle for the identification of the desaparecidos, because time is passing – and the Madres de Plaza de Mayo have become grandmothers, some even great-grandmothers, and many have died without ever knowing anything about their children and grandchildren.”“Milei risks erasing their memory,” he adds, “the only antidote to ensure that what happened never happens again.”Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayArgentinaDiego MaradonaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Deportations from the US to Venezuela, which have rarely taken place, have been a point of dispute for theTrump administration.Sunday’s indirect deportation flight to Venezuela comes amid heightened tensions between theTrump administrationand Venezuela, and an increase in operations targeting Venezuelan immigrants in the US.The Venezuelan government official’s announcement also alluded to the highly contentious expulsion of Venezuelan migrants toEl Salvadorlast week.“Migrating is not a crime, and we will not rest until we accomplish the return of all who need it, and until we rescue our brothers that are kidnapped in El Salvador,” said Jorge Rodríguez Gomez, the president of the Venezuelan national assembly.Judge blocks Trump use of 18th-century war law to deport VenezuelansRead moreThe Honduran foreign ministerannouncedon Sunday night that 199 Venezuelans were deported from the US to a military base in Honduras on Sunday. From there, the migrants were placed on Venezuelan planes and returned to Venezuela.“This process shows us again the positive cooperation between the government ofHonduras, the United States of America and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,” Enrique Reina said on X.According to the US state department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, the Trump administrationexpects to see“a consistent flow of deportation flights to Venezuela going forward”.Since the Trump administration took office two months ago, there has been heightened pressure and aggression towards the Venezuelan government. In early February, the Venezuelan government sent two planes to the US to pick up deportees and returned them to Venezuela. At the time, the two flights were seen as a breakthrough in relations between the US and Venezuela.However, scheduled flights were againplaced on holdby the Venezuelan government, afterDonald Trumpreversed the 2022 license given to Chevron to operate in Venezuela. Last week, secretary of state Marco Rubiothreatened“new, severe, and escalating sanctions” on Venezuela if it did not accept deportations.On Monday, the treasury department published a license authorizing the wind down of Chevron’s work in Venezuela.The first deportation to Venezuela via Honduras took placelast month, when the US deported 177 Venezuelan immigrants previously detained at the Guantánamo Bay naval base. The US government’s Immigration and Customs Enforcementagencyand the Honduran foreign minister at the time both announced that deportation.The Honduran government has strong diplomatic relations with Venezuela and their involvement in the transfer of Venezuelan deportees raises questions about behind-the-scenes negotiations between the Trump administration and the two Latin American governments. Before the US president took office, Honduran leftwing president Xiomara Castro hadthreatenedto expel the US military from a base in the Central American country, in response to Trump’s threats to engage in mass deportations.But after February’s first deportation to Venezuela via Honduras, Reinaconfirmedthat Castro’s husband – former president reformist Manuel Zelaya– had coordinated with Trump envoys Mauricio Claver-Carone and Richard Grenell for the transfer of the migrants.In a shakeup to US and Honduran relations, Castro’s brother-in-law and Zelaya’s brother, was previously accused in a US federal court of collaborating with drug traffickers. Her predecessor Juan Orland0 Hernández wasconvicted and sentenced in New York of drug trafficking.All of this comes amid heightened US aggression towards the Venezuelan government. Earlier this year, before Trump assumed the presidency, the US state department announced a reward of up to $25m, for information leading to the capture of Venezuelan presidentNicolás Maduro. In March 2020, under Trump’s first presidency, Maduro and other top officials were indicted in a New York federal court of drug trafficking and related crimes.On Monday, Trumpthreatened to impose25% tariffs on any country that purchases oil from Venezuela, saying the country “has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse”.When announcing the secondary tariffs, Trump added, without proof, that Venezuela has “purposefully and deceitfully” sent to the US, tens of thousands of “undercover” gang members. In late February, the state department designated the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua as a terrorist organization. The Trump administration has continually, also without proof, claimed that many Venezuelan immigrants in the US belong to the gang, and have been sent by the Venezuelan government.Last week, the Trump administration quickly, and without due process, expelled 238 Venezuelan migrants from the US to El Salvador afterinvokingthe Alien Enemies Act. When invoking the Act, Trump said that the Tren de Aragua gang “is closely aligned with, and indeed has infiltrated, the Maduro regime”.Trump revokes legal status of 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and VenezuelansRead moreThe Venezuelan immigrants were sent to a high-security “terrorism” prison, run by the rightwing Salvadoran government of Nayib Bukele.In the days that followed, news organizations began publishing details of the operation, including that some of the Venezuelans expelled to El Salvador were not members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The Trump administration continues to say that the rendition operation was legal, and that all Venezuelans expelled in the operation were gang members. A federal judge blocked the administration from expelling people via the Alien Enemies Act, and on Monday, he ruled migrants are entitled to individual hearings before being expelled.Despite the Trump administration claiming that alleged Tren de Aragua members were sent by the Venezuelan government, an intelligence document suggests otherwise.Reporting from the New York Timeslast Thursday revealed that the CIA and the National Security Agency contradict Trump’s claims of the Venezuelan government’s ties to the Tren de Aragua gang, raising questions about Trump’s invocation of the war-time Alien Enemies Act. The justice departmentannounceda criminal investigation into the source of the New York Times’ reporting.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationVenezuelaHondurasEl SalvadorTrump administrationAmericasNicolás MaduronewsShareReuse this content"

Now, we need to do extraordinary things for ourselves.”Residents of Gander opened their arms to nearly6,600 airline passengersdiverted there when the US government shut down airspace during 9/11.In a matter of a few hours, the town population of 10,000 in 2001 was overwhelmed by 38 planeloads of travelers, yet locals went to work in their kitchens and cleaned up spare rooms to offer space and food to the newcomers.Flight crews quickly filled Gander’s hotels, so passengers were taken to schools, fire stations, church halls. The Canadian military flew in 5,000 cots. Stores donated blankets, coffee machines, barbecue grills. Unable to retrieve their luggage, passengers became dependent on the kindness of strangers, and it came in the shape of clothes, showers, toys, banks of phones to call home free of charge, an arena that became a giant walk-in fridge full of donated food.Once all the planes had landed or turned back to Europe, Gander’s air traffic controllers switched to cooking meals in the building nonstop for three days.On Monday, Carney visited the home of Beulah Cooper, who opened her home and comforted many including Dennis and Hannah O’Rourke, an elderly couple whose New York firefighter son, Kevin, went missing at the World Trade Center and was later confirmed to have died there.The O’Rourkes remained friends with Cooper long after and went back to Gander, saying they felt eternally indebted.“More than 6,000 passengers. Overnight, the town’s population almost doubled,” Carney said during a speech to residents. “You showed friendship to people who were fearful. In a crisis, you showed your character. When people needed help, you gave it.”Carney noted the story of that day became legend, immortalized in the Canadian-made Broadway hit musicalCome From Away.“It became yet another example of the unbreakable bond between Canadians and Americans. Because when Americans are in need, Canadians have always shown up,” Carney said.Carney noted Canadians have always been by Americans’ side whether it was during the Iranian hostage crisis, or more recently during the California wildfires or in Afghanistan, whereCanadalost 158 members of the armed forces and seven civilians.Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbor and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that hasinfuriated Canadians. The US president has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested the border is a fictional line.Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products – as well as all of America’s trading partners – on 2 April.Carney said Canadians were over the shock of the betrayal but now had to look out for themselves. He said Canadians and Americans had traditionally been like brothers.“But that’s changed. And it wasn’t us who did the changing. Unfortunately, President Trump’s actions have put that kinship under greater strain today than at any point in our storied history,” Carney said.Carney and his Conservative opponent, Pierre Poilievre, said Trump must respect Canada’s sovereignty as they kicked off their election campaigns on Sunday. Carney announced afive-week election campaignbefore the vote on 28 April.Carney still has not had a phone call with Trump and suggested that might not happen until after the election. “I’m available for a call. But you know we are going to talk on our terms as a sovereign country, not as what he pretends we are,” Carney said.He said the Americans were making a “fundamental mistake” in the trade war.“They think they will weaken us. They think that they can own us, quite frankly, that’s what they think,” he said. “We are going to get stronger. We are going to wait this out. They are going to come to the table and we are going to negotiate a good deal for Canadians.”Explore more on these topicsMark CarneyCanadaDonald TrumpAmericasUS foreign policySeptember 11 2001newsShareReuse this content"

The administration claims activities of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua constitute such an invasion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His attorney, Lindsay Toczylowski, went on MSNBC last week and claimed he had “disappeared” despite having a scheduled immigration court appearance, after officialsmisinterpreted his tattoosas gang symbols.According to Boasberg’s order, five Venezuelan immigrants had secured emergency relief – hours before the Trump administration said it would use the Alien Enemies Act – fearing immediate deportation without a chance to contest their alleged gang membership. Several of the migrants who filed the lawsuit argue they actually fled Venezuela to escape the gang.Trump has called Boasberg, an Obama-appointed judge, a “radical left lunatic” and called for his impeachment, prompting the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, toissue a rare rebuke.Boasberg explained on Monday that his orders did not block normal immigration enforcement, noting the administration had already designated Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization, allowing deportations through standard channels.Lawyers for Trump have asked the appeals court to lift Boasberg’s ruling that blocked the administration’s use of the wartime act. If the appeals court rules in their favor, that could give a free hand for the Trump administration to use it to deport any immigrant it accuses of being a gang member without the standard due process owed to accused persons in the US.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpVenezuelaUS politicsAmericasLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

A broad trough – an area of locally lower pressure – has been moving across northern Australia, dragging in warm, moist air from the Gulf of Carpentaria and providing the perfect ingredients for the formation of severe thunderstorms, and evensupercells.More than 70mm (2.75in) of rain fell in an hour under the slow-moving storms over the weekend in what is usually an arid, low rainfall zone with a desert/grassland climate classification. Some parts of the region have sparse observation data, but some local stations have been able to record more than 100mm within 24 hours, with 132mm of rain at Marion Downs, Queensland.The high rainfall to such dry ground heightens the risk of flash flooding, with flooding also often occurring after the weather events have passed as river catchments merge. While minor flood watches are in place, a more moderate flood watch is likely to be issued later in the week as water transports through various river catchments, with the potential for communities and transport links to be cut off. As the trough moves further east into Queensland through Monday and Tuesday, some models are predicting that central/southern parts of Queensland will receive 200mm of rain within a 24-hour period, with perhaps another 100mm or so into Wednesday, exacerbating the flash flood risk for the remainder of the week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

One justice voted to impeach Han.Han, who resumed the acting presidency on Monday, thanked the court for its “wise decision”.“I believe that all citizens are clearly speaking out against the highly polarised political sphere,” he said. “I think there is no place for division now. Our country’s priority is to move forward.”Han, 75, had served in leadership positions for more than three decades under five presidents, both conservative and liberal.In a country sharply divided by partisan rhetoric, Han had been seen as a rare example of an official whose varied career transcended party lines.Still, the opposition-led parliament accused him of not doing enough to thwart Yoon’s decision to declare martial law, an accusation he denied.The finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, assumed the position of acting president while the cases of Yoon and Han were considered by the constitutional court.Parliament impeached Han over his alleged role in the martial law, as well as his refusal to appoint more justices to the constitutional court and to back special counsel bills targeting Yoon and the first lady, Kim Keon-hee.Han attended the only hearing in the case on 19 February, where he denied any role in the martial law episode and called for the court to dismiss the impeachment.South Korea’s presidential office welcomed Han’s reinstatement and said the ruling “reaffirms that excessive impeachments by the national assembly are reckless and malicious political offensives”.“We hope that acting president Han’s return to duty marks the beginning of a return to normal governance.”The unexpected imposition of martial law on 3 December by Yoon and the ensuing political upheaval sent shock waves through Asia’s fourth-largest economy, and drew concerns from allies such as the US, who had seen Yoon as a key partner in efforts to counter China and North Korea.The martial law in the end lasted only about six hours after lawmakers voted to reject the declaration, after defying efforts by police and the military to seal off parliament, hopping fences to avoid the security cordons.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificYoon Suk YeolnewsShareReuse this content"

The Save Victoria Park group has reportedly briefed lawyers in a potential court challenge against the stadium build, arguing the project will destroy valuable green space and must be stopped due to the site’s significance to First Nations communities.Victoria Park was converted into a golf course in 1931, butBrisbanecity council developed plans in 2020 to convert the 64 hectare site back into park.“Victoria Park has a really rich Indigenous history and one of the centrepieces of the park will be the lake – Lake Barrambin – and that has a wide Indigenous history as well,”the lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, saidin 2020.Brisbane historian Ray Kerkhove conducted multiple heritages assessments of Victoria Park, also known as Barrambin, for different levels of government.He said if Crisafulli announced plans to turn it into a stadium, his response would be “horror and despair”.Kerkhove said Victoria Park, which is heritage listed, is probably the most significant site of Indigenous heritage in central Brisbane.The park served as the town camp for up to 1,500 Indigenous people throughout the 19th century, before they were forced on to missions, and Aboriginal people returned to live there when allowed to leave the missions in the 20th century, he said.Brisbane is deciding on a 2032 Olympics stadium: how do the options stack up?Read more“That’s a continuity of nearly 200 years. I’ve walked around there and found stone tools and oyster shells on the ground,” he said.It served as a meeting place long before that, and is part of a songline, he said. Kerkhove said the heritage would be destroyed by a new stadium.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“There’s this long history of Aboriginal people having that place as a special place …” he said.“Of course it is (on a songline). Most base camps are on songlines”.Both the organisation’s recommendations and the government response will be released later today.The former Labor government rejected a similar recommendation by a previous inquiry on costs grounds.Brisbane was awarded the Games in July 2021, under the former premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. It was the first city selected under the Olympics’ “new norm” approach, which is designed to reduce infrastructure costs by reusing existing venues as much as possible.Palaszczuk’s successor, Steven Miles, cancelled the Gabba rebuild in March last year, announcing his own venues plan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We need to take care of it, and to build on top of it, it just wouldn’t be nice.“It’s almost like our history doesn’t matter.”Kerkhove saidthere were at least two documented massacres at the park in the 1840s. Both times the entire town camp was burned to the ground.“That was a scuffle in the middle of the night. We don’t really know how many people. Certainly some were killed,” he said.Organisers have claimed the Games benefits First Nations people, with Brisbane 2032 being touted as the first Olympicswith its own reconciliation action plan.Explore more on these topicsBrisbane Olympic Games 2032BrisbaneQueensland politicsQueenslandnewsShareReuse this content"

When she got the call with the news, she felt both a “sense of disbelief” and “weirdly buoyant – that floating sense of something happening”.After her son moved to Brisbane, Larkin had been “really taken aback” by how much she missed him. “I rarely write about my children, I think they’ve maybe got one poem each now,” said Larkin. Her son hadn’t read the poem until Larkin found out she’d won the competition. “He’s delighted for me. I reckon he’s probably a little bit embarrassed as well.”The poem incorporates the Finnish language, which Larkin had begun reading about before going to Helsinki last summer, around the time that her son moved. Her poem plays with the abessive case, which is used to express absence and involves adding the suffix-ttaor-ttäon to nouns. “I’m really interested in the way knowledge of other languages shines a light on English,” she said.Larkin’s debut collection, Rope of Sand, was published in 2023. She has also published two pamphlets, Vital Capacity and A Dovetail of Breath. Winning the competition “will give me more confidence with my writing going forward in terms of experimenting and trying out new things”. She is working on a second collection.All the poems were read anonymously by a judging panel comprising Romalyn Ante, John McAuliffe and Stephen Sexton, who described the winning poem as “very impressive, ingenious and affecting”.Matt Barnard was named as the runner-up, winning £2,000, while third place went to Sorrel Briggs, who receives £1,000. The top three poems will be published in the spring 2025 issue of the Poetry Society’s journal,The Poetry Review.Seven commended poets, winning £500 each, are Yong-Yu Huang, Lee Knapper, Hannah Perrin King, Lesley Sharpe, Chris Beckett, Kit Buchan and Andrew Dennison.Past winners of the competition include Carol Ann Duffy, Sinéad Morrissey, James Berry and Tony Harrison. Last year, Imogen Wadewon the awardfor a poem inspired by her experience being mugged in New York. The competition will next open in June.Absence has a grammarI am learning to use the abessivecase as if I were Finnish,to indicate that what I missis so much a part of methat its loss is structural.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Or if they want the Olympics at all.Before the 2024 state election campaign, both major parties held focus groups that found broadly similar conclusions. People in Brisbane supported the idea of hosting the Olympics (those outside the capital largely did not), but no one wanted to spend significant public money or construction efforts on Games venues, at a time when housing supply had reached a critical point.1:34Brisbane is no 'hillbilly town', insists 2032 Olympic chief Andrew Liveris from Paris – videoThe International Olympic Committee also seemed to recognise the risk it might be “on the nose” if a host city pressed ahead with expensive, unpopular construction plans.The state government’s solution last year – converting the suburban Queensland Sports and Athletics Centre (Qsac) into a boutique athletics venue – brought forth another, competing anxiety.In Paris, Games events were held against the backdrop of some of the world’s most recognisable landmarks. In Los Angeles, the Olympic flame would be set alight atop the LA Coliseum.Qsac, built in the 1980s for the Commonwealth Games, was built next to a cemetery. Across the road is a self-storage business and a liquidated furniture outlet. There is very little public transport nearby.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThese contrasting worries – not spending too much money on new venues; not embarrassing ourselves alongside Paris and LA – are unlikely to be resolved by building a bigger, better stadium. They need a deeper reckoning.After Paris 2024’s stupendous opening ceremony, how the hell will Brisbane 2032 compete? | Andrew MessengerRead moreThe moniker of “Olympic city” does not, by itself, transform a place. The “Brown Snake” is notthe Seine(though it is roughly the same colour). Bowen Hills is not Beverly Hills.One of the things Brisbaneites love about their city is that it is something otherthan a global metropolis. Those not born in Brisbane – but who choose to live here – often do so because it is “not Sydney”.Hosting the Olympics is only going to be successful if it reflects Brisbane; not some half-baked imitation of a larger city with a functioning public transport network and a clear understanding of its identity.The International Olympic Committee has been clear – it wants the Olympics to adapt to the host city, not the host city to alter itself for the Olympics.But what is missing is a clear vision – from political leaders, from both sides of politics, who have tied themselves in knots and put planning years behind schedule – about what a Brisbane Games looks like.Does it look like paving the inner-city’s largest green space to build a stadium so that we aren’t, as the deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, said when launching the state’s latest venues review, “embarrassed” when compared with LA and Paris?Brisbane’s reluctance to craft an Olympics that is unique to the city – not just an imitation of a bigger one – speaks to a lack of political courage, vision and belief that our place is worthy of hosting the Games.The state of playThe premier, David Crisafulli, has placed a great deal of capital in the idea that he’s the sort of person who keeps his promises. On Tuesday, he’s likely going to break a big one.During the election campaign – knowing there was reluctance about the idea of building a new stadium – the new premier promised he would not. Instead there would be a 100-day venues review.LNP figures have long contemplated the situation. Crisafulli can argue his position was to support the review; the experts have said there is a need for a new stadium; and so he is acting responsibly by following their advice.But at the same time, the premier is also lobbying to ignore another key part of the venues review team’s advice – that the state push ahead with plans to construct a $2.5bn inner-city arena.View image in fullscreenPremier David Crisafulli.Photograph: Darren England/AAPDoing away with the arena would, as Crisafulli has argued internally, free up funding for the construction of a new stadium. It would also allow the state to talk about sporting legacy – building a purpose-built swimming centre, rather than an area with a temporary pool, would be a good outcome for the sport.But all this is politically untenable. It’s not possible to fall back on “taking the advice of experts” when you also ignore their advice when you want to do something else. The “broken promise” claims will follow Crisafulli until the next election.Few voters, particularly in regional Queensland, will buy the idea of a new stadium even if the government tries to argue it has saved money in other places.Should the IOC – which gave Brisbane 11 years to plan – be nervous about the state of affairs? There is enough time to get things back on track. But there is also little sign that any of the things that have derailed the process so far – provincial politics and the public unease – are going away any time soon.Opponents of the Victoria Park stadium plan say they’ve briefed barristers and could launch a legal challenge. They have amassed significant high-profile support. Local Indigenous elders say they oppose use of the wetland site, known as Barrambin.There is little doubt the IOC – when it devised its “new normal” process and awarded the Games to a smaller city like Brisbane – had envisaged something other than bulldozing parkland and building concrete over First Nations cultural heritage sites.Explore more on these topicsBrisbane Olympic Games 2032BrisbaneOlympic GamesQueenslandanalysisShareReuse this content"

Dozens of protesters had gathered outside the courthouse and shouted: “Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you.”After confirming his date and place of birth, the actor told the panel of three judges that he was prepared to answer the court’s questions. He is expected to testify on Tuesday.Depardieu – one of France’s most famous actors, who has made more than 200 films and TV series – is the highest-profile figure in the French film industry to face allegations of sexual assault since the #MeToo movement.Depardieu is charged with the sexual assault of a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant director during the shooting of the feature film Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in Paris in 2021. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000) if convicted.He is accused of sexually assaulting the set dresser on 10 September 2021 on the film set, allegedly trapping her between his legs before grabbing her buttocks, pubis and chest. She has said the actor also used obscene language and had to be pulled away by bodyguards.The set dresser’s lawyer told the court that several people had witnessed her being grabbed and “trapped against her will”. The set dresser had immediately spoken to senior colleagues who had suggested at the time that she go to the police. Her lawyer said a production manager recounted receiving a call from Depardieu at the time, saying he was sorry and it was “no longer the era to do that”. Depardieu’s lawyer denied this.Depardieu isalso charged with assaulting an assistant director both on set and in the street on 31 August and in September 2021, allegedly grabbing her buttocks and chest. The woman’s lawyer said she had told friends at the time that Depardieu had been touching her.Depardieu’s lawyer, Jérémie Assous, said the actor denied all charges. He told the panel of three judges: “Truth is on our side.”The judges dismissed demands by Depardieu’s defence that the case should be thrown out. They rejected Depardieu’s lawyer’s argument that the investigation was biased and aimed solely at “bringing Depardieu down”. The state prosecutor and the lawyers for the complainants told the court that the investigation into Depardieu was solid and the case must be heard.The trial had been postponed last Octoberafter lawyers warned of Depardieu’s ill health, saying he had undergone a quadruple heart bypass and had diabetes that was aggravated by the stress of the trial.Depardieu arrived in the courtroom looking strong and healthy. While waiting for the hearing to begin, he smiled, blew kisses and winked at friends and supporters. He smiled at the French actorFanny Ardant, who appeared briefly to confirm that she would give evidence later in the trial. Ardant, who acted in The Green Shutters, will speak in favour of Depardieu. Before the trial, she said she supported him because he was a friend.Medical experts subsequently ruled that Depardieu was well enough to stand trial this month, but with special provisions for his health: his court appearances would be limited to six-hour stints, with a 15-minute pause and snack every three hours. He would be seated but allowed to stand up if needed, must have private access to toilets, must be able to regularly control his blood sugar and eat a sweet snack if necessary.The trial is the first case against Depardieu to come to court. Overall, about 20 women have accused Depardieu of improper behaviour, but several cases have not been pursued because they exceeded the time limit for bringing a legal complaint.The French actor Charlotte Arnould was the first woman to file a criminal complaint against Depardieu, in 2018, alleging he raped and sexually assaulted her when she was 22 and Depardieu, a friend of her father, was almost 70. Last August, the Paris prosecutor’s office requested a trial for rape and sexual assault, but a trial date has not yet been set. In an open letter to Le Figaro in 2023, Depardieu denied the allegations, saying any encounter with Arnould had been consensual.Arnould watched from the public benches on Monday. Also among the public was the actor Anouk Grinberg, who appeared in The Green Shutters. Grinberg told Agence France-Presse before the trial that Depardieu had constantly made “salacious remarks” during shooting, and producers who hired him knew they were “hiring an abuser”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsGérard DepardieuFranceParisEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The agency hadaround 3,500 employeeswith an annual budget of $886m in 2024.“We have many coworkers in different services, several of whom came here and sought asylum visas. If their own government knew they worked for RFA [Radio Free Asia] and they went back to their own country, their lives would be at risk,” Jaewoo Park, a journalist for RFA, told the Guardian.“Authoritarian governments have praised what Trump is doing right now,” Park said. “In Burma, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, there were people who fought for freedom and democracy, and they came to work at RFA. It’s very risky for them. Their lives are in danger if Radio Free Asia doesn’t exist.”ChineseandRussianstate media have praised the cuts of the news agencies, with a Russian broadcastercallingthe cuts a “holiday” for Russian state media outlets.The shuttering of the agency was unexpected and has caused chaos for Park and others. “My wife is 28 weeks pregnant and we’re very concerned because I might go back to South Korea because I’m on a working visa. My wife is almost due and we just bought a home last year,” he added. “It’s very concerning and depressing.”But the impact of the decision will be felt globally, said Park. He cited Radio Free Asia’s broadcasts toNorth Koreawhich, he noted, defectors from North Korea have cited as an important source of independent news.“We know North Korea is a very oppressed country. They cannot hear anything other than the government press,” he said.Workers at Voice of America have also pointed out the risks and dangers posed to some employees on visas who may have to return to their home countries now their positions are in jeopardy.Two contributors for VoA arecurrently imprisonedin Myanmar and Vietnam and four contributors to Radio Free Asia are currently imprisoned in Vietnam. Russia, Belarus and Azerbaijan alsoreportedlyhave journalists affiliated with the news agencies currently imprisoned.“Dozens of VoA staffers in Washington are on J-1 visas [non-immigrant visas meant to encourage cultural exchange], and if they lose them, they may have to return to countries whose governments have a record of jailing critics,” wrote Liam Scott in the Columbia Journalism Review, a VoA journalist who was notified their contract would be terminated on 31 March. “Two Russian contractors on J-1 visas who are set to be officially terminated at the end of March are considered at significant risk of being imprisoned if they return toRussia, according to a VoA staffer with knowledge of the situation.”Stanislav Aseyev, a Ukrainian journalist, shared in aposton X that he wastorturedfor writing forRadio Libertyafter being told it was an “enemy” of Russia.“Now, the ‘enemy of Russia’ is being destroyed by America itself, and my torture seems doubly in vain,” he wrote.A VOA employee who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian: “Screwing over the people who worked for them and helped them, reminds me of what happened toAfghan interpreters.” Following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Afghan interpreters for the US military wereleft behind, stranded and in danger while trying to obtain special visas to escape to the US.“It would be an even bigger shame if people that sacrificed for our country were thrown under the bus. It’s a tremendous own goal in terms of US foreign policy and US national interests,” they said.Federal workers, journalists and labor unions filed alawsuitlast week against the US Agency for Global Media over the shuttering of the agency by the Trump administration, seeking immediate relief to reverse it.Donald Trumpissuedan executive order to defund the US Agency for Global Media, on 14 March. Kari Lake, a former TV anchor, formallyjoinedVoice of America as special adviser in late February 2025.Lake lost the 2022 election for governor of Arizona and a 2024 US Senate race in Arizona as the Republican nominee. Sheclaimedthe 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump and filed lawsuits claiming her 2022 election bid was also stolen from her. Those lawsuits weredismissedand her lawyers wererecently orderedby a federal court to pay $122,000 in legal fees to Maricopa County for the “frivolous” lawsuits.Lake claimed in apress releasethat the agency was “not salvageable” and accused it of “massive national security violations, including spies and terrorist sympathizers and/or supporters infiltrating the agency”.The US state department and US Agency for Global Media did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Asked about the visa and immigration statuses for workers at the news agencies during a press briefing on 21 March, state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “I have the question out to the secretary. It’s something that I’m following up with as well. He’s a busy guy.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsNorth KoreaChinaRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But uncertainty remains over how and when the partial ceasefire would take effect – and whether its scope would extend beyond energy infrastructure to include other critical sites, such as hospitals, bridges, and vital utilities.US officialsheld initial talks with Ukraine on Sunday eveningand negotiated separately with Russia on Monday, with most meetings taking place at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh. Monday’s talks were still going after more than eight hours, according to Russian state media.The limited ceasefire in Ukraine: what has been agreed and how will it work?Read moreThe US is expected to shuttle between the two countries to finalise details and negotiate separate measures to ensure the safety of shipping in the Black Sea. “The ultimate goal is a 30-day ceasefire, during which time we discuss a permanent ceasefire. We’re not far away from that,” said the US special envoy Steve Witkoff in a podcast with the far-right commentator Tucker Carlson over the weekend.Moscow meanwhile appears to be exploiting the window before any ceasefire takes hold, launching mass drone attacks onUkraineon Monday. Ukrainian officials said that a Russian missile had also damaged a school and a hospital in Ukraine’s north-eastern city of Sumy, wounding at least 74 people including 13 children.“Moscow speaks of peace while carrying out brutal strikes on densely populated residential areas in major Ukrainian cities,” the country’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said. “Instead of making hollow statements about peace,Russiamust stop bombing our cities and end its war on civilians.”The Ukrainian and US delegations on Sunday discussed proposals to protect energy facilities and critical infrastructure, Ukraine’s defence minister said.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said his country’s delegation to Sunday’s talks was working in “a completely constructive manner”, adding: “The conversation is quite useful, the work of the delegations is continuing.”Zelenskyy earlier said he would hand the US a list of energy infrastructure that would be off-limits for strikes by the Russian military.Map of Russian-controlled areas in Ukraine and claimed Ukrainian advances in RussiaThe Ukrainian delegation could hold additional discussions with US officials on Monday. “We are implementing the president of Ukraine’s directive to bring a just peace closer and to strengthen security,” Rustem Umerov, the Ukrainian defence minister who heads the country’s delegation, said on Facebook.Russia is represented in the talksby Sergey Beseda, a secretive adviser to Russia’s FSB services and Grigory Karasin, a former diplomat who negotiated the 2014 Minsk accords between Russia and Ukraine.As the Russia-US talks began in Riyadh, Trump said he expected Washington and Kyiv to sign a revenue-sharing agreement on Ukrainian critical minerals soon.Trump also told reporters the US was talking to Ukraine about the potential for its firms to own Ukrainian power plants.Ukrainian officials have backed the signing of a minerals deal, but Zelenskyy has publicly rejected the idea of US firms owning Ukrainian power plants.The lead-up to the talks was marked by a series of controversial pro-Russian statements by Witkoff – tapped by Trump as his personal envoy to Putin – in which he appeared to legitimise Russia’s staged referendums in four Ukrainian regions.Speaking with Carlson, Witkoff claimed that in the four regionswhere Moscow held widely condemned referendumson joining Russia, “the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their annexation marked the largest forcible seizure of territory inEuropesince the second world war.In the interview with Carlson, Witkoff also claimed Putin had commissioned a portrait of Trump “by a leading Russian painter” that the envoy had brought back with him after a trip to Moscow.Witkoff went on to say that after the assassination attempt on Trump last July, Putin told him that he visited his local church, met his priest and prayed for Trump. “Not because he was the president of the United States or could become the president of the United States, but because he had a friendship with him and he was praying for his friend,” Witkoff said.“I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy. That is a complicated situation, that war and all the ingredients that led up to it,” he added.Witkoff’s willingness to echo Kremlin talking points and his praise for Putin are likely to heighten anxiety in Ukraine and across European capitals.In an interview with Time magazine published on Monday but conducted before Witkoff’s remarks, Zelenskyy said some US officials had begun to take Putin at his word even when it contradicted their own intelligence.“I believe Russia has managed to influence some people on the White House team through information,” he said. “Their signal to the Americans was that the Ukrainians do not want to end the war, and something should be done to force them.”Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on what would be acceptable terms for a peace treaty, with no sign that Putin has relinquished any of his maximalist aims in the war against Ukraine.Moscow has set out several maximalist conditions for any long-term settlement – most of which are non-starters for Kyiv and its European allies. These include a halt to all foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, restrictions on the size of its armed forces, and international recognition of the four Ukrainian regions Russia illegally annexed following staged referendums in 2022.The Kremlin has also signalled it would reject any presence of western troops in Ukraine – something Kyiv views as essential to securing lasting security guarantees.Ukraine remains deeply sceptical of any Russian agreement, pointing to past instances where Moscow failed to honour its commitments.Explore more on these topicsUkraineTrump administrationRussiaSaudi ArabiaDonald TrumpUS politicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The mayor of Turkey’s largest city – a longtime rival of the president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan– issued a video message to his supporters, filming himself as he put on a crisp white shirt and tie to be dressed for his detention.“A small group is trying to usurp the will of the people,” he said. “I will stand strong.”Days later, İmamoğlu was officially arrested on corruption charges and taken to a high-security prison on the edge of the city he has governed since 2019. Turkey’s interior ministry then removed İmamoğlu from office, even as the Republican People’s party (CHP) nominated him as its candidate for president at the next election after a primary vote.Party officials said 15 million people cast a ballot, boasting that the overwhelming majority were from non-party members. Since İmamoğlu’s detention, tens of thousands of people filled the streets around Istanbul’s city hall as part of nightly demonstrations that have quickly taken hold in many places far beyond traditional CHP areas.This includes people in İmamoğlu’s hometown of Trabzon, part of the coastal Black Sea region where Erdoğan has his roots and some of his strongest support. Local media showedcrowds marching through the street holding masks of İmamoğlu’s faceover the weekend, as CHP politicians called praised him as “Trabzon’s son” and “a brother to all of us”.It is this kind of grassroots support for İmamoğlu in Erdoğan’s heartland that has cemented the affable 54-year-old former businessman as the president’s main rival, and the only politician capable of challenging him at the ballot box. İmamoğlu has often rebuffed observations about the parallels between him and Erdoğan, calling himself a staunch social democrat with no further similarities to the president other than their shared heritage and love of football.But İmamoğlu’s detention has only provided another opportunity for his story to parallel Erdoğan’s, one that risks undermining the Turkish president in the long run. Erdoğan became the mayor of Istanbul in the mid-1990s, before he was jailed for reading a poem, emerging from prison to galvanise his status as a politician worthy of the national stage, overcoming a ban from politics to become prime minister just four years after his release.“We are reliving the political dramas of the 1990s where Erdoğan was targeted by the state, except this time Erdoğan has become the state,” said Soner Cagaptay, a biographer of Erdoğan and an analyst with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.“İmamoğlu is the new Erdoğan,” he said, adding that jailing his rival could backfire for the Turkish president.Dr Ziya Meral, a lecturer at Soas University of London, said: “Erdoğan frequently uses the expression that if you win Istanbul you win the nation, and it echoes his own political career.View image in fullscreenA billboard displays a picture of Ekrem İmamoğlu in Istanbul.Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters“It means if you can do a good job as Istanbul mayor, win the trust of people and deliver for them, then a national victory is much more likely, and there’s an element of that with İmamoğlu.”The Turkish authorities have long sought to make İmamoğlu’s rule more difficult, including annulling his first election victory in 2019 before he won a second vote with a larger margin. İmamoğlu was later served a political ban and jail time, accused of insulting election officials after his initial victory, which he fought with a prolonged appeal.But governing Turkey’s largest city has been fraught with obstacles, including the government blocking many of Imamoğlu’s policies that required federal approval, and Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party fighting the mayor on everything, from taxis to metro lines.“All our decisions are being blocked,” he said in an interview three years ago, deftly batting away questions about his presidential ambitions or the cost of the wristwatch he normally wears that he said is intended as an inheritance for his son.“İmamoğlu has a lot of political charm with the voters, he’s really personable. He comes across as friendly, and quick-witted,” said Meral. “He has wide appeal, and his more accommodating in his outlook compared to other candidates from the CHP.”With İmamoğlu now seen as “the victim of a political campaign”, Meral added, this could increase his support, even among unlikely supporters of the opposition.What İmamoğlu’s presidential run could look like from detention remains unclear. An election is due in 2028, although an early vote is expected.Feting his newfound nomination, İmamoğlu issued a message from prison to his supporters, one equally intended for his jailers: “This extraordinary moment has terrified a small group of ill-intentioned people. They are right to be terrified.”Explore more on these topicsTurkeyEuropeRecep Tayyip ErdoğanprofilesShareReuse this content"

It was not clear why.In a statement the IDF said there was a violent confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis after “terrorists” threw rocks at Israeli citizens.“IDF and Israeli Police forces arrived to disperse the confrontation, at this point, several terrorists began hurling rocks at the security forces,” the statement said.“The forces apprehended three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at them, as well as an Israeli civilian involved in the violent confrontation. The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israel Police.”Basel Adra, another of No Other Land’s four directors, who are all from Israel and Palestine, told the Guardian he thought the escalating settler violence might be a response to the international recognition won by the documentary.“Palestinians in the village have been under physical attack by settlers almost daily. The settlers’ violence is increasing here. Maybe it’s a revenge for the movie and the Oscar,” he said.Adra, who witnessed the attack in Susya described the violence as “horrific”. “There were dozens of settlers together with the Israeli soldiers and they were threatening us with weapons,” he said. “The police were there from the beginning and did not intervene. While the soldiers were pointing their weapons at us, the settlers started attacking the houses of the Palestinians.“Hamdan tried to protect his family and the settlers attacked him. Soldiers started shooting in the air to prevent anyone to help Hamdan. He was shouting for help. They let the settlers attack him and then the army abducted him.”Nasser’s Israeli co-director Yuval Abraham posted on X: “A group of settlers just lynched Hamdan Ballal, co director of our film no other land. They beat him and he has injuries in his head and stomach, bleeding. Soldiers invaded the ambulance he called, and took him. No sign of him since.”This is not the first time that directors and member of crew ofNo Other Landhave been attacked by settlers.Last February,Adrawas also surrounded and attacked by masked Israeli settlers.Earlier on Monday,Adrawrote on X that “armed and masked settlers” were “leading a terror attack onMasafer Yatta” as he was writing.“Dozens of settlers arrived at my friend Naser’s house in Susya, throwing stones at his home, smashing his vehicle, and slashing [the vehicle’s tyres with knives],” he added.“We risked our life to film,” he said, noting that “soldiers are ordering us to stay inside our homes in the village, while those who attack and could’ve slaughtered the residents in their homes roam freely, masked, around the village”.Israel’s culture minister has called the Oscar win for the joint Palestinian-Israeli documentary “a sad moment for the world of cinema”.Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelNo Other LandDocumentary filmsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Three other hospitals had earlier reported 25 deaths from Israeli strikes overnight and into Monday.1:03Israeli strike at Gaza hospital leaves several dead including Hamas political leader – videoThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians.In a separate Israeli airstrike on Sunday night, the Nasser hospital, the largest medical facility in southern Gaza, was hit, killing five people, including aHamaspolitical leader.The Israeli military said its attack followed extensive intelligence and used precise munitions to minimise harm at the site.Hamas confirmed that a member of its political office, Ismail Barhoum, had been killed. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, confirmed the target was Barhoum.Hamas’s al-Aqsa TV said Barhoum was being treated at the hospital for wounds sustained in a previous attack. Another Hamas leader, Salah al-Bardawil, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Khan Younis on Sunday. Both Bardawil and Barhoum were members of the 19-member political office, the group’s decision-making body, 11 of whom have been killed since the start of the war in late 2023, according to Hamas sources.Sunday’s strike on Nasser hospital was the second on a health facility in Gaza in three days. On Friday, Israel blew up central Gaza’sTurkish-Palestinian Friendship hospital, Gaza’s only specialised cancer treatment hospital, which had already been severely damaged by Israeli airstrikes since October 2023.Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan, a volunteer in a Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) team working at Nasser hospital, said medics in the emergency department were awaiting casualties when a massive blast shook the building.“Everybody ran out to see what happened until one of my colleagues screamed ‘They hit surgery,’ Haj-Hassan said in a voice message. “There was so much smoke and fire. I ran across to the building next door, where the paediatric ICU is, just to grab my portable ultrasounds and a few things, knowing that we’d be receiving casualties.“As I walked out, I could see the second floor of the building on fire.”Steve Cutts, the chief executive of MAP, said the attack “demonstrates once again that nowhere is safe in Gaza”.Cutts said a 16-year-old boy recovering from earlier surgery was also killed and at least eight people, including medical staff, were injured.The International Committee of the Red Cross said its office in the southern Gaza Strip was damaged by an explosive projectile on Monday, adding that no staff were wounded.Gaza’s ceasefire brought hope, but it was the calm before a brutal stormRead moreThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said the aim of the war was to destroy Hamas as a military and governing entity. The ambition of the new campaign was to force the group to give up the remaining hostages, he said last week.On Monday, Hamas’s armed wing released a video showing two Israeli hostages held in Gaza since the Palestinian militants’ attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.The footage, which lasts a little over three minutes and whose exact recording date could not be verified, shows two men sitting on the floor speaking in Hebrew to a hostage who has since been released, asking him to recount his experiences in captivity in order to speed up their release.Meanwhile, officials say Egypt has introduced a new proposal to try to get the Gaza ceasefire back on track.According to the plan, Hamas would release five living hostages, including an American-Israeli, in return for Israel allowing humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and a weeks-long pause in the fighting, an Egyptian official said Monday. Israel would also release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.A Hamas official said the group had “responded positively” to the proposal, without elaborating.The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 50,082 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and another 113,408 have been wounded, since the beginning of the war, triggered by an attack by Hamas militants in Israel in October 2023 in which they killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Hospitals must be protected and healthcare must not be a target.”He called for attacks on Palestinian health facilities to be investigated and “any perpetrators held to account”.Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as hiding places for weapons and command centres, a charge the Palestinian militant group denies.Palestinians in Gaza have again been fleeing for their lives afterIsrael launched its new offensive in the territory, which started on Tuesday witha wave of airstrikes that killed more than 400 people, mostly civilians, ending two months of relative calm.On Sunday, Palestinian officials said the total death toll from nearly 18 months of conflict had passed 50,000. The Israeli military said it did its best to reduce harm to civilians and questioned the death toll provided by health authorities in the Hamas-run territory. Most of the dead in Gaza have been civilians, according to health officials. Israel said they included about 20,000 fighters. Hamas does not disclose casualty figures.Another Hamas leader, Salah al-Bardawil, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Khan Younis on Sunday. Both Bardawil and Barhoum were members of the 19-member political office, the group’s decision-making body, 11 of whom have been killed since the start of the war in late 2023, according to Hamas sources.Signalling it could escalate its actions further, on Sunday the Israeli military said one of its divisions that had operated in Lebanon, where Israel fought Hamas’s Iranian-backed ally, Hezbollah, was preparing for possible action in Gaza. It distributed a video of tanks unloaded in a field and a caption that read: “Preparations of the 36th division for operations in the Gaza Strip.”The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said the aim of the war was to destroy Hamas as a military and governing entity. The ambition of the new campaign was to force the group to give up the remaining hostages, he said on Tuesday.Large protests have been taking place in Israel, with more than 100,000 demonstrating against efforts by Netanyahu to fire both thehead of the internal security service, Ronen Bar, and the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara.Bar, as the head of the Shin Bet, has been investigating Netanyahu’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including allegations of leaking classified documents to foreign media and taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.Baharav-Miara, who has frequently clashed with the government, warned the prime minister he could not fire the domestic intelligence chief before her office had reviewed his motives for doing so.In an unprecedented step on Sunday, after accusing her of blocking the government’s policies, Israel’s cabinet voted unanimously in favour of a no-confidence motion against Baharav-Miara.After the vote, the justice minister, Yariv Levin, called on her to resign.Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet in recent months, the 25-year-old finance analyst from northern Tehran says that she never knows who could be watching her every move.She says she has received messages from the police before warning her of suspected violations of the country’s strict hijab laws, but last November she was sent an SMS message containing her car registration plate that stated the exact time and place that she had been recorded driving without her head properly covered. Next time it happened, the SMS warned, her car would be impounded.“It was really unsettling,” she says.“When you receive these messages you don’t know who has reported you – and the police never seem to have proof of the violation.”After widespread outcry last year, the Iranian authorities said they would suspend enforcement of the new, strict, hijab laws, which impose draconian penalties – including fines and prison sentences – on women found in breach of the mandatory dress code.Many of us have stopped wearing the hijab, despite these intimidation tacticsDaryaYet women in Iran are reporting that state surveillance has been steadily increasing.Last week, the UN’s fact-finding missionreportedonIran’s increasing reliance on digital surveillancesuch as its Nazer mobile application, a state-backed reporting platform that allows citizens and police to report women for alleged violations.The app is accessible only via Iran’s state-controlledNational Information Network. Members of the public can apply to become “hijab monitors” to get the app and begin filing reports, which are then passed to the police.According to the UN mission, the app has recently been expanded to allow users to upload the time, location and licence plate of a car in which a woman has been seen without a hijab.It can also now be used to report women for hijab violations on public transport, in taxis and even in ambulances.According to the UN report, aerial surveillance using drones has also been used at events such as the Tehran international book fair and on the island of Kish, a tourist destination, to identify women not complying with the hijab law.The government has also increased online monitoring, blocking women’s Instagram accounts for non-compliance of hijab laws, and issuing warnings via text message. CCTV surveillance and facial-recognition technology has also been installed at universities. “This ‘digital repression’ is not only stifling academic freedom but also causing increased psychological stress among students,” says a spokesperson for the Amirkabir Newsletter, an Iranian student media group.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Few comedians inIndiadare to make political jokes for risk of a backlash.Kamra’s standup routine, performed in Mumbai’s well-known Habitat comedy club on Friday night, included a parody song about Eknath Shinde, the second most powerful figure in the Maharashtra state government.The song referred to the deputy chief minister as a “gaddar”, meaning traitor, a reference to him switching his political allegiance in 2022 and helping to bring down the previous state government.Indian comedian Vir Das accused of ‘vilifying nation’Read moreAn online video of the routine prompted criticism from the leaders of Shinde’s Shiv Sena party. On Sunday night about 20 Shiv Sena supporters descended on Habitat and began to smash it apart, throwing chairs, tearing down posters and breaking light fittings.The police have arrested more than 10 people for the incident, including the leader of Shiv Sena’s youth faction, Rahul Kanal.The Shiv Sena-led government sought to blame Kamra for the violence. Maharastra’s chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, claimed in the state assembly on Monday that people were free to perform standup comedy but added that “freedom of expression has its own limitations. You cannot insult anyone”.“There is no need to spare them,” said Fadnavis. “We will not tolerate this and we will teach them a lesson.”View image in fullscreenPosters and rubbish bags scattered outside the Habitat comedy club on Monday.Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APThe state home minister, Yogesh Kadam, said the police were trying to trace Kamra and that the government would investigate his phone records and look into his bank account transactions to prove whether there was a “mastermind” or political conspiracy behind his jokes.Shiv Sena also filed police cases against Kamra for defamation and public mischief.In a statement on Monday night, Kamra said he would not apologise, emphasising that “as far as I know, it is not against the law to poke fun at our leaders and the circus that is our political system.”He added: “I don’t fear this mob and I will not be hiding under my bed, waiting for this to die down.”My Statement -pic.twitter.com/QZ6NchIcsM— Kunal Kamra (@kunalkamra88)March 24, 2025Ministers also claimed that the Habitat comedy club was “illegal”. A demolition team from the local municipal council arrived at the venue on Monday and began demolishing part of the building on the grounds that part of it had been illegally constructed.In a statement on Monday, the venue said it was “shocked, worried and extremely broken by the recent acts of vandalism targeting us. We have never been involved in the content performed by any artist”.The venue said it was shutting down until “we figure out the best way to provide a platform for free expression without putting ourselves and our property in jeopardy”.Comedians and comedy venues have increasingly been caught in the crosshairs of India’s shrinking space for freedom of expression since the rise of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, which has ruled for more than a decade. In Maharastra, Shiv Sena rules the state government in coalition with the BJP.In 2021,a Muslim comedian was detained by policefor weeks for alleged “vulgar” jokes insulting Hindu gods despite never having performed at the show. In the same year, the comedian Vir Das faced a backlash and police reports after a comedy monologue that dealt with politically sensitive issues.Opposition politicians in Maharashtra condemned the violence and retaliation against Kamra. Shinde’s former political ally, Aaditya Thackeray, said “only an insecure coward” would react in such a way to a comedy song.Explore more on these topicsIndiaFreedom of speechComedyMumbaiSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

She has denied all wrongdoing.Now MPs fear that Britain’s efforts to assist Bangladesh could be further clouded by an apparent smear campaign against Mansur involving news articles by fake journalists.MPs in the 47-strong all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on responsible tax and corruption received emails before a session on Monday with Mansur. The sender, who claimed to be a journalist, sent links to a website called International Policy Digest, featuring articles about apparent displays of wealth by Mansur’s daughter and questioning why she was not being investigated.Neither of the articles’ supposed authors appears to have any other profile as a journalist. The Guardian found that pictures of them were actually stock images.Mansur and MPs in the group raised concerns that the emails were part of a concerted disinformation campaign.Mansur, a former IMF official, who previously lived and worked in Washington, said he believed that people under investigation for money laundering were trying to “diminish my reputation and target me in various ways”.He added that his daughter was a US citizen who had little to do with Bangladesh.One APPG member, Rupa Huq, received a separate email from a UK public relations firm called Palatine Communications, also linking to International Policy Digest.The email said that if Mansur was prepared to “impugn the integrity of Tulip Siddiq” then he and his family should also face scrutiny.Mansur said he had never made any comments about Siddiq.However, he is a key figure in the transitional government led by Mohammad Yunus, whoseACCaccused Siddiq, along with her family members, amid an investigation into a 2013 deal with Russia that allegedly overinflated the price of a nuclear power plant.Huq said it was “highly unusual” to receive such an email and compared it to demonstrations that have targeted her speaking about Bangladesh in parliament. She said both were “designed to intimidate and interfere with parliament and MPs’ normal work”.Members of the APPG are understood to have referred the emails to parliamentary cyber security advisers, as well as to the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, which isinvestigating disinformation.“If it is the case that this communication is an attempt to mislead UK politicians when it comes to a very serious corruption scandal, then I think we should be very concerned,” said APPG member Phil Brickell.“I urge the relevant parliamentary authorities to investigate thoroughly – we must get to the bottom of who paid for this, and why, in order to understand how we can best protect ourselves.”A spokesperson for Palatine Communications said: “Our client instructions are confidential. In sending the email in question, we acted on our own initiative.“We have nothing to do with, and know nothing of, the authorship of this article, but nor did we ever claim it represented the gospel truth. Like numerous articles from many media outlets, it raises legitimate concerns about the current situation in Bangladesh that we believe are worthy of MPs’ consideration.”A spokesperson for International Policy Digest said the person who had actually written the articles had “wished to remain anonymous”, adding that they were confident that the content was “fairly accurate”.Explore more on these topicsHouse of CommonsBangladeshSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

But in some of these situations that’s the only course once you’ve gone through everything else.”Wicking also criticised the west London airport’s communication. He said it was “appalling” that airlines had to wait until midnight on Friday to confirm terminal 2 would open on Saturday.Wicking added the situation was “not justifiable given the amount of money that has been spent on Heathrow over the years and the fact that it is the most expensive airport in the world”.By mid-afternoon on Friday, the airport had told all airlines tobegin preparations for a full schedule on Saturday, the Guardian understands.Wicking also called for an independent investigation into what happened and the length of time it took for flights to resume.An internal review of the airport’s crisis management plans and its response will be undertaken by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, who is an independent member of Heathrow’s board.On Saturday, the energy secretary, Ed Miliband,ordered an investigation into the power outagewhich will be led by the National Energy System Operator.A Heathrow spokesperson told the Guardian on Monday: “This was an unprecedented issue which began with a fire at an off-airport substation, in less than 24 hours the entire airport was rebooted from a standing start and we delivered a full schedule from Saturday onwards.“There are two reviews into the systems and response both at Heathrow and with the wider grid infrastructure.“We will support these and lessons will be learned where needed. Every penny we invest in our airport infrastructure is approved by airlines and our regulator. On a project-by-project basis, they oversee and influence how we build and maintain Heathrow.”Heathrow is Europe’s largest airport, with more than 83.9 million passengers travelling through its terminals in 2024.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportAir transportTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

Therefore, we are withdrawing it from the removal programme.“We understand the importance of maintaining reliable communication options, especially in areas where mobile service is lacking. The payphone has proven to be a vital resource for residents, ensuring that they have access to emergency services and can stay connected.“Our decision reflects our commitment to supporting the community’s needs and ensuring that essential services remain accessible.”Harris was born in 1935, the same year that the K6 style of red phone box was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. It went into production in 1936, becoming a familiar sight across the UK in just a few years.Linda Jennings, from Brinton and Sharrington parish council, said: “It’s fantastic, the ‘normal man’ has won over the big company. We are all very pleased. It’s really good that BT has backed down.“The mobile phone signal is really poor, it’s a lifeline for people. If you can’t get a signal there, you need these phone boxes. We have a parish council meeting on Thursday, Derek will get a big pat on the back.”Last month,Harris told the Guardian of the need for the phone box to remain.“We live next to perhaps the most beautiful part of Norfolk, the tranquil Glaven Valley with a pure chalk stream running through it,” he said. “It attracts ramblers, walkers, the lot, and everyone knows that there’s a working kiosk.”In the event of an emergency and the mobile network being down, he added, “Wouldn’t it be awful if someone said: ‘If only they had kept that working kiosk’?“What you have to bear in mind is the few calls that have been made have been vital, they’ve probably saved someone’s life. Not that long ago, there was a snowstorm.”On that occasion, the mobile network was down and the call someone made from the phone box “was the only way that rescue came to save this driver whose car was completely covered in snow – it fell off the top of the hedgerows on to his car, and he was trapped.”Explore more on these topicsNorfolkEnglandBTHeritageCommunitiesTelecommunications industryTelecomsnewsShareReuse this content"

But uncertainty remains over how and when the partial ceasefire would take effect – and whether its scope would extend beyond energy infrastructure to include other critical sites, such as hospitals, bridges and vital utilities.US officialsheld initial talks with Ukraine on Sunday eveningand negotiated separately with Russia on Monday, with most meetings taking place at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh.The US is expected to shuttle between the two countries to finalise details and negotiate separate measures to ensure the safety of shipping in the Black Sea. “The ultimate goal is a 30-day ceasefire, during which time we discuss a permanent ceasefire. We’re not far away from that,” said the US special envoy Steve Witkoff in a podcast with the far-right commentator Tucker Carlson over the weekend.As the Russia-US talks began in Riyadh, Trump said he expected Washington and Kyiv to sign a revenue-sharing agreement on Ukrainian critical minerals soon.Trump also told reporters the US was talking to Ukraine about the potential for its firms to own Ukrainian power plants.Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump listed issues he said were on the table: “We’re talking about territory right now. We’re talking about lines of demarcation, talking about power, power-plant ownership.”Ukrainian officials have backed the signing of a minerals deal, but Zelenskyy has publicly rejected the idea of US firms owning Ukrainian power plants.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy meeting with commanders of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Ukraine and Russia have agreed in principle to a one-month halt on strikes on energy infrastructure.Photograph: Presidential Press Service Handout Handout/EPAThe lead-up to the talks was marked by a series of pro-Russian statements by Witkoff – tapped by Trump as his personal envoy to Putin – in which he appeared to legitimise Russia’s staged referendums in four Ukrainian regions.Speaking with Carlson, Witkoff claimed that in the four regionswhere Moscow held widely condemned referendumson joining Russia, “the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule”.The referendums in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces were widely rebuked in the west as illegitimate and are viewed as a thinly veiled attempt to justify Russia’s illegal annexation of the regions. Their annexation marked the largest forcible seizure of territory in Europe since the second world war.In the interview with Carlson, Witkoff also claimed Putin had commissioned a portrait of Trump “by a leading Russian painter” that the envoy had brought back with him after a trip to Moscow.Witkoff went on to say that after the assassination attempt on Trump last July, Putin told him that he visited his local church, met his priest and prayed for Trump. “Not because he was the president of the United States or could become the president of the United States, but because he had a friendship with him and he was praying for his friend,” Witkoff said.“I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy. That is a complicated situation, that war and all the ingredients that led up to it,” he added.Witkoff’s willingness to echo Kremlin talking points and his praise for Putin are likely to heighten anxiety in Ukraine and across European capitals.In an interview with Time magazine published on Monday but conducted before Witkoff’s remarks, Zelenskyy said some US officials had begun to take Putin at his word even when it contradicted their own intelligence.“I believe Russia has managed to influence some people on the White House team through information,” he said. “Their signal to the Americans was that the Ukrainians do not want to end the war, and something should be done to force them.”Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on what would be acceptable terms for a peace treaty, with no sign that Putin has relinquished any of his maximalist aims in the war against Ukraine.Moscow has set out several maximalist conditions for any long-term settlement – most of which are non-starters for Kyiv and its European allies. These include a halt to all foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, restrictions on the size of its armed forces, and international recognition of the four Ukrainian regions Russia illegally annexed following staged referendums in 2022.The Kremlin has also signalled it would reject any presence of western troops in Ukraine – something Kyiv views as essential to securing lasting security guarantees.Ukraine remains deeply sceptical of any Russian agreement, pointing to past instances where Moscow failed to honour its commitments.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

They have hired a search firm, he added.DeJoy has led a dramatic effort to restructure USPS over the last five years, including cutting forecast cumulative losses over a decade to $80bn from $160bn. The outgoing postal chief has used tactics similar to the Musk-led “department of government efficiency” (Doge) team, including shrinking the workforce and canceling or renegotiating contracts.Two media outlets reported last month that Trump was preparing to issue an executive order to fire the USPS’s board of governors.Musk said this month he thought USPS should be privatized.USPS, an agency with 635,000 employees that lost $9.5bn last year, has been exempt from Doge-directed federal employee reductions.The White House did not immediately comment on whether it had any involvement in DeJoy’s departure.

They can be triggered when you’re on the bottom of the slope and even the side or the top of a slope, because all you have to do is break that weak layer, and then that weak layer shoots out like dominoes and breaks into the slopes,” she said.The weak layer can be broken on a flat track, but that wouldn’t cause an avalanche because there is no slope for the snow to come down.“When we have avalanche conditions like this, as avalanche professionals, we recommend people just stay on slopes that aren’t steep enough to slide, and then they don’t have to worry about triggering an avalanche, and sadly, this person was not in that scenario,” Wagner said. “They were on the edge of the slope and ended up being caught.”The avalanche center has been warning people of this weak layer for weeks, and there were similar conditions on 4 March, whenthree heli-skiers were killed. That accident happened when they were caught in an avalanche near Girdwood, about 40 miles south of Anchorage.“It’s still unsafe,” Wagner said on Monday. “We are still recommending that people stick to the lower angle slopes because this is not something we want to mess with.”Explore more on these topicsAlaskaAvalanchesExtreme weatherUS weatherSnownewsShareReuse this content"

She has been pushing for a buyout since April last year but was rebuffed by 23andMe’s board.The company is still reeling from a huge data breach in 2023 thataffected the data of nearly 7 million people, about half of its customers. Revenues have fallen as many of its 15 million customersscrambleto delete their DNA data from the company’s archives.Over the weekend the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, urged the company’s users to ask it to “delete your data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company”.Mark Jensen, the company’s chair, said: “After a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, we have determined that a court-supervised sale process is the best path forward to maximise the value of the business.“We are committed to continuing to safeguard customer data and being transparent about the management of user data going forward, and data privacy will be an important consideration in any potential transaction.”Fighting for survival,23andMe has cut the jobs of 200 people, amounting to 40% of its workforce, and stopped development of all its therapies in November. Wojcicki’s ambition has been to turn the company into a drug developer.Wojcicki will be replaced by its chief financial officer, Joe Selsavage, until a permanent replacement is found but she is staying on the 23andMe board.She co-founded the business in 2006 with Linda Avey and Paul Cusenza. In apost on X, she said she was “disappointed” by the bankruptcy filing and that her bid to take the company private was rejected. She explained she had resigned “so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder”.She added: “If I am fortunate enough to secure the company’s assets through the restructuring process, I remain committed to our long-term vision of being a global leader in genetics.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why eggs – and their rising price – are an American obsessionAdam GabbattTrump used their price as a campaign issue but has been unable to stop costs rising. Why do eggs matter so much?Mon 24 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 10.14 EDTShareAs the Trump economy continues to perform with all the robustness and reliability ofa Tesla Cybertruck, one thing, above anything else, has come to be seen as a measure of how the US is faring: the humbleegg.The egg holds a uniquely central place in American culture, egg experts say, and the soaring price in recent months, largely due to a bird flu outbreak, has been discussed and debated across the country.About 30 million chickens have been culled due to the disease, making a mockery ofDonald Trump’s campaign trail promises to reduce grocery prices. Eggs cost 59% more in Februarycompared with a year earlier, and while the price has declined in recent days, the government has predicted egg costs will inch back up. But the egg focus raises the question: why has the egg become the de facto barometer for economic success in the US?“We all know that famous phrase from James Carville: ‘It’s the economy, stupid.’ This is like that, but, I suppose it’s the pedestrian, grounded version of that, without having to understand economics or anything like that. Everybody knows how much eggs cost,” said Clodagh Harrington, a lecturer in American politics at University College Cork.“They’re not steak, they’re not champagne, they’re not things that a lot of people will never have. And they’re not a kind of disgusting, low-budget, fast food either. They are considered, with some caveats, to be a reasonably healthy food option. So there’s a kind of a commonality there that everybody knows the price of eggs.”‘Eggflation’ sending US shoppers to Mexico – where $300 fines awaitRead moreThe ongoing egg price outrage could be seen as a political problem of Republicans’ own making. On the campaign trail Trumpstood in front of an arrayof groceries,Kim Jong-il style, and lamented that “grocery prices have skyrocketed”.“When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one,” Trump said.Later in the campaign, JD Vance held a press conference at a supermarket in Pennsylvania, where he wielded a carton of 12 eggs and complained that they cost $4. The stunt didn’t work as Vance intended – many people noticed that there was a sign behind himadvertising a dozen eggs for sale at $2.99– but it made clear that eggs could be an important political tool.As theTrump administrationseeks to fight the bad publicity around high egg prices, it has suggested some unusual solutions.Brooke Rollins, the secretary of agriculture, was dispatched to Fox News in early Marchto defend the price surge, and suggested that people combat prices by buying their own chickens and having them roam around their property.“People are sort of looking around and thinking: ‘Wow, maybe I could get a chicken in my back yard and it’s awesome,’” Rollins said. She provided no evidence that people were increasingly keeping chickens in their backyards as a result of the increase in egg prices, and the Guardian was unable to find any case studies.In a stark contrast to Trump’s nationalist policies, the government is now seeking to import eggs, and has asked Denmark and a variety of other European countries to help. In February the Turkish egg producers central unionsaidit would export 420m eggs to the US in 2025.But another solution to the crisis would be to just stop eating eggs. Why can’t Americans quit them?“There’s a kind of a classic aspect of the American breakfast: your coffee and your eggs,” Harrington said.“In Europe, maybe it’s not quite so much that. In Europe if you’re on the mainland, you might be having a croissant, if you’re in Britain or Ireland, you might be having something a bit more stodgy.“Even the diner culture, that’s something that we don’t really have over here. The second half of the 20th century, that classic imagery of the people in the diner, very often they were eating eggs. So that there’s a kind of a cultural touchstone element to it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

More than 90% of US households buy eggs, and it’s no surprise people are concerned, especially during periods of higher egg prices. We know people are frustrated, and we understand and share those concerns.”Metz said egg farmers were engaged in the “fight of their lives” against bird flu.“Egg farmers appreciate the patience their customers and consumers have shown during these challenging times. America’s egg farmers are working hard to protect their farms and birds so they can continue supplying the nutritious eggs Americans love,” she said.There have been signs that egg prices may be declining. Rollins claimed on Tuesday that the average price of a dozen eggs had declined by $1.85 since 26 February – althoughthe US Department of Agriculturereported on Thursday that the egg market was actually “slow to moderate”, and said that the price dip may be mostly due to people buying less.And Rollins herself warned that “we expect [the price of eggs] to perhaps inch back up” in the coming weeks, given demand for eggs is likely to increase as Easter approaches.While the fate of the US has been intertwined with the egg for generations, the prolonged love affair, for now, will continue to be strained.Explore more on these topicsUS newsEggsUS economyTrump administrationFoodBreakfastJD VanceanalysisShareReuse this content"

The agency hadaround 3,500 employeeswith an annual budget of $886m in 2024.“We have many coworkers in different services, several of whom came here and sought asylum visas. If their own government knew they worked for RFA [Radio Free Asia] and they went back to their own country, their lives would be at risk,” Jaewoo Park, a journalist for RFA, told the Guardian.“Authoritarian governments have praised what Trump is doing right now,” Park said. “In Burma, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, there were people who fought for freedom and democracy, and they came to work at RFA. It’s very risky for them. Their lives are in danger if Radio Free Asia doesn’t exist.”ChineseandRussianstate media have praised the cuts of the news agencies, with a Russian broadcastercallingthe cuts a “holiday” for Russian state media outlets.The shuttering of the agency was unexpected and has caused chaos for Park and others. “My wife is 28 weeks pregnant and we’re very concerned because I might go back to South Korea because I’m on a working visa. My wife is almost due and we just bought a home last year,” he added. “It’s very concerning and depressing.”But the impact of the decision will be felt globally, said Park. He cited Radio Free Asia’s broadcasts toNorth Koreawhich, he noted, defectors from North Korea have cited as an important source of independent news.“We know North Korea is a very oppressed country. They cannot hear anything other than the government press,” he said.Workers at Voice of America have also pointed out the risks and dangers posed to some employees on visas who may have to return to their home countries now their positions are in jeopardy.Two contributors for VoA arecurrently imprisonedin Myanmar and Vietnam and four contributors to Radio Free Asia are currently imprisoned in Vietnam. Russia, Belarus and Azerbaijan alsoreportedlyhave journalists affiliated with the news agencies currently imprisoned.“Dozens of VoA staffers in Washington are on J-1 visas [non-immigrant visas meant to encourage cultural exchange], and if they lose them, they may have to return to countries whose governments have a record of jailing critics,” wrote Liam Scott in the Columbia Journalism Review, a VoA journalist who was notified their contract would be terminated on 31 March. “Two Russian contractors on J-1 visas who are set to be officially terminated at the end of March are considered at significant risk of being imprisoned if they return toRussia, according to a VoA staffer with knowledge of the situation.”Stanislav Aseyev, a Ukrainian journalist, shared in aposton X that he wastorturedfor writing forRadio Libertyafter being told it was an “enemy” of Russia.“Now, the ‘enemy of Russia’ is being destroyed by America itself, and my torture seems doubly in vain,” he wrote.A VOA employee who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian: “Screwing over the people who worked for them and helped them, reminds me of what happened toAfghan interpreters.” Following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Afghan interpreters for the US military wereleft behind, stranded and in danger while trying to obtain special visas to escape to the US.“It would be an even bigger shame if people that sacrificed for our country were thrown under the bus. It’s a tremendous own goal in terms of US foreign policy and US national interests,” they said.Federal workers, journalists and labor unions filed alawsuitlast week against the US Agency for Global Media over the shuttering of the agency by the Trump administration, seeking immediate relief to reverse it.Donald Trumpissuedan executive order to defund the US Agency for Global Media, on 14 March. Kari Lake, a former TV anchor, formallyjoinedVoice of America as special adviser in late February 2025.Lake lost the 2022 election for governor of Arizona and a 2024 US Senate race in Arizona as the Republican nominee. Sheclaimedthe 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump and filed lawsuits claiming her 2022 election bid was also stolen from her. Those lawsuits weredismissedand her lawyers wererecently orderedby a federal court to pay $122,000 in legal fees to Maricopa County for the “frivolous” lawsuits.Lake claimed in apress releasethat the agency was “not salvageable” and accused it of “massive national security violations, including spies and terrorist sympathizers and/or supporters infiltrating the agency”.The US state department and US Agency for Global Media did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Asked about the visa and immigration statuses for workers at the news agencies during a press briefing on 21 March, state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “I have the question out to the secretary. It’s something that I’m following up with as well. He’s a busy guy.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsNorth KoreaChinaRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In January, itssales across Europe fell 45%, from 18,161 in 2024 to 9,945.Elon Musk tells Tesla employees to hold on to their stock amid harsh selloffRead moreHowever, in the UK the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported analmost 21% risein the number of new Tesla cars registered in February, with the Model 3 and Model Y proving the second and third most popular after the Mini Cooper.Analysts and investors have been attempting to assess what impact Musk’s political interventions are having on the carmaker, where he is chief executive, amid signs that his senior role in Trump’s administration is leading to a consumer backlash bysome Tesla ownersor prospective buyers. Tesla dealerships have also beenthe target of protests.The tech billionaire and close Trump adviser hasshown support for Germany’s far-right AfD party, theatrically brandished a “chainsaw of democracy” at a conservative conference, and accused Keir Starmer and other senior politicians ofcovering up the scandal about grooming gangs.However, analysts have said that the volatile sales are also likely to have been affected by Tesla’s overhaul of the Model Y.Felipe Muñoz, a global analyst at Jato Dynamics, said: “Tesla is experiencing a period of immense change. In addition to Elon Musk’s increasingly active role in politics and the increased competition it is facing within the EV market, the brand is phasing out the existing version of the Model Y – its bestselling vehicle – before it rolls out the update.“Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover.”The research company’s figures for February show that Tesla’s rivals powered ahead in Europe last month.Volkswagen reported a 180% increase in sales of battery electric vehicles to just under 20,000, while BMW and Mini sold a combined 19,000 such models last month.The Chinese-owned BYD recorded a 94% increase in sales in Europe to more than 4,000. Separate figures show that BYD’s global sales topped $100bn (£83bn) last year, overtaking Tesla as the world’s biggest electric car company by revenue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tesla reported annual revenues of $97.7bn last year.BYD also sells about the same number of electric vehicles as Tesla – 1.76m compared with 1.79m respectively in 2024. However, when sales of BYD’s other hybrid cars are included it is much larger.Polestar, which is primarily owned by Volvo’s parent company, Geely, recorded an 84% increase to more than 2,000 vehicles.BYD sold 4.27m vehicles last year, almost as many as the 4.5m sold by Ford, and has forecast that it will sell between 5m and 6m this year. The Hong Kong-listed company has a market value of about $160bn, up about 50% so far this year. Tesla is valued at $780bn despite a share-price plunge of more than a third in 2025. Tesla shares opened up 6% on Monday as the wider Nasdaq index rose nearly 2%.Total car sales in across the 25 EU markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 970,000 in February, while BEV registrations were up by a quarter.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskAutomotive industryDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

So we absolutely have no tax scams in this country. We’re very clear in terms of transparency,” he told RTÉ, adding the country had led the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revised tax agreement that increased Ireland’s corporate tax rate from 12.5% to 15%.Speaking on the All-In podcast, Lutnick was clear Dublin was in his sights. “We have to try and fix a whole bunch of these tax scams. Ireland is my favourite. The country of Ireland last year had a $60bn budget surplus. So [America] lose $2tn and they make $60[bn],” he said, significantly inflating Ireland’s actual surplus.In 2024, Ireland recorded a €25bn (£21bn) surplus that included the“transformational” Apple back tax windfall of €14bn– the result of a long-running tax battle.Official government data showed Ireland last year operated a trade deficit with the US of almost €93bn when goods and services were taken into account. It included a trade surplus in goods of about €70bn but a deficit in services amounting to €163bn.Trump has already said will introduce tariffs against the EU on 2 April, which he has described as “liberation day”.In ameeting with Ireland’s taoiseachin the Oval Office two weeks ago, he made it clear Ireland was in his sights, singling out the US pharmaceutical companies operating in Ireland that include Pfizer and Eli Lilly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It had been inevitable forEnglandagainst the team ranked 140 in the world. Is this the famous English arrogance? Maybe. What it was always going to be about was the manner of the victory. Whether there were any signs of Thomas Tuchel getting his messages across, sprinkling his magic.It was easy to enjoy the Mexican wave rippling around Wembley in the 75th minute, shortly after Harry Kane had made it 2-0 and just before Eberechi Eze, on as a substitute, made a few stepovers and watched his shot deflect in off theLatviacaptain, Antonijs Cernomordijs, for No 3. It was Eze’s first England goal.England 3-0 Latvia: player ratings for the hosts from the World Cup qualifierRead moreThere had been a lovely moment towards the end of the first half, Reece James curling home a stunning 25-yard free-kick. It was his first start for England since September 2022 and his first international goal, too.Yet it was a mixed bag for Tuchel’s team. It is never ideal when the onus is on England to break down ultra‑defensive opponents. There were spells in the opening 45 minutes and pretty much all of the first half of the second period when England were predictable in possession, lacking tempo. They took too many touches. It all felt underwhelming and unsatisfactory.Jude Bellingham was lucky not to be dismissed for a second yellow card, which would have put an entirely different complexion on the night. His lunge into Raivis Jurkovskis in the 56th minute was emblematic of the frustration that had started to take hold. It was the kind of rush of blood that England dread in a major tournament tie.It was a game that many of those present had watched on loop throughout their lives: England in a Wembley qualifier against compact, 11‑men‑behind-the-ball minnows. They are difficult to analyse; to do much more than shrug afterwards and move on. Tuchel can reflect on a solid enough start, taking in the2-0 win against Albaniahere last Friday. It most certainly has not been spectacular.Tuchel had turned the dial with his selection, giving Morgan Rogers his full debut in one of the No 10 positions; Bellingham was in the other. Call them half 10s or double 10s. Tuchel’s tactical language is infectious. Rogers was a plus point.The first half was attritional, too congested for England’s liking. Tuchel has talked about bringing Premier League levels of intensity but that was in short supply. His players struggled to move the ball with sufficient speed.View image in fullscreenReece James curls in a stunning free-kick to give England the lead.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersJames made an erratic start, looking too hyped up. The right-back banged his shoulder into Andrejs Ciganiks in an aerial challenge and was fortunate to escape a booking. He overhit a cross. He looked a little vulnerable defensively. But it was overtaken on 38 minutes by the purity of his free-kick technique. James could not have placed the ball any more accurately into the top corner if he had stood on the line and done so with his hands.England had a weird moment on 18 minutes when Jordan Pickford raced from his line and unnerved Marc Guéhi, who was running back with Vladislavs Gutkovskis. Guéhi touched the ball away from the goalkeeper and the Latvia No 9 could see an empty net, albeit from a tight angle. He could not find it.Apart from that, it was England’s attack against Latvia’s massed defence. Marcus Rashford had got the memo to take on his man; he was positive, although the end product consistently eluded him. He might have had a penalty only he went down too easily when Roberts Savalnieks challenged him. Jarrod Bowen should have had one when the goalkeeper, Krisjanis Zviedris, went into him after dropping a high ball. It was a surprise when the VAR did not agree.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They ought not to have needed to provide it themselves with their paper planes.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze after scoring his first senior England goal.Photograph: John Walton/PABellingham felt the red mist come down. He had been booked at the end of the first half after stamping into Dmitrijs Zelenkovs. Which only made his full-blooded slide challenge into Jurkovskis risky to say the least. Bellingham got none of the ball and he crashed into the man, catching him with his trailing knee. The referee, Orel Grinfeeld, chose to spare him.Kane stirred his team around the midway point of the second half. He was narrowly off target after a move involving Myles Lewis-Skelly and Bellingham. He was then on target at the far post, turning home after Declan Rice had surged on to a Rogers pass to cross. England could have had more by the end, Rogers going close more than once.

Not so fast …Read more“I mean, I feel great,” Betts told reporters in Los Angeles. “Like, my body feels great. I’ve been able to work out. I’ve been able to do pretty much everything but eat, which is strange. So the symptoms have kind of gone away, I just have to figure out how to get my stomach to kind of calm down.”Betts added that he was unsure of his next steps. “My body’s just kind of eating itself,” he said. “It’s hard to not fuel it. And so every time – literally, every time – I fuel my body, I throw up ... I don’t know what to do.”The eight-time All-Star said that his blood tests have nor shown anything unusual. Betts won’t play in Monday’s exhibition at Angel Stadium, and he’s a long shot for the Dodgers’ opening day game on American soil on Thursday against Detroit.“It’s just hard to fathom not eating and going to play a game,” Betts said. “So it looks like I’m just going to be light for a little bit. Maybe I play uphill a little bit for the beginning of the season. But no, I just want to play, man. I’m tired of sitting, tired of throwing up, tired of doing all this. I really just want to play.”Betts is making the full-time transition to shortstop after playing most of his career in right field and second base.

The university violated its duty “by failing to supervise and monitor Weiss and as a result plaintiffs and thousands of others have had their privacy illegally invaded,” attorney Parker Stinar said in the lawsuit.The university has declined to comment.Weiss gained access to the databases of more than 100 colleges and universities that were maintained by a third-party vendor, Keffer Development Services, and then downloaded personal information and medical data of more than 150,000 athletes, according to the indictment. He then got access to the social media, email and cloud storage accounts of more than 2,000 athletes, as well as more than 1,300 students or alumni from schools across the country, the indictment states.“Weiss primarily targeted female college athletes,” the indictment said. “He researched and targeted these women based on their school affiliation, athletic history and physical characteristics. His goal was to obtain private photographs and videos never intended to be shared beyond intimate partners.”Weiss spent two seasons with Michigan before he was fired in 2023 for not cooperating with a school investigation. He was co-offensive coordinator in 2022 when the Wolverines were 13-1 and played in the college football playoff. He had previously spent more than a decade with the NFL’s Ravens in various coaching roles.Explore more on these topicsNFLBaltimore RavensCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

After he and his teammate, Charles Leclerc, were disqualified from theChinese Grand Prixon Sunday, he may have to consider taking up residence again, as a rocked Ferrari deal with a disheartening opening to the season.Ferrari have never endured a double disqualification before in the 75 years they have participated in F1, an embarrassment for which they held up their hands. They conceded that the skid block on the floor of Hamilton’s car had been worn 0.5mm below the limit, while Leclerc’s ride was 1kg below the minimum weight requirement. The F1 governing body, the FIA, said Ferrari acknowledged a“genuine error”and the team said it was a “mistake” they would endeavour not to repeat.McLaren teammates Norris and Piastri ‘nervous and excited’ by F1 title duelRead moreWhat made the events even more striking was the extraordinary turnaround they represented; that what had started so well could come clattering down about their ears with such calamity. Hamilton had taken pole andthe win in the sprint race on Saturdaywith absolute elation at his first success with the team. Finally, here was the Ferrari that had been expected this season, a competitive car mixing at the very front.Twenty-four hours later, the picture had changed drastically.Ferrarimade changes to the set-up of the car before the race, which Hamilton said he believed were a mistake. It is hard to argue.After a strong sprint,Hamilton and Leclerc qualified fifth and sixthand the race did not improve from there. Hamilton struggled for pace almost from the off, to the extent he offered to move over for Leclerc and duly let his teammate through. New tyres made no appreciable difference to Hamilton’s pace and the pair never came within a sniff of the leaders.The disqualification three hours later brought the curtain down with bleak finality. It cost the team 18 points. They are 61 behind the leaders, McLaren, after only two meetings and, almost unthinkably, equal with Williams. Ferrari called it a misjudgment. It is the sort of misjudgment they can ill afford if they intend on challenging for a title any time soon. Nor should it be one they take easily, not least because we have been here before.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton leads Charles Leclerc early in the race.Photograph: Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty ImagesIn 2023, Hamilton, driving for Mercedes, and Leclerc, for Ferrari, weredisqualified at the US Grand Prixfor excessive wear to the skid block, or plank as it is commonly known. The plank – not made of wood but of glass-reinforced plastic – sits beneath the car. Its purpose is simple: to prevent teams from running their cars too low, a limit imposed to maintain some control on the top speeds because the lower they run the quicker they can go. Excessive wear is a straight disqualification, there are no grey areas.Both teams offered mitigation at the time. That the track was bumpy, that it being a sprint weekend minimised the time they had to set up the car. China, too, was a sprint weekend but no other team suffered excessive wear, while the track, just resurfaced, was praised for its smoothness, making such a miscalculation even more egregious.It may as much have been the result of a team pushing every margin. “We have to be at the limit on every single item of the car,” the team principal, Fred Vasseur, told the Race last year. “We have to be aggressive and it’s a challenge to be at the limit of the weight, to be at the limit of the plank, to be at the limit of the cooling, to be at the limit of the fuel. It’s a challenge because in the end you are taking more and more risk.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A notable feature of his time in charge is calm, stable management. He has made a point of eliminating blame culture and ensuring the team do not swing from highs to lows, to protect team members and allow them to flourish. Those strengths, Leclerc believes, have made a huge difference.The reaction to this setback will be key, both understanding why it happened and how to deal with it. Were the team trying too hard, aware they weren’t close enough to McLaren, Mercedes and Red Bull? Was pressure applied to find solutions for a car the team admit swings in and out of the performance window according to the vagaries of its tyres? The debrief may be painful.In the past, similar circumstances have led Ferrari into injurious internal contortions and even bloodletting so this difficult opening to the season is a tremendous test. They will need to refocus and restart but crucially remain unified. Pulling together will surely be Vasseur’s goal and doubtless Hamilton’s too.Explore more on these topicsFerrariFormula OneLewis HamiltonMotor sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

Occasionally, he would shake his head in despair. Mostly, he just looked on with a frown.The United States men’s national team manager understood that there would be a lot of recriminations to go around. Following a second competitive loss in four days in the Concacaf Nations League finals, it was hard to pinpoint where, exactly, to lay the blame for a dispiriting international window for the US.After Panama beat the Americans with alate, smash-and-grab 1-0 winon Thursday, Canada largely outplayed the US anddeserved the 2-1 victoryon Sunday. The Americans had a late flurry of chances for the equalizer, sure, but their northern neighbors had produced the better chances, executed the better game plan and mustered the superior intensity in a match that got chippy only when the US remembered they were playing a rival.Canada win Concacaf Nations League third place, putting USA at a crossroadsRead morePerhaps this was all a kind of geopolitical karma for Donald Trump’s bluster aboutmaking Canada a 51st stateandreclaiming the Panama canalsomehow.For the Americans, there were concerning commonalities between the defeats at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles: disjointed lines; stray passes; a lack of precision in the final third; defensive lapses; and an evident dearth of the passion US manager Mauricio Pochettino is forever insisting on.The more visceral absence, however, was in any measurable support for the home team, with vast swaths of empty seats in the 70,000-seat SoFi Stadium. Twice, the US contest felt like an undercard; the junior varsity game going on as fans trickled in for the real thing – the Mexico-Panama game that was to take place later. The American Outlaws supporters’ group did their best but barely filled a section. The upshot was a muted atmosphere for a pair of games that ought to have offered an intensity attendant to the stakes – and helped prepare the US for even tougher tests to come.View image in fullscreenSeats at SoFi Stadium only started to fill as the US game was nearing its end.Photograph: Jam Media/Getty ImagesThere were valid explanations for the feeble support for the US in a venue that will become the closest possible thing to their home stadium for the 2026 World Cup. The bout with Panama kicked off at 4pm local time on a Thursday; the one with Canada at 3pm (albeit on a Sunday). Both of the games, and the tickets to enter them, were twinned with Mexico matches, whose fans reliably snap up every ticket they can. Concacaf once again set its ticket prices high.But it feels like something far larger is afoot. There was nothing stopping US fans from buying more tickets before Mexico fans gobbled them all up, with prices plainly not an issue forEl Tri’s fanbase. It feels like the fan base for the USMNT has lost interest, or has been gradually eroded.Maybe that’s because US Soccer, too, makes it a habit to set ticket prices as high as it possibly can even for friendly matches. The result is predictable: for the 7 September friendly with Canada in Kansas City, a mere 10,000 fans showed up, leaving even a Major League Soccer venue half empty. Nearly the same occurred later in that window, with around 15,000 in an FC Cincinnati home stadium built for 10,000 more.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It wasn’t just that the soccer itself ranged from bad to underwhelming: every bit of it was disappointing, on the field and off it.Pochettino, for his part, felt compelled to break through the fourth wall and address the fans and their mounting anxiety directly on Sunday. This is seldom a good sign, particularly when you are just six months into the job and barreling towards the World Cup you were hired to salvage. “I want to send a message to the fans: don’t be pessimistic,” Pochettinotold reportersafter the game. “The main objective is the World Cup”Captain Christian Pulisic, too, acknowledged the slump the program has slipped into. “We’ve gotta come back from this,” he told Paramount+ after the game. “We’re not at our best at the moment. When we come back [for the next international window in June], some things need to change and we need to improve. Obviously, the feeling is not good right now. We need to turn it around and we can hopefully build some momentum this summer, because we really do need it.”The US men will gather three more times before the 2026 World Cup. Once this summer for a pair of friendlies and the Concacaf Gold Cup. Again in November and next March for international windows probably filled with a pair of friendlies apiece. And then it will be time for the real thing.The Yanks will surely play in front of packed houses for their World Cup group stage matches starting on 12 June 2026 – two of them at the very SoFi Stadium in Inglewood where they have just lost twice, and one in Seattle – but how many of those fans will offer truly raucous, home-filed-advantage support? And how much will the US need it?Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

To be fair, Americans in general had been in short supply there last week, with the abject turnout for both of the host nation’s two games.One bright spot for the Americans, however, was that Jesse Marsch had been silenced. A second-half red card meant theCanadacoach was barred from talking post-match. The dismissal came after an almighty touchline meltdown that spilled on to the playing area as he roared at referee Katia Itzel García after back-to-back penalty appeals. Cameras trailed him through stadium gangways and tunnels as he raged on. ‘Marsch madness’ headlines were a layup.As it turned out, Marsch’s reflections weren’t needed. His players had done more than enough talking in 90 dominant minutes,beating the US 2-1in the Concacaf Nations League third-place game, and reestablishing themselves as a force within the region that could make noise when they co-host next summer’s World Cup.Canada win Concacaf Nations League third place, putting USA at a crossroadsRead moreMarsch and Canada departed Los Angeles Monday morning having used another international window to expand their repertoire. Sunday’s victory was for more than third place.The geopolitical climate dictated as much. So too, however, did sporting circumstances: two World Cup host nations, both coming off stinging semi-final losses, felt the 2026 clock ticking and only one locked in.“Political environment aside … it was just really important that we go into this summer with some momentum,” defender Alistair Johnston said afterwards. “It would have been tough to have lost both of these matches and gone out of there thinking ‘did we make a step forward or not?’”The Trumpian trade war backdrop was inescapable, so Marsch leaned into it, showing his players footage of thethree fights in nine secondsthat opened last month’s first US v Canada 4 Nations Face-off hockey clash. “Elbows up” is becoming a cultural rallying cry north of the border; Johnston raised his when he went airborne and rattled into USMNT striker Patrick Agyemang for an early tone-setter.But unlike the gold medal victory in the second meeting on ice last month, Sunday’s Canadian triumph wasn’t tension-filled, edge-of-the-blade stuff. It was utterly comprehensive, with those in red dominating every facet. Thursday’s loss to Mexico hurt deeply given how vocal Canada were about leaving here with a trophy, but it set the stage for Marsch to make some demands of his team.With Canada having bossed possession against Mexico but done precious little with it, Marsch insisted that more attacking fluidity could be found by “slowing the game down” in the final third. On Sunday they were metronomic, with Ali Ahmed tapering the tempo to terrific effect as he set up both Tani Oluwaseyi’s opener and Jonathan David’s winner. Marsch also asked his team to show they could rebound in a short turnaround, with just a few days between games. They did so despite adversity: losing captain Alphonso Davies to an early injury, then seeing the coach dismissed with the game still level.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is a squad which is growing, and new depth and options emerged in Inglewood. Hajduk Split’s Niko Sigur sprung from the bench to win just his third cap and put in 80-plus ultra impressive minutes at right back after Davies was forced out. Johnston switched to left-back to brilliant effect, perhaps opening the possibility of freeing up Davies to move further forward in future matches.In midfield, vice-captain Stephen Eustáquio started on the bench with Mathieu Choinière brought in to partner Ismaël Koné. Choinière was impressively tidy and busy but Koné in particular took the added responsibility and thrived, owning middle America.“An amazing performance,” assistant Mauro Biello said afterwards of a player who has found playing time hard to come by until his recent loan from Marseille to Rennes. “Ismaël’s in Ramadan right now and it’s not easy for him going through that but he showed his fighting spirit.”Spirit can sometimes easier to identify by its absence than presence. The US appear to be devoid of what Canada have. And what Canada have may be best exemplified by Eustáquio, who admitted to reporters his disappointment at being dropped from the lineup but said “everybody matters … we need that depth come 2026.”The team John Herdman brought to Qatar in 2022 had spirit without depth. Marsch, knowing this can’t simply be his or Davies and David’s team alone, is melding all of the above. Set-piece improvements feel like the next vital step with a specialist coach due to be hired by the next June window.Canada 2-1 USA: Concacaf Nations League third-place game – as it happenedRead moreDavid’s winner was superb. But Biello pointed to his 50-yard covering sprint back to clear danger before half-time as “speaking a lot to the type of player he is, the type of leader he is.” Vitally, new pillars have been installed around existing ones. Moïse Bombito’s performances against Mexico and the US underlined his emergence as one of the most promising defenders in the game. Nice may well make a quick and sizeable profit on him this summer.Before this window, The Athletic ranked the top 20 players in Concacaf, a list which included 11 US players and just four Canadians, with Bombito down at 19th. The sound of 40 million pairs of eyebrows being raised north of the 49th parallel made its way to LA.“For many years there we were always the underdog,” said Biello in his brief, unexpected post-match appearance. “But things are starting to shift.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaUSAUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Norwegian police pressed charges against Ingebrigtsen Sr last year, accusing him of abusing two of his seven children, including Jakob for several years.The police started their investigation in October 2023 when Jakob and his fellow athlete brothers, Filip and Henrik, accused their father of physical violence and abusive behaviour in a Norwegian newspaper column. The charge against Gjert for the abuse of his daughter was filed at the end of April 2024. Six months later he was also charged with abusing Jakob.Jakob, whocompleted a golden doublein the 1500m and 3,000m at the world indoor championships in Nanjing, China on Sunday, accused his father of several incidents of abuse, according to Norwegian media, including slapping him twice in 2008 and kicking him in the stomach after he fell off a scooter in 2009.Gjert announced in 2022 that he was stepping down as coach not long after Jakob wonOlympic gold in the 1500m in Tokyo,prompting widespread speculation in Norway over their rift.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although Sunderland is 15 miles away many Millwall fans are expected to change trains at Newcastle central station en route to Wearside.Newcastle fans reacted positively to the news that there will now be an open-top bus parade but remain concerned that anyone wanting to attend the Town Moor event had to register by Sunday night, with no guarantees of admission on the day. Moreover it is a “standing only” party with no facilities for car parking. Admission will be free and the event will run from 4pm until 8pm.Eddie Howe and his playersare expected to take to the stage at about 6pm but many older fans feel the need to stand for so long means it is unsuited to their needs, let alone those of children. Then there is the problem of what happens if it rains on a site prone to turning muddy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That certainly applies to Steve Clarke, who has raised levels withScotlandto the point where qualifying for tournaments has become reality as opposed to a pipe dream. Clarke has been the head coach to end years in the international wilderness.There is, however, a slightly ominous feel around the Scotland setup once more.Defeat by Greece– a rising force – can happen. What should not transpire is the comprehensive thumping dished out at Hampden Park on Sunday. Scotland looked utterly unprepared for what they faced. Theirs was a ragged, disjointed display.Scotland relegated in Nations League as Karetsas leads Greece demolition jobRead moreClarke has made it pretty obvious he views the World Cup campaign as his last. Another shot at club management is in his thoughts. Having been in the role since 2019, that familiarity consequence has the Tartan Army glancing towards a fresh start. Clarke’s employers have no excuse for not having a succession plan; in the absence of an available Scotland-based head coach of the calibre required to lead the national team, it is going to have to broaden horizons. Clarke’s raising of the bar has consequences for his replacement. The Scottish Football Association is going to have to break with tradition and think big.The Greece debacle felt like a line in the sand. It was similar in that respect toScotland’s final game at Euro 2024, where the lack of attacking intent against Hungary angered supporters. Clarke had recovered from that night in Stuttgart courtesy of a strong finish to the Nations League. Greece at Hampden ate up a lot of that goodwill. If Scotland start World Cup qualifying poorly, the mood will quickly turn toxic.Clarke’s reference to a lack of “energy” and “legs” in his team meant something went awry in the planning stage. A Thursday-Sunday two-leg tie is unusual, with the level of travel required inevitably affecting players. Scotland needed to get fine details right afteran arduous 1-0 win in Piraeus.It was apparent at half-time of the second leg that Scotland desperately needed change. Clarke did not implement it; 15 seconds into the second period,Greecehad put the tie out of reach. The head coach curiously refuses to deploy Ryan Christie in the midfield role in which he excels at Bournemouth. Lewis Ferguson earns rave reviews captaining Bologna but was left out of that midfield as Kenny McLean started. This is not to decry McLean, a fine servant for his country, but picking a Championship player ahead of someone tipped to move to one of Serie A’s top clubs feels nonsensical.View image in fullscreenSteve Clarke selected the 18-year-olds Lennon Miller (left) and James Wilson to face Greece.Photograph: Russell Cheyne/ReutersGrant Hanley, Clarke’s go-to centre-back, had been a very late substitute in Birmingham’s past three League One games. Yet he was relied upon to play 180 minutes against Greece. Anthony Ralston, the right-back, does not start regularly at Celtic.It would be wrong, however, to focus on Hanley and Ralston. Scotland needed so much more from supposed star turns. Andy Robertson was woeful in the second leg. Che Adams, the centre-forward, has a rather unfortunate habit of not looking remotely dangerous near to goal. John McGinn has flattered to deceive in Scotland colours for a while. Wild excitement over Billy Gilmour is undermined by the fact he is, aged 23, already at club No 3 in search of regular football.Gilmour is neat and tidy but too much of his play goes backwards or sideways. He also lacks the physicality to adequately screen a defence; a significant problem for Scotland given Christie, McGinn and Scott McTominay want to chase the game. Greece gleefully exposed how open Scotland became.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This team, who have generally served him so well, may have run their race. Whether he is of a mind to make changes, especially with his time in post apparently ticking down, is open to question.There is a lack of pace, which leads to overemphasis on Ben Doak. The 19-year-old will have a decent career; some in Scotland portray him as a tartan Messi. Clarke’s ability to shake up personnel is undermined by a glaring lack of emerging talent. That much was true when Scotland were qualifying for back-to-back European Championships, it is just that nobody wanted to hear it.There was wild noise when the 18-year-olds James Wilson and Lennon Miller were selected for the Greece tie. Other countries would think nothing of such a move. Indeed, in the 17-year-old Konstantinos Karetsas, Greece had the most eye-catching player on display at Hampden. Scotland are in the shameful position of not having a goalkeeper deemed capable of replacing the 42-year-old Craig Gordon.The path towards the World Cup will be rocky for Scotland. Greece have just shown how formidable an opponent they will be. Denmark are seasoned tournament campaigners. Belarus will bring logistical challenges. Clarke has two dicey June friendly matches to lower the temperature around his position. Given the progress of the recent past, this may well be an unjust situation. It is, though, a realistic one. Memories are short in this business.Explore more on these topicsScotlandGreeceanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Atlético Madrid forward’s chapter withLes Bleus,which spanned over a decade, was coming to an end. Olise was ​given the daunting task of replacing a man who had accumulated 137 caps, 84 of which came in consecutive matches, an omnipresence that stretched back over half a decade.Golden era of French coaching is over, so who will replace Deschamps?Read moreIn Olise’s debut,a3-1 defeat to Italy, the shirt seemed to hang heavily on his shoulders. “When I saw my name on the​ shirt, I was more excited than afraid,” ​said Olise​ but it didn’t look that way. His manager was more realistic. “At the start, it was a bit difficult for him​. Sometimes it takes a little bit of time​,” said Deschamps. The boots to fill were considerable given that Griezmann had been the creative fulcrum in the midfield.Olise, like Griezmann, is expected to compensate for a technical deficit in France’s midfield. The mix, composition and shape of Deschamps’ midfield has long​ been a point of contestation, including during the Euros last summer. It is no coincidence that these questions grew in pertinence as the competition progressed, just as Griezmann’s impact waned.Deschamps deployed a hybrid, messy version of a midfield diamond in Split last week to disappointing results as​Francelost 2-0 to Croatiain the first​ leg of their Nations League quarter-final. “​What we lacked was technical precision,” said Deschamps. It is not a n​ew issue. France’s academies are rightly touted as some of the best in world football but ​they tend to produce midfielders who are more athletic than technical, which is why Deschamps has opted to play an attacker deeper. Enter Olise.For Deschamps, diamonds​ are not for ever​. In fact​, ​t​he system he used in Croatia was ditched ​for the return fixture on Sunday night in favour of a 4-4-2. The key in the system was Olise. TheBayern Munichforward was given a free role​, coming off his right flank and often occupying central positions, dropping deep and trying to bridge that technical deficit in midfield.Even an imperfect display from Olise at the Stade de France showed how important he ​could be for the team. Olise touched the ball more than any of France’s other forward players, a testament to his ability to find spaces and​ his willingness to drop deep to help in buildup. But he was also the player who lost possession the most. Over the course of his 105 minutes on the pitch, he lost the ball on 28 occasions. Granted, he was audacious in his distribution and that naturally lends itself to losing the ball but at times, ​but there was a lack of synchronicity with his teammates.View image in fullscreenMichael Olise scored his first international goal against Croatia.Photograph: Nathan Barange/ShutterstockIt is a question of building ​relationships ​and also perhaps breaching the language barrier. Having grown up in England to a Nigerian father and Franco-Algerian mother, he has been exposed to the French language but, as he recently noted, he always responded in English as a child. At times he needed translation help from Loïc Badé during his first press conference as a France player back in September. And his monosyllabic responses ​after the match on Sunday saw his interviewer describe him as a “man of few words”.The language barrier has at times​ been an issue for Deschamps, who does not speak English but wants to form a “deep bond” with Olise, who he sees as integral to his plans. Olise​’s timidity – at least publicly – plays a role too but, the intent is there; speaking in a language that is not his mother tongue in press duties and on TV is highly commendable and, given the French presence at Bayern Munich (Dayot Upamecano, Kingsley Coman, Sacha Boey, as well as Paris-born Raphaël Guerreiro), it will become less of an issue over time.Time is very much on his side after his performance againstCroatia. His sumptuous free-kick showed what France have been missing​ – for nearly 18 years. His direct free-kick was the first scored by a France player since Jérôme Rothen against the Faroe Islands in October 20​07; famously, Kylian Mbappé has never scored a direct free-kick. Having ​s​cored his first goal for France, ​O​lise then ​picked up his first assist, teeing up the prolific Ousmane Dembélé to finish first time.Nations League roundup: Trincão and Ronaldo fire Portugal into semi-finalsRead moreSuch a performance was necessary given the calibre of player​s knocking on the door behind him. Désiré Doué made his France debut on Sunday​ and had an impact. The PSG man has shown himself capable of playing in midfield as well as on the wings. Then there is Rayan Cherki, who has 26 goal contributions ​f​or Lyon this season​. He leads the assists charts in Ligue 1 and the Europa League. Cherki’s display against ​the England Under-21s last week w​ill not have done his chances of a first call-up any harm either. Maghnes Akliouche​ is also in contention; his manager at Monaco, Adi Hütter, believes​ he is already “an international-level player”.But Olise’s performance keeps the others on the outside looking in. Deschamps described Olise as “radiant” asFrance beat Croatia on penaltiesto progress to the​ semi-finals of the Nations League. “His direct free-kick, his technical touch​ … I am happy for him and it has a bearing on other matches because he will be confident,” said Deschamps.As Deschamps notes, this is a young France side after the retirements of Griezmann, Olivier Giroud, Hugo Lloris andRaphaël Varane since the 2022 World Cup. The manager’s tenure ​willend after the next World Cupso this is his last chance to conjure a team in his image. He has issues in other ​parts of the pitch but Deschamps can at least be relieved that, with just over a year to go before the start of the World Cup, he has found a replacement for one of his former cadres,Griezmann, as Olise takes the torch.This is an article byGet French Football NewsExplore more on these topicsFranceGet French Football NewsCroatiaNations LeagueBayern MunichfeaturesShareReuse this content"

During 13 years in Europe he won league titles in every country he played in – Portugal, Spain, England and Italy – and is now back in Brazil withFlamengo, chasing more trophies and a place in Brazil’s 2026 World Cup squad.The 33-year-old stands out off the pitch too, quitting social media twice for a sustained period over its toxicity, looking back at his younger self wondering why he bought a car that he used once a year and wanting to study psychology when he finishes his playing career rather than pursuing a job in coaching.Vinícius Júnior launches 99th-minute winner to lift Brazil past ColombiaRead moreDanilo is engaging company for more than two hours and has many stories to tell, starting with theManchester Citymanager, the man who changed his life. “Pep Guardiola educates his players,” the right-back says. “That’s the most important thing about his work. He makes all players think about football in the same way. Time, space, movement, possession,taking care of the ball.”“He makes you understand the spaces on the pitch like no other coach and he lives the game emotionally like no other coach,” Danilo continues. “I was brainwashed by Guardiola, but in a good way. It was like I was at university. What I experienced with him allowed me to raise my level and keep that level to this day. It’s not that I was an idiot before I arrived at Manchester City but I realised that I played football in completely the wrong way. If I had met him before, he would have made my life a lot easier. I’m so glad I was able to play under him and was able to learn from him.”Danilo’s comments are a reminder of how influential Guardiola can be, even for players who are some way into their careers. It was not as if Danilo was a novice when he arrived at the Etihad in the summer of 2017. He had already played for Santos in Brazil, Porto in Portugal andReal Madridin Spain, where he collected two Champions League titles under Zinedine Zidane.He spent two seasons at City, winning the league in both and making 60 appearances. In 2017-18City amassed 100 pointsand finished 19 above second-placed Manchester United. The following season was much closer with Liverpool pushing City all the way, ending up one point behind.View image in fullscreenDanilo credits his former Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola with changing his life.Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty ImagesKevin De Bruyne, John Stones, Ederson, Bernardo Silva, Ilkay Gündogan and Phil Foden are some of the players still at the club from that era but Danilo is not surprised that levels had to drop at some point. “We have to remember that football is cyclical,” he says. “There are a lot of players who are now 33, 34 years old and have been at the top of their game for eight, nine, 10 years. This drop in performance is natural. You have to look at the mental aspect as well. When I talk about age, it’s not even physical. It’s the experience of being under so much pressure for so many years, the pressure of winning and winning all the time.“When you lose, the feeling is that everything has gone wrong and you feel less valuable, incapable. It’s difficult to balance these feelings. That’s why when you win, you only feel relief. However, with age comes a better understanding and it is easier to reflect on some of the defeats and victories.”The defender’s personal journey has been interesting too and it is clear Danilo does not want to carry on playing until he is 40. He wants to enjoy his life outside football, something he learned during his time in Europe. He is also pleased that he has matured into a different person to the one in his early 20s. “My main thing was to understand who Ireallyam,” he says. “Not following the tide, not following the herd so to speak, you know? I don’t have to think like everyone else, I’m not obliged to live like everyone else. I don’t have to dress like everyone else, I don’t have to talk about the same things that everyone else talks about”.“When I played for Porto, for example, I came to Brazil once a year. I bought a car, a Camaro, which cost 500,000 reals [£68,000]. Well, the car was in Bicas [the small town where Danilo was born]. What was I going to do with a Camaro in Bicas? There’s a lot of social pressure to have a nice car because you’re a footballer and all that. But this is something that I look at myself from 10 years ago and I say: ‘Really? You’re joking, right?’”View image in fullscreenDanilo says he was ‘a complete hostage to criticism’ during his time at Real Madrid.Photograph: Helios de la Rubia/Real Madrid/Getty ImagesBicas is a town of fewer than 15,000 inhabitants. Danilo left home at the age of 15 to play for América Mineiro and Santos until he moved to Porto in 2012. In Europe he faced a series of challenges in order to understand himself better. Social media played a part in that and Danilo has come to realise that players could communicate better with fans. Despite being very active on Instagram at the moment, with more than 1,700 posts and 3.6 million followers, he knows the pitfalls and the need not to be held hostage by all the criticism and anger on the different platforms.Now matter how mature you are, you want to be accepted. Social media is a toxic environment. Toxic on all levels“As much as we say we don’t care about these things we are human beings after all. You can’t help but feel it. I’m not addicted to social media, I’m not a very attached guy. But we want to be accepted by people, we want to receive positive feedback. Nobody wants negative feedback. No matter how much you study, how much you worry about your mental health, how mature you are, you want to be accepted. And social media is a toxic environment. Toxic on all levels”Mental health is a topic close to Danilo’s heart, especially after the problems he faced at Real Madrid between 2015 and 2017. At the time he felt bad and that he wasn’t matching the investment the Spanish team had made in him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were times when it seemed like I couldn’t remember how to play football any more. The criticism was really hurting me. I was a complete hostage to criticism, to social media, to everything. That’s when I started working with a sports psychologist.”The person responsible for recommending a psychologist to Danilo was Lucas Silva, a Brazilian midfielder who had an unsuccessful spell at Real Madrid. It was the first time that Danilo had had access to professional help in that area and he wishes clubs would help players more in that aspect.“I’m going to put it very bluntly: the clubs will only do something when they realise the financial damage they are being hit by. Look how many players who were stars at youth level and who didn’t make it into the professional game because of this avalanche of criticism. When you come up, there’s a lot of money, women and fame. But how to deal with it? We all know someone who has lost their way in football. When clubs realise how many players they’re losing due to emotional and psychological problems, they’ll think twice and start investing because that’s technical and financial value for the team.“And that’s nasty because they don’t care about the human being. We need to humanise football more. People still ignore it, they don’t like to talk about it. But when it comes to the financial side, they care.”View image in fullscreen‘We need to humanise football more’: Danilo wants to study psychology after hanging up his boots, rather than go into coaching.Photograph: Lucas Figueiredo/The GuardianIn an attempt to make sport more humane, Danilo created the “Voz Futura” project in 2020. The Brazilian wants to encourage more people to discuss mental health and to look after themselves better.“Voz Futura is a project that was born during the pandemic, at a time when I felt very influenced by the traditional media, you know? There’s so much negative news. It was a very difficult time for everyone. I was in Italy, which was badly affected. People in Brazil still hadn’t realised the magnitude of things. And every day I opened the main websites and newspapers, as I always do, and I would always feel something very negative. I still didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do but I wanted it to be something important and different to traditional media. We have many people with incredible lives who can inspire and motivate us.”Voz Futura is one of several projects outside football for Danilo but that does not mean he is done on the pitch. He still has a lot to contribute to Flamengo, who are preparing for the Club World Cup, and potentially for the national team, and he thinks the move back to his home country may help him achieve that. “That’s one of my goals, to get closer to the Brazilian people, to the fans. This can help me and also enhance my role in the Brazilian national team,” he says.At Flamengo, Danilo is managed by Filipe Luís, the former Chelsea and Atlético Madrid defender, who is only six years his senior. “Filipe stopped playing in December and in February he was already coaching Flamengo’s under-17s. I rang him and said: ‘You’re mad.’ He said he didn’t know coaches worked so hard. That’s why I’ll never be a coach.”No chance? “Zero. None. I think football still has a lot to give me but when I finish, I need to turn over a new leaf in my life. I want to start university, I want to study psychology, I want to study communications. Life is unpredictable and I’ve learned to allow myself to change my mind but today my answer about being a coach is that it’s impossible.”Explore more on these topicsFlamengoThe ObserverManchester CityPep GuardiolaReal MadridfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The action will take place at seventh-tier FC United’s home game against Stockton on a weekend when United do not have a match.Fans will gather behind one of the goals before kick‑off to display their disquiet at the American family’s proprietorship, which began with Malcolm Glazer’s leveraged purchase. That loaded about £500m debt on the club and caused a section of unhappy supporters to break away and form FC United. The club was officially founded on 18 May 2005 in an Indian restaurant in Rusholme.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.After Glazer died in May 2014, his six children took over and they remain the majority owners, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s share purchase of 28.94% last year making him the largest individual shareholder. United’s debt is about £730m. The club owes a further £300m in transfer fees and has lost £300m in the past three years.FC United said: “Together, we will make our voices heard – enough is enough.

Boehly and Clearlake havean uneasy relationshipand have both explored the possibility of buying each other out. The mood has cooled since differences spilled out into the open this season but tension over Chelsea’s future direction persists.A key issue to resolve is whether Chelsea should leave Stamford Bridge or expand its capacity of about 40,000. Redeveloping is not straightforward and talks aboutmoving to Earl’s Courthave continued.

It would have turned the game upside down so we decided to take him out straight away. You could see the huge effort Jude put in the first game and he didn’t seem so fresh. I didn’t want to take the risk so took him off.”If England’s performance against an opponent attempting a brick-wall defence was not always easy on the eye, Tuchel was otherwise happy enough following his second win to follow thedefeat of Albaniaon Friday.“The organisation of the camp was top,” the head coach said. “The players make the difference, they reminded me instantly why I was excited to take the job. You need these type of matches and the tension that not everything falls into place in the first minute.”James scored a first-half free‑kick in his first England start since September 2022 and came in for high praise from his former Chelsea manager. “I know Reecey [James] and the quality the boy has is amazing,” said Tuchel, who added that he had been in “close contact” with a player he declared was of the “highest level”, and “in a good space mentally”.Tuchel said: “He has every right to be proud and happy with his performance.

The Save Victoria Park group has reportedly briefed lawyers in a potential court challenge against the stadium build, arguing the project will destroy valuable green space and must be stopped due to the site’s significance to First Nations communities.Victoria Park was converted into a golf course in 1931, butBrisbanecity council developed plans in 2020 to convert the 64 hectare site back into park.“Victoria Park has a really rich Indigenous history and one of the centrepieces of the park will be the lake – Lake Barrambin – and that has a wide Indigenous history as well,”the lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, saidin 2020.Brisbane historian Ray Kerkhove conducted multiple heritages assessments of Victoria Park, also known as Barrambin, for different levels of government.He said if Crisafulli announced plans to turn it into a stadium, his response would be “horror and despair”.Kerkhove said Victoria Park, which is heritage listed, is probably the most significant site of Indigenous heritage in central Brisbane.The park served as the town camp for up to 1,500 Indigenous people throughout the 19th century, before they were forced on to missions, and Aboriginal people returned to live there when allowed to leave the missions in the 20th century, he said.Brisbane is deciding on a 2032 Olympics stadium: how do the options stack up?Read more“That’s a continuity of nearly 200 years. I’ve walked around there and found stone tools and oyster shells on the ground,” he said.It served as a meeting place long before that, and is part of a songline, he said. Kerkhove said the heritage would be destroyed by a new stadium.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“There’s this long history of Aboriginal people having that place as a special place …” he said.“Of course it is (on a songline). Most base camps are on songlines”.Both the organisation’s recommendations and the government response will be released later today.The former Labor government rejected a similar recommendation by a previous inquiry on costs grounds.Brisbane was awarded the Games in July 2021, under the former premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. It was the first city selected under the Olympics’ “new norm” approach, which is designed to reduce infrastructure costs by reusing existing venues as much as possible.Palaszczuk’s successor, Steven Miles, cancelled the Gabba rebuild in March last year, announcing his own venues plan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We need to take care of it, and to build on top of it, it just wouldn’t be nice.“It’s almost like our history doesn’t matter.”Kerkhove saidthere were at least two documented massacres at the park in the 1840s. Both times the entire town camp was burned to the ground.“That was a scuffle in the middle of the night. We don’t really know how many people. Certainly some were killed,” he said.Organisers have claimed the Games benefits First Nations people, with Brisbane 2032 being touted as the first Olympicswith its own reconciliation action plan.Explore more on these topicsBrisbane Olympic Games 2032BrisbaneQueensland politicsQueenslandnewsShareReuse this content"

She will return to the top 50 for the first time since her eight-month layoff in 2023 after undergoing surgery to both wrists and her ankle. Raducanu will next face Jessica Pegula, the fourth seed, after she defeated Marta Kostyuk 6-2, 6-3.Emma Raducanu races through in Miami Open as Kessler pulls out injuredRead moreOn paper, this was supposed to be a fiercely difficult match. Anisimova is a former teenage prodigy who reached the French Open semi-finals at 17 in 2019 before taking a break from professional tennis in 2023 to address her mental health and burnout. This season has signalled her recovery, winning a first WTA 1000 title at the Qatar Open last month and then reaching the fourth round in Miami by beating the Indian Wells champion Mirra Andreeva.In this match, however, it was Raducanu who produced another faultless performance. Over the past week, she has demonstrated some of the best tennis of her career outside her 2021 US Open title run. Her serve and forehand, with which she has struggled for the past few years, have been excellent and she has frustrated opponents with her solid defence and cutting backhand slice.At her best, Anisimova is one of the cleanest ball-strikers in the world, her timing and hand-eye coordination the driving force behind her teenage breakthrough. From the start of this match, however, she simply could not put the ball in court. She had some understandable excuses. Her tough three-set win against Andreeva ended late on Sunday night and she had received a medical timeout for blisters on her right hand, which led to criticism from Andreeva.The writing was on the wall for Anisimova as she ended the first set by essentially tanking the final game. Between the sets, the American received a medical timeout, eventually returning to the court with her right wrist taped after the trainer had massaged her forearm. Although Anisimova’s level slightly improved in the second set, Raducanu refused to let her focus and intensity drop.“I felt something was maybe going down on the other side,” Raducanu told Sky Sports. “It’s really difficult to stay focused when your opponent is making some errors and then all of a sudden just blasting the lines and winners and you have no idea what’s going on. Those matches are almost tougher to stay focused the whole time. When things are, in a way, more normal, it’s just like you know you have to be locked in every single point. I’m really proud of how I came through that.”At the end of another brilliant win, Raducanu’s performance earned her a standing ovation from the newest temporary member of her team, the British coach and commentator Mark Petchey, alongside the former player Jane O’Donoghue. The timing of Raducanu’s breakthrough this week has been fascinating considering she had opted to end her trial period with the Slovak coach Vladimir Platenik on the eve of the tournament.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s extremely important I think.“For me, who’s very expressive, when I play my best I’m definitely authentic, true to myself and creative.

There’s so much more to it and moving forward now, it might look a little bit different. I don’t think the way that we’ll play will be different but we want to win games.“For me, those two months in India and Pakistan, they hurt me so much. I want to win everything, I do.

The outpouring of concern for Tamim reflects how much he is loved and appreciated by the nation.“The BCB is closely monitoring his health and continues to remain in contact with the hospital’s medical team. The board is committed to providing every support and assistance to ensure Tamim’s swift recovery.”Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.After a hectic past 12 months in all formats, Duckett is set to miss the early part of the County Championship with a view to be firing on all cylinders for a five-Test series against India.“Nothing’s set in stone at the minute,” Duckett said. “It’s always a slightly tricky place to be because where I’m at in my career is a big thanks to Nottinghamshire.

It is understood, however, that Farrell has since made a move for Wigglesworth to join his staff in Australia and he will go with Borthwick’s blessing.The move is a significant step in Wigglesworth’s coaching career. When Borthwick left Leicester to join England in December 2022, ­Wigglesworth took charge of the Tigers for the rest of the season before joining his former boss in the buildup to the 2023 World Cup. Initially he was responsible for the attack and last October, after the shock resignations of Felix Jones and Aled Walters as defence coach and head of strength and conditioning respectively, Wigglesworth was promoted to senior coach.He will be reunited with Walters, who has already been announced as part of the Lions’ backroom staff along with David Nucifora, who has been appointed general manager. The Australian is employed by the Scottish union as performance director, a role he previously held with Ireland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If so, I wouldn’t fixate on them; while it’s certainly possible for sports to draw inspiration from each other, they very rarely map precisely on to each other. Will players start moving in different patterns to now? Possibly, but football is 150 years old; there is very little new under the sun.I think what we are seeing now, though, is more structured patterns, automations, practised and practised so they can be deployed in games when an appropriate situation occurs. That’s particularly true of counter-attacks; Jogi Löw’s Germany were masters of that. On the one hand, if everybody knows where everybody is about to run, moves can be made quicker, gaining vital fractions of seconds on a defence. But there are other coaches, such as José Mourinho, who believe football is too fluid and chaotic for automations to be more than intermittently effective; they prefer to instil a mindset so players instinctively make the right decisions in any given circumstance.And as for goalkeepers effectively becoming playmakers, that’s been in the game for decades. Ederson, perhaps, has taken it further than anybody else, but look at Stanley Menzo at Ajax in the 80s, or René Higuita with Colombia and Atlético Nacional. When Higuita wasdispossessed to allow Roger Milla his second for Cameroonin the last 16 of the 1990 World Cup, the general sense, in the UK at least, was that a “crazy” keeper had got his comeuppance. Look back on it, though, and with modern eyes it’s apparent that Higuita has come out to deal with a long ball, and is looking to draw a Cameroon player out of position to give his outfielders a numerical advantage. The problem comes when Luis Carlos Perea plays a terrible pass back to him, allowing Milla to steal in. “We quickly realised that we had something special: an extra outfield player,” Francisco Maturana, his coach both at club and national level, explained in an interview with The Blizzard. Within our gameplan we had a structure with five lines and every line was separated by 10 metres. That meant we had 11 players instead of 10 able to generate play. It wasn’t us insisting that he should get out of his area and play but the system that encouraged it.”Sometimes when I attend games at West Brom, as a goalkeeper prepares to take a goal kick, all 20 outfield players will congregate in a small area to one side of the pitch around the halfway line. The goal kick is contested by the players and then normal play resumes. I am completely baffled as to 1) why this happens, and 2) why the kicking team never leaves a player in the wide open space on the other side of the pitch to take full advantage of an open path to goal. Perhaps you could offer an explanation for this bizarre tactic?– RobertThis is a related issue to the first question. In the 1980s this was common; almost nobody played out from the back, keepers always kicked long and, either because of the way they naturally kicked (eg, a right-footer will usually kick with a slight right-to-left drift) or because of where the best headers tended to play, those kicks would be directed to one side or the other. With both sides pushing up to catch the opposition offside from the second ball, the effect was that 20 outfielders would end up in a small box around halfway, slightly pushed into the half being attacked by the team taking the goal kick. As to why one player doesn’t break off into space; he wouldn’t be in space for long because a marker would follow him.Football used to be a more a game of territory than possession. The logic was that if you could get the ball into the opposition half, they were under pressure. One mistake could lead to a shooting chance. The mentality has changed over the past two decades, largely because of improvements in pitch technology. Now, with far fewer bobbles, the first touch can be taken almost for granted, so the game becomes far less about winning the ball back after a poor touch than about manipulating the shape of the game and creating overloads. Possession matters more than position. As pressing structures have improved, though, it’s become increasingly risky to play out from the back – and the problem if a side goes long with full-backs dropping to receive a short pass is that it effectively takes offside out of the equation. And so the result is the hoof into a tight knot of players near halfway and a scramble to win the second ball.I find it interesting that no one has picked up the fact thatArsenalmight be struggling because of Declan Rice’s current position (left-sided No 8). Arteta still hasn’t fixed the gap that Granit Xhaka left. Rice plays better, and so do Arsenal, when he plays in his natural position. Thoughts?– NelsonI think this has been widely recognised as a problem for both Arsenal and England. Rice is occasionally portrayed as a defensive midfielder, but he is not. He is a box-to-box player who is very good at making forward surges from deep. He does not, though, have the tactical brain to operate as an effective deep-lying midfielder, which he is often asked to do. Granit Xhaka, as you say, fulfilled that role last season, and although Thomas Partey has done so this season, the Ghanaian has been less convincing. Martin Ødegaard’s slight downturn in form this season can probably in part be attributed to Xhaka’s departure. What Arsenal could really do with is a peak-era Jorginho. The present version, at 33, has managed just 544 league minutes this season.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

He’s parked in a chair on the patio of the US men’s national team hotel in Manhattan Beach, Los Angeles. He’s facing the horizon and embracing the sun, the moment. There are possibilities ahead, including in the Nations League finals that were then due to take place in a couple days.Sargent arrived for his second camp under Mauricio Pochettino as a safe bet to be the starting striker for the US men’s national team after Ricardo Pepi and Folarin Balogun were left off the Concacaf Nations League Finals due to injuries. Prior to the semifinal against Panama, he wasn’t feeling the heat.“I wouldn’t say [there’s] pressure,” he told the Guardian. “I think it’s a good opportunity, for sure, though. Without them being here, to really make a good name for myself.”Canada win Concacaf Nations League third place, putting USA at a crossroadsRead moreThen he came agonizingly close to his first USMNT goal since 2019 in Thursday’s loss to Panama, denied by the post then the offside flag after a well-taken finish. He continued to starve for service in that game, then didn’t feature at all in the third-place match against Canada,another forgettable lossfor a rotated US team.“It’s not something I stress about, I think if I do what I want to throughout the game, it should lead to me getting chances,” Sargent said before the games had started. “And hopefully I can put a chance away soon.”He’s had no such issues at club level this year. Following two months on the sidelines, Sargent returned to action for EFLChampionshipside Norwich City in January, tallying eight goals in his last 10 games. He describes his current form as a flow state, in which he isn’t overthinking things.“You’re just in a zone where you feel like things are just coming off for you, the goal looks bigger for you. Everything just seems to feel a little bit easier,” he said.Entering this World Cup cycle, there was lingering uncertainty about who the first-choice No 9 would be for the US in 2026. The recruitment of Balogun and Pepi’s form for club and country added competition, and while Sargent had more experience he was rarely available for national team duty because of various injuries. Even in Qatar, he was the starter at the position until an injury cut his World Cup short in the final group stage game.“I remember vividly him being in a boot and us being in the players’ lounge and just playing pool and talking about everything, really,” veteran defender Tim Ream said. “Disappointment in the injury, what it was going to take to get back. You look at it now, and again, it was a setback. And he’s come back stronger for it. But in that moment, he was the starting striker, wasn’t he? And was probably going to be from that point forward in the tournament unless something changed, and it did.”View image in fullscreenJosh Sargent has been in great form for Norwich.Photograph: John Walton/PAReflecting on the ensuing, stop-start ride with the US, Sargent sighed.“It’s been a road where I’m here for a couple games, and then I’m gone for a while. With injury or whatever it is. Come back, haven’t always been starting right away,” Sargent said.His latest start for the US in the Nations League came after Pochettino expressed confidence in Sargent by allowing him, and the rest of the team, the trust to determine their own approach.“He said to us, we’re the best at what we do which is why we’re here, and to feel free,” Sargent said. “There are some patterns that he puts us through, but at the end of the day, he trusts us to go out there and do our thing. He puts a lot of trust in us to do what we know to do, and that’s to create chances and score goals. So there is, I think, a bit of freedom in that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s a great asset to our team, of course he’s a leader,” US defender Joe Scally said. “It’s crazy, I guess you could say he’s one of the older guys, or in the middle of the pack.”Canada 2-1 USA: Concacaf Nations League third-place game – as it happenedRead moreSargent’s future, though, is unclear. At least one of Balogun or Pepi will probably be back in the fold when the US reconvene in the summer for the Gold Cup. Other options, like Vancouver Whitecaps’ Brian White and Charlotte FC’s Patrick Agyemang, have now joined Pochettino’s USMNT in multiple camps. Agyemang started in Sargent’s place on Sunday, with White coming off the bench.Sargent said he appreciates beingthe guyup top, and doesn’t take that stability for granted. His club career has given him plenty of reason why. After becoming the first player in the history of the US men’s program to be called up by the U-17, U-20 and senior national teams in the same calendar year in 2017, Sargent’s progress in Europe was uneven. He was not deployed exclusively as a striker at Werder Bremen and again at Norwich, where he was often battling relegation or ultimately enduring it. Following his breakout 2022-23 season, Finnish hitman Teemu Pukki left the Canaries in the summer and Sargent was anointed the No 9.He’s happy at Norwich, but noted there are a lot of factors behind the decision on where to be in his prime. There have been persistent links to MLS, which he’s coy about.“I think there will be a few options this summer if something were to happen,” Sargent said. “It’s a decision that me and my wife are gonna have to make together, and whatever makes the most sense for our family, as well as my career.”Jumping to a Premier League or Bundesliga team isn’t without risk, either. Minutes leading up to the World Cup are essential, and Sargent is reaching a crossroads.Explore more on these topicsUSANorwich CityUS sportsChampionshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The players took a water break while messages warning about the use of the slur appeared on the scoreboard and over the public address system.Mexico’s homophobic chant started as an unfunny joke.

But with Jiménez in dominant form, Mexico stepped up to claim this trophy.Jiménez played alongside Giménez in the Nations League semi-finals and finals, with coach Javier Aguirre using an aggressive alignment to create more attacking opportunities. It worked splendidly thanks to Jiménez, who needed only a few minutes to get Mexico on top in the final.After Roberto Alvarado put a long, beautiful cross into the box, Jiménez outmaneuvered a defender and bounced in a header that set off a raucous celebration at SoFi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US defeat, which came 72 hours after a1-0 loss to Panama in Thursday’s semi-finals, meant the home side finished fourth in a competition they won in its three previous editions.For Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie, the problem lies not in talent or tactics but in temperament.“We know we can play better,” McKennie said. “It wasn’t that we didn’t have control of the games that we played in. But at the end of the day, Panama andCanadajust seemed like they fought a little bit harder than us. That can’t be the case, especially moving forward, especially with being a year away from the World Cup.”Canada 2-1 USA: Concacaf Nations League third-place game – as it happenedRead moreCrystal Palace goalkeeper Matt Turner believes lack of exuberance translates into lack of execution.“There needs to be a minimum expectation of intensity, of fight, of passion,” Turner said. “What we had to do was clear and we weren’t able to execute it consistently over 90 minutes in both games – you know, critical errors, critical mistakes, guys not taking ownership in big moments.”Jonathan David scored the winning goal, breaking a 1-1 tie in the 59th minute. David received Ali Ahmed’s pass in the penalty area, took one touch to his left and unleashed a curling shot that settled inside the left post far beyond Turner’s reach.The result raises questions about the immediate future of the US program, and rewardedCanadafor a more adventurous game plan that sawLes Rougesgenerate more scoring chances more consistently throughout the 90 minutes. Canada out-shot the United States, 9-5, and took four shots on target compared to two for the hosts.“Obviously, we never really found a rhythm and were aggressive enough in the attack to create enough chances,” midfielder Christian Pulisic said. “I’d love to find different ways that I can get the ball and make a difference. It just felt like I wasn’t able to really punch a mark on the game, which is always tough for an attacking player.”Despite the collective frustration, Pochettino maintained a calm perspective.“I think everyone saw and felt that after Panama and Canada, there are things we need to improve a lot,” Pochettino said. “I think we need to approach the games and the camps in a different way. But I say there’s still a lot of time to the World Cup. Now it’s time to be calm, analyze the last two games, and then, like I told the players, be sure you’re ready.”Yet Pochettino also issued a warning: “If we will be in this situation today, in one year’s time, for sure, I will tell you, Houston, we have a problem, no? SOS.”After the semifinal loss to Panama, Pochettino replaced five starters from that match’s lineup and used a different tactical formation.Instead of employing a three-man backline with wingbacks as he did against Panama, Pochettino started Cameron Carter-Vickers, Mark McKenzie and Max Arfsten along with Joe Scally as a flat back four. Scally was the only defender who started against Panama.In the midfield, Diego Luna entered the lineup and played in front of holding midfielders McKennie and Tyler Adams and McKennie, with Patrick Agyemang serving as the lone striker in front of attacking midfielders Pulisic and Tim Weah.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trainers applied ice to Davies’ right knee before he left. Nevertheless, Canada took the lead when Tani Oluwaseyi scored in the 27th minute.Ahmed began the scoring sequence with a cross from the left side of the penalty area to David, whose shot deflected off McKenzie. The ball fell to Oluwaseyi, who poked the ball home from the edge of the six-yard box.Canada’s Jonathan David: ‘If people say I’m the best in Concacaf it makes me proud’Read moreAgyemang equalized in the 35th minute. McKennie started the play with a long ball to Weah on the left flank, who avoided three defenders. Weah passed from the left side of the penalty area to Luna, who poked a short left-footed pass to Agyemang. The striker’s 11-yard shot deflected off goalkeeper Dayne St Clair’s right leg.Gio Reyna, considered one of the United States’ most dynamic players, entered the match in the 69th minute but made no impact.The United States now turns its attention to the Concacaf Gold Cup, which will start on 14 June and which could prove pivotal in the squad’s development.“I think for us, Gold Cup is going to be a huge, huge opportunity, not only to have more time with the staff and be together in the same environment, but also push each other and go up against these teams,” Turner said. “We can then right the ship and hopefully lift the trophy in front of our fans.”Explore more on these topicsFootballUSACanadaUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Tesla dealerships have also beenthe target of protests.The tech billionaire and close Trump adviser hasshown support for Germany’s far-right AfD party, theatrically brandished a “chainsaw of democracy” at a conservative conference, and accused Keir Starmer and other senior politicians ofcovering up the scandal about grooming gangs.However, analysts have said that the volatile sales are also likely to have been affected by Tesla’s overhaul of the Model Y.Felipe Muñoz, a global analyst at Jato Dynamics, said: “Tesla is experiencing a period of immense change. In addition to Elon Musk’s increasingly active role in politics and the increased competition it is facing within the EV market, the brand is phasing out the existing version of the Model Y – its bestselling vehicle – before it rolls out the update.“Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover.”The research company’s figures for February show that Tesla’s rivals powered ahead in Europe last month.Volkswagen reported a 180% increase in sales of battery electric vehicles to just under 20,000, while BMW and Mini sold a combined 19,000 such models last month.The Chinese-owned BYD recorded a 94% increase in sales in Europe to more than 4,000.

It’s about time. The devastating Netflix dramaAdolescence, about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl after being radicalised by the online manosphere, has drawn attention to the problem through the sheer force of its brilliant writing and a blistering lead performance from teenager Owen Cooper. Recently, former England football manager Gareth Southgategave a speech about the state of boyhood in the UK, specifically about how young men, lacking moral mentors, are turning to gambling and video gaming, thereby disconnecting from society and immersing themselves in predominantly male online communities where misogyny and racism are often rife. There has been some kickback in the gaming press to the idea that games have provided a less-than-ideal environment for boys, but even those of us who have played and enjoyed games all our lives need to face up to the fact that gaming forums, message boards, streaming platforms and social media groups are awash with disturbing hate speech and violent rhetoric.Honestly, we have known this for a while. The 2014 harassment campaign GamerGate, which claimed to be about a lack of objectivity in games journalism, but was really a reaction to increasing inclusivity and progressive thinking in game development, was a testing ground for the radicalisation of young white men by “alt-right” influencers and news outlets such as Breitbart. Many of the apparatus of online rightwing extremism, including mass harassment and doxing of victims, originated in that rancid cauldron, where female and LGBTQI+ game developers, and game-makers of colour, were made to fear for their lives.The last thing we need from politicians and lifestyle gurus is a blanket statement that boys need to stop playing gamesIt didn’t end there – toxic fandom has continued to dog the games industry. Developers of games who have sought to diversify their characters and narratives, or have simply delayed the launch of much-anticipated titles, have faced mass online abuse and death threats. A friend of mine, once the media-visible executive producer of a major game series, was forced to accept a police escort for him and his family for several days after fans of the game disagreed with several new features of the latest instalment. More recently,it’s been reportedthat members of the team working on Assassin’s Creed Shadows were told by the company not to mention their role in the production on social media in case they were targeted and harassed. Shadows received a huge online backlash when it was revealed that one of the two lead characters would be a black samurai. Trump didn’t come up with the idea of ludicrously misrepresenting the concept of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) to appease right-leaning voters – toxic game communities have been doing this for years.The worry, in the current maelstrom, is that the nuance of the problem will be lost. Even while condemning gaming communities that worship influencers such as Andrew Tate and Sneako, that belittle women and share “incel” and red pill philosophies, it is important to recognise the hugely positive roles that online communities can play in the lives of teenagers. As the father of an autistic teen, I have seen my son flourishing through contact with other players in games such as Minecraft and Warframe. The last thing we need from politicians and attention-seeking lifestyle gurus is a blanket philosophy that boys need to stop playing games or that all games are unhealthy – this isn’t about screen time, it’s not about getting boys to touch grass once in a while. We have to understand that our children are digital natives, as at home online as they are in any physical space – for many, there is no clear delineation. And honestly, if you’re shaking your head at how sad that is while spending hours a day perusing Facebook, Instagram or TikTok, then I don’t know what to say to you.What can be done? Of course, the games industry has a responsibility – just like social media companies do – to monitor its communities and make them safe. Robust online moderation and the use of AI to monitor in-game chat for key slurs and subjects, are a vital part of combating the problem. But in the long term, the problem of abusive, antisocial young men won’t go away until we get to the source. Many young men in 2025 lack a sense of direction, identity and purpose. Traditional careers are disappearing; social changes are challenging historical masculine roles; mental health services are hard to access; city centres are dying. Whatever the truth of the matter, whatever we want to say about privilege, the world feels openly hostile to them. And into this vortex, come online influencers who will harness, direct and ultimately monetise that sense of hopelessness and rage, pointing it at easily identifiable targets – women, immigrants, “libtards”, beta males, and yes, the makers of progressive video games.I have spent my whole career defending video games as a medium from those who seek to demonise the entire culture, but you simply cannot approach this subject without recognising that the games community – traditionally dominated by young men interested in violent power fantasies – is part of it.Young peopleoften come to games to escape, to become virtual superheroes, but their vulnerability and lack of experience makes them targets and victims. It’s going to take more than one brilliant TV drama to get society to address this pressing problem, but when it does, the games industry is going to have to be a big part of the difficult conversations to come.Explore more on these topicsGamesAdolescenceOnline abuseYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

Chief judge James E Boasberg of the US district court for the District of Columbiarushed to convenea hearing on the legality of the challenged action as two deportation flightsdepartedfrom Texas, followed quickly by a third. Moments after the judge ordered them to return so he could rule on a motion barring the deportation, El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele,tweeted: “Oopsie ... Too late”, with a laughing emoji, even as the court considered whether its order had been defied.The branch of government best able to uncover and safeguard both our noblest traditions and the simple truth in moments such as these – the judiciary – has beenhobbled and vilifiedby Trump and his allies, making wildly irresponsible calls for impeachment that put dangeroustargetson the backs of judges who rule in ways they dislike. Even mild-mannered chief justice John Robertshad to cry“foul”. The administration’s cavalier attitude toward courts that fail to do its bidding, exemplified by calls for Boasberg’s removal,seemed to confirmconcerns about a looming crisis.Trumpworld is failing this constitutional quiz. Can you pass it?Read moreBut searching for evidence of a “constitutional crisis” in the rapidly escalating clashes of the executive branch with the judicial branch misses the larger cataclysm taking place across the US. This president, abetted by the supine acquiescence of the Republican Congress and licensed by aUS supreme courtpartly of his own making, is not just temporarily deconstructing the institutions that comprise our democracy. He and his circle are making a bid to reshape the US altogether by systematically erasing and distorting the historical underpinnings of our 235-year-old experiment in self-government under law.What we are currently living through is nothing less than areorganized forgettingof the building blocks of our republic and the history of our struggles, distorting what it means to be American. The body politic is being hollowed out by a rapidly metastasizing virus attacking the underpinnings of our entire constitutional system. Make no mistake. This is how dictatorshipgrows.Symptomatic of that reshaping is the peculiar emergence, in a duet staged by the president together with the world’s richest man and Trump’s main benefactor, of aco-presidencywithout precedent in our republic and without even a hint of the irony in such shared power being propagated by ideologues whose mantra has long been the need for a “unitary presidency”.As staffers of the newly minted so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge)raidedcongressionally created independent federal agencies and foundationswithoutwarning and slashed entire programs without thought, the Trump administration stuttered when asked by the courts to explain who was in charge of the “department” that no Congress had created – and how the leader of that enterprise had somehow acquired the power of the purse that the constitution clearly delegated only to Congress.More than juststonewallingcourts and refusing to provide basic information on government activities, the Trump administration has waged war on history itself. Having first debilitated our capacity to act, it is now coming after our capacity to think. The same day Boasberg directed the administration to explain why it had seemingly failed to comply with his order, Doge staffersmarchedinto the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the agency responsible for funding many needy public museums, libraries and historic repositories across the country.Like Julius Caesar besieging and burning the Library of Alexandria, the Doge officials descended upon the IMLS to begin the process of gutting the public institutions dedicated to preserving and making widely available the shared memory of our past. It was none other than Benjamin Franklin whoseconceptionof public libraries democratized knowledge and made it accessible to ordinary people. What used to be the private province of the few became the public province of the many.In these dark times, Americans must harness the power of the civil rights movement again | Al SharptonRead moreThe attack on the IMLS is only the latest episode of the Trump presidency’s attempt to privatize information while replacing authentic history with a version more to its liking. As internet archivistsraceto back up the nation’s files and records, Trump administration officials have been systematically purging government websites in real time of the tools, concepts and language we need to act as informed citizens. In response to secretary of defense Pete Hegseth’s order to remove “diversity” content from the department’s platforms, the Pentagontook downpages about the Holocaust, September 11, cancer awareness and suicide prevention. So too, the Department of Agriculturedeletedentire datasets and resources that farmers relied on to identify ways of coping with heat waves, droughts, floods and wildfires. Websites belonging to the Small Business Administration and Arlington National Cemeteryscrubbedtheir platforms of photographs and references to women, LGBTQ+ individuals and people of color, including facts about American heroes such asJackie RobinsonorGen Colin Powell.Taken together, these events of the past few weeks reveal an alarmingly rapid collapse of what gives the United States constitution life and meaning. Its words may remain unchanged, but its role in our lives is crumbling before our eyes. Looking for a decisive explosion or a moment of crisis – what physicists call a singularity – in the chaotic onrush of presidential provocations is a fool’s errand, one calculated to disarm the resistance without which we will surely be doomed.The seeds of our ongoing disintegration long precede Trump’s rise to power. They were planted decades ago by strategic politicians who dressed rightwing ideologies in conservative garments, permitting the darkest angels of our nature to take hold and to reach a climax in fake claims of a stolen election that led to aninsurrectionin our country’s capital, followed first by the Senate’s abdication of its duty in Trump’s second impeachment trial (on the bogus ground that the trial had begun too late to give the Senate jurisdiction) and next by the US supreme court’sgiftingof Trump – and every future president – with a nearly absolute immunity transforming the office from one restrained by law to a source of virtually limitless power.Rarely noted is how this frightening power to ignore federal criminal law has been conferred not only on the president but on his legions of loyal lieutenants, from public officials to private militias. Because the constitution itself gives presidents an unbridled power to pardon others – a power Trump reveled in employing to free from prison the violent insurrectionists that he had himself helped unleash – we now live under a system in which any president can license his trusted followers to commit crimes to consolidate his power and wealth, making clear that a pardon awaits them should they face federal prosecution. The upshot is that privateers in league with the president can safely ignore federal laws criminalizing corrupt evasion of rules designed to protect public health and safety while they casually usurp powers the constitution gave to Congress, moving so fast and breaking so much that not even genuinely independent federal courts can keep pace with the mayhem.Trump’s imperial plan is now eroding the rights of people who thought they were safe | Nesrine MalikRead moreIn his iconic poem The Hollow Men, TS Eliot a century ago famouslywrote: “This is the way the world ends / This is the way the world ends / ... /Not with a bang but a whimper.” Rooted in our past, the anti-democracy virus has reached a fever pitch as it ravages the body politic and revises all traces of our history. It’s a virus we must fight with all the energy we can muster if we don’t want our system of self-government under law to die – not in a sudden explosion but with a quiet whimper.The tragedy is that too many politicians and organizations are caving in without afight, leading others to follow suit. With each surrender, Trump and his minions not only grow more emboldened but cement their hold on power by cracking down on all who dare oppose them in court, includinglawyerswho come to the aid of the administration’s enemies.Without more courageous leaders – including Republican officeholders who fear being primaried by candidates backed by limitless wealth – and without more bravery on the part of corporate CEOs whose fortunes can be threatened by Trump, elite lawyers whose business can shrivel if Trump targets them, and ordinary citizens understandably fearing online threats and worse, this darkness will be our destiny as we are reduced to mere memories and then relegated to the vast wasteland of the forgotten.Laurence H Tribe is the Carl M Loeb University professor and professor of constitutional law emeritus at Harvard Law School.

As the nation grasped for ways to slow these plant closings, I also wrote about Washington’s use of carefully employed trade measures, like targeted tariffs, and how they helped save some plants and jobs, especially in the steel industry.Carefully targeted tariffs can be a winning strategy, butDonald Trump’s obsession withtariffs– especially across-the-board ones that are neither careful nor targeted – has already shown itself to be a lose-lose strategy.Perhaps it’s too generous to use the word strategy to describe what the president is doing, because his tariffs seem based on fiat and whim, not on thoughtful planning.Trump is like Elmer Fudd with his shotgun, shooting every which way: Canada today, China tomorrow and perhaps Champagne country the day after, with tariffs imposed one day, suspended the next and then re-imposed a few days later, but, wait, those re-imposed tariffs might be canceled next week. It’s a “strategy” of chaos and capriciousness, with some viciousness thrown in.Trump is abandoning democracy and freedom. That creates an opening for Europe  – and Britain | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreObsessed as he is with tariffs, Trump calls tariffs “the greatest thing ever invented”, and“the most beautiful wordin the dictionary”. He talks as if tariffs will create an economic nirvana, but the opposite is happening. Stock markets are plummeting, corporate confidence is tanking, consumers fear higher prices and economists warn the measures might push the US into recession.Let’s count the ways Trump’s tariffs are a lose-lose proposition.First, at a time when Americans are feeling beaten and bruised from the pandemic-era burst of inflation, the tariffs – which are really a tax on imports – will inevitably push up prices. Trump’s tariffs will hit less affluent Americans hardest because they spend a higher percentage of their income on clothes and other imported goods. Many of those Americans voted for Trump, believing him when he said he’d reduce prices.Second, even though Trump boasts that tariffs will make American industry great again, it’s dubious whether Trump’s tariffs will do much to spur manufacturing. Trump has evidently forgotten that if you want to persuade corporations to build new factories – in this case, to bring back operations from overseas – then you need to reassure business executives that there will be economic and policy stability. But that’s the opposite of what Trump, the emperor of chaos, is all about. If you were a CEO, would you shell out $200m to build a new factory in the US in response to Trump’s tariffs when you know that Trump might lift those tariffs tomorrow or in two weeks or whenever a foreign leader flatters him or promises to let Eric and Don Jr build a Trump hotel at a beautiful seaside resort in their country?Trump is eager for hundreds of companies to build new factories in the US, but with his on-again-off again, here today-gone-tomorrow tariffs, he has made many stability-craving CEOs too scared to build new plants. Moreover, if Trump wants to attract the manufacturing industries and jobs of tomorrow, he’s been shooting himself and the US in the foot with his ideological war against the industries of the future, including electric vehicles, renewable energy and semiconductors. Trump is eventhreatening to kill Biden’s hugely successful subsidy programto build sophisticated new semiconductor plants in the US.Third, Trump’s tariffs are undermining economic growth; evenTrump’s team has acknowledgedthe threat of recession. His tariffs are sabotaging supply chains, and that will disrupt production at many factories. His scattershot tariffs are so alarming companies that many are hesitating on plans to invest in new plant and equipment. That also undercuts growth. In addition, the widespread fears that tariffs will push inflation skyward have causedconsumer sentiment to fall sharply. That could cause consumer spending, the major engine of the US economy, to decline.Any honest, fair-minded cost-benefit analysis will show that Trump’s tariffs will cause far more damage than gainFourth, Trump’s tariffs are hitting various U.S. industries hard. Trump’s hefty 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will hurt US auto makers by raising the cost of vital raw materials and making US-made cars less competitive vis-a-vis foreign automakers. Not only that, trade retaliation from Canada, Europe and China is already harming many US industries – including agriculture, motorcycles and Kentucky bourbon—and that, too, will push the economy toward recession. And let’s not forget that Trump’s tariffs are hurting the targeted countries, and that’s slowing their – and worldwide – economic growth.Fifth, another big way we lose is that Trump, by slapping tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the European Union, has further angered and alienated many of our closest allies, and that comes on top of his disparaging Nato and increasingly allying the US with Russia. In this way, Trump may destroy the Atlantic Alliance, which has been pivotal for maintaining peace and prosperity, though not perfectly, since the second world war.Sixth, any honest, fair-minded cost-benefit analysis will show that Trump’s tariffs will cause far more damage than gain. Although Trump says his tariffs will“create jobs like we have never seen before”, economic studies have found that the tariffs Trump imposed in his first term failed to increase the number of jobs. Those tariffs created a small number of jobs in some industries, but retaliation and supply-chain disruptions caused job losses in other industries. Astudy by economistsat MIT, the World Bank, Harvard and the University of Zurich concluded that Trump’s first-term tariffs “neither raised nor lowered US employment” and didn’t “provide economic help to the US heartland”.In Canada, I saw how Trump is ripping North America apart – and how hard its bond will be to repair | Andy BeckettRead moreWith Trump’s tariffs changing day to day, it’s impossible to predict how many jobs those tariffs will create or destroy. Thus far, his tariffs have caused US stock markets tolose $4tn in value, and those losses could grow. If Trump’s tariffs were to create 100,000 jobs, which some economists say is unrealistically optimistic, the cost would be an astronomical $40m per job ($4tn divided by 100,000). If his tariffs created 10,000 jobs, the cost would be $400m per job.With Trump’s tariffs slowing economic growth, if they result in a 1 percentage point drop in annual GDP, that would mean a loss of $300bn a year in economic output. (1% of the nation’s $30tn GDP). If Trump’s tariffs yielded 100,000 jobs, the cost would be $3m per job. Or if Trump’s tariffs raise inflation by 1%, that would cost American consumers roughly $200bn a year – which would mean a cost of $2m per job created.Returning to Elmer Fudd, his goal was always to shoot Bugs Bunny, but his gun often blew up in his face by mistake.

Across the country, higher education is facing a crisis that threatens the entire vision of independence: a direct federal government effort to destroy academic freedom by controlling ideas and acceptable areas of inquiry. University leaders should be standing in solidarity with those who have been attacked to defend academic freedom and free speech. So far, all but five have been silent.The US president has made no secret of his intent to control what is studied, thought and debated. His administration sent a letter to Columbia University demanding sweeping changes, including placing the Middle Eastern, South Asian and African studies department under “academic receivership” for five years, abolishing the university judicial board, and centralizing all disciplinary processes under the office of the president. Such unprecedented intervention is blatantly illegal and a wholesale attack on academic freedom and free speech. On Friday, Columbiacapitulated.It is an embarrassment to Columbia, of course, but the embarrassment is not Columbia’s alone. The use of federal funding threats to control universities should be a five-alarm fire for the thousands of other universities, and yet the response from the majority of academic leadership has been silence.By my count, five university presidents have publicly condemned Trump. The president of Wesleyan, Michael Roth, has been the first and loudest,clearly expressingthe unacceptable nature of Trump’s attack. The presidents ofMount Holyoke,Delta Collegein Michigan,Trinity Community Collegein Washington DC, andPrincetonhave also made clear that what Trump is doing is unacceptable.The thousands of others who are keeping totally quiet know what is happening, and how serious it is; ina recent survey, 94% said Trump directly threatened academic freedom.The silence from university presidents is particularly jarring when compared with the swift and seemingly coordinated statements universities have issued on dozens of other issues – from US supreme court decisions to international conflicts to campus protests. Now that it comes to defending their core institutional values against a direct authoritarian attack, their collective voice is crickets.The reasons are understandable. If anyoneuniversity speaks out, they are scared Trump would pull funding. The president of that university will have to see the place they love and the people they are responsible for gutted by a $50 or $100 or $400 million cut, either to federal grants or scholarships. What if speaking out will change nothing? Why risk the all-critical research of their science faculty, important scholarships for their students, for a statement that might lead to naught?This is the grotesque genius of his attack on Columbia, which operated like putting a dead body on a car for all to see – so long as each university president sees their job in isolation, and their possible defiance in isolation, all arrows point towards silence. He wins without even having to fight.But what if he did have to fight? It is not at all clear that Trump will pull funding. He hasn’t attacked Wesleyan, Princeton, Delta, Liberty. This isn’t an oversight: he wants the ground of the debate to be at Columbia, to be conflated with Gaza-Israel, to be complicated by questions about protests and student discipline and the nature of Ivy League education.If he takes on the Big 10 schools, or a small liberal arts community college, or a Catholic university like the one at which I teach, or any school where there is no pre-existing major conflict, he will be more cleanly revealed as an anti-speech bully. The university presidents can have litigation counsel at the ready to file for a temporary restraining order if Trump pulls funding because of disliked speech, and they will win these lawsuits. Constitutional law is on the side of protecting academic freedom and political speech.I don’t want to sugarcoat it: Trump could cause real chaos, significantly hurt programs while the legal fight is going on, and scare off other alumni donors to a school – who are themselves scared. If they spoke up alone, it’s possible it wouldn’t matter. I understand why university presidents are so trepidatious – he could truly wreck havoc on the people that they have pledged to care for.But it is precisely because of this dilemma that each leader is morally required to speak up – and to be prioritizing identifying others who will speak up as well over all else. It is an existential moment: standing by in silence as other universities get humiliated leads to all being humiliated.While it is far from assured that a single voice will lead to others, courage is courageous, and not only because of its natural infectiousness. The more universities speak up, the more obvious it will become that Trump cannot take on all of them, the weaker he will be, the more he will be revealed as an anti-dissent authoritarian. Trumpdoescare how popular he is, and it matters for his leverage in Congress, too. He ran in part onfreeing speech; the more it is clear he is imprisoning it, the worse he’ll do.This red scare will not end with an appeal to decency that is seen around the country on national television. Trump is worse than McCarthy; he is more powerful, more vengeful, and more determined to destroy institutions and bend them into subservience. But it can end with collective bravery. If they can find a way to share methodology for financial aid, they can find a way to share a rebuke to Trump.To be sure, the reputational power of universities is low, and university presidents have little faith that they have any meaningful political power. Their weak reputations came about in part because ofilliberalism in the last 10 years, brought on in part by arhetoric of student safety trumping free discourse, and in part because of theungodly cost of tuition. The recentprice-fixing lawsuitshaven’t helped.The US is poised to use terror laws against students. This could be worse than McCarthyism | Thomas Anthony Durkin and Bernard HarcourtRead moreThat leads me to wonder whether there might be other reasons university presidents are so quiet; more mundane, human, contextual ones. They tend to be trained in thinking strategically when virtue ethics is what is called for; game theory has a way of demanding data points that no one has. Or perhaps, after making too many statements on too many topics in the 2018-2022 period, presidents may be exhausted and annoyed when they are told that speaking out is a moral imperative. They have been turning towards institutional neutrality in most policy issues, tired of being told that every crisis demands a university president voice – one last call demanding courage can feel like overload, overwrought and irrelevant.The reason this is different is because the government is attacking free speech and free inquiry itself. The current collective cowardice is self-defeating. Their refusal to stand together now only makes them more vulnerable in the future, and less credible when they say they are privately resisting. How can we trust they aren’t complying in advance, reshaping their curriculum and research dollars to avoid retribution? We can’t.If university leaders, some of the most privileged people in our society, allow themselves to be bullied and blackmailed, and refuse to coordinate with each other on courage, how do we expect any other institutions – law firms, non-profits, businesses – to stand up?Zephyr Teachout is an American attorney, author, political candidate, and professor of law specializing in democracy and antitrust at Fordham UniversityExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpUS universitiesUS politicsUS educationUS campus protestscommentShareReuse this content"

All it takes is an aggressive new government in the stronger state and a relatively equal relationship of economic and military cooperation can suddenly turn exploitative, even threatening.Since Donald Trump’s second inauguration, this realisation has been dawning across the west, but nowhere more disconcertinglythan in Canada. Its border with the US is the longest in the world: 5,525 miles of often empty and hard to defend land, lakes and rivers. Canada’s two biggest cities, Toronto and Montreal, are only a few hours to the north, were you to approach them in a US army tank.Earlier this month, I spent a week in some of this particularly vulnerable stretch of Ontario and Quebec, visiting my daughter at university and encountering a new, more anxiousCanada. At times, as the trains I took crawled along the congested trans-Canadian rail corridor, the roofs of individual American buildings were visible, glinting in the cold sun across the border. The feeling of being a foreigner in a tense, contested place reminded me of when I lived in West Germany, near the East German border, during the early 1980s, one of the most fraught phases of the cold war.Until Trump started talking so insistently about making Canada his country’s “51st state”, that would have been an absurd comparison. But not any more. “The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country,”said the new Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, in his first speech as Liberal leader. “If they succeed, they will destroy our way of life.” Supposedly one of the most harmonious – and strategically important – relationships between rich western countries appears to have changed radically.The Canadians I spoke to, in shops, at bus stops and stations, at home and by email, were generally less dramatic about the situation than Carney, who has a reputation as a leader to establish, and now anelection to win next month. There was some anger at the US – and at Britain’s failure to condemn Trump’s threats against a Commonwealth country. “The king is proud to align himself with a despot for … a dangled trade agreement,” a Montreal academic told me, referring to King Charles’srecent invitation to Trump to make a second state visit to Britain. “A bold response from us in Canada would be to cut our ties with the monarchy.”More often, however, people shook their heads or rolled their eyes at Trump’s behaviour. He was crazy, chaotic, totally inconsistent, people told me – not like a steady and realistic Canadian, they implied. There were satisfied smiles at the tariff-drivenslide in the US stock market.And yet, people also said, Trump’s threats meant that Canadian life would have to change profoundly. Though what those changes might be was a topic they generally avoided – except for a baker in Montreal, who sold me some sourdough while we discussed whether Canada would need to get nuclear weapons.Relations between America and Canada have not always been peaceful. The US invaded Canada in 1775 and 1812, without success. During the 1920s and 1930s it drew up a more hypothetical invasion scheme, War Plan Red. In fundamental ways, fear of the US shaped Canada, encouraging its unification out of what had originally been disparate territories, and also the decision to site its capital in Ottawa, further from the border than its other eastern cities.As in Britain, in the mid-20th century the Canadian state sought to create what it called a “special relationship” with the US. Canada’s export-oriented economy – necessary because of the country’s relatively small and scattered population – got access to US markets. US businesses got access to prosperous Canadian consumers, often close to America’s manufacturing heartlands. During the cold war, both countries saw Canada as a key place to build defences against Russian attack.With Trump seemingly much closer to Moscow than Ottawa, that North American alliance may in effect be dead. By area, Canada is the world’s second-biggest country after Russia, but its armed forces are tiny, about half the size of Britain’s. The feeling that Canada has been abandoned militarily by the US possibly explains the huge “Fuck Trump” flag I saw flying from the back of a pickup truck in the usually polite city of Kingston, Ontario, home of the Royal Military College of Canada.Economic ties will take longer to unravel. There were still California carrots on Montreal supermarket shelves, and my trains were passed by endless goods wagons from the famous old American freight company Union Pacific. Yet the number of Canadians visiting the US is already plummeting: last month it was as low as during the latter stages of the pandemic. In this, as in much else, Canada may be an early adopter of new habits regarding the US which then spread across what is left of the liberal west. For left-leaning foreigners, Americana and American places may lose much of their appeal, because the US has been made so authoritarian and hostile to outsiders by such a quintessentially American figure.Canada is self-consciously following another path. “Canada is a mosaic,” says Carney, and pro-diversity messages pour out of its government and businesses, as if calculated to wind up US conservatives. As well as vast, increasingly coveted supplies of water and minerals, Canada – despite its considerable inequalities and very heavy per capita carbon footprint – offers an increasingly different model of how to live on the North American continent.Will Trump or any hard-right successors in the White House allow this provocation to continue? Another US invasion may not actually be imminent. Trump already has too many ambitious policy goals. Conquering, let alone occupying, as enormous and physically extreme a country as Canada would be an intimidating prospect even for the fantasy-driven Republicans.Yet it’s equally hard to imagine US-Canadian relations returning quickly to their former state. Too many imbalances and contrasts between the countries have been pointed out, too many threats offered. Trust has been lost. Political careers are being made on both sides by acting tough towards the neighbouring government.Canadians are less known than Americans for flying the flag, but there were a lot of them fluttering along the border this month. It may be many years before they come down.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionUS politicsDonald TrumpMark CarneyUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Repressive policing, methods of detention and controlling dissent, forcing humans to produce goods and services for overlords in the metropolis, or even mass enslavement and killing: all “boomerang” back into that metropolis. First, they are used against those who are seen as inferior; then, they are deployed even against those citizens with full rights and privileges if they dare to question authority. In short, the remote other eventually becomes the intimate familiar.Donald Trump’s second term has sofar been a case studyin how systems built for those whose rights have been diluted or taken awayeventually devour thosewho were assumed to be safe from such violations. There are three ways in which this process of rebounding happens. The first is through the creation of a domestic caste system that mirrors the one outside a country’s borders, as demonstrated in the recent treatment of those foreigners with permanent US residency and valid work visas whoexpressed dissenting views on Gaza.Under Trump, their actions meet a threshold of insubordination that justifies their arrest, detention and deportation. The human rights of those individuals, such as due process, are cancelled. In allying themselves with Palestinians and against US foreign policy, they are demoted to the level of those Palestinians in their treatment by the US government. The tenuousness of permanent residency, valid work visas, green cards, marriage to US citizens and parenthood to American children starts to become clear. These are all conditional rights that can be stripped away if, in your alliances and solidarities, you identify yourself as a subject of American power. You mark yourself out as a citizen of the periphery daring to ask for the rights of the citizens of the core.Trump’s invocationof the 1798 Alien Enemies Act is an almost too-on-the-nose demonstration of that two-tier system. Laws that were designed centuries ago, and have only been used to create legal vacuums on US soil in order to detain foreigners, create a second class of human. Franklin Roosevelt relied on the act tocreate domestic internment campsduring the second world war, in which more than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were detained. Another order that he issued, and that mandated the internment of US citizens,was only overturned in 2018. If it had not been, Trump would no doubt be using the law to extend arrests and detentions to US citizens for their political opinions as well.I am a Palestinian political prisoner in Louisiana. I am being targeted for my activism | Mahmoud KhalilRead moreThat legal infrastructure, no matter how dormant, is always open to reactivation and capture. A similar process unfolds within the workings of an immigration complex that is already opaque and reflexively punitive. The second rebound mechanism is via this sort of infrastructure. The US immigration system is a vast enterprise of bureaucracy, employment, detention centres and private companies thatchannels and imprisons immigrants. It is also a system that, even before Trump, was one of legal sinkholes and almost infinite licence. Border guards have the final decision-making authority on whether you enter the US, no matter what visa you are issued from an embassy abroad; customs agents have the right to search devices; and, if you are detained and deported,that whole processcan happen without you being given access to a lawyer or standing before a judge. Detention for many is astate of extended limbo.Combine a system so large with a regime that enables it while weakening the judicial and legal proceedings that act as a check on its worst impulses, and you have a recipe for overreach and impunity. On his first day in office, Trumpsigned an executive orderthat gave even more power to border officials to “identify all resources that may be used to ensure that all aliens seeking admission to the United States, or who are already in the United States, are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible”. With increased deportations of undocumented migrants being a flagship policy of Trump’s campaign, and the empowerment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to achieve that end, a practical and political dragnet has been cast so wide that it’s catching a lot more than intended. It is no longer only those whose skin colour, paperwork or political opinions throw them into uncertainty.Over the past few weeks,German tourists were arrestedwhen they tried to enter the US entirely legally through the southern border, and detained for weeks before being deported. Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen with a work visa, wasarrested and detainedfor two weeks but told to “mentally prepare” herself for “months”. AFrench scientist was denied entryto the US when his phone was searched and messages critical of Trump were found. Those who have been added to the immigration detention prison population, from Mooney toMahmoud Khalil, a green-card holder and recent graduate of Columbia University, testify to the state of detainees they met there. “Justice,”Khalil wrote from detention, “escapes the contours of this nation’s immigration facilities.”Which brings us to the third way in which the boomerang effect takes place – through the erosion of norms and standards, a cannibalisation of the very political systems meant to govern and protect those at the centre. On 18 March, Trump called for theimpeachment of a federal judgewho issued a temporary ban on deportations as ordered by the administration. The confrontation between Trump and the judiciary has precipitated aconstitutional crisisthat is shaking the foundations of US politics. The system of checks and balances – the equality of the legislative, executive and judicial branches under the constitution – is threatened by Trump’s open defiance and desired subjugation of all to the executive office. This is against a backdrop of thelimiting of academic freedom, theviolation of the first amendment, and a disregard for the US constitutiondescribed by expertsas a “blitzkrieg on the law”.In this, there is something that can be seen everywhere in regimes that either have or crave absolute power. In order to seize authority and run a whole country according to the interests of a sovereign, more and more parties must be disenfranchised and repressed. The imperial form of governance is the prototype of what is required to exert control in the presence of mass dissent. But all political systems with large components that subdue a significant portion of the population cannot continue without those components overtaking the entire machine. It is a simple, almost elegant fact; something like a law of nature. But a nation that withholds its best ideals from some will end up losing them for all.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS constitution and civil libertiesUS immigrationTrump administrationMahmoud KhalilUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

No wonder academics want outMon 24 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 04.23 EDTShareIn six weeks, the Trump administration’s “rapid scheduled disassembly” of American science has been as sharp and deep as its trashing of the US’s alliances and goodwill; Earth science,weather forecastingand early warning systems,medical research(includingcancer research),Nasa. Academic grantsmore broadlyhave been cut, paused and subject to review for a long list ofbanned words(including such contentious terms as “political” and “women”).This has caused universities across the country toreduce their intakeof PhD students, medical students and other graduate students, introduce hiring freezes and even rescind some offers of admission. More than 12,500 US citizens currently in other countries on Fulbright research grants recently had theirfunding paused,along with 7,400 foreign scholars currently hosted in the US, leaving themfinancially stranded. And, when it came to one foreign academic visiting the US, detaining them andrefusing them entry.Even more worryingly, the administration is specifically targeting some universities, including pulling$400m in fundingfrom Columbia University, and $800m from Johns Hopkins, forcing it tolay off2,000 people. Furthermore, the legally dubious arrest and detention ofMahmoud Khalil, and the cancelling of his green card, is sure to have a chilling effect on foreign students and researchers already in the US – and on the desire of others to go there in the future. As Christina Pagel, a German-British professor at University College London, writes: “This isn’t chaos.” Instead, the attacks on research appear to follow a three-pronged objective: to forcibly align science with state ideology; undermine academic independence and suppress dissent; and maintain geopolitical and economic goals.The Saturn V rockets that took US astronauts to space – and eventually the moon – in the 1960s owed their existence toOperation Paperclip, which brought 1,500 former Nazi scientists (such as Wernher von Braun, the former director of Nasa’s Marshall Space Flight Center) to the US. In the week after Donald Trump’s election, I wondered whether the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas may inadvertently get his wish (of a Europe that unified through opposition to the US) and suggested that Europe position itself to reverse the decades-longtransatlantic brain drainby welcoming highly educated American researchers and scientists who were sure to find themselves under attack. This time, there is no moral quandary about it, no Nazi pasts to ignore; only as much advantage to be gained as can be in a world where the EU must hold the ground for liberal democratic society, joined by Canada to the west, and Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to the east.To some extent, EU governments and institutions are already picking up on the opportunity. For example, on 7 March, the University of Aix-Marseilleannounced Safe Place for Science, a three-year, €15m programme to bring 15 American scientists working in climate, health and astrophysics to its campus. According to a university spokesperson, more than 60 applications have been received, 30 of them coming within the first 24 hours. The university indicated that it has been in contact withother universitiesand the French government about expanding “scientific asylum” on both a national and European level, and to help coordinate welcoming and relocating different researchers.I am a Palestinian political prisoner in Louisiana. I am being targeted for my activism | Mahmoud KhalilRead moreUS federal government spending on all research and development (R&D) totalled roughly$195bnin 2024. That sounds imposing, but let’s put it into greater context. As of 2023, US GDP was$27.7tnand EU GDP was$26.5tn, when adjusted for purchasing power parity. Taken as a whole, both polities are roughly the same economic size. Let’s imagine that the EU were to put real money on the table to lure science of all kinds out of the US and to the continent. It wouldn’t need to match $195bn, euro for dollar, in part because more than half the US total isdefence R&D, and the EU is already boosting defence spending …bigly. So, say it just picked a bold, round number that lends itself well to narrative, storytelling and headlines, and is enough to rope in the cuts happening in the US.A sum of €25bn a year would represent just under 0.1% of the EU’s GDP, and even less if the UK, Norway and Switzerland (all of which participate in the Horizon Europe research funding programme) were included. As it is, R&D spending in the EU lags behind the US – and a report ordered by the European Commission’s research departmentrecently recommendedmore than doubling Horizon Europe’s €95bn, seven-year budget. What I’m suggesting goes further, yes. But not only is it well within the EU’s ability to afford, it would ultimately pay for itself: research found that non-defence R&D spendingreturned 200%for the US during the postwar period.But let me push the boundary of fantastical again, and suggest that the EU may lure not just American researchers, but American universities themselves. According to theCross Border Education Research Team, US universities maintain 29 actual campuses in Europe (and far more if you include “centres” and study abroad programmes). There are dozens of American colleges and universities withenormous endowmentsthat regularly splash out hundreds of millions of dollars at a timeon new buildings. If US crackdowns (like therecent demandsmade of Columbia) on academic freedom, funding, and foreign students and faculties become more frequent, they may find the idea of second campuses in Europe tempting indeed.Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sure, she could have bought her own tickets, but how safe would she be in a mosh pit, with her approval ratings at58% against, 17% in favour? I would argue still pretty safe. I personally disapprove quite strongly of Reeves’s performance in the exchequer: her dispiriting, intellectually shonky defeatism (for decisions, apparently, that can’t be helped) and empty boosterism (for the growth she thinks she can conjure). Yet I wouldn’t dream of ruining an evening of bouncy pop by accosting her, which I’m sure goes for most Carpenter fans. I wouldn’t even give her a piece of my mind at some musically appropriate event, like a Billy Bragg concert.Heidi Alexander started a half-hearted attempt to defend Reeves in an interview with Times Radio, which turned into an absolute knee-capping halfway through. “I actually sadly haven’t been to see any concerts at all over the last nine months,” said the transport secretary, “partly because I’ve been very, very busy.”There are two counts against the chancellor. She shouldn’t have accepted the tickets; the fact that she did meant she wasn’t busy enough. On that second point, I’m going to lodge a tiny defence. There is no right amount of busy for the chancellor to be. Any attempt to publicly exert herself in the national interest would look like a stunt, yet keeping her head down inspires no confidence. Really, the only right way to be in this situation is not-chancellor. If, for some reason, you absolutely have to be chancellor, then it is probably safest, whatever you do, never to visibly enjoy it. This strikes out any association at all with Carpenter, and even a covers band in a local pub.Let’s throw in a third count against her: this error was far from forced. After theshambles of last year, with Keir and the Taylor Swift tickets (which hesubsequently paid back), Keir and the “designer” glasses (it’s a red flag when any politician has a “designer” anything), Reeves’s own admission that before the election she’d accepted a cash donation from Juliet Rosenfeld for her campaign trail wardrobe, and the endless discussions all of this sparked about whether the new government was really any different from the old, it should have been obvious that freebies are to be avoided until such time as the public has forgotten every politician who has ever been profligate in the 21st century. Nobody can say how long this will take. I think I’ll be wondering what Boris Johnson’s wallpaper looked like until I die.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves, appears on Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg.Photograph: Jeff Overs/PAThat can all be filed under “optics”, and should have been obvious to this political generation, who were raised to ask “how will this look?” first and “is this important?” some time later, if at all. There’s a whole other vexed area, that of “vibe” – there’s a reason why Tony Blair could ask Noel Gallagher to Downing Street and it smell like the winds of change, rather than frivolous nonsense from a prime minister who should have been concentrating on his government’s minimum wage legislation. When there is optimism in the air, when people are feeling prosperous (never mind for now whether that feeling was warranted or merely a debt-fuelled mass delusion), leaders almost have a duty to echo that by visibly enjoying themselves.Contrast that with the sight of George Osborne at the London Paralympics in 2012. The former chancellorwas booed by spectatorsbecause his austerity measures had already hit disabled people so hard, and the juxtaposition of him then basking in the glory of Paralympians’ achievements was too much to take. But there was an underlying sense, too, that no politician, least of all the chancellor, can talk about tough choices in their day job, then throw on their chinos and enjoy the weekend. There pretty much has to be no visible enjoyment until the tough times have passed. Which is to say, even if Reeves had paid for her tickets, the news of her attending a Carpenter gig would probably still have generated opprobrium, though it may have taken a less verbal, more grunting form.Really there’s no answer to this, except, no rock’n’roll (or country pop) until the good times are also rolling.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It looked at first like a typo, and I almost ignored it. But I pressed on the letters on my phone, which caused its meaning to pop up in a little box, like a window appearing in a wall. To limn is to “depict or describe in painting or words”.I was drinking cold coffee in my kitchen, andpreparing to write this column– my last. Because I knew that I would do the swan, a large, long-necked water bird had started gliding around my mind, so it seemed clear that the word limn looks like a swan: the tall l with the tiny flick of a dipped head, and the letters after.It can also mean “to suffuse with light”, or outline: the full moon limned the dark river and the white feathers of a swan upon it. Limn: it comes from luminare, to make light, and illuminate, as in to illuminate, or decorate, a manuscript.It was only much later, when I read the words “Farewell, all joys! O Death, come close mine eyes! / More Geese than Swans now live, more Fools than Wise.”, that I suspected I had written about swans in this column before. I had,in November 2022.Recently my mother told me she was worried that in the last two years or so, I had “lost some of my innocence”. This is the sort of thing mothers say as you are walking, perfectly innocently, to the movies, thinking of nothing but popcorn and wine. And it is the sort of thing they tend to be right about. Over the course of writing these columns, I have had a child, have lost someone important to me and have lost, then rebuilt, my sense of self. The swan song I wrote in 2022 was by a person who feels familiar, but separate, from the one that stood in my kitchen this morning.So it is exactly right that there should be two depictions of a swan: one before, and one after. After all, the most famous swan poem, Yeats’ The Wild Swans at Coole, is about this feeling of having changed between one year and another, and realising it because you see swans:I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,And now my heart is sore.All’s changed since I, hearing at twilight,The first time on this shore,The bell-beat of their wings above my head,Trod with a lighter tread.Swans, quite obliviously, sent Yeats into despair. And that is one of the very many magical things about people thinking about animals. Pick one – some will speak to you, others not, and you will know instantly – and it acts like a key or a guide. It will illuminate (limn) your own memories, otherwise doors wedged closed or opened at random, and poems, or books, or passages, or lyrics, or cartoons you once loved, or hated, or were confused by: all of these are living in your head, along with all of the animals. To think about a given animal, or insect, or themoon, orfish that singor fish thatportend doomis to remember old selves, to connect your heart to your tongue:Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor canHer heart inform her tongue, –the swan’sdown-feather,That stands upon the swell at full of tide,And neither way inclines.I have learned that people can feel so strongly aboutdaddy long legsorKomodo dragonsor alemmingthat if you insult that animal in your headline, people will defend it in the comments in their hundreds. That people will write to you to tell you the story of one particular spider that inhabits one particular shower, or to admit that they, too, have alwayspronounced anemone incorrectly. Will send you emails about thefrogs,robins,snailsandslugsin their gardens or tell you the price of abeaverin Canada ($2,000).Now, I am off to a new job. Writing these on a Monday morning, staring an animal in the eye, devouring all I can about anoyster, being paid to contemplate, for hours, the significance of anegg, has been meaningful and delightful.

Let’s have a clear planJagjit Chadha is professor of economics at Cambridge University and a former academic adviser to HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Treasury select committeeMon 24 Mar 2025 09.27 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 14.00 EDTShareBritain has a severe problem with its sluggish rate of growth. And while Labour wishes to tackle it, it is going about it the wrong way. The trend rate of economic growth has been successively revised down to just over 1%, which is less than half of our postwar norm. Twice-yearly incremental changes to tax and spending policy – such as thespring statement this Wednesday– will not meet the challenges of stimulating a sustained increase in the growth rate, which requires a significant nurturing of our intellectual and physical capital.TheBank of Englandand the government set monetary and fiscal policies respectively, and therefore GDP growth. These institutions, or rather successive bosses of the Treasury, chancellors, must then take much of the direct blame for our stagnation. Policy fails because it is not subject to sufficient timely independent scrutiny. While we are now beginning to understand the errors in policymaking since 2010, a commitment to examine economic performance earlier would help the UK move away from poor policy practice.Let me start with monetary policy. For most of the time since the financial crisis, the Bank of England’s interest rate policy has been ultra-loose. Low interest rates and the bond purchases programme (so-called quantitative easing, or QE) has stimulated a huge escalation in asset prices. And this has skewed wealth distribution towards those with assets, rather than those who live from income alone. Low interest rates have also allowed highly indebted firms, so-called zombie firms, to continue trading – but they do not typically invest in their workers or firm-specific capital. Both of these channels act to lower economic growth.In June 2023, the court of the Bank of England commissioned the former chair of the US central bank and Nobel prize winner,Ben Bernanke, to write a report on the Bank of England’s forecasting processes. Following thepublication of the reportlast April, we now also know that the Bank’s model and model team need fundamental reform as they failed in 2021-22 to understand the buildup in inflationary pressure. There is also the ongoing problem of the clarity and effectiveness of monetary policy committee (MPC) communication, which has meant that there has been excessive volatility in other interest rates as markets have often felt misled as to the Bank’s view. Monetary policy has simply been in the wrong space – too loose and opaque to understand.Simultaneously, government tax and spend policy has failed. Debt to GDP has practically doubled since the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was established in 2010 and the net worth of the public sector has also been in long-term and persistent decline. The basic problem with the fiscal framework is that it disincentivises public investment and research and development (R&D) as it encouraged successive chancellors to trim public investment in order to meet the fiscal rule for debt.Unfortunately, it is precisely these areas of government expenditure that have been systematically shown to stimulate growth in many academic studies. Successive chancellors have basically offered policies that favour existing structures and interests with minimal oversight, where what we need, for example, is regulatory reform of public-good providers and a consolidation in civil service numbers.As a result of these failures and in the interests of transparency, I would support an inquiry into QE, which seems likely to lose us roughly £100bn – and dwarfs the current concern in meeting the arbitrary fiscal rules. This is because the Bank is now selling the bonds it bought at a lower price than their purchase. It is also time to review the fiscal framework that has a fundamental flaw in its design: the use of the instrument of policy (debt to GDP) as the objective of policy. If we really want to bring about a better standard of living with fiscal policy, we cannot at the same time adopt arbitrary restrictions on its use.TheLabourgovernment has declared its aim to bring about a persistent increase in growth, but also to have only one fiscal event a year. But growth has stalled since July’s general election and the March statement is increasingly sounding like a second budget. We need to have a different type of spring statement: one that focuses on our plans and progress towards higher growth and a better standard of living. We do not need yet more incremental changes to tax and spending.The chancellor should commit to an annual spring statement that provides a thorough outline of the economy, which includes an analysis of growth prospects and policies being considered. Also, because economic growth is slow to change and uncertain, we need real-time markers, which are consistent with higher growth, so we can monitor progress.Reeves to reveal biggest UK spending cuts since austerity in spring statementRead moreLate last year, the Treasury finally published anarea of research interests (ARI) document: other departments had done so for years. The ARI sets out the economic issues on which the Treasury is hoping to encourage academic thinking and research. As such, the ARI provides a rather good scheme for the structure of the statement and may encourage the Treasury to commission or invite submissions. The report could easily be turned around by a new unit in Whitehall and ought to be reviewed by the under-resourced Economic Advisory Council, which at last count only had two, albeit excellent, academic members.The final document would be published on the day of the statement and form the intellectual basis for the chancellor’s speech, as well as encouraging a more authoritative debate on policies for growth. But most importantly, it would force the Treasury and the chancellor to take more direct ownership and responsibility for economic growth and living standards.Such an event would set the agenda for the autumn budget and have the considerable benefit of encouraging longer-term thinking on public policy. The advantage of an annual commitment to such a statement means that we will hear about progress since the previous year and so track success or failure.The clock is already ticking on a government pursuing growth; according to the latest numbers, the economy has stalled once again. We need to adopt a fundamentally different approach to our growth problem: open the windows at the Treasury and let in light and air.Jagjit Chadha is professor of economics at Cambridge University.

Change is good, but patient safety must come firstJeremy HuntThe biggest area of risk – in terms of lives lost and cost – involves NHS maternity units. Organisation upheaval must not distract us from what matters mostMon 24 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 08.04 EDTShareIwas the health secretary when NHS England was set up. Although there are advantages to depoliticising operational decisions, it has led to massive and counterproductive overcentralisation. The NHS has become the most micromanaged healthcare system in the world. Hospital chief executives are frequently working to more than 100 operational targets, making innovation and longer-term change impossible. GPs have about 80 of them. So as long asscrapping NHS Englanddoes not mean replacing bureaucratic overcentralisation with political overcentralisation, Wes Streeting is on the right track.But I am worried about something else being missed. In the huge blizzard of organisational change, there is a risk of eyes going off the ball when it comes to broader patient safety risks. In December, the charity I set up,Patient Safety Watch, published a report put together by a team of people at Imperial College London led byProf Ara Darzi. It suggested that if our standards were as high as the top 10% of OECD countries, every year fewer patients would die. Twelve out of 22 patient safety metrics have been going in the wrong direction in the past two years. It is a wake-up call about the tragedy of avoidable death, highlighted magnificently by Merope Mills in her successful campaign forMartha’s ruleafter the tragic loss of her daughter.Why is this a concern? Because right now, tens of thousands of civil servants are starting the process of reapplying for their jobs after the axing of NHS England. In 2013, I saw with my own eyes the upheaval this kind of structural change causes. So my plea to Streeting is not to let organisational upheaval distract him from the gritty business of making sure we improve standards of patient care on the frontline.A figure of 13,500 avoidable deathsa year isn’t just a statistic, it is 37 patients lostevery single day. Thirty-seven families whose lives are tragically and needlessly ruined. And a massive cost for the NHS because,according to the OECD, about 10% of the cost of modern healthcare systems is putting things right that should not have gone wrong. That is £15bn of savings no one would disagree with right in front of our eyes.The biggest area of risk is NHS maternity units. The bill for settling litigation claims for maternity issues has risen tonearly £2bn a year. In the decade up to the start of the pandemic, the NHS made real strides in reducing baby deaths and stillbirths, but the latest data suggests that they are going back up. Particularly worrying are the ethnic disparities involved: black women giving birth are nearly three times more likely to die than white women.A major investigation by the midwife and community activist Donna Ockenden intomaternity services at Nottingham University hospitals trustis uncovering some harrowing failures of care. But even more worrying is that those failures appear to be part of a pattern: she found the same issues at Shrewsbury and Telford in her 2020 report. Dr Bill Kirkup found similar things going wrongin his reports on East Kentin 2022 and Morecambe Bay in 2015.8:48‘Fix poverty, fix health’: A day in the life of a ‘failing’ NHSEvery one of those reports has identified preventable deaths, staff shortages and deep-rooted cultural failings such as an overemphasis on so-called “normal births” which in practice lead to delays in vitally needed interventions by obstetricians. It is true that overall staff numbers have been going up and theNHS long-term workforce planhas doubled or nearly doubled the number of doctor, nurse and midwife training places. But if we are going to stop babies dying or becoming disabled because of medical error, we cannot wait for the decade it will take them to come onstream.What then needs to happen? First, it is essential that improving maternity safety is part of the new 10-year plan as it was in the last one. That worked: between2013 and 2019, extended perinatal mortality fell by 18%– from 6.04 per 1,000 total births to 4.96 – equivalent to about 770 fewer baby deaths a year. We also need a system to make sure that recommendations from public inquiries, the independent Health Services Safety Investigation Body (HSSIB) and coroners are actually implemented. There needs be a central repository of recommendations with public accountability as to who is responsible for implementing which ones by an agreed date.Poor NHS maternity care in danger of becoming normalised, regulator warnsRead moreIt is also critical to put in place a turnaround programme for the 10% of trusts where maternity safety is rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). After theMid Staffs scandal, which saw hundreds of patients die as a result of poor care at Stafford hospital,Bruce Keoghled a national review of 14 NHS trusts with high mortality rates, leading to11 being placed in special measureswith high-level central support. Most of them were turned round fast. Maternity services need a similar intervention based on robust, independent inspections by a reformed CQC we need to see back on its feet.Finally – and most challengingly – we need a renewed focus on dismantling the blame culture that makes it difficult for clinicians to be open about mistakes and failures, and therefore make sure the system learns the necessary lessons. This problem has beenlargely cracked in the aviation industry, which has made dramatic progress in improving passenger safety. It has proved much harder in healthcare systems where death is inevitably a more normal occurrence. But no system has thought harder about the ethical issues involved than the NHS – if anyone can solve this, it is surely us.Tackling these issues cannot wait until after new and better NHS structures are put in place. If England had the same maternity safety levels as Sweden,1,000 more babies would live every year. Nothing would demonstrate better that the NHS really is turning a corner.Jeremy Hunt served as secretary of state for health, later secretary of state for health and social care, from 2012 to 2018Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The fact it even got to court reveals an alarming ignoranceMon 24 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 07.33 EDTShareIt was summer 2014. Driving back to London with my baby daughter after a day out in Waltham Abbey, I was waiting for a traffic light to turn green. Pulled up beside me on my right-hand side was a long-haired, long-bearded man on a classic motorcycle. He looked around my car, and shook his head in seeming disapproval. Suddenly – with absolutely no provocation – he roared out “FUCKING NIGGERS”. Then he jumped the red light and sped off.Every decent person could see that as a credible hate crime. But there are exchanges less clear cut, with motivations more arguable. How should society – and the law – deal with those?Earlier this month, without scrutiny or fanfare, theCrown Prosecution Serviceabandoned a lengthy attempt to prosecute a recent university graduate for her use, in a jovial conversation on social media, of the word “nigga”. The case turned on an exchange on X (formerly Twitter) on 27 August 2023, after Newcastle United had been beaten 2-1 by Liverpool. Jamila A, a 21-year-old Black British woman, in conversation on X with an African American friend and referring to the Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, quipped:“@******** i’m so pissed off let me get my hands on that fuckin isak nigga.”The tweet was picked up by a data monitoring organisation hired by the Football Association, and months after the tweet was posted, the police were at her door.She was taken into custody for questioning, subsequently arrested and charged with being in violation of theMalicious Communications Act 1988. After media interest, the CPS “downgraded” the charge to a violation of theCommunications Act 2003: to be heard in a magistrates’ trial, where a conviction was more likely.Would Sam Kerr have been charged if she were a man – or white – or straight? | Anna Cody and Giridharan SivaramanRead moreWhen contacted about the caseby the Independent newspaperJuly of last year, the CPS responded: “Hate crime has a profound impact on victims and communities. Being from an ethnic minority background does not provide a defence to racially abusing someone. Our commitment to tackling these abhorrent crimes through fair and impartial prosecution is unwavering.”But on5 March, after a year of causing Jamila A needless anxiety, thecharges were dropped. There was brief mention of the outcome on social media and among interested journalists. The world moved on.Still, there is an issue here, for Jamila was just the latest in an ever-growing line of Black and brown people to be targeted by a state that absurdly fails or refuses to understand the difference between stark and hurtful racism and the use of terms that have become common intra-communal parlance.Racism is a terrible blight. All robust effort should be made by citizens to protect their fellow humans from it. But context is important. As I see it, the authorities made the conscious decision to ignore the glaringly crucial context that these were just two young Black people conversing like two young Black people about another young Black person. They were not hosting a Klan rally, and there was nothing obscene or out of the ordinary in their conversation. It’s clear to me that the player was not subject to any incitement to hate at the hands of Jamila A. As her lawyers said in a statement, “No evidence of any party finding the tweet offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing had been provided”.For the benefit of the police and the CPS: the substantial difference between the biker screaming racism at my daughter and me, and Jamila referring to Isak as she did is not a matter of spelling or semantics but intent, history, culture and community. The biker subjected us to the words – and mannerisms – of white supremacy and dehumanisation. But that experience and the experience of a Black friend or even a Black stranger referring to me as or calling me the N-word are galaxies apart.There have been other misapplications of outrage and concern. Last year’s so-called emoji trial ended in the crown court acquittal of a Black man charged aftersending a raccoon emojito a Black Conservative politician on social media. The word “coon” has long been a viciously racist slur directed by white racists towards Black people. But there is also, among Black Britons and African Americans, the term “cooning” – a form of critique directed at Black people alleged to be collaborating with or pandering to racism in order to curry favour. Last September, Marieha Hussain,a teacher of south Asian origin,was acquittedof a racially aggravated public order offence after she carried a placard depicting Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman as “coconuts”: one of many forms of satirical critique used about visible minorities (and formerly colonised people) alleged to over-identify with the tastes, cultural practices and behaviours of their historical colonial overloards. District Judge Vanessa Lloyd ruled that the placard carried by Hussain was “part of the genre of political satire”. So, a heavily pregnant woman faced trial for obvious satire.All the instances involved the weaponisation of terms that are sometimes controversial, sometimes satirical, sometimes unpleasant and sometimes loving, but widely recognised and accepted as intra-communal language – and, therefore, have an entirely different communal resonance.They show the very hate crime laws that were designed to protect minorities are now being used to persecute them. For some, that may be the intention. But it erodes the credibility of the state to protect and police a multicultural society such as our own. The words and images in question may not have been kind, but neither were they reason for intervention by police officers and courts.Just as the word “queer” has been reclaimed by the LGBTQ+ community from the speech of homophobes, there has been a wider reclamation of oppressive, denigrative and dehumanising language. It comes from a place of community, kinship, shared characteristics and a history of oppression.And it is interesting, is it not, that there is no sign of such intrusive policing when the N-word as deployed by rappers is being used to generate billions in profits for large, predominately white-owned companies?There should be a conversation about this. Certainly, there should be a prosecutorial rethink. The law is based on statutes and interpretation, but surely its root is in common sense. There is enough real hate crime around.

As the last surviving Monkee turns 80, he remembers 60s fame – and what happened when the band broke freeMon 24 Mar 2025 12.08 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 12.52 EDTShareIn 1965, Micky Dolenz was an architecture student and jobbing actor in Los Angeles, doing the rounds of auditions for TV pilots. As a 10-year-old he had played the lead in a TV series called Circus Boy, but the former child star began to notice something odd about the jobs his agent was now sending him to: every one was for a series “about kids in a band”. He says: “One was called The Happeners, about a little folk trio like Peter, Paul and Mary. One was about a surfing band like the Beach Boys. Another was about a big family folk ensemble. Something was in the air, obviously, because of the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Four Seasons, Motown. Young people, who had disposable income, were being targeted.”None of those shows got made but a fourth audition proved more fruitful: it called for “folk’n’roll musician/singers … four insane boys” who looked as if they might hang around a hip Sunset Strip coffee shop calledBen Frank’s. Dolenz got a leading role, happily acquiescing to learn to play drums. “It was kind of the same as when I was in Circus Boy and they told me I had to learn to ride an elephant – ‘Great! When do I start?’”The series was green-lit and the Monkees proved so successful at parting young people from their disposable income that, within a year, Dolenz was unable to visit the shopping mall near his parents’ home in San Jose without causing pandemonium. “I go through the big glass doors and all of a sudden there are people running, screaming. I thought it was a fire. I hold open the big door and I’m going, ‘Slow down! Don’t run! Don’t panic! It’s all right!’ And suddenly I realised they were running at me. I was like, ‘Oh God!’”View image in fullscreenChild star … 10-year-old Dolenz in Circus Boy.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIt was, he concedes, a very strange kind of fame. He was playing a character clearly based on himself and also called Micky – the drummer in a luckless fictional band called the Monkees. “We lived in a Malibu beach house,” he wryly notes, “and every episode had us trying to get a record deal or trying to get a gig and never making it – which does beg the question of how we could afford a Malibu beach house.”But in real life, the band became one of the biggest in the world, at one juncture selling 6m albums and 5m singlesin four months. Or rather, they were actors pretending to be a band, in order to front a succession of records that they hadn’t actually played on. Initially at least, everything but the vocals was handled by crack session musicians. When their second album, 1967’s More of the Monkees, was released, the first they knew about it was when it appeared in the shops.It seems a deeply peculiar blurring of fantasy and reality, guaranteed to mess with an early twentysomething’s head. “Oh boy, oh boy!” chuckles Dolenz, tapping the side of his skull. “You don’t want to be in here sometimes! I think because of my upbringing in the business, I always attempted to separate the person from the persona. I wasn’t always successful, but that’s incredibly important if you want to survive. To some degree, I’ve always known that Micky the wacky drummer on television was who the girls were in love with – not me, Micky Dolenz, who grew up in the Valley. Now that’s easy to say, but sometimes very, very difficult to do. But if you don’t keep that separation, it can be disastrous. We see that happen all the time. An interesting, weird place to be.”It’s even weirder that Dolenz is still talking about the Monkees nearly 60 years later. They weren’t supposed to have such staying power. The TV show was cancelled in 1968 after two seasons. The big hits dried up around the same time. But here Dolenz is, Zooming from his holiday home on the Delaware River a few days after his 80th birthday, the last surviving Monkee, looking jaunty in orange-tinted sunglasses and a rakishly angled trilby. (Davy Jones,Peter TorkandMike Nesmithhave all died.) Rewind TV is now repeating the show in the UK for the first time in years, although in truth, some channel somewhere in the world seems to have been re-running the series almost constantly since it was cancelled. It was a mainstay of children’s TV in the 70s, while MTV’s repeats in 1986 proved so popular, they triggered the first in a series of Monkees reunions.View image in fullscreen‘The wacky drummer’ … with the Monkees.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThere is one sense in which the show’s longevity is surprising. You might have expected the music to last: from I’m a Believer to Daydream Believer, the big hits were exquisitely turned examples of the songwriter-for-hire’s craft. But the show is a kind of period piece, a last transmission from a more innocent era of 60s pop that was about to be overwhelmed by psychedelia and more serious-minded artistic ambition.Dolenz, however, stopped being surprised at the show’s durability decades ago. “It was about a fictitious band that wanted to be the Beatles, or the Stones, or whoever. That struggle for success is a classic theme in Hollywood movies and Broadway shows. It was more like a little Marx Brothers musical on television than a band – a little romp, laughing, singing, music, shtick. John Lennon first made that comment, ‘The Monkees are like the Marx Brothers.’ He was absolutely right. And the comedy wasn’t topical, nor was it satirical. So it stands up, it has legs.”He chafes a little at the suggestion that the Monkees were effectively a manufactured boyband, saying: “It was not a boyband. It was the cast of a television show, like when the cast of Glee made albums.” But Dolenz admits he was the member most comfortable with whatever the Monkees were: a showbiz pro, unbothered when albums appeared without their knowledge, or when the producers showed so little confidence in their ability to play live that they booked their first gig in Hawaii, “because back then Honolulu was like another planet, so they figured if we really sucked no one would hear what happened”.View image in fullscreen‘You don’t want to be in my head’ … Dolenz today.Photograph: Kat Tuohy PhotographyThis was not a view shared by all his bandmates. When More of the Monkees appeared, a disgruntled Nesmith broke ranks, publicly describing it as “probably the worst album in the history of the world” and bluntly telling a reporter: “I don’t care if we never sell another record … tell the world we don’t record our own music.”“Frankly,” says Dolenz, “I didn’t give a shit one way or the other. I don’t mean I didn’t give a shit about Mike. I did – and I knew what he was going through. He was frustrated because he was misled. He was not an actor, he was a singer-songwriter, and they told him he was going to write and record his own music. And basically, he was not allowed to do that. In the very early days of the show, he went to the producers with his guitar and played them a song he’d written that he wanted the Monkees to record. According to him, they said, ‘Thank you, but no thank you – it’s not a Monkees song.’ He said, ‘Wait a minute, I am one of the fucking Monkees. What are you talking about?’ But they blew him off.“So Mike, in his inimitable manner, gave it to an unknown girl singer kicking around town, Linda Ronstadt. The song was called Different Drum. It was a Top 20 hit. So he was terribly frustrated and I felt for him, and I backed him. He’s the one that told me not to go to New York to record the new Monkees single – and I didn’t. I went to England, where I met Paul McCartney for the first time. He invited me to a Beatles session for Sgt Pepper. So – no regrets.”For all that he viewed himself as an actor first, Dolenz seems to have rather enjoyed the life of a rock star. Some of the 60s pop aristocracy were a little snippy about the Monkees (the Byrds wrote the sarcastic So You Want to Be a Rock’n’Roll Star? about them) but most were not. Neil Young played on their albums. At one bizarre juncture, Frank Zappa asked Dolenz to become his drummer, but the Monkees’ record label wouldn’t give him permission. “I was sort of relieved,” says Dolenz. “I mean, you listen to his stuff and it’s like 7/13 time, you know, these ridiculous time signatures.”Dolenz took full advantage, knocking around with the Beatles, hanging out backstage at the Monterey festival and inviting its star turn, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, to support the Monkees on tour – on the grounds that “he was very theatrical and the Monkees was a theatrical act”. This had disastrous consequences: Hendrix swiftly quit, dispirited by the experience of performing Purple Haze to nonplussed teens screaming for Davy Jones.When Nesmith’s gambit paid off and the Monkees were allowed to write and perform their own material, Dolenz jumped in with both feet. He wrote their fabulous 1967 hit Randy Scouse Git, was the first pop artist to take delivery of a Moog synthesiser, and says his happiest memories of the band were recording their third album, Headquarters. They were finally permitted to have a say: “Pinocchio became a real boy.”‘Now it’s this incredible cult film’ … watch the trailer for the Monkees’ film Head.Dolenz has “absolutely no pains, no regrets, no pangs” that the series was cancelled. You could tell he was tiring of it from the final episode, which he wrote and directed. The plot involved TV controlling people’s minds via a symbol that looked remarkably like the logo of the CBS network. The episode was laced with references to marijuana, anti-war songs, and featured a guest appearance from Tim Buckley, debuting his exquisiteSong to the Siren. None of it seemed designed to part young people from their disposable income.Nor did Head, the 1968 Monkees film with a screenplay by Jack Nicholson, allegedly written under the influence of LSD. “We were looking to move on: we didn’t want to make a film that was a feature-length Monkees episode where Davy falls in love and the girl’s uncle is a crook and we have to save him and we sing her some songs. So Head was a little bit stream-of-consciousness. When they first screened the movie, it was not a typical screening. They had ‘movieolas’, with one of the five reels of the film in each and the idea was you could start watching the movie from any point on any reel.” He laughs. “It was a very, very 60s idea.”Dolenz sees Head as a film about breaking the traditional rules of Hollywood, which its producers and Nicholson would go on to do with Easy Rider the following year. “There’s a lot of breaking the fourth wall, a scene where I start talking to the director and say, ‘I can’t take this any more’ and walk off through the back of the set, through the typical Hollywood backdrop painting.”The Monkees’ Head: ‘Our fans couldn’t even see it’Read moreBut it was also very obviously about the Monkees and their discomfort with being, as one song from the soundtrack puts it, “a manufactured image with no philosophies”. It ends with the band trapped in a glass tank, being stored away in a studio warehouse. “It did terribly at the box office,” says Dolenz. “Nobody seemed to care. I certainly didn’t. But of course now it’s this incredible cult film. Every once in a while, someone comes up to me and tells me it’s great. Quentin Tarantino did, so did Edgar Wright, a wonderful director. It’s a very interesting little film.”View image in fullscreen‘No Monkee business’ … Dolenz in his producer/director role with Metal Mickey.Photograph: Phillip Jackson/ANL/ShutterstockIt more or less ended the Monkees’ commercial career. Tork left, then Nesmith. Dolenz and Jones soldiered on, then split in 1970. Dolenz says he never really had any further ambitions in music. He eventually moved to England and reinvented himself as a producer and director, famously directing the 80s kids’ show Metal Mickey. “No Monkee business,” he nods. “I remember that feeling, that moment when someone interviewed me and the article didn’t say, ‘Micky Dolenz, ex-Monkee.’ It said, ‘Michael Dolenz, producer/director.’ Not that I ever tried to escape the Monkees, but I carved out this different career, so when the Monkees first reunited in 1986 I was fine. I had no problem going back and recreating that character.”He toured, on and off, with various iterations of the Monkees until all the other members died. He still plays live occasionally, describing it as his “day job”, and seems as content with the Monkees’ legacy as he could possibly be. But then, he always was. He thought they were quietly groundbreaking. “Nothing like that had ever happened before,” he says. “We were on our own. We were long-haired weirdos on television. Back then, the only time you saw long-haired weirdos on television, they were usually being arrested.”Micky Dolenz: Live at the Troubadour is out now.

I missed out on my death scene in Jurassic Park because a hurricane destroyed the set in Hawaii, so I never got to go down and get eaten by a velociraptor. When Renny Harlin told me he was making a horror movie with killer sharks, and that I was going to be the first person to die, I said: “Great!” It was a good idea – once he’d killed me, it meant any character’s life was up for grabs.I had no idea I was going to be as wet as I was. I was in water for a month: it was kind of wild. For the storm scenes, they were dumping water down on us from towers, like big-ass waves flying everywhere. After Stellan Skarsgård has his arm bitten off and we’re out on the deck trying to get him on the helicopter, we didn’t know they were going to throw that much water. The rehearsals had been very different.By the second week, the water tank had become a giant pool of urineRenny HarlinAs a kid, you go to movies, you watch people die, then you play games where you act out death scenes of your own. You bounce off the walls and stagger around, fall over, pick yourself up off the floor, say something, finally fall down for good - give it a bit of James Cagney. I’ve had very varied deaths in movies, but everyone remembers this one. It was great being at the premiere, having not told any of my friends, and seeing them react. Usually in movies like that, all the black people get killed early, but in Deep Blue Sea, LL Cool J is the last one alive. That felt like a small victory.View image in fullscreen‘Maybe he’ll have the shark regurgitate me’ … Jackson in Deep Blue Sea.Photograph: Album/AlamyI’m making a new movie with Renny, the fourth we’ve done together, but I hear he’s also working on another one involving sharks. I’ve not had the call about that yet. Maybe he’ll bring back the shark that ate me in Deep Blue Sea and have it regurgitate me so I can come back and fight another day.Renny Harlin, directorThe screenplay reminded me of other films I loved, such as Alien and The Poseidon Adventure – people faced with a huge challenge in a contained space. We shot it with the water tanks that had been built for Titanic at Baja Studios in Mexico, constructing sets that could be sunk on a hydraulic platform. We had hundreds of crew and cast working in wetsuits, and for the first week everyone would religiously get out of the tank whenever they needed to go to the bathroom. But it’s horrible climbing in and out of a cold wetsuit, and by the second week, people only seemed to leave the pool for lunch. By then, it had become a giant tank of urine.I wanted the sharks on the screen. We knew about the problems the Jaws crew had with their mechanical shark, which is one of the reasons you see so little of it. CGI was still in its infancy in 1999, but we used it for some of the attack scenes, which now look pretty dated by today’s standards. We also shot some footage of Thomas Jane (who played Carter) swimming alongside real sharks in the Bahamas.A company in San Francisco built us fully remote-controlled sharks that would do almost anything we needed: a seven-metre model and two smaller ones. The big one had a 1,000-horsepower engine and must have weighed a ton, so although it was great to have something convincing that the cast could interact with, we had to make sure no one got in its way.Sam and I had become friends making The Long Kiss Goodnight and made a pact to carry on working together. When he heard I was making Deep Blue Sea, he called and said: “So who am I playing?” I thought: “Now I’m in trouble.” And we had to add the part of the CEO who financed the research facilities and pays a visit when things start going wrong.Sam’s death scenewas inspired by Tom Skerritt’s in Alien. Tom, playing Dallas, appears to be the hero until he suddenly gets killed halfway through. So that’s what we did with Sam – just as it looks like he’s about to lead the other characters to safety, we kill him in the middle of his cliched hero speech. At the test screening, people were screaming, then laughing. I had to fight the marketing team, though. They wanted to put that bit in the trailer. I said: “No! It has to be a surprise.”The 10 best movie shark performances – ranked!Read moreOne thing that didn’t go down well with test audiences was the original ending, where Saffron Burrows, as head scientist Susan, was one of the survivors. Deep Blue Sea presents sharks as innocent creatures of the wild and humans as the bad guys, messing with Mother Nature. Hundreds of test cards came back saying Susan deserved to be punished – despite the good intentions, her genetic engineering had caused the sharks to become smarter, leading to all the chaos. I also wonder if her upper-class-sounding English accent was a factor, in that American audiences felt they were being lectured.We had to fix that at very short notice – one day’s extra shooting, a few new visual effects, the shark gets Susan and LL Cool J ends up the hero. He wrote a song to play over end credits, too, and I directed thevideo, which is something I don’t usually do. We got away with having his character’s foul-mouthed parrot get eaten. I think the reaction would have been different if he’d had a cute little puppy.Deep Blue Sea is out now on 4K UHD and Blu-ray from Arrow VideoExplore more on these topicsFilmHow we madeAction and adventure filmsSharksSamuel L JacksonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I loved the feeling of making people laugh, but the thought of it being a job had never crossed my mind. A career started to snowball without me even realising and I’ve been delighted and astounded by that ever since. I’ve grown up in this job, and 18-year-old me would never have believed it possible.Who did you admire when you were starting out?Rob Rouse. To this day, if I see I’m on a lineup with him I’m buzzing. I’ve also been in awe of Ross Noble’s ludicrous genius since before I even started comedy.Any bugbears from the world of comedy?Promoters who don’t pay on time. People who act like if you’re not based in London then you don’t matter. People who won’t acknowledge that class is a huge hurdle in the arts. When you find out your train home is actually a rail replacement bus. Three-and-a-half-star reviews – go on, round it up to four. I dare you.What inspired your new show,Big Girl Pants?As some audiences have watched me grow up, I felt I had to recognise the milestone of turning 30. If my last show was about making the best of what you have, this one is about making the best of what is still to come.

Check my fly isn’t down and that there’s nothing in my teeth.Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?When I was first starting to get paid weekend spots, there was a particularly heinous crowd where I watched the other much more experienced comedians bomb so I accepted my fate. The whole thing felt like a fever dream. I remember checking my watch thinking I might be nearly done and I was only six minutes into a 15-minute set. I tried to leave without being paid then bought a pack of continental deli meat on the way back and ate the whole thing with shame.What have you learned from standup?To try to find the funny side of any situation. Life feels so much easier to navigate if you can do it while having a laugh. I also know the British rail network like the back of my hand, have learned how to get changed in a green room full of other comics without exposing yourself, and have an excellent knowledge of how to navigate on foot between most train stations, Travelodges and the nearest Nando’s.Who is your comedy hero?Russell Howard. I used to religiously watch Good News every week. He was the first standup I saw live, when I was 15, and I went to see him year after year. I remember I took a selfie with his poster after that first gig because I wasn’t able to stay back and meet him. Fast forward 12 years and we got to work together. I told him the story and asked if I could finally get my picture with him and of course he agreed to recreate the one I took with his poster. He was also lovely to my mam, so that’s a big thumbs up.What are you most excited for?Tonotbe at the Edinburgh fringe in August. I’ve only not been four times in the last 11 years, and two of those were during the Covid years so I could hardly make the most of it. It will be strange not waking up in a panic and checking a ticket sales report, but I am sure I will adjust nicely.You’re in a cab, the driver finds out you’re a comedian and asks you for a joke. What do you say?Even this hypothetical situation has me breaking out in anxiety sweats. I never tell taxi drivers what I do, and instead use it as an opportunity to explore what alternate versions of Lauren would be doing. Some days I am a teacher, others I am a nail technician. I fear the day will come when I get the same driver twice, and I’ll be mid elaborate backstory when he tells me: “I thought you worked in a supermarket?”Lauren Pattison: Big Girl Pants ison touruntil 10 JuneExplore more on these topicsStageComedy Q&AComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalRoss NoblefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will it ever go viral again?Stuart HeritageMon 24 Mar 2025 10.05 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 10.16 EDTShareLife has changed beyond all recognition over the last 67 years. The way we live, the way we communicate, the things we eat; if you were to grab someone from 1958 and bring them forward in time to 2025, the sheer scale of change would blow their minds. Except, perhaps, for one thing. Everything else might be unrecognisable, butBlue Peterhas always been broadcast live. Until now.It has been reported that the last live episode of Blue Peter has aired, ending a tradition that has endured for nearly seven decades. It isn’t the end of Blue Peter, which will continue, albeit in a prerecorded format, but it is the end of an era. The show may be an institution, but even the longest-running children’s programme in the world isn’t immune to change.The BBC has cited changing viewing habits as the reason for the switch, but that feels like code for something sadder. Blue Peter used to be watched by millions of children, all excited and eager to learn. But there are so many other choices today – not just on streaming platforms, but the monolith that is YouTube – and the staid, earnest, eat-your-vegetables approach taken by Blue Peter no longer holds the same appeal. In other words, it isn’t financially sustainable to put on a weekly live show for a declining audience that is more likely to watch it on iPlayer anyway.The BBC says that viewers are unlikely to notice much difference, because the show has been mixing live and prerecorded segments for decades, but plenty of people have pointed out that the show might lose some of the magic you only get with live TV. What they mean, I suspect, is that elephants won’t poop all over the floor any more.View image in fullscreenJohn Noakes with Shep, the Blue Peter dog, in 1978.Photograph: Photoshot/Getty ImagesThis, to some, is the quintessential Blue Peter moment; the episode in 1969 when a baby elephant called Lulu started acting up in the studio. Afterdragging John Noakes and Peter Purves around the floor, Lulu narrowly missed Valerie Singleton’s shoes with a stream of urine, crapped everywhere, then caused her keeper to slip on it and fall over.There have been other live catastrophes. In 1971, someone had the smart idea of having a campfire singalong, despite the show being filmed indoors. Dozens of Guides and Brownies looked increasingly worried as the flames grew higher and the studio filled with thick black smoke before someone rushed in with a fire extinguisher. A year later,Roy Castle’s attempt to play the spoonswas frustrated and derailed by Shep the dog leaping up at him and trying to join in on the drums. Also, let’s not forget the show’s 1966 attempt ata Dalek cake, the result resembling a sort of floppy sponge dildo. All these moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.View image in fullscreenLive in 2000 … opening the Blue Peter time capsules buried in 1971 and 1984, presenters from left: Janet Ellis, Simon Groom, Simon Thomas, Konnie Huq, Peter Purves, Valerie Singleton, John Noakes, Katy Hill and Matt Baker.Photograph: BBCExcept they won’t. One pile of elephant poo every 67 years hardly justifies keeping Blue Peter live and, besides, most of its indelible moments were prerecorded anyway. When John Noakes climbed Nelson’s Column in 1977 – without a harness, on some rickety tied-together ladders, on a windy day while wearingflares– it had been recorded. It’s also worth pointing out that prerecorded segments don’t have to be sanitised. In a filmed piece in 2008, presenter Andy Akinwolere was tasked with putting the star on top of the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree.He dropped the star,which fell 70ft to the ground. Blue Peter still kept it in the final broadcast.That is extremely heartening. Blue Peter may not be live any more, but it is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the show to leave all the accidents in anyway. If a presenter is recording an episode and there’s a power cut or a fire, or a zookeeper starts skidding around in piles of animal excrement, Blue Peter is smart enough to keep all that stuff in. After all, nothing gets more eyeballs than a cock-up gone viral. This might be the end of an era, but Blue Peter is going nowhere just yet.Explore more on these topicsBlue PeterChildren's TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the Scottish icon is honoured in a new stamp and a stirring musical, we separate the classy from the crackpotMark FisherMon 24 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 17.19 EDTShareIt is the UK’s largest body of fresh water, its volume totalling more than all the lakes of England and Wales combined. It is also the UK’s greatest source of daft stories. For the best part of a century, Loch Ness has used its monster-adjacent status not only to finance a healthy tourist economy, but also to generate a small industry in Nessie-related fiction, from the inspired to the crackpot. The Simpsons sent Mr Burns to do battle with the creature in an episode called Monty Can’t Buy Me Love. From the pen of poet Ted Hughes came Nessie the Mannerless Monster, who was tired of being told she does not exist. And indie folkster Matilda Mann has a song called The Loch Ness Monster, containing this advice: “Stay right down there.” Not wanting to be left out, the Royal Mail has just honoured Nessie with a fine, if rather unscary, stamp.To these slithery ranks we will shortly be able to add Nessie, a family musical written and composed by Glasgow’s Shonagh Murray andabout to premiere in Edinburgh and Pitlochry. Murray was reluctant to tackle such a familiar Scottish icon, until a challenge from her father drew her in. “I had just finished doing a couple of shows about the women behind Robert Burns,” she says. “I was joking with my dad that I needed to find something a wee bit less Scottish. He was like: ‘Oh, there’s loads of Scottish stories that have been told – but not to their full potential. You should do a Nessie musical.’ On a dare, I wrote an opening number. The more I was writing, the more I liked it. There was something charming and special about it.”I never met the monster, said the writer of The Secret of the Loch after her research, but I did find a wonderful whiskyDespite claims to the contrary, the story goes back no further than May 1933. That was when hotel proprietor Donaldina Mackay and her husband John, driving along the north shore of the loch, claimed to have seen a large creature on the surface. They said it resembled a whale and described it rolling for a minute before disappearing. Their testimony, reported by the Inverness Courier, set off a summer of sighting claims. At the time, thedinosaur-battling King Kongwas becoming a monster hit in cinemas, but here was a fearsome creature on Scotland’s very own soil (or loch).View image in fullscreenMr Burns and the monster … The Simpsons.Photograph: YoutubeBy October, the Scotsman newspaper, having gathered several testimonies, was declaring: “The fact that the loch does contain a creature much larger than any loch fish is evidently beyond all question.” People did question it, however – and only two days later, the same paper quoted a zoology professor speculating that the creature was a “large lump of waterlogged peat”. His view was countered by those who reckoned it was a plesiosaurus that had missed the memo about extinction.Any good myth needs a backstory and Nessie advocates were soon looking around for some ancient pedigree. Step forward St Columba who, in the sixth century, supposedly fended off a “certain aquatic monster” by making the sign of the cross. This took place at the river Ness and not the loch, but it was all the evidence they needed to show Nessie had staying power. No one dwelt on the fact that, according to Adomnán, the saint’s biographer, Columba had form on this kind of thing, having variously silenced a storm, raised a boy from the dead, and turned a pail of milk into a demon.“There are so many could-be-real sightings and so many hoax sightings,” says Murray. “But I like the not knowing. I like the mystery of it and the idea the natural world is playing a trick on us.”View image in fullscreen‘Terrible’ … an iguana as Nessie in 1934’s The Secret of the Loch.Photograph: YoutubeFilm-makers quickly jumped on board the Nessie bandwagon. Released a year after that first sighting,The Secret of the Lochwas a lighthearted romance that culminated in a young London reporter having an underwater showdown with Nessie. It was edited by David Lean, no less, and called “terrible” by its own writer, Charles Bennett, who co-wrote it with a woman called Billie Bristow. The pair went to Scotland for research, with Bristow declaring: “I never met the monster, but I found a wonderful scotch whisky.” The monster, meanwhile, was played by a young green iguana.View image in fullscreenRather unscary … the new stamp.Photograph: Royal Mail/PAFor all its faults, The Secret of the Loch set out what elements were required for this new genre. Choose pretty much any Nessie movie – from 2001’s appalling Beneath Loch Ness, shot mainly in California, to 1996’s Loch Ness, which is worth seeing for Keith Allen as a deranged Nessie hunter – and charge your glasses for a drinking game of monster proportions. Your task is to spot arrogant outsiders, stereotyped locals and sceptical scientists. There are bonus shots for unconvincing special effects, and if you plan to sink a wee dram for every terrible Scottish accent, you should first seek medical advice.In The Secret of the Loch, Frederick Peisley plays the cub reporter Jimmy Andrews, who is determined to get a story out of one of the few scientists convinced the monster is real. Even before he leaves London, Jimmy is trying out his highland flings and hackneyed Scottish phrases. Once he gets to Loch Ness, he finds himself in a low-ceilinged tavern where the drinkers are as cautious with their money as they are with their conversation.Much the same pub with much the same clientele appears in every subsequent Nessie film. But there is one change: it tends to be loud-mouthed Americans, rather than patrician Englishmen, who treatScotlandso condescendingly. Countless curmudgeonly locals are shown knocking back whisky, withholding hospitality and fighting ancient clan battles, while the sophisticated incomers sort out fact from fiction. A rare exception is the 1980s cartoon series The Family-Ness, which is told from the perspective of local children (not that you would know from the accents).View image in fullscreenKids are the key … final touches for the new musical Nessie.Photograph: Fraser BandAs the composer of Nessie, Murray is allowing herself to lean into the Scottishness, but with more authenticity. “It’s Scottish folk meeting musical theatre,” she says when we meet atPitlochry Festival theatreand look out at the rolling hills and the tree-lined River Tummel with its famous fish ladder. “We’re nodding to the heritage of where the story is. I came up here when I was writing and I would walk in the gardens and over the dam. It massively sped up my writing process. The music has a flow in the underwater moments and gives a grounding to the moments that need a callback to Scottish trad, rather than Instagram.”As the excellentMythillogical podcastpoints out in its Nessie special, The Secret of the Loch also established a trope about the scientific establishment. For belief in the monster to persist, a way must be found to dismiss any rational objectors, so nearly every movie features a diehard sceptic who is ultimately proved wrong in the most dramatic, tumultuous fashion, invariably by the appearance of the monster, rather fabulously in the case of that iguana.Appropriately, given the number of fraudsters who have targeted Nessie, another common plotline is forgery. In fact, many of the most accomplished – and certainly funniest – films have been about fakes. In their short film Another Fine Ness, the Chuckle Brothers turn the monster lore into a joke as they fake footprints and whip out a tartan glove puppet in an attempt to win a Nessie-spotting competition. Similarly, in the 1961 comedy What a Whopper,Adam Faithplays a hard-up writer who thinks he might find a market for his Nessie book if he contrives a sighting. As his scheme goes hilariously wrong, he comes up with this superb justification for his plan: “I had psychology on my side: theywantedto see something.”View image in fullscreen‘Interested in the difference between fact and truth’ … Werner Herzog in Incident at Loch Ness.Best of all is the mockumentary Incident at Loch Ness, a great cineaste in-joke in whichWerner Herzogis followed by a film crew as he supposedly makes a documentary called The Enigma of Loch Ness. “I’ve always been interested in the difference between fact and truth,” deadpans the director of Fitzcarraldo and Grizzly Man hilariously, as he asks his producer to find an “obsessed but credible” cryptozoologist to interview. His other requests include shots of Highland games, whisky, urchins and a “shepherd with a flock”. Herzog also has a thing about beards. The more he seeks the truth, the more his producer tries to fake the monster – and the more the “real” monster intervenes.Murray, for her part, is partly using the legend to question our relationship with the environment. “So many people are flippant and dismissive of the Loch Ness monster,” she says. “You’re more likely to buy into its magic through children. For Mara, our lead character, it’s about speaking up for the natural world that she loves – and cutting through the noise of the adult voices.”Nessie is at The Studio at Festival theatre, Edinburgh, 28 March–5 April; Pitlochry Festival theatre, 9 July–16 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageMusicalsScotlandTheatreFictionPitlochry Festival theatrePodcastingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The kids have come in during the holidays to be extras in a new BBC comedy drama, Crongton, set on a fictional housing estate.The 10-part series, the first episodes of which air this evening, follows Lemar “Liccle Bit” Jackson (Samson Agboola), a child who, as adults would recognise, is being groomed into joining a gang. But this is nothing likeAdolescence, the Netflix drama that has prompted endless debate about society and toxic masculinity. This is a kids’ TV programme. Adults are not invited.The show is an adaptation of a hit book series by the lauded novelist Alex Wheatle, who won the Guardian children’s fiction prize in 2016 with hissecond Crongton book. The BBC show arrives amid upsetting news for its cast and crew, as it was announced on Friday that Wheatle had died.“It is with great sadness to inform you that Alex Wheatle, our ‘Brixton Bard’, sadly passed away on Sunday 16 March 2025 after his fight with prostate cancer,” his family wrote in a statement posted on social media.The series writer, Archie Maddocks, who adapted the bestselling novels, says the books are darker and grittier than the screen version.It might be a softer version of the story, with bright colours and upbeat music, but the themes need to be hard-hitting to reach children in the digital age, he says.View image in fullscreenArchie Maddocks in Crongton.Photograph: Khuram Qadeer Mirza/BBC/New Pictures“The kids also know much more about the world than they did when I was younger because they’ve got social media,” says Maddocks, a comedian who also plays a teacher in the show.He says Crongton’s job, as well as to entertain, is to reflect the realities of children’s lives. “It’s a good way to get that message through without going, ‘The world is so dangerous. Don’t do this, don’t do that,’” he says. “Because I don’t think kids hear that. You give them room to work out their own conclusions. That’s a better way of teaching lessons.”The show uses a mix of live action and animation to help interpret situations characters find themselves exposed to. Some of them see in cartoons, others in 1940s film noir, while one girl, a wannabe dancer, sees characters dancing instead of fighting.The young cast, some of whom were found during an open casting call for people with no acting experience, echoes what Maddocks says.“It manages to cover different themes while also being funny,” says Seyi Andes-Pelumi, who plays Liccle Bit’s friend Rapid.Another young cast member, Noah Cox, who plays McKay in his first TV role, says: “It’s realistic, like people can relate to it.”Crongton trailer – videoAt the real-life school in Burmantofts where the series is filmed, 70% of the children speak English as a second language. It is in the most deprived ward in Leeds and one of the most deprived in England. For the children here, the themes are a reality. Liccle Bit’s multigenerational household, with a busy mother working to keep a roof over the family’s head, is normal.“Life is about choices, and if you make the wrong choice, it might come back to haunt you,” Liccle Bit says in the trailer, as we see the character offered money to do a favour for a gangster.Kelle Bryan, who rose to fame in the girl group Eternal, plays a family member of Liccle Bit’s, and says she was drawn to the show because of its potential to make a difference. “I took the job because I’m an advocate for social change and I really think this job is at the forefront of that,” she says. “These stories are critical for instigating change and getting in at a point where we can make those changes.“I think by the time they’ve got to 18, we’ve lost our young people. And the time we influence them is at the beginning of things – so while they’re at school, while they’re in education – and we’ve got more adult control at those points where parentally you’re in control of the dos and don’ts, where we’ve got more of a say in what that child can and can’t do.View image in fullscreen‘Programmes like this really seep into the psyche of people at that critical stage, at 12 or 13’ … Sutara Gayle and Kelle Bryan in Crongton.Photograph: Khuram Qadeer Mirza/BBC/New Pictures“I think programmes like Crongton really seep into the psyche of younger people, especially at that critical stage, at 12 or 13, where it’s pre-adult and they’re starting to make decisions that can take their life in one direction or another.”Bryan works with different knife-crime charities, including the Ben Kinsella Trust, named after a 16-year-old Islington boy who wasstabbed to deathby older teenagers in an unprovoked attack in 2008. The charity, set up by his sister Brooke Kinsella, the EastEnders actor, campaigns to end knife crime in the UK,a problem that is increasing.Bryan says it is “vital” that stories like this are being told. “There isn’t anything like it at the moment on television,” she says. “It’s got real credible heart to it. It’s told truthfully, so it’s not been sterilised for television.”She says the show harnesses the “adult voice” in young people’s heads, “where you kind of go ‘Mum wouldn’t like it if I was doing this, but I’m gonna do it anyway’.Alex Wheatle, novelist and ‘Brixton Bard’, dies aged 62Read more“He makes one decision. And he ends up down this pathway. And then when you look back on it, you can see it started then. This is how we ended up here. And that’s what’s important for children to see.”It is not an abstract story for Bryan. Her cousin was also killed in a knife crime. “He went to the shop to pick up the takeaway – it wasn’t even a chicken shop because chicken shops are stereotypically where black people are supposed to hang out, and I’m absolutely against that stereotype – so he’d gone to collect his takeaway, and he never came home,” she says.“He was a teen that never came home. I’m a living witness of the after-effects that have plagued that family and are still plaguing it today. Whatever I can do to shed light and change the narrative, I’m on board.”Crongton is on BBC iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionKnife crimeGangsLeedsCrimeYoung peopleChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Now the French film-maker is back – with a funny yet tragic story of lofty ideals, base passions and a lusty priestPhil HoadMon 24 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTShareThere’s a wonderfully frank clifftop scene in Misericordia, Alain Guiraudie’s new rural thriller, in which a priest seems to give absolution to a murderer. Not through some great act of clemency, though, but because of what he wants in return. “He’s a lot like me,” says the director, laughing. “He’s navigatingbetween his greater ideals and his desires as a man. I think a lot of us do that.”Morally flexible clergymen, vacillating killers, characters whose desires lead them into terra incognita – this is Guiraudie’s morally unstable terrain. Misericordia is the mirror image of his much-praised 2013 psychological drama Stranger By the Lake. Where that film made a murderer a dimly grasped object of desire, here the point of view is the killer’s. Jérémie stirs up dormant passions when he returns to his childhood village for the funeral of his former baker boss. In Guiraudie’s hands, it’s never certain whether a story will turn out tragic or comic. In Misericordia, it’s both: the film starts off in Talented Mr Ripley territory, before spiralling into bed-hopping, gendarme-dodging farce.Cruising hasn't disappeared, especially in France. We’re still attached to it, still got that romantic notionI’d hoped to meet Guiraudie in Aveyron, where he was born and where many of his films are set, but he’s upped sticks from the south-west and now lives in Paris. “After 20 years, I fancied a change of horizon,” he says, sitting in a brasserie near the capital’s Buttes-Chaumont park. “And also I was there less and less. My furniture may as well have been in a storage unit.”With a full head of silvery hair and well-hewn features, the 60-year-old still looks fresh from a hike in the stark Aveyron highlands, in his Polartec jacket, climbing shoes and headband. Through Misericordia, Stranger By the Lake and his 2016 comedy-drama Staying Vertical, he has broadened the scope of on-screen depictions of ruralFrance, something he thinks has narrowed since the 1970s.Mainly, Guiraudie likes to remind audiences that sexuality is just as rich out there as it is on the Parisian thoroughfare moving past our brasserie window. “The working class has become completely excluded from the representation of sensuality, of sexuality, of homosexuality,” he says. “There’s an impression those things only concern hot young people in sexy jobs. But it’s important to remember you can be a worker, or a farmer, and gay. Or not even gay, but with an erotic life.”The priest wandering into shot fully erect in Misericordia – surely a screen first – gets that point across effectively, as does the middle-aged sex worker cheerfully plying her trade in 2022’s Nobody’s Hero. It seems natural that Guiraudie is on intimate terms withla France profonde: he grew up in a five-house hamlet north of Toulouse with his parents on a small dairy farm. The claustrophobia of Misericordia – “where everyone is always making up stories about the neighbours” – is a direct lift. In such a place, the idea of making films seemed absurd: “It felt very far off socially and geographically. My parents always had a tendency to dampen my ambitions. By saying, ‘Careful. It’s not possible. You won’t get there.’”After dropping out of history studies in Montpellier, Guiraudie began writing novels, then realised they were closer to film scripts. He broke out of his inertia by describing it, writing a story about two layabouts in a village square bantering about some magazine project. Encouraged by a Toulouse producer to film it, he turned it into his first short: 1990’s Les Héros Sont Immortels (Heroes Never Die). He learned everything about film-making on the job, while working simultaneously as a night watchman. “It was the most thrilling period of my youth,” he says, “apart from certain great parties.”View image in fullscreen‘You give up a lot of your intimate self’ … Guiraudie.Photograph: Helene BambergerThe erotic action of Stranger By the Lake was focused on the titular cruising spot, its drama alternating between horny conversations at its nudist beach and pornographically shot tussles in the undergrowth. The film had a classical purity. Although it was rapturously reviewed, and was by far his most commercially successful, some American viewers felt it described a world that had been made obsolete by Grindr and the like. But Guiraudie points out that real-life cruising is far from dead – from Berlin’s Tiergarten to the actual lake where they filmed, Sainte-Croix in south-east France. “It hasn’t completely disappeared,” he says. “Especially in France, we’re still attached to it. We’ve still got that romantic notion of sex and love.”Even the film’s explicit sex scenes added to the Greco-Roman feel. Shot with body doubles, this was an area in which Guiraudie forced himself to take a head-on approach. “I wanted to face up to the representation of sex and of my sexuality: homosexuality. It’s complicated because you give up a lot of your intimate self and you have to ask a lot of actors.”For someone whose films are so carnal, Guiraudie is an unlikely sort of moralist, in his amused fascination with how best to negotiate the world. His characters, in their wayward navigation of their desires, seem constantly to be trying to locate the correct path – not that the director, as his films veer from tragic to comic, makes it easy for them. That appears to be Guiraudie’s take on how the universe works: a sense of unfathomability probably inherited from his Catholic education. Until he lost his faith at the age of 14, he insisted on going to mass himself, despite his parents’ indifference to it. He points out that Catholicism has the same kind of pragmatic accommodation to sex seen in his films: “It integrates the physical needs of man quite well. The proof is that forgives easily [via confession].”Guiraudie has torn up and strewn across the table his Kusmi tea sachet. He’s getting used to Paris, he says, a once-unthinkable notion: “I’m liking it more and more. I’m doing things the opposite way round to everyone else, heading off to the countryside as they get older.”Currently writing a new film, this Molière of the Massif Central is headed somewhere new in his work too: it will be set in France’s overseas territories. Not that us humans have any choice but to adapt. “My impression is that whatever we’re living through – amorous or otherwise – never lives up to our ideals.” He laughs once more. “Reality always smacks us in the face.”Misericordia is out on 28 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmStranger By The LakeFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The tragic story of Hyde’s young ancestors is directly referenced on the final track, Trimdon Grange 1882, on which the singer adapts words written after the explosion by “pitman’s poet” Tommy Armstrong. “I just couldn’t sing the line, ‘Be a father to the orphans, never let them cry for bread,’” the singer admits. “I just kept choking up.”We’re talking in the Peacock, the beautifulSunderlandpub that Hyde runs with family members, which houses an events space, recording studio and rehearsal facility. It’s a long way from coal mining, but the pub was previously called the Londonderry and its former name is still visible carved in the glass of one older window. “The Marquis of Londonderry owned lots of the mines,” Hyde says. “Mining’s this huge thing that has been lost, but the legacy is all around us.”The Futureheads man has done commissioned work before, from music for a colliery band to a prison songwriting project. For Miners’ Ballads, he says he felt “a deep responsibility to make it authentic, having never been a miner”. So he delved into archives to immerse himself in how these workers lived. “Imagine people going to work not knowing if they’re coming home at the end of the day,” he says. “They worked in virtual darkness and the job was to remove the walls around them. If a pickaxe released a pocket of gas, it caused an explosion. The other side of that is how the fear of loss bound communities together.”Similarly, adapting old mining songs and books gives the lyrics a genuine, vivid feel. “I found these great old songs about camaraderie, unionisation, love and disaster,” he says, “and it just became this epic storyline.”View image in fullscreenHyde at the memorial.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianHyde plays virtually all the instruments on the album and the eclectic mix of uplifting anthems, folky pop and gentle orchestrations captures the full spectrum of the mining experience, from tragedy to togetherness. For the haunting The Endless Ropes, he was inspired by Gavin Bryars’ remarkable track Jesus’ Blood Never Failed Me Yet (which features a loop of a homeless man singing) to put musical backing to ex-miner Jim Moreland’s chilling narrative about how a co-worker lost a limb in a mining accident. Hyde found the lyrics for rousing unionisation anthem Come All You Colliers in AL Lloyd’s 1952 book Come All Ye Bold Miners. “For the drums I channelled the energy of my dearly departed friend Dave Harper,” he says, referring to the drummer of Futureheads contemporaries Frankie & the Heartstrings, who died in 2021. “He was such a primal drummer.”In a way, Miners’ Ballads is the latest instalment of the unusual journey Hyde has been on since 2013, when the Futureheads took a few years out (they returned in 2019). First he became a pastry chef, having been introduced to finer cuisine by Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill when he produced their eponymous 2004 debut album. “He’d say, ‘Have you ever tried partridge?’” Hyde chuckles. “‘How about kimchi?’” Cooking became “an occasional hobby, then a job”, but after realising it wasn’t for him he then became a music teacher. He grins. “I remember standing in front of a crowd of kids in primary school who were all singing, thinking: I used to do this at Glastonbury!”He still teaches, but got involved in the Peacock after taking on part of the building to establish a music school; he was then offered the opportunity to renovate the derelict pub downstairs. “It was full of black mould and rats and had holes in the roof,” he says. You’d never know it now. After we stop talking we take a short, wet drive up to nearby Kelloe, where “William J Hyde, 26” is among the names on the memorial to the 1882 disaster. “A lot of them are buried under there,” Hyde says, sadly, staring at the stone column in torrential rain. “Because they never got out.” He admits that making Miners’ Ballads has been “a life-changing experience. What matters is doing something meaningful. I feel I’ve created something I can be really proud of.”Miners’ Ballads is out now on Sirenspire Records. Hyde performs Miners’ Ballads with Durham Miners Association brass band at Redhills Durham Miners hall as part ofDurham Brass festivalon 14 July.Explore more on these topicsMusicSunderlandFutureheadsIndieFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, despite the stream of criticism over its so-called “woke” credentials, figures reveal that it is proportionally more successful in “red” states that vote Republican than those voting Democrat.Overall, Snow White’s figures are well down on what Disney may have hoped for; the previously worst performing remake was the Tim Burton-directed Dumbo, which took $45m on its opening weekend in 2019, and finished with a worldwide box-office take of $353m. In contrast, remade films such as Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King all took over $1bn worldwide.Snow White’s chances of profitability are further hampered by the size of its production budget, a rumoured $270m after extensive reshoots – compared to Dumbo’s $170m, Lion King’s $260m, and Aladdin’s $183m.However, assumptions thatthe rows over alterationsfrom the original animation – including casting a part-Hispanic performer, Rachel Zegler, in the title role, replacing dwarf actors with CGI, and downplaying the prince’s role in the action – as well as outspoken political statements by Zegler criticising Donald Trump and expressing support for Palestinians, have led to the mediocre results, are not borne out by analysis of US box-office returns.A report in Deadlinesuggests that ticket sales and attendance overperformed in Republican voting counties in comparison to standard revenue patterns. Because of the preponderance of cinemas in Democrat-supporting urban areas, a family-oriented movie would expect 63% of its sales from “blue” counties and 37% from “red”. However, in Snow White’s case, the balance was tilted towards Republican counties, which accounted for 40% of ticket sales.Box-office analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore said in Varietythat family audiences were not likely to have paid much attention to the rows, and it was not likely to have been a significant factor. “In the case of Snow White, kids and families likely just wanted to see a PG film and [were] perhaps unaware of the controversies.”The film also performed disappointingly in international markets, falling short of its $50m forecast to accumulate $44.3m, afterreleasing in a swathe of countriesincluding France, China and the UK.Snow White review – Disney’s exhaustingly awful reboot axes the prince and makes the dwarves mo-capRead moreBox-office analyst David A Gross of FranchiseRe told Varietythat Disney will be hoping for a long tail and a gradual accumulation of interest. “It’s a soft opening by Disney’s historic standard. Success will depend on whether the film plays well for a couple of months like Mufasa recently did.”Mufasa: The Lion King started even more poorly than Snow White, with an opening North American weekend of $35m in December 2024, but went on to gross $718m worldwide.The same weekend also saw spectacularly bad figures for The Alto Knights, a period gangster film with Robert De Niro in a double role. Costing around $45m to make, The Alto Knights came in sixth, taking $3.2m from 2,800 venues.Explore more on these topicsFilmSnow WhiteFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Cronenberg said: “There was a discussion aboutAdrien Brody… [and] apparently they used artificial intelligence to improve his accent. I think it was a campaign against The Brutalist by some other Oscar nominees. It’s very much a Harvey Weinstein kind of thing, though he wasn’t around.”‘Something must have gone wrong with us’: David Cronenberg and Howard Shore on four decades of body horrorRead moreCronenberg referred to his 1993 film M Butterfly, in which John Lone plays Beijing opera performer Song Liling. “We mess with actors’ voices all the time. In the case of John [Lone], when he was being this character, this singer, I raised the pitch of his voice [to sound more female] and when he’s revealed as a man, I lowered to his natural voice. This is just a part of moviemaking.”The row originally erupted in Januarywhen The Brutalist’s editor Dávid Jancsó said in an interview with Red Shark that his voice was combined with the film’s lead actors Brody and Felicity Jones, using an AI tool to create a more convincing Hungarian accent. The film’s director Brady Corbet defended the practice in a statement, saying: “Adrien and Felicity’s performances are completely their own … The aim was to preserve the authenticity of Adrien and Felicity’s performances in another language, not to replace or alter them.”It emerged around the same time that a similar AI-created hybrid was used to enhance Emilia Pérez’s Karla Sofía Gascón’s singing voice; it was blended with vocals by Camille, the French pop star who co-wrote the film’s score.The issue did not appear to hurt Brody, who won the best actor Oscar for The Brutalist; however Jones, Gascón and Corbet failed to win.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe BrutalistDavid CronenbergArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Bradford Live, a new 3,900-capacity, city-centre entertainment venue, was splashed over the pages of local newspapers, made the subject of Facebook groups andeven afforded national headlines. Unfortunately, it was for the wrong reasons.The exceptionally well-restoredWest Yorkshireconcert hall was brimming with possibilities, but was unable to open in November as planned because there was no operator in place to run it.To make matters worse, it had been funded with £50m from the public purse – most of which was paid for locally by a council with a budget crisis.However, that chapter in the 95-year-old building’s history looks finally set to close, after a deal was struck with Trafalgar Entertainment, which runs 19 other venues in the UK including the Glasgow Pavilion and London’s Trafalgar and Olympia theatres, and Theatre Royal Sydney in Australia.Acts are being confirmed, staff are being hired, and there is a new sense of optimism in the city that the venue really will open within the next six months.“Generations of people have been coming here for shows, for the ballroom, when it was a bingo hall, when it was a cinema,” said councillor Alex Ross-Shaw.“Literally generation after generation has their own memories of this venue, and that’s why there was such a huge public campaign to save it. Being able to do that and secure its future so that the next generations can build those memories, it’s been really fantastic.”View image in fullscreenBradford Live was refurbished with £50m from the public purse.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe Midlands-based NEC Group pulled out of the original deal to run the venue in September last year, just months before it was due to open. Locals who had fought to save it from demolition were frustrated, and Ross-Shaw said it became “the biggest talking point” in the city.He was unable to say anything while the tender process was ongoing – and while the council dealt with a budget crisis and unpopular council tax rises. “But it’s great to be able to talk about it now and it’s all very exciting,” he added.Bradford has taken a beating when it comes to local authority cuts. Since 2011, £350m has been cut from its budget, and rising demand for council services has created a “perfect storm”, Ross-Shaw said.About two-thirds of what the council spends goes on social care for children and adults. The city is home to some of the most deprived wards inEnglandand poverty is on a scale rarely seen in other parts of the country. According to Ross-Shaw, the investment in Bradford Live amounted to 0.4% of the council’s overall budget.“If we don’t want to be completely relying on central government for the future of Bradford, we have to be able to generate our own revenues and business rates, grow the economy, grow housing,” he said. “Having a regeneration programme is inevitably going to be part of that, and Bradford deserves that investment.View image in fullscreenDarren Moore is confident the seats will be filled when the doors finally open.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“We saw that there was a need for the council to step in and provide that when the private sector wouldn’t. And obviously by doing that, we give the private sector confidence it can come in and invest in Bradford.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The late opening will also prevent the venue from capitalising onBradford’s status as this year’s UK city of culture.However, Darren Moore, the venue director at Bradford Live, is confident that the seats will be filled when the doors finally open.“There’s not another indoor venue of this size in WestYorkshire,” he said.“There’s a circuit of [similar mid-size venues] appearing. There’s one opening in Derby, there’s one in Hull, you’ve got one up at Stockton. So it’s a developing market.”For Sir Howard Panter, joint chief executive and co-founder of Trafalgar Entertainment, it is a project with something of a personal connection. He says he was brought up to believe the city was “the centre of the universe” by his Bradfordian father.Panter described the building as “world-class” and said: “The phone has been off the hook ever since it was announced that we were the operator.”He added: “I think it will unquestionably generate far more for the local economy than the local economy has invested in it,” citing research showing that a minimum of £1.40 is expected to be made for every £1 invested.“So I think, over the years, Bradford will be a brighter and wealthier and happier place because of Bradford Live.”Explore more on these topicsBradfordYorkshireUK city of cultureEnglandLocal governmentNorth of EnglandWest YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The battle between the government and the press, said Clooney, is a “fight for the ages”.“You see it happening at the LA Times, you see it happening at the Washington Post,” he said, in reference to protests by staff at the two titles at their rightwing owners, both of whom clamped down on the papers choosing to endorse a candidate at last year’s election.Clooney drew parallels between the events Good Night, and Good Luck dramatises and the difficulties faced by reporters in pursuit of truth today. The actor cited Trump’s $16m recent defamation settlement with ABC News, as well as the$20bn “voter interference” suit Trump filed against CBS last Octoberin which he claimed 60 Minutes had “deceptively edited” an interview with his rival, Kamala Harris, to present her in a more flattering light.View image in fullscreen‘A fight for the ages’ … George Clooney in the 2005 film version of Good Night, and Good Luck.Photograph: YouTubeSaid Clooney: “When the other three estates fail, when the judiciary and the executive and the legislative branches fail us, the fourth estate has to succeed.”“ABC has just settled a lawsuit with the Trump administration. And CBS News is in the process … We’re seeing this idea of using government to scare or fine or use corporations – to make journalists smaller.”“Governments don’t like the freedom of the press. They never have. And that goes for whether you are a conservative or a liberal or whatever side you’re on. They don’t like the press,” he added.Trump took to Truth Social to combat Clooney’s arguments, and to offer a broadside against the show.“Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total ‘puff piece’ on George Clooney, a second-rate movie ‘star’ and failed political pundit,” wrote Trump.“He fought hard for Sleepy Joe’s election, and then, right after the Debate, dumped him like a dog. Later, I assume under orders from the Obama camp, pushed all out for ‘Kamala,’ only to soon realise that this was not going to work out too well.”He then reiterated his earlier claims against the show, saying: “60 Minutes even fraudulently inserted Fake answers into her disastrous interview, aired just before Election Day, in one of the most embarrassing and dishonest events in broadcast history … And now George Clooney again? His press agent should be making a fortune!!!”Asked about his article asking Biden to step down as he felt he simply “cannot win”, Clooney, whose father was a journalist, said: “I’ll make it kind of easy. I was raised to tell the truth.‘George Clooney – who cares?’ Did celebrity endorsements actually harm Kamala Harris?Read more“I had seen the president up close for this fundraiser, and I was surprised. And so I feel as if there was a lot of profiles in cowardice in my party through all of that. And I was not proud of that. And I also believed I had to tell the truth …At the time, Trump hit back at Clooney for his article, calling him a“fake movie actor”who “never came close to making a great movie”.“What does Clooney know about anything?” Trump added. “Clooney should get out of politics and go back to television. Movies never really worked for him!!!”Appearing on Stephen Colbert’s talkshow last week to promote his play, Clooney was asked about his feelings about the defeat of Harris last year.“Well I don’t know, what am I supposed to do? Storm the fucking Capitol?” he said in reference to the 6 January insurrection, to applause from the audience. Without saying Trump’s name, Clooney also had a message for the new president, saying: “Good for you. I hope you do well because our country needs it, and we will meet you in 3.5 years and see where we go next.”Explore more on these topicsGeorge ClooneyBroadwayDonald TrumpTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

He will finally speak.”Depardieu walked past reporters and into the courtroom without saying a word, his hand on his lawyer’s shoulder, before the start of the trial around 1:30pm (1230 GMT).The proceedings, which are expected to last up to three days, were initially scheduled to start in October but were postponed because of Depardieu’s ill-health.Prosecutors allege that assaults against two women, whose full identities have not been revealed, took place during the 2021 filmingLes Volets Verts, or The Green Shutters.They accuse Depardieu of groping one of the women on the film set, pulling her towards him and trapping her with his legs before touching her waist, hips and breasts while saying obscene words. Three people witnessed the scene, prosecutors say.They say Depardieu groped the second woman on set and in the street.A lawyer for one of the women said before the trial that her client had been scared to come forward against Depardieu.“There’s a fear, because he’s a cinema giant,” said Carine Durrieu-Diebolt. “It’s a struggle between David and Goliath and they are afraid of retaliation as they all work in cinema but at a much lower level than Depardieu.”The lawyer for the second plaintiff did not reply to requests for comment.If found guilty, Depardieu could face a sentence of up to five years in jail and a €75,000 (£63,000) fine.Depardieu’s trial is the highest-profile #MeToo case to come to court inFrance.Explore more on these topicsGérard DepardieuFrance#MeToo movementEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Given that both were in the minor mode – the A minor, D784 and the C minor, D958 – together they constituted quite a serious, heavyweight affair for a Sunday morning recital.A pianist of graceful poise and sensitivity, Momen has a highly fluent technique that allowed everything to carry well in this acoustic. And, despite seeming a slight slip of a thing, to use an old-fashioned phrase, in these sonatas she showed that she could unleash considerable power in Schubert’s outbursts of high-volume dramatic tension, sometimes shocking in their immediacy. At the other extreme, her pianissimo was often pianississimo, so that lyrical lines, rather than quietly singing out, sounded understated and as a result curiously underwhelming. It was in the mercurial finale of the A minor sonata and the lilting, dance-like F major theme with its chromatic edge, poignant and piquant at every appearance, that Momen captured most expressively the happy/sad ambivalence of this composer’s musical makeup.That same tendency to play on vast dynamic contrasts was present in the C minor sonata too, the first of Schubert’s final three almost symphonic sonatas in which trauma and foreboding coexist with the consoling beauty of music. Again, it was the Allegro finale – febrile, fast and furious – that communicated best.Three pieces from Janáček’s On an Overgrown Path, No 1 Naše večery (Our Evenings), No 9 V pláči (In Tears) and No 10, Sýček neodletěl! (The Barn Owl Has Not Flown Away!) formed a neat tripartite sequence. In these Moravian-inflected melodies, Momen negotiated the balance of serenity and volatility in a way which resonated with Schubert.Momen has written abouther affinity for the keyboard music of William Byrdand this was manifest in her playing of his Prelude and Fantasia in A minor, MB 12 and 13. Here was fine rhythmic clarity and conviction, but with an element of playful fantasy too. It felt refreshing for being a foil for the big sonatas and, heard in this context was also, for many, an illuminating introduction to the Renaissance master.In recital atWesley Centre, Harrogate, 2 June ; atWigmore Hall, London, 8 JuneExplore more on these topicsClassical musicRoyal Welsh College of Music and DramareviewsShareReuse this content"

XX review – amazing film of battling 90s psych rockers revisited two decades onRereleased documentary study of the Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre is an epic story of success and failurePeter BradshawMon 24 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 09.02 EDTShareAfter 20 years, Ondi Timoner has rereleased her riveting and colossal documentary study of two psych rock bands, the Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre, and their epic dual story of success and failure. There is about 40 minutes of extra material and a present-day coda that reveals, among other things, that each band has a member who now sells real estate. That ending, brutally and suddenly visiting grey-haired middle age on these gorgeous rock’n’roll exquisites, reminded me of the Fellini-esque dream opening to Woody Allen’s Stardust Memories in which two trains, one carrying life’s winners and the other with hapless losers, wind up at the same dusty rubbish heap.Dig! XX, which took years to shoot, is alternately narrated by the Warhols’ frontman, Courtney Taylor-Taylor, and the BJM’s relentlessly goofy tambourine player, Joel Gion, and it shows the complex “frenmity” of the two bands. Almost from the outset, it seemed as if the Dandy Warhols were destined for commercial success tainted by feelings of selling out, and their pals the Brian Jonestown Massacre were heading for failure redeemed by a magnificent and self-destructive kind of integrity.All of them were devoted to the traditional excesses and entitlements of rock’n’roll and enamoured of their 1960s image; the BJM’s guitarist Matt Hollywood even affected John Lennon specs. But it is quite late on in the film that someone makes a very good point: “Sixties bands got into drugs. But they were famous first.” Nowhere in the film does any band-member reflect on the self-fulfilling prophecy of success and failure in their joke-names:Andy Warhol, triumphant and world-famous in the depthless world of celebrity for a lot longer than 15 minutes, and Brian Jones, dying young (or living for ever) after a mysterious accident in his swimming pool.‘We had even more fights than they show in the film’: how we made Dig! with the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy WarholsRead moreThe undisputed star of the film is surely the BJM’s leader,Anton Newcombe, a snake-hipped and bedraggled Adonis who provides pure on-camera gold with his outrageous behaviour, motormouthed self-pity and disdain for everyone else; the tone is set when he blows the band’s entire tour budget on sitars. The BJM suspect, with good reason, that the Warhols are jealous of their authentic rock’n’roll chaos; they live in the real thing which the prissier Warhols can only fabricate in their photoshoots, one of which takes place without permission in the BJM’s squalid shared apartment. The bands both tour endlessly, an ordeal of hardship and frustration, chasing the breakout success that only happens to the Dandy Warhols because they are the ones with discipline and don’t have full-on fistfights on stage. (Amazingly, gloriously, and also tragically, the ageing and reunited BJM have a public punch-up in 2023.)But does the rock’n’roll world camouflage the truth about Newcombe’s mental state and drug abuse? Do we confer the ironised title of damaged genius on him by not seeing his pain and unhappiness? He goes in and out of rehab, something the film can’t really show. And, for me, Gion is the other enigma: always smirking, gurning, wise-cracking – always on. Is there a hidden truth he is not showing us? A gripping and desperately sad story.Dig!

Not that you need reminding. Every corner of the internet, from Reddit to X, is desperate to point out that Jewish people are apparently in control of the banks, Hollywood, the government and, ahem, art criticism. That’s the price you pay for being a successful immigrant.And that success is nothing new. Swiss-French photographerHélène Binet’s latest body of work documents a sweeping array of opulent, lavish country houses owned or built by Jews across Europe. Bankers, textile merchants, stockbrokers, politicians, the story of post-medieval Jewry is a tale filled with an awful lot of high achievers, and they built themselves some seriously swanky houses. A selection of Binet’s images has been hung in the most appropriate of settings;Waddesdon Manor, the wildly over the top 19th-century weekend party house ofBaron Ferdinand de Rothschild.Binet’s photographs are quiet, austere but hugely detailed. Shadowy, stark, bleak images show ceilings slathered in cherubim and curlicues, columns carved to ornate perfection, and complex, chaotic marble. It’s not all overblown English romanticism. There are modernist masterpieces in Czechia, villas in Greece, Italy and Germany. The styles are as varied as the locations and the eras.No expense needed to be spared in building these houses. They were symbols of staggering success. But they’re also symbols of integration:Moses MontefiorebuiltEast Cliff Lodgein Ramsgate andBenjamin Disraeliremodelled Hughenden Manor in Buckinghamshire because they could, because they were accepted, because they’d overcome their basic and essentially vast cultural differences with the rest of British society. These houses say: “We’re here, we made it, we’re not so different from you.”View image in fullscreen‘No expense needed to be spared’ … Discovering Jewish Country Houses, Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire.Photograph: HELENE BINETHistory has proved just how hubristic that is, and the real symbolic power here is that time hasn’t been kind to most of these houses. The painted walls of theLiebermann Villain Berlin, owned by the painter Max Liebermann, are faded and pale. The ceiling fresco of Leopoldo Franchetti’sVilla Montescain Perugia is cracked and peeling. The mausoleum at East Cliff Lodge is all that remains of the house, the rest destroyed long ago.At the same time, the work doesn’t exactly tug on any heartstrings or have a big emotional pull because it’s hard to have sympathy, or really any kinship, with the super rich. Oh boohoo, you’ve got moss on the roof of your mansion, your caviar’s gone off. And that’s an interesting way to approach Jewish narratives, because so much of what we hear about in the history of Jews – from Schindler’s List to the works ofPrimo LeviorHannah Arendt– is told through tales of pogroms, destitution and desperate migration, of society’s most vulnerable groups facing untold suffering.This is more about empire building, about legacy and success and financial strength being accumulated and slowly falling apart. Each photo here depicts a mini Roman empire that flourished and soon faded; these are textile tycoons, banking magnates, capitalist pioneers reaching their pinnacles before, almost inevitably, crashing to the ground. The difference is that those empires were built in a hostile environment.This show inarguably works much better as a book than a small exhibition. They’re images that benefit way more from being studied in print than quickly glimpsed on a wall. And the photos are dwarfed by their surroundings at Waddesdon Manor, so it’s not a massive success as a show. But they are disquietingly haunted photos, filled with cracked plaster, crumbling stone, dusty floors and moss-covered dereliction. They’re portraits of grandeur and largesse, of what it means for an immigrant to not only make it in a new society, but to reach the very top.But they also feel like a terrifying warning that no matter how well you do, you can lose it all; no matter how accepted you feel, how much money you make, how much power you exert, you’ll never truly fit in. You’ll still be just an immigrant – just a Jew.Discovering Jewish Country Houses: Photographs by Hélène Binet is at Waddeston Manor from 26 March-22 JuneExplore more on these topicsPhotographyExhibitionsArchitecturereviewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s also surprisingly nuanced, thanks to its A-game performancesGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailLuke BuckmasterMon 24 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 24 Mar 2025 19.04 EDTShareThe tone of this gracefully crafted adaptation of Liane Moriarty’s bestselling novel is tender and mysterious, imbued with a soft literary quality. It’s mostly based on the fictitious Scribbly Gum island, a picturesque location situated close to Sydney, where property presumably costs more than the gross GDP of several countries and almost all its tiny population belong to the same family. Like every family they conceal secrets, but given this is a mystery-thriller – executive produced byNicole Kidman, no less – those secrets are particularly big and juicy.Across the show’s six-part arc, various skeletons are pried from the closet by a protagonist whose task is to interrupt the status quo and act as an agent of change. This is Sophie (Teresa Palmer), a likable journalist in her late 30s who inherits a property not from the bank of mum and dad, but from a rather less common depository: the bank of an ex-boyfriend’s relative who barely knew her. The reason the now-deceased Connie (Angela Punch McGregor) bequeathed it to her is one of several key mysteries, slowly and tastefully revealed.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAnother mystery concerns the disappearance many moons ago of a young couple whose baby was found and raised by Connie and her sister Rose (Miranda Richardson). The baby grew up to be Enigma (Helen Thomson), who, like the rest of the family, has cashed in on the mystery, using it to attract tourists to the island, where they’re welcomed with a pre-rehearsed spiel.Liane Moriarty: ‘I was wondering, “How is everyone on this plane going to die?”’Read moreQuestions abound. An enigmatic letter to Sophie, written by Connie, concludes with a suggestion that the protagonist may meet the love of her life on Scribbly Gum. We can’t be sure how to interpret Connie’s hippy-dippy prophecy – whether things will spill over into the magical. The series builds an interesting psychological space, brimming with thepotentialfor something fantastic. The windows to this world are open, and many things could drift inside.There’s quite a few characters to keep track of, each vividly written and performed. Assisting Sophie in her investigations is the initially hostile Veronika (Danielle Macdonald, recently great inThe Tourist), whose parents are Ron (Jeremy Lindsay Taylor) and Connie’s daughter Margie (Susan Prior). Enigma’s daughter is Grace (Claude Scott-Mitchell), who’s married to Callum (Uli Latukefu), and has recently experienced a traumatic birth. There’s also Sophie’s ex Thomas (Charlie Garber), who’s faffing about on the island, having been kicked out of his home by his wife.View image in fullscreenTeresa Palmer plays Sophie, an outsider who interrupts the status quo when she arrives on the island.Photograph: Mark RogersPerformances are very impressive across the board; in fact this is one of the best ensemble casts from any Australian TV show in recent years. The always reliable Teresa Palmer brings to the lead role a timeless, complicated radiance, and a face full of nuances and enigmas. There were times when I looked at her eyes and wondered: is that a twinkle of light or perhaps something darker, something haunted?

You can feel the walls between them; the scars that haven’t healed. The Last Anniversary is great at capturing the interpersonal consequences of events in and beyond our control: those things that draw us together and push us apart.Sprinkled throughout the series are some rich atmospheric embellishments. I was particularly fond of a surreal, sensitively staged scene in the second episode, where a character looks through a window into a room where an event from her past is taking place. It pipes intrigue into an otherwise standard flashback, fluidly merging timelines into a single mise en scène and using space to reveal information. The show might wrap up a tad neatly, but it’s still very well made: full of big reveals balanced by surprising details.The Last Anniversary streams onBingein Australia from 27 March and AMC+ in the US from 30 March.

As a young British-born Muslim with Pakistani heritage, Hussain found himself among those on the frontline of a renewed wave of Islamophobia and racial profiling in the UK. The experiences of growing up in the post 9/11, 7/7 era as a young Muslim man instilled in him a hysterical pressure “to change myself”, he says.Five years later, in 2010, West Midlands police started putting up CCTV cameras across Birmingham – 218 cameras were installed, some of them hidden – most in majority Muslim areas of the city.Project Championas the surveillance scheme was known, was dismantled a year later, after complaints from the community and an independent review – but the scars remain. Hussain’s exhibition What Did You Want to See? at Ikon is his visceral response to the ignominy of Project Champion, and the catharsis of coming together as a community in its wake.View image in fullscreenUnrecognisable sites … Gulzar-E-Madina mosque.Photograph: MAHTABHUSSAIN/Mahtab HussainThe show begins by reclaiming the gaze on the community from the suspicious, watchful eyes of the state. Hussain grew up between Druids Heath and Handsworth, and clearly remembers when the cameras went up – it was the same year he picked up the camera himself. In the summers of 2023 and 2024 he returned to photograph every mosque inBirmingham. The 160 photographs mimic the surveillance images, shot at a similar distance from the buildings as a standard security camera. But these pictures don’t pry. Arranged in a Becher-like grid, they are a typology of mosque architecture and community spaces. Some are striking for their ordinariness – housed in run-down residential terraces, and in one case, a former church. It’s in those unmarked and unrecognisable sites Hussain reveals what he means by the humility and tenacity of trying to blend in. When you turn around you notice a dusty reclaimed CCTV camera in the corner of the gallery, pointing right at you.View image in fullscreenMahtab Hussain.Photograph: Mahtab HussainHussain further explores this fraught tension between being visible and being watched in a series of new portraits. He is known mostly as a portrait photographer, and this new body of work sees him shift to more classical black and white to portray individuals from Birmingham’s diverse Muslim community. Though this exhibition proves there is much more to Hussain than portraits, this is still where he excels; particularly in depicting a certain kind of machismo. One male subject in a Canada Goose jacket scowls at the camera, his mouth curled, brow arched – Hussain doesn’t try to mollify or make his subjects appear vulnerable, knowing that these portraits allow people to be what they are, or at least what they want to be.A young man in a white vest postures and tugs at the chain around his neck, like a 90s pop idol; a labourer in black gloves lugs a tyre on his shoulder; an older man wearing a pakol hat smiles at the camera. There is no common fashion, gesture, skin tone – only their faith that joins these subjects. Perhaps the standout is Hussain’s portrait of his mother – poised with a cigarette, commanding beauty and power. Her gaze says it – I’m here to stay. At the centre of the show is a space with video instructions on how to use the mats and say the prayers provided. It is a reminder of the spaces that remain constant, the faith that is untouched by prying eyes.View image in fullscreenAllowing people to be what they are … Daddy Shaf by Mahtab Hussain.Photograph: MAHTABHUSSAIN/Mahtab HussainIf this installation looks to the future, the lyrical new film piece next door, made with the novelist and playwrightGuy Gunaratne, looks back. It’s a quick-paced, lo-fi mashup of archival and new footage, influenced by Derek Jarman and Arthur Jafa, telling the story of British Asians and Muslims. The narration is cribbed from legendary British-Pakistani actorZia Mohyeddin’s Here Today, Here Tomorrow, a film about the plight of the Asian community in Britain, made in Birmingham in the late 1970s.There are those searing flashes again, the sting of trying to fit in: childhood footage of Hussain’s family, performing in the school nativity play. A group of Liverpool fans belt out the Mo Salah chant: “If he scores another few, then I’ll be Muslim too.” The footage moves between soaring joy and shocking brutality, between racism and resistance. A young Rishi Sunak flashes up, talking about his lack of working-class friends; a man holds up the brick that smashed his face and shop windows in a racist attack. “Some of the English hope one fine morning they will wake up and find them all gone,” the archival voice of Mohyeddin says. It’s infuriating, galvanising and overwhelming.Mahtab Hussain: What Did You Want to See? is atIkon, Birmingham, until 1 June, as part of the Photoworks 30th birthday programmeExplore more on these topicsArt and designPhotographyIslamophobiaBirminghamInstallationPoliceExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Director and co-writer Chris Reading adopts a little The Office deadpan, some Shaun of the Dead bathos, a heap of Terry Gilliam, and even shoplifts a shot from Wes Anderson. If the resulting low-budget assemblage still bears these nametags and has the odd stray thread showing, it also has a persistent charm of its own.The ChaChaCha vintage emporium (whichreally exists) is limping along until owners Ruth (Ruth Syratt) and Megan (Megan Stevenson) stumble on a time machine in the form of a souped-up bumper car – and thus an infinite supply of merchandise from whichever epoch they desire. It transpires the gizmo was invented by Ralph (Brian Bovell), former presenter of a Tomorrow’s World-style TV show and now burnt-out stalwart of the Muswell Hill Science Club. Suspicious about their surfeit of “old but somehow new” stock, club president Martin (Guy Henry) warns them about abusing the device. Of course they ignore him – until a visual migraine of a wormhole opens up in their backroom.Where Syratt and Stevenson are note-perfect blase in their “interview” segments, connected by narration from Stephen Fry, Reading injects a serious fastidiousness and energy into the film. It’s particularly sharp on a particular breed of British hobbyism: not just fusty bric-a-brac hunters, but the petty territorialism of amateur clubs (incarnated in the tyrannically pedantic Henry), and the nerdy garden-shed inventor contingent who lapped up Tomorrow’s World. In the film’s parody of the show, titled The Future Today,Johnny Vegashas a nifty cameo as Botty, a fake android patronised by the presenters.Reading also gets considerable mileage out of Time Bandits-style miniature historical segments and deliberately cheesy vortex graphics that bring the film’s preoccupation with nostalgia into sharper focus. If it has an early tendency to lean into vibes rather than precision gags, it also later accelerates – as Ruth is forced to rescue Megan from the Unreason, a kind of interdimensional refuse tip – into madcap fun that comes close to outrunning its influences. Starring in this thrifty little triumph could be the best business decision Syratt and Stevenson ever made.Time Travel is Dangerous is in cinemas from 28 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsStephen FryJohnny VegasLondonComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Appleton is good on mother-daughter relationships. In the title story, Ana is alienated by the realisation that everyone around her is pregnant. As she obsesses about the breakdown of her friendship with Chloe, tormented by her upbeat social media posts, we realise there is more going on: Ana is projecting her pain about her bipolar mother and conflicted emotions about having children.In Road Trip, 17-year-old Allie hangs out with older friends. Her mother’s coldness is palpable when she picks up her hungover daughter. Driving home, they have to stop so Allie can vomit. Left there by her mother, Allie recalls other incidents of maternal cruelty: “How bad do you have to be to be rejected by the person whose body was your first home?”When photos of women eating go viral, the sale of voiles, mouth coverings, soarPositive Vibes explores how social media erodes one’s confidence and sense of identity. Lia, an art student, works in a coffee shop. She becomes obsessed with Sara, a local influencer, and her Instagram posts advocating positivity: “Like having a friend in your pocket.” When Lia realises that Cora, fellow barista and art graduate, has stolen one of her ideas and posted it on Insta (gaining prized followers), Lia’s meltdown is excruciating and darkly comic.The curse of social media is everywhere in the 11 tales: the scrutiny, the need to perform, the desire for “likes”, and relentless fear of being blocked. This is best exemplified in Shut Your Mouth: when photos of women eating go viral, the sale of voiles, mouth coverings, soar. Appleton’s wry observational style is well suited to these tales of young women navigating the modern world. She writes with empathy for her vulnerable protagonists, conveying their inner conflicts and deceptions.I Hope You’re Happyby Marni Appleton is published by Indigo Press (£12.99).

My older cousin would come round to play at my house, and she was a big fan of Britney Spears. She put on … Baby One More Time and I was like: “What is this song? I love it.” I watched the music video and fell in love with her.The first record I boughtI was a big fan ofK-popband BigBang before I moved from Thailand to Korea. I bought Taeyang’s first solo album Solar from Myeongdong, Korea’s famous shopping and fashion district where all the tourists go.The song that gets me up in the morningSnooze by SZA is not too slow and not too upbeat, so it’s really nice to hear when I’ve just woken up and am trying to get ready. Then I’ll put on a bit of Eternal Sunshine by Ariana Grande.The song I do at karaokeWhen I was younger, my friend and I used to love singing Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen. It’s a fun song.The song that makes me cryThere are a lot of different styles on my new album, but Dream is the only one that’s sad. It’s about a girl who can’t meet a certain person, so she can only dream about them. If you can relate to that, I guess it would make you cry, too.The song I know every lyric toEveryone knows the lyrics to Baby by Justin Bieber and Ludacris, don’t they? I think everyone was a Bieber fan when they were young. I met him a few years ago, but just for a quick hi. I didn’t tell him how much I loved him because I’m too shy.The song I can no longer listen toThis is a bit savage, but probably Boombayah by Blackpink. Not because of the song, it’s just that the dance moves are really aggressive. There’s a lot of whipping your head, so it’s really intense to perform.The song that changed my lifeI auditioned for Blackpink in Thailand by singing Ice Cream Freeze (Let’s Chill) by Hannah Montana, so Miley Cyrus. There must have been 1,000 people, so I never thought I would get picked. It’s a fun song and good to dance to, so I think it really suited my style.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Jenny is close to 16 hands, with stocky feathered legs, a flowing mane and gentle demeanour. I’m quite wary of horses, but as I watch her belly expanding slowly as she breathes, and notice her long eyelashes and velvet-soft nose, I feel entranced and completely relaxed.I’m at Westerlands, a regenerative farm in Graffham, in the South Downs national park, for a back-to-nature experience, staying in a new cabin and sampling an “equestrian wellness” session. Run by stable manager and equine behaviourist Elly Middleton, with wellness coach Gemma Peterson, the monthly workshops offer people the chance to spend time with horses, slow down and recharge (they can be tailored and booked privately, too).“We can learn a lot from horses, they are masters of mindfulness and deeply intuitive,” says Elly. “The farm’s whole ethos is about healing in nature. Just being with a horse can have therapeutic benefits, teaching us wellbeing techniques, such as how to be in the moment.”As I stand quietly by Jenny’s side, stroking her neck, her head bows towards mine – and I feel myself physically relax and my mind stillThe two-hour session begins with breathwork, meditation and journalling led by Gemma, before we meet the horses and are encouraged to connect with “touch, feel and smell”. As I stand quietly by Jenny’s side, stroking her neck, her head bows towards mine – and I feel myself physically relax and my mind still. It’s a simple but strangely powerful experience. We finish with restorative yoga nidra by an open fire and I practically float back to my cabin.A former racehorse stud farm (and seasonal home for polo ponies), Westerlands has been owned by the Jamison family since the 1980s. In recent years, it has begun to transition into a “regenerative farm”, managed for nature, with the aim of increasing biodiversity and protecting the environment. It is very much a family affair, with Antonia Jamison and her husband, Oliver, at the helm, along with sisters Emma (an artist who shares a studio here with their mother, Pamela, also a painter) and Mel (a herbalist who guides foraging walks).View image in fullscreenTimber Country, the new off-grid cabin where Jane stayed, has a covered outdoor bathThe family owns adjacent land on the top of the Downs, too, including nature reserves managed by the Graffham Down Trust. Bordering the South Downs Way, it’s a magical stretch of chalk downland and woods, with ancient yews, meadows and panoramic views to the sea. It’s all part of theWeald to Wavesinitiative to create a 100-mile nature recovery corridor across Sussex from the High Weald to the coast.To restore soil health, the number of sheep and cattle on the farm is limited, and just eight horses remain at the equestrian centre for trekking and horse connection experiences. Beekeeping (honey is for sale), planting edible hedgerows and rewilding are among the plans for restoration, along with hosting events and encouraging visitors to explore.“We’re very much on a journey to restore the land and create community, giving more opportunities for people to connect with nature,” says Antonia. “By giving nature space, we’ve seen a lot of changes in a short time, with more insects and birdlife already. Westerlands is a place of peace, and we want it to be accessible to everyone.”View image in fullscreenParticipants are encouraged to ‘touch, feel and smell’ the horsesCentral to the new model is a growing range of accommodation, from cabins and cottages to converted barns.Woodfire Campsiteoperates from one of the paddocks, with its outdoor kitchen creating delicious communal meals that all guests can join.I’m staying in the newest cabin – Timber Country – in a vast field of its own. Built sustainably with local wood, the cabin sleeps four and is off-grid, with sweeping countryside views and a covered outdoor bath (the Downs is a dark sky reserve and there’s a telescope to rent for clear nights too).This is a beautiful part of the world, with plentiful walks and great pubs (the Cricketers at Duncton is a favourite). Footpaths lead to Graffham village, Lavington Common nature reserve lies to the north, Petworth is 10 minutes’ drive away, and ebikes can be hired to explore further. But I don’t venture far as there’s plenty to do on the farm.The peace of Westerlands soon works its magic and I leave feeling rejuvenated and inspired by the transformation that’s taking placeAfter coffee at Horsebox Cafe (in a vintage horsebox repurposed by Emma), I head to the WildSpa, a recent addition with sauna and spring-fed plunge pool in a private garden, and to the Rose Room in a 17th-century cottage for reflexology with Louise (treatments range from massage to reiki and life coaching). It’s blissful. There’s the WildFit outdoor green gym, too, with regular classes from circuits to kettlebells (and the option to book private classes, from yoga to resistance training).Horses are at the heart of Westerlands and the next morning I reunite with Jenny for a trek through the farm and countryside. Riders of all levels and ages are catered for (three is the minimum age), while non-riders can sign up for 45-minute horse connection sessions. Owners can even bring their horses on holiday. I’ve not ridden for a while, but it’s a joy to meander through the woodlands in the spring sunshine.View image in fullscreenThe spa at Westerlands includes a sauna and a spring-fed plunge pool.Photograph: Andy HannantBack at the stables, I learn about medicinal herbs the horses are fed and see the “herb cafe”, where they select the plants they need to thrive. “Horses have the ability to recognise what they need for therapeutic purposes,” Elly explains, “for example, lemon balm for antihistamine, rosehip for joints. They’re drawn to what they need.”The peace of Westerlands soon works its magic and I leave feeling rejuvenated and inspired by the transformation that’s taking place. I remember the teachings from the workshop – the benefits of slowing down and being more present – and Elly’s words of advice ring in my mind: “Basically, be more horse.” I think that will be my motto from now on.The trip was provided byWesterlands.Shepherd Hut(sleepsfour) costs from £75 a night;Timber Country(sleeps four)from£139a night.Gather, Reflect, Connectequine connection workshops cost £49pp for two hours.Horseridingfrom £35 for 30 minutesTrot on: tips fornew ridersView image in fullscreenJane ready for a ride on Jenny1Pick a British Horse Society-approved organisation (or its equivalent abroad) to guarantee a good standard of horses and trained staff.2Be honest about your riding experience. A good centre will match you with the right horse.3Keep calm. A lot of people arrive in a state of overexcitement, but staying calm and quiet is the best approach.4Approach the horse at the shoulder and greet it; it’s a partnership, you will be working together.5Wear sensible, weather-appropriate clothes like leggings or tracksuit bottoms, no shorts, vest tops or hoods. Boots should be jodhpur-style or riding boots, with a flat sole and small heel, no trainers. Always wear a riding helmet and a hi-vis vest.6Sit deep in the saddle with a straight back and relax the legs. The aim is to activate the core while maintaining supple shoulders and hips. You should be in line from shoulder to hip to heel. This helps you to balance so the horse can move well. Squeeze from the lower calves to move forward.7Be soft with the reins as they connect directly with the horse’s mouth. Keep shoulders soft and hands relaxed. If you can’t stay relaxed in the arms and hands, hold the front of the saddle.Elly Middleton, WesterlandsequestrianmanagerExplore more on these topicsTravelHorse riding holidaysSussex holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Keep things relaxed with this mostly make-ahead menuGeorgina HaydenMon 24 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTShareI’m sitting in my kitchen, a pot of coffee by my side and the remnants of yesterday’s passion fruit and saffron creme caramel taunting me (I’ve already convinced myself that it is an acceptable breakfast, so should probably put it away before it becomes an acceptable lunch).When I was younger, I wanted to race through the colder months and get them out the way. However, I’ve learned to love this quieter quarter. To hibernate and replenish my energy, spend time in my kitchen with the radio on. Just peace and quiet and eating.That being said, having people round in the gentle early spring days is easy – diaries are emptier. Everyone appreciates a home-cooked meal, no pressure to be fancy or go out-out. You want to come over for lunch and bring your slippers with you? Be my guest, I’m not changing out of mine.I will make an effort to cook a snack, though – everyone loves a deep-fried, salty nibble with their drink. Panisse hits all these marks. To make life easier, I prepare the chickpea batter in advance, ready to fry at the last minute as I chat to people from the kitchen, handing over the crisp morsels as they’re ready. I apply that principle to all elements of entertaining: what can I do ahead so I am the most present host I can be?The creme caramel will inevitably get you “ooohs” and “ahhhs”, and you can make it the day before. The lamb cooks so slowly that all the hard work is done in the morning. For a vegetarian main, the filling for the cauliflower, kimchi and blue cheese pithivier has to be cooled in advance – you can even make the entire pie ahead, ready to bake. It won’t suffer any ill fate. The only dish I think needs to be cooked just before serving is the potatoes, but it’s surprisingly simple, and the deep flavours are worth it.All of which gives you more time to natter and make drinks (in your slippers, if that’s how you’re rolling). The past few months have been like this at my place, and it has been the tonic we all need. I’m looking forward to warmer days now, but will be happy to have a few more cosy lunches.Panisses with crisp herby capersView image in fullscreenPanisses with crisp herby capers.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverThis is an excellent choice for a snack with drinks as you do most of the hard work in advance. I love a panisse served simply with crisp-fried herbs and capers, but you could also add a spicy chutney on the side, or a drizzle of a sriracha mayo over the top. Just be sure to slice them on the thinner side – the crisp surface area is key.Serves 6-8as a snackolive oil300mlgarlic2 cloves, peeled and finely choppedchickpea (gram) flour250gsea salt and freshly ground black peppercapers3 tbsprosemary and thyme½ pack of each, leaves pickedlemon1, zestedGrease a 23cm square cake tin with olive oil and leave to one side. Pour 800ml of water into a measuring jug. Place 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat and fry the chopped garlic for a minute or two until golden. Working quickly, stir in the chickpea flour, season generously and whisk in the water. Cook over the hob for around 8-10 minutes, beating consistently with a spatula until you have a thick porridge consistency. Immediately pour the mixture into the greased cake tin and smooth the top out as best you can. Leave to one side to cool completely, then chill for at least 2 hours before frying.When you are ready to fry the panisses, turn the set batter out on to a chopping board and cut into 3 rectangles. Then, cut each rectangle into 1-1½cm thick slices and set aside.Prepare the garnish. Place a large frying pan on a medium heat and pour in 100ml of the olive oil. Fry the capers and herbs for a few minutes until golden, then transfer to a kitchen-roll-lined plate with a slotted spoon.Next, fry the panisses in batches: you don’t want to overcrowd the pan or they won’t turn golden and crisp. Make sure the oil comes 1cm up the side of the frying pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden and crisp, then use a slotted spoon to transfer to the kitchen-roll-lined plate.Serve them hot, as they come out of the pan, scattered with the fried capers and herbs, a grating of lemon zest and a generous pinch of sea salt. Repeat until the mixture has all been fried.Cauliflower, kimchi and blue cheese pithivierView image in fullscreenCauliflower, kimchi and blue cheese pithivier.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverKimchi and blue cheese is one of my all-time favourite double acts. For me, it’s up there with gin and tonic, bread and butter, bangers and mash. Usually found in the form of a toastie (known as kimcheese), here I turn it into a vegetarian main and add roasted cauliflower to the mix then envelop it in buttery puff pastry. Even the most vocal blue-cheese haters in my life adore this pie.Serves 6cauliflower1 large, trimmed weight 650golive oil2 tbspsea salt and freshly ground black pepperunsalted butter35ggarlic2 cloves, peeled and finely slicedplain flour2 heaped tbspwhole milk350mlstilton150gkimchi125gegg1 largeready-rolled all-butter puff pastry2 x 320g packsmature cheese50g, such as cheddar, coarsely gratedsesame seeds1 tbspPreheat your oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7. Cut the cauliflower into small, even-sized florets and place in a roasting tin. Drizzle with the olive oil, season generously and toss together. Spread out into a single layer and roast for 18-20 minutes until the cauliflower is tender and charred.Meanwhile, place the butter in a medium-sized saucepan and fry the sliced garlic for a couple of minutes until golden. Stir in the plain flour, fry for a further minute then whisk in the milk. You are making a thick white sauce to coat the cauliflower. As soon as the cauliflower is ready, stir it in and leave to one side to cool.While the cauliflower is cooling, chop the stilton as best you can into small pieces. Finely chop the kimchi. Whisk the egg with a pinch of salt until smooth.Turn the oven down to 180C/gas mark 6. Unroll one sheet of puff pastry and cut an oval shape the same size as the pastry (essentially rounding off the corners) and place on a lined baking tray. Score a 1½cm border inside the circle and then evenly spread out the kimchi inside the border. Stir the cheddar and chopped stilton into the cauliflower mixture, and spoon this into a mound on top of the kimchi. Brush the pastry border with the beaten egg. Roll the second sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface, so it is 2cm larger and cut the same oval shape. Drape it over the cauliflower filling and press down on the edge to seal the sheets together. Then, using a small sharp knife, neaten the border, and score lines in the pastry, starting at the top, all the way to the edge. Brush with beaten egg, and sprinkle the edge with the sesame seeds. Pop the tray in the oven for about 40-45 minutes, until golden all over.When it’s done, leave to cool for at least 5 minutes (or longer) before cutting and serving.Lamb shoulder with charred salsa rossaView image in fullscreenLamb shoulder with charred salsa rossa.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverLamb shoulder needs very little intervention to create a showstopping centrepiece, just a few aromatics – but this charred salsa rossa is absolutely worth the extra effort. Charring the peppers first adds a subtle smokiness and sweetness. And, despite their overexposure in the 1990s, sundried tomatoes do have a time and place, and it is in this recipe.Serves 6bone-in shoulder of lamb2kgtomatoes4, ripered onions2, peeledolive oilsea salt and freshly ground black pepperred peppers2sundried tomatoes75ggarlic1 bulbred wine vinegar2 tbspfennel seeds1 tsp, lightly crushedfresh oregano½ a bunchwatercressto servePreheat the oven to 220C fan/gas mark 9. Take the lamb out of the fridge to come up to room temperature while you get on with the base. Cut the tomatoes into quarters and red onions into eighths and place in a roasting tray that is big enough to hold all the ingredients. Drizzle with olive oil, season well and place in the hot oven to char for about 20 minutes.Meanwhile, char the red peppers over an open gas hob (or under a grill) until blackened all over, then place in a bowl and cover with clingfilm to soften the skin. After a minute, flake away the blackened skin, then halve them, remove the seeds and chop them up (they can have a bit of texture, you don’t want them too fine). Chop the sundried tomatoes. Halve the garlic bulb horizontally.When the tomatoes and onions are ready, add the chopped peppers, sundried tomatoes and garlic to the tray and pour in 200ml of hot water and the red wine vinegar. Make little incisions into the lamb and rub over the crushed fennel seeds. Season well. Place on top of the veg and scatter over half the fresh oregano. Drizzle everything with olive oil and tightly cover the tray with tin foil. Place in the oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 150C fan/gas mark 3. Cook for 4-4½ hours, checking occasionally to make sure there is enough liquid in the tray.When the lamb is tender and easily comes away from the bone, remove the foil and turn the oven back up to 220C fan/gas mark 9 for a final 20 minutes, so that the meat becomes browned and crisp on top, and any liquid in the tray evaporates. Leave the lamb to rest for 10 minutes, then pull the meat off the bone with two forks into the salsa rossa and serve. Serve with dressed watercress and the browned new potatoes (see below).White wine and lemon browned new potatoesView image in fullscreenWhite wine and lemon browned new potatoes.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverThis French-inspired way of cooking new potatoes is a slight elevation from simply tossing them in salty butter and herbs (also tremendous, obviously). You don’t have to dot with spoons of creme fraiche at the end but I really enjoy the way it melts into the nutty brown butter.Serves 6unsalted butter150gsmall new potatoes750g, washedsea salt and freshly ground black peppergarlic4 cloves, crushedwhite wine200mllemon1soft herbs1 x bunch, such as chives, chervil, tarragon, parsley – a mixture might be nicecreme fraiche200g, to serve (optional)Place a wide saute pan or large saucepan over a medium heat. Melt the butter and cook until it starts to smell nutty, then add the potatoes to the pan, ideally in a single layer. Season generously, add the crushed garlic and toss well.Pour in the white wine and bring to the boil. Cover the pan, reduce to a medium heat and cook for 15 minutes. Turn the potatoes over – they should have browned on the undersides. Add 100ml water and cover again, and cook for a further 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes have browned on the other side and are tender (check occasionally that the potatoes aren’t burning, and add a splash of water if necessary). Remove the lid, and fry uncovered for the last 8-10 minutes to glaze all over.Meanwhile, finely chop the soft herbs. Adjust the seasoning, squeeze over the lemon, stir in the soft herbs and serve dotted with creme fraiche.Passion fruit and saffron creme caramelView image in fullscreenPassion fruit and saffron creme caramel.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverWhen I have people round, I ensure that at least one (if not more) of the courses can be entirely made in advance, to reduce stress. I love the cooking part of hosting but I want to be sociable, too. This passion fruit creme caramel is not too heavy, so a perfect after-dinner sweet hit, and it can all be done the day before bar the turning out. Elegant and fancy enough to wow your friends, stress-free on the day for you.Serves 6passion fruit6 large, ripe onescaster sugar275gsingle cream300mlwhole milk300mlsaffrona pincheggs 3 large, plus 2 yolksfine sea salta pinchPreheat your oven to 140C fan/gas mark 2½. Have a 1kg loaf tin ready.Scoop out the flesh of 5 of the passion fruit into a blender with 1 tablespoon of water. Blitz for a couple of seconds, then pass through a fine-mesh sieve into a jug. You need about 100ml of passion fruit juice (if it is not enough, just add a splash of water). Pour into a small frying pan with 200g of the caster sugar. Bring to the boil over a medium-high heat, swirling the pan. Do not stir or it will crystallise. The sugar will melt, and after about 3-5 minutes you will get a deep golden passion fruit caramel. Remove the pan from the heat, then quickly and evenly pour the caramel into the base of the loaf tin. Place the loaf tin into a larger roasting tin that is higher sided.Warm the cream, milk and saffron in a saucepan over a medium heat. It should be warm, but not boiling at any point. Meanwhile, vigorously whisk the whole eggs, yolks, salt and remaining 75g of caster sugar until pale and thickened. When the milk mixture is warm, slowly whisk it into the eggs until smooth. You don’t want too many air bubbles, so leave it for a few minutes for them to subside if needed. Boil a kettle of water.Strain the custard mixture into a large jug through a fine-mesh sieve, then carefully pour into the prepared loaf tin, over the caramel. Place the tins in the oven, then carefully pour enough just boiled water into the larger tin so that it comes two-thirds of the way up the outside of the loaf tin. Bake for around 1 hour, or until the creme caramel is just set in the middle.Remove the creme caramel tin from the water bath and leave to cool completely. Then loosely cover and pop in the fridge for at least 4 hours before serving. Remove the loaf tin from the fridge 30 minutes before you want to serve it, then gently run a knife around the inside of the tin. Place a serving platter (preferably one that has a lip) on top and turn it over. Serve with the pulp of the extra passion fruit scooped over the top, if you like the crunch from the seeds.Georgina Hayden is a cook, food writer and broadcaster.

And, because they are small, so are the crystals that form when the water in their taut cells (imagine many minuscule balloons) turns to ice. And small crystals cause far less damage, puncturing and ripping to cell walls, which means that, when the pea defrosts and the ice returns to water, the cell walls are able to hold it, resulting in a firmer pea.Larger items, on the other hand, see the formation of larger ice crystals, which can puncture the walls (again, imagine minuscule balloons, but this time with lots of tiny rips), making them leaky when they defrost and causing mushy vegetables. This is why peas survive the industrial freezing process so much better than, say, carrots or a slice of aubergine.Peas also defrost quickly, which is something I am reminded of every couple of weeks when I find a warm bag abandoned on the sofa, having done its job with a swollen ankle or a lump on the head. Yes, the bag could go back in the freezer, but often it becomes our next meal.This is a dish I started making when my son was young (for me, not for him), having had it made for me by a friend who likes frozen peas even more than I do and refers to them as “the vegetable in frozen armour”, for the way they ride in and save supper. You don’t actually need to defrost the peas (by using hot water or a sprained wrist); they can go straight from the freezer into the hot, softened shallot or onion (just give them an extra minute or so in the pan, stirring until they glisten).There is a satisfying bit of stove alchemy in this recipe, when the single cream, spoonful of cream cheese and grated cheese thicken into a sauce. The sauce then thickens further on the surface of the pasta. My ideal shape here would be little elbow macaroni (again, for me, not for my son), but a ridged penne also works, as does pretty much any small tube or shell for that matter. As always, I have given specific quantities, but this really is a recipe to be made by eye, using whatever cream and cheese you have in the fridge. The lemon zest is optional, but it adds another dimension and an edge to the sauce.Not to rush anything, but this is a dish to be eaten as soon as possible, while it is hot and the sauce is thick enough to catch and hold the peas, and creamy enough that the tubes of pasta slide around the bowl or plate.Pasta with peas, cream, lemon and cheeseServes43 tbspolive oil1 knob butter1 small onion, or 2 shallots, peeled and finely diced200g frozen peas, defrostedSalt250ml single cream1 tbspcream cheese, or robiola50g grana padano, parmesan or sharp cheddar, gratedZest of1 unwaxed lemonWhitepepper400g-500gpasta– elbow macaroni, penne, fusilli, linguineBring a large pan of water to a boil ready for the pasta. Working in a frying pan or medium-sized saucepan, warm the olive oil and butter over a medium heat, then add the onion and fry, stirring, until soft and translucent. Add the peas and stir until they glisten.Add salt to the boiling water, stir the pot, then add the pasta and set the timer for a minute less than the recommended pasta cooking time.Add the cream to the peas and simmer gently. About 30 seconds before the pasta timer rings, add the grated cheese, lemon zest and some white pepper to the cream and pea mix, then raise the heat slightly and stir constantly, so the sauce bubbles and thickens.When the timer rings, either use a spider sieve to lift the pasta directly into the sauce, or drain the pasta into a colander (save some of the cooking water), then tip into the pea pan.Toss everything for about 30 seconds; if the mix seems dry, add a bit of pasta cooking water; if it seems loose, add more grated cheese. The aim is that the sauce thickens on the surface of the pasta and catches the peas. Serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkPastaStarterMain courseCheeseVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"
