Until now, the saltire was associated with pro-independence marches through city centres where billowing saltires were carried aloft, or the national football and rugby teams.And so last Saturday, Syedain draped the saltires she had bought over some crowd barriers as she joined counter-protesters outside the Cladhan hotel, which houses about 90 asylum seekers.“We were doing it to reclaim our flag,” she says. “In England the St George’s flag has always been associated with the far right. In Scotland it’s more complicated.“Some people thought it was about the women’s rugby, and others thought it was to do with the independence movement. The conversation we need to have as a community is: what is your motivation for flying the saltire in Falkirk right now?”Counter-protests outside the Cladhan hotel on 30 August with people dancing, holding placards and Scottish flagsJohn Swinney, Scotland’s nationalist first minister, was quick to challenge the flag’s use by the right in a pro-independence speech on Thursday. “Our saltire is a flag of welcome – and refugees are welcome here,” he said. “The saltire belongs to the people of Scotland,” he told reporters afterwards, “and it’s always been perceived as a flag of welcome, of solidarity and sanctuary”.But the meaning of the saltire is contested.When Bob Doris, a Scottish National party MSP for Maryhill in Glasgow, where the flags appeared overnight on lamp-posts, accused the far right of “hi-jacking” the saltire, a community group responded: “The flags were not put up by far right – it was some of your own supporters and friends.”“The truth is that the flags were put up as a signal to politicians, like you, to start listening to concerns in your constituency,” wrote the organiser of the local Facebook group No1seems2care.“You have wrongly linked the saltire flags in your area with the far right and in doing so you have attached a perception of shame to those who display it. You didn’t do that in [the independence referendum of] 2014 or at your elections Bob.”The guerilla flag-flying is endorsed by a loose network of Facebook groups such as this one, which highlight failing public services and escalating household bills. Another, the Tartan Team, which raised flags overnight in a handful of north Glasgow suburbs, said: “Immigration isn’t a problem with us. That’s why it’s a saltire – to let the SNP know it’s our flag not theirs.” The anger of those protesting outside hotels should instead “be directed at politicians and councillors who have dodged the main issues this country faces for too long”.As in England, for many the flag signifies their demands to put local people first. But council workers tasked with removing them have faced abuse, with officials in one local authority, Aberdeenshire, asking for police protection.View image in fullscreenFlags in Maryhill, Glasgow.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe group coordinating protests against the Cladhan, Save our Futures and Our Kids’ Futures, say they were galvanised by the rape of a local teenager by an Afghan asylum seeker.Sadeq Nikzad, 29, was jailed for nine years in June after attacking a 15-year-old girl in Falkirk town centre in October 2023. The group, which also raises concerns about wider public safety, lack of council transparency and digital ID, has been supported by a local Reform councillor while a number of far-right activists have been identified at their protests.An investigation by the Ferret website found that far-right groups such as the Homeland party, Britain First and Patriotic Alternative have attended similar demonstrations across Scotland this summer, prompting claims they are exploiting concerns over asylum seeker housing to stoke racial tensions.John Swinney argues that public anger is fuelled by the poverty and social damage caused by the economic austerity introduced by the Conservative UK government more than a decade ago, and then Brexit. “Far too many people are struggling to get by,” he said on Thursday. “Years of flat-lining living standards have taken their toll.”Yet the “utterly chilling” anti-immigration language being widely used by politicians at Westminster was energising those behind the surge in protests, he said. “Politicians calling for mass deportations. They demand that we pull out of international human rights treaties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Well I am.”View image in fullscreenJohn Swinney argues that public anger is fuelled by the poverty and social damage caused by austerity and Brexit.Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty ImagesScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar faced personal racist attacks by Nigel Farage in the Hamilton byelection earlier this year, in which his party triumph over the SNP in Reform’s most significant electoral showing thus far in Scotland with 26% of the vote.Earlier this week he dismissed Farage as “a chancer who doesn’t understand Scotland”,adding he could “understand those Scots, that are considering Reform, often feel a genuine sense of hopelessness” and promising to build support “based on like-minded individuals who want to challenge those noisy minorities, whether it’s the SNP or Reform and Farage”.Last summer, people of colour living in Scotlandwarned against complacencyafter the country escaped the chain reaction of racist violence across England and Northern Ireland set off by the horrific Southport killings last July.They suggested a combination of inhibiting factors, including there being proportionally fewer black and ethnic minority citizens living there and, until recently, the broad political and media consensus that migration was of benefit given Scotland’s significant demographic challenges.A year later, the landscape is very different, with recent polling for More in Common suggesting that Reform was neck and neck with Scottish Labour in voting intention for next May’s Scottish parliament election. Immigration appears to be a top concern for Scottish voters for the first time and the Scottish government is facing a refugee crisis in Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city.Last week, Farage described Glasgow as the “asylum capital” of the UK – it has the highest number of asylum seekers measured by local authority – and tried to link this with an increase in reports of sexual assault in the city. Rape Crisis Scotland immediately responded that there is “absolutely no evidence” to substantiate this correlation.But the city councilhas been warningfor months that homeless refugees are putting “unprecedented pressure” on services.Stronger housing rights brought in by the Scottish government, such as a statutory duty to accommodate single adult males, has seen a sharp increase in those applying to homelessness services coming from elsewhere in Scotland and the UK. Combined with the UK government’s accelerated asylum processing, which has left many newly recognised refugees homeless, the cost to the city has soared to tens of millions.This week Susan Aitken, Glasgow’s council leader, said things were at “breaking point”.Colin Macfarlane, of the Scottish Refugee Council, disputes the narrative that Glasgow is considered a “soft touch” by refugees. “There are many reasons a person may choose to live here, such as finding established communities, having family already settled here or access to resources.“It is incorrect to suggest homelessness provision in Glasgow is ‘better’ or ‘softer’ than anywhere else in Scotland. In fact, it currently takes on average two weeks for a person who has become street homeless to enter accommodation.”View image in fullscreenSusan Aitken, Glasgow’s council leader, said homelessness services in the city were at ‘breaking point’.Photograph: Gerard Ferry/AlamyGlasgow has a strong tradition of welcoming refugees. For supporters of immigration, this was encapsulated by theprotests on Kenmure Streetin Glasgow’s southside when vast crowds prevented immigration enforcement officers from detaining two asylum seekers in May 2021, forcing their release.Now the mood on the streets is shifting says Tabassum Niamat, a community activist based in the same area. She said the communities she works with, in particular those visibly Muslim women who cover their hair or faces in public, are reporting a rise in micro-aggressions such as staring, verbal and sometimes physical aggression.“There’s a sense in the air that things are ready to explode; this brewing tension all around. You feel the anger, even in the way people look at you now. People are getting sworn at in the streets, and those who are most vulnerable, people for whom English is not their first language, children, women, the elderly, are getting targeted. Day in, day out it’s getting worse.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandImmigration and asylumFar rightGlasgowScottish National party (SNP)John SwinneyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m on a treatment drug. I don’t identify as sporty. I wouldn’t have done it without a goal.”This Sunday the 57-year-old will roar up the Campsie Hills north of Glasgow in a “camp as Christmas” sparkly cape alongside her partner, Sarah, and 3,000 other participants.It’s all part of the inauguralTour de 4, a charity ride conceived by Sir Chris Hoy with the aim of challenging assumptions about those living with stage 4 cancer.The roaring is literal: during months of training, Erwin has found vocalising “really helps” on steeper inclines. And the pink and gold sequins encapsulate the spirit of celebrating each day woven through the event, a hallmark of Hoy’s approach to his own stage 4 prostate cancer.The six-time Olympic gold medallist stunned the UK late last year when herevealed that his cancer was incurable, with a prognosis of between two and four years to live.Hoy’s honesty and grace in sharing his circumstances moved Erwin, who has been living with stage 4 lung cancer for five years. “It’s rare that people speak out about having stage 4 cancer. The shame, the confusion, it’s not something we speak about,” she said.Hoy describes this unique event, where those living with stage 4 cancer will cycle alongside their loved ones to raise funds for cancer charities across the UK, as “an opportunity to push limits”.Different routes and levels of participation are tailored to the individual’s physical capacity – from riding a static bike for as little as one minute in the SirChris HoyVelodrome in Glasgow, to three outdoor routes of increasing length and elevation.View image in fullscreenChris Hoy in 2008. His ‘honesty and grace’ about living with stage 4 cancer moved Mel Erwin to take part.Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA“This is not about being the fastest,” Hoy has reassured participants. “It’s about preparation, about showing up, riding your way and being part of something bigger than all of us.”This notion of it being a movement inspiredErwin, who lives in east London, to get involved. “It’s about being part of a community. It’s really isolating having cancer – stage 4 cancer in particular,” she said.Hoy’s motivation is “to shine a spotlight on what a stage 4 cancer diagnosis can look like and demonstrate that it is possible to live well and lead a happy life alongside this devastating diagnosis”.It’s an attitude that resonated powerfully with Christine Lote, from Bristol, who was diagnosed with stage 4 bone cancer on her eldest daughter’s third birthday last June. In the “whirlwind of overwhelm and heartbreak” that followed came Hoy’s announcement and his memoir All That Matters. Lote, whose daughters Sophie and Chloe are now two and four, appreciated how Hoy had written about “navigating your diagnosis as a family”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For Erwin, the training has eased this. “There’s something about keeping the wheels turning, the fact that my muscles, thighs, heart, lungs, everything is working in synchronicity.”Hoy, Lote and Erwin acknowledge that not everyone with stage 4 cancer can manage a physical challenge like this, and the event is organised around inclusivity. Lote has gathered a list of names from herInstagram pageof people who would have loved to have taken part but are now too sick, and will carry it in her cycle jersey.“Unfortunately, many people I know and love aren’t well enough to do this challenge,” said Erwin. “Me and Christine both know one day that will be us. We’re doing what we can now to raise awareness and to celebrate. But it’s also painful, that’s the reality. On the day, there will be tears because we’ve lost people along the way and one day people will lose us.”Explore more on these topicsCancerScotlandCyclingChris HoyHealth & wellbeingHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Her social media described her as a yoga teacher and practitioner of biodecoding, an obscure alternative therapy that claims to cure illness by resolving past traumas.Her husband, Juan Carlos Cortegoso, 61, built and raced go-karts. Like many in this neighbourhood, the couple were comfortably off, and discreet. “Patri was an excellent person”, one neighbour said. “Nice, well educated,” said another.Then, last month, they put their house up for sale. A photographer from a local estate agent, Robles Casas y Campos, came round to shoot the spacious, elegantly furnished interiors. The pictures went up. And their quiet existence came crashing down.The fifth photograph on the agency’s listing showed a general view of the villa’s living room. Hanging on the wall, above a buttoned sofa in plush green velvet and next to a polished antique commode, was a highly distinctive oil painting of a woman.View image in fullscreenThe painting by Italian artist Ghislandi in the living room in Mar del Plata.Photograph: Robles Casas & CamposMore than 11,000km away, the Dutch news outlet AD had, for several years, been quietly investigating the fate of old master paintings looted by the Nazis and stilllisted by the Dutch culture ministry as “unreturned”after the second world war.Journalists had made several attempts to speak to Patricia Kadgien, the owner of the property, and to her elder sister, Alicia, the daughters of a high-ranking Nazi official Friedrich Kadgien, who was known to have settled in Argentina after the war.Their calls and messages had consistently gone unanswered, or been rebuffed. But then a Dutch reporter based in Buenos Aires, Peter Schouten, went knocking on the door of the villa – and spotted a “for sale” sign.Old master painting looted by Nazis spotted in Argentinian property listingRead moreWhat followed, after Schouten and his colleagues in Rotterdam clicked on the link to the property and instantly recognised the work,made headlines around the worldas the story unfolded of the unlikely recovery of an 18th-century portrait missing for 80 years.“It’s very surreal – a little absurd, too,” Schouten said after a packed court hearing during which Kadgien and Cortegoso were charged with aggravated concealment for allegedly hiding Portrait of a Lady, by the late-baroque portraitist Giuseppe Ghislandi.The federal prosecutor, Carlos Martínez, told the court that the concealment charge “must be understood as linked to the crime of genocide … This is theft in the context of genocide. It is connected to the most serious crimes known to humanity.”A judge imposed a 180-day travel ban on the couple and barred them from leaving their home for more than 24 hours without approval as Martínez said the plundering of cultural assets “was part of a systematic plan … to enrich the Nazi regime and its members”.View image in fullscreenPatricia Kadgien attends a hearing on charges of concealment and obstruction of justicePhotograph: Jose Scalzo/ReutersAfter the media reports of the work’s likely location, and before a police search, the couple had tried to obstruct the investigation, the prosecutor argued, by taking down the online property listing and for sale sign andreplacing the portrait with a tapestry.Despite knowing they were under investigation, it was alleged that the defendants had also attempted a civil action claiming the painting was rightfully theirs, turning it over only after they wereplaced under house arrestand facing further police raids.Through their lawyer, Kadgien and Cortegoso have denied concealment, saying they had always been willing to hand over the painting, and obstruction, arguing that their civil action was aimed at establishing ownership and not at hiding the artwork.During a series of raids this week on properties owned by members of the Kadgien family, police seized engravings, prints, drawings and two 19th-century paintings, officials have said, with further charges likely if those works, too, prove to have been looted.Portrait of a Lady belonged to Jacques Goudstikker, a Jewish-Dutch art dealer who fled Amsterdam in mid-May 1940 to escape the Nazis, but died after falling through an open hatch into the hold of the SS Bodegraven, the ship carrying him to the UK.Goudstikker carried with him a notebook detailing his collection of more than 1,100 artworks, including pieces by Rubens, Giotto, Titian, Rembrandt and Van Gogh, all of which were snapped up for a fraction of their value by Nazi officials.Some were later recovered and displayed as part of the Dutch national collection in the Rijkmuseum, before 202 works were restored to the dealer’s sole heir, his daughter-in-law, Marei von Saher, in 2006. Portrait of a Lady was not among them.Chief among the buyers in a forced sale typical of second world war art thefts was Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, one of whose senior aides, in the early years of the war, was a 33-year-old official called Friedrich Gustav Kadgien.Born in 1907, Kadgien joined the Nazi party in 1932 and the SS in 1935. By 1938, he was a special representative working for Göring on the four-year economic plan drawn up by Adolf Hitler to rearm Germany and prepare it for self-sufficiency by 1940.A key player in the Third Reich’s foreign currency dealings, Kadgien was also, according to a 1996 Swiss report, “heavily involved in criminal methods for the acquisition of cash, securities and diamonds stolen from Jewish victims”.Kadgien “confiscated a large amount of property from Jewish merchants, including jewellery and diamonds in Amsterdam, and oversaw the sale of expropriated shares and securities through banks and front companies in Switzerland”, Martínez said.He fled to Zurich early in 1945, then to nearby Baden, where in 1948 he set up a successful finance and trading firm, Imhauka. With pressure growing after questioning by Swiss and US investigators, Kadgien left for South America in 1949.Thousands of Nazis fled to the continent after the war, settling in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay. With a few notable high-profile exceptions, most lived out their lives undisturbed, sometimes without even changing names.Kadgien resurfaced in Rio de Janeiro in 1951, settling in the Santa Teresa district and establishing a Brazilian branch of Imhauka with Ludwig Haupt, a former colleague from the four-year-plan, and Anna Imfeld, the wife of his Swiss associate.By whatever means it was acquired, his wealth was sufficient for him to invest in an 85,000-hectare ranch with 20,000 cattle. A Buenos Aires branch of Imhauka followed in 1951, and Kadgien – now Federico Gustavo – won Argentinian citizenship soon after.Imhauka secured valuable contracts with Juan Perón’s government, including acting as an intermediary for major German engineering firms such as Siemens, while a second company, Dryamin, launched in 1973, specialised in food and drugs.In the Argentinian capital, Kadgien married Hildegard Strauss, with whom he had Patricia and Alicia. He died, without being held accountable for his wartime and subsequent actions, in 1978 or 1979, and is reportedly buried in the German cemetery.Alicia became a model and is locally well known, unlike Patricia, whose unwanted fame is more recent. “If you hadn’t told me I would never have known,” a neighbour said. Another said she was being “held responsible for her father’s mistakes”.Even those sympathetic to her, however, admit it was strange that she did not hand over the painting immediately.The fate of Portrait of a Lady, which will be registered with Argentina’s supreme court, is now uncertain.Prosecutors have requested it be held, but not displayed, at the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires while its ultimate ownership is determined. This week von Saher, Goudstikker’s heir, lodged a legal claim to the work with the FBI in New York.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaAmericasNazismSecond world warArt theftArtnewsShareReuse this content"

But then came the shocking diagnosis. Now fully recovered, she’s re‑evaluating everythingSat 6 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTShareIt all starts with the coil. Of course it does. This is Davina, and Davina McCall doesn’t do personal by halves. “I loved the coil, but people always used to go, ‘I’m not getting the coil,ugh.’I always wondered why it wasn’t more popular.” So, it was June 2023 and McCall was getting her preferred method of contraception replaced –on TV, naturally, for a documentary. “I asked my children’s permission. ‘Can Mummy get her coil refitted on television?’ They all rolled their eyes, like: ‘God! Here she goes again.’”Post-fitting, her friend Dame Lesley Regan, a gynaecologist, suggested that McCall have a health screening at the state-of-the-art women’s health clinic where she worked, in exchange for a talk she would give on menopause. To be honest, McCall says, she thought the idea ridiculous. “I was like: ‘Honestly, I don’t need that. I’m the healthiest woman you’ve ever met. I don’t go to the doctor, I have a good immune system, I eat well.’”It’s 10 months now since McCall had her brain tumour removed. Although benign, the colloid cyst was huge. If left untreated, it could have eventually killed her. The TV presenter says she’s still trying to process everything: how fluky it was that it was spotted; what could have happened if it hadn’t been, or if she had refused the op (she almost did); and how her brain has been changed.We meet at a studio in London where she’s having her photo taken. She arrives wearing a candy floss-coloured shirt, black skort and Ibiza tan. She looks ludicrously fit, like she could knock off a triathlon before breakfast. Today, at 57, McCall’s addiction is health and fitness. It used to be booze and heroin.View image in fullscreen‘I looked at my life and thought: have I done everything I want to do? And I thought: yeah, I have.’ Dress: Claire Mischevani. Earrings: Giovanni RaspiniI’ve never met McCall before, but within seconds I feel I’ve known her for life. And in a way I have. McCall is one of the few celebrities whose public persona is pretty much the same as their private one. She grabs my hand, and leads me to the sofa where we’re going to talk. I feel like a contestant onBig Brother, which she presented for 10 years and 16 series (including the celebrity version). I half expect her to tell me that we’re live on Channel 4, so please don’t swear. In fact, this is probably the biggest difference between TV and real versions. The real McCall swears like a drunken nun.She stares at my bag disbelievingly, as I pull out a second recorder. “Fucking hell, you taping me in stereo?” McCall is a great talker. You can turn your two recorders on and pop out for a couple of hours and she’s sure to have filled them with spellbinding if scatological stories. Her tales (of which there are many) invariably have tangents. And the tangents usually have their own tangents. So, somehow, she segues from the coil to The Lowdown (“It’s thisamazing website, like a TripAdvisor for your vagina”), to the respect she has for her children’s privacy (“I’ve never posted any pictures of my son. He didn’t choose to be famous; I did”), her desire to shock as a teenage girl, Donny Osmond, her years at MTV, before getting back to the coil (around an hour later) to explain how it led to her diagnosis.McCall was working as a judge on the TV series The Masked Singer when she got her diagnosis. She was told only about three people in a million get a colloid cyst, a non-cancerous fluid-filled sac that typically develops in the brain’s third ventricle. She was shocked, but the word she heard loudest was “benign”. In that case, she told herself, she didn’t have to do anything about it. She agreed to speak to a couple of brain surgeons, but her starting point was that they wouldn’t be operating on her. “I spoke to an amazing surgeon in America and said I need an honest opinion on whether I should have this operation. She said, ‘Are you sure you’re not symptomatic?’, and I said yes. And she said: ‘Well, I’m really surprised because looking at your scans it looks like you should be.’” Because it was so big? “Yeah! D’you want me to show you?” Before I’ve got time to answer, she’s got her smartphone out and I’m staring at a white, jelly-like blob on her brain. “A big colloid cyst is 10mm or more, and mine was 14mm,” she says proudly. “This is Jeffrey.”“Eh?” I say.View image in fullscreenMcCall after her surgery in November 2024.Photograph: Courtesy of Davina McCall/Eroteme“Jeffrey is what I call it.” Why? “Because I don’t know anyone called Jeffrey, so I could say ‘Fuck Jeffrey’ without hurting anyone’s feelings.”How did she react when she was told she should have surgery? “I burst into tears.” She had left the studio to take the call and was pacing around the courtyard. “I was relieved and frightened. So the fear of it being a dead cert that I’m going to get it taken out, and then the relief of ‘Thank fuck, I’m going to get it taken out’ came at the same time. Nobody at The Masked Singer knew. I pull myself together, walk back in to go towards my dressing room and see this guy called Joe from ITV. And he goes: ‘Hey, hi, how are you doing?’ And I burst into tears, and he gives me a hug and asks what’s going on. I said: ‘I’ve just found out I’ve got a brain tumour and I need to get it operated on and I feel good and terrible all at the same time.’”This was last October. A month later, she had the operation. McCall didn’t tell anybody on the show itself what was happening. “I pretended to everybody on the judging panel I was sick. And then I actually put on a costume and performed.” (She sang Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas and This Christmas on The Masked Singer Christmas Special.) Why? “It was quite weird. I wasn’t thinking this in a dramatic way, but I did think: if I don’t make it, this will be amazing for my kids to watch. I know that sounds a bit dark …” She comes to a stop.Just as her emotions are about to get the better of her, she cheers herself up by telling meexactlywhat the operating team did to her brain. “They cut like a hairband into my head, peeled the front of my head down, then went through the two halves of my brain, so it looked like that.” She shows me a photo of the hairband scar. Is the scar still there? “My partner, Michael, very sweetly said, ‘You’ve just got a little white patch’, so we sprayed some root spray, but this is all new hair growing back.” Her hair is a magnificent auburn. Is it her natural colour? She laughs. “No, I’m grey. I coloured my hair two nights ago. I’m not ready to go grey yet.”Michael and I were really good friends because we were hairdresser and client. I told him all of my secretsMcCall feels she has emerged from her experience transformed. “The best thing to come out of it is not being frightened of death any more.” How scared was she? “I wasn’t terrified of dying, but I didn’t want to die. I love life, love living, and definitely wanted to be around for my kids while they were young. I think if I’d got ill when my kids were little it would have been very different, but I looked at my three kids and, although I didn’t want to leave them, I did think: you’d all be OK if I did. That’s a nice feeling. Then I looked at my life and thought: have I done everything I want to do? And I thought: yeah, I have. I’ve lived a really good life. I’ve really enjoyed my life. I’ve loved, and I’ve been loved.”After the diagnosis, she started a podcast called Begin Again. “The whole idea behind it is helping people get to a point in their lives where they feel they can die happy. It’s about doing everything in your life you want to do, and how do you begin again to do that, so that you can die happy; so you can go, I’ve lived a life I’m proud of, or that I wanted to live.”What was she totting up when she did the inventory of her life? “My kids. Would they be OK without me? I always thought my job is to teach them to fly away and never look back, even though you want them to look back sometimes. I don’t want to have kids who are too afraid to leave me. I guess the fact that one lives in Manchester, one lives in Australia, and the other one didn’t come on holiday with us because he was in Split means I’ve done a good job. They’re independent, happy kids.”View image in fullscreen‘I don’t look at other people. I like being monogamous.’ Dress: Lanvin. Earrings and chunky bangle: Dinosaur Designs. Other bangle: Davina’s ownThey had a very different childhood from your own? “Definitely. They had a solid childhood. I was with their dad for 18 years. We were together, they were under one roof, they had food on the table.” McCall split up from her second husband and the father of her children, Matthew Robertson, in 2017. She got together with the hairdresser Michael Douglas two years later. Douglas has done McCall’s hair for more than 20 years, and the two families were friends. Often he would bring his two children around to her house when he was doing her hair.She was as surprised as anybody when they got together. I assumed it evolved into a relationship, but she says not. “It was more of a coup de foudre. A lightning bolt. I probably don’t want to talk about this because I have to think about Matthew. Michael and I were really good friends because we were hairdresser and client. I told him all of my secrets, about how I was feeling, and he was a brilliant sounding board. He would share his experiences; I would share my experiences. We would help each other navigate things. And he was in love with his wife and I was in love with my husband, so it was us trying to help each other through our lives. That’s what’s so mad about it. And then coup de foudre.Mad. Like I’d put on a different pair of glasses.”She says she had to make sure she was over Robertson before thinking about a new relationship. “If I’m with somebody I’m with them. I don’t look at other people. I like being monogamous.”McCall’s childhood was famously unsolid – at least on her maternal side. Her French mother, Florence, was a chaotic alcoholic who also dabbled in drugs, a glamorous socialite who never quite grew up and who died in 2008. When McCall was 13, Florence took her clubbing in Île de Ré along with her 19-year-old sister. “I remember my mum left me and my sis to go and get some weed or something, and being a bit frightened then. I was like: ‘Oh I’m socoool.’ Then when my mum left, I’m: ‘Oh my God, I’m so young, what am I doing in this place?’”I left my boyfriend because I thought it was his fault I was taking drugs. Maybe it was my fault he was taking themHer parents split up when she was three. Florence returned to France, and young Davina went to live with her paternal grandparents in Surrey. At 13 she moved in with her father, Andrew, a marketing and advertising executive who died in 2022, and her stepmother, Gaby, in London. She adored them (and is still exceptionally close to Gaby) but it was the absent Florence who was the defining influence of her childhood. “I was very loved. My dad and my granny and my stepmum loved me a lot. But it was my mother’s love that I spent my childhood seeking. I had it all there, and the thing I wanted was the thing I couldn’t have. I was just trying to fill this hole.”By her mid-teens, she had become a rock chick – cool, loud, impossible to ignore. She was having a great time of it. “When I got to 18 or 19 I was an extreme extrovert. Outrageous outfits, always with people, dancing, chat, loved it.” She was running her own club nights, frequently on the lash, and developed a serious drug problem. “I was going down a muddy route of heroin and cocaine, and I was a mess.” How muddy a mess was she? “I don’t want to underplay me taking heroin. The fact I wasn’t injecting doesn’t mean it’s safe to take heroin. It really fucked up my life. My life was falling apart. I left my boyfriend because I thought it was his fault I was taking drugs. It wasn’t. I got worse when I left him. Maybe it was my fault he was taking them.”She says she was such a contradictory shambles – conscientious and wasted, ecstatic and miserable, life of the party and lonely as hell, permissive and puritanical. “I was half nun, half wild child. I was half really good girl: so compliant, swotty, good morals and manners, and full of love. And then half maniac.” She didn’t have a clue what she wanted to do with her life. Then, when she was 19, MTV got in touch with a bunch of notable clubbers, including her, to see if they could help with the launch of MTV Europe. Their job was to entertain celebrities attending the launch on the journey from London to Amsterdam, where the party was held, and throughout the night. “At the end of that night I was like: ‘Oh my God. I’ve found my calling. I have to work for MTV!’”View image in fullscreenWith her partner Michael Douglas and daughter Holly Robertson, after being made an MBE in January 2024.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesShe’s screaming with enthusiasm, Davina-style. What was so good about it? “It was just so mad. Everyone who worked at MTV was under 25. All the biggest bands of the era were on this plane – Duran Duran, Sigue Sigue Sputnik. I think Donny Osmond was on the plane, too. I love Donny.” I tell her how much I liked him when I met him. “Oh my God, isn’t he the loveliest man?! I sat next to him on The Masked Singer, and he was my poster boy.” She points to her legs. Eh? I say. “I’ve got goose bumps.” And the goose bumps really are visible.She comes to a stop. And she’s gone from hyper to a brief unexpected low. “Nobody really understood what it meant to me sitting next to Donny. All the people in my life who would have really got what that meant to me had died – my sister, my dad, my granny.” Seconds later, she has refuelled. The energy’s back. “And when I came back from that MTV trip I thought: I want to work there.”Was access to celebrity part of what attracted her to MTV? “No, it was the vibe, the energy. It felt like if you had an idea and you went to somebody at MTV, they’d go: let’s do it. I remember turning up there and Robbie [Williams] had just left Take That and they said they were going to do a two-hour special in an hour! It was so exciting to be around.”But there were two problems. MTV wanted to hire presenters from the continent, and McCall was too much of a wreck to hold down a proper job. At 25, she got clean. She says she had to give up alcohol before she could contemplate giving up drugs. What had been the attraction of heroin? “You take heroin because you’re deeply insecure and part of your extrovertism is to cover up your deep insecurity. Heroin is like a hug and it tells you that you don’t need anyone or anything, and everything’s all right.”Sobriety soon paid off. “Amazingly, six months clean, I get a call off MTV, who I had been trying to get a screen test off. If I’d have got a screen test off them when I was still using I would have messed it up.” She has never drunk alcohol or taken drugs since then. Nor has she been without work.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

You felt she would have just as happily been a contestant as the presenter.View image in fullscreen‘I’m an amplifier. I take good news and spread it everywhere.’ Coat: Richard Quinn. Ring: Laura VannThere has been a consistency to all the work she has done over the past 30 years. Today, she’s promoting Stranded on Honeymoon Island, a new dating show that’s a melange of other dating shows – contestants have to marry (though it’s not legally binding) then spend time together on a desert island. The first show she presented, Streetmate, was one of the earliest of the genre. It involved McCall rolling up to strangers in different places, asking them if they were single and were up for her finding them a date (which involved the contestant telling McCall who they fancied on the street and her then playing matchmaker). It was simple, audacious and had infinitely more energy than most of today’s shows (including the first episode of Stranded).I tell her I watched an episode of Streetmate earlier today. “Ohmygodwhichonewhichone?” she replies in turbo-drive Davina. I tell her it was a show in which the woman calls the man a laddish loser, says he has no chance, and they end up together. “Oh my God! So good.” She’s panting with excitement. And laughing. Pant-laughing. “Oh my God, you know I nearly did Streetmate again when it came back [in 2017], then they changed their minds and went for Scarlett [Moffatt]. Ilovedthat show. It was amazing.”But it was on Big Brother, the groundbreaking C4 show in which a bunch of strangers were locked inside a house together under constant observation, that McCall really made her mark, and for which she remains best known. The first few series were compelling. As was McCall, particularly when collecting newly evicted contestants from the house, with the catchphrase: “Big Brother house, this is Davina. You are live on Channel 4; please do not swear. Youhave been evicted. I’m coming to get you.”The first series of Big Brother was mega. A serious TV show the broadsheets were unpicking, a psychological experimentMcCall adored Big Brother. And still does. “The first series was mega. I remember thinking: oh my God, the broadsheets are talking about us. I’d never been on a show where the broadsheets talked about it, and here was a serious TV show that people were unpicking. It was a psychological experiment. It wassogood.”She talks about some of her favourite contestants – Anna Nolan, the Irish woman who had trained as a nun and with whom she’s still friendly (“We share the same birthday!”); Pete Bennett, who has Tourette syndrome; Helen “I like blinking, I do” Adams, who fell in love with Paul Clarke on the show; Nikki Grahame (“She was fucking great – so brilliant and funny and full of life”) and Jade Goody, who both died tragically young; Chantelle Houghton, who had to pretend she was famous in the Celebrity Big Brother house. She’d still be going, if I hadn’t stopped her.I tell herthat when I interviewed Petewe were both in bed (no, I can’t remember why) and show herthe photo. She howls with delight. “Awwww, that’s so fucking great. Oh my God! That is so iconic. Oh. My. God.Sweeeet!”Big Brother had controversies by the bucket-load – rowdiness, fights, a racist row after Goody referred to the Indian contestant Shilpa Shetty as “Shilpa Poppadom” and two other contestants used racist language. In Big Brother series five, fake evictions led to a huge scrap involving most of the contestants. “Fight Night was quite frightening when we had to get security to go in,” she says. “Nobody thought it would kick off like that. We learned more as they went on. Now they don’t allow alcohol like they used to. You used to be able to get booze whenever you wanted.” Was it booze that led to the problems? “That’s what they learned in the end. That’s why they locked the alcohol away.”How did she deal with the racist incident? “I owed it to them to give them an opportunity to know we knew what had happened, to not trip them up. So, off-camera, we said we saw the racist slurs, and this is an opportunity for you to make it OK. That was us trying to safeguard them.” She admits safeguarding was primitive back then. “They were greeted by boos on their way out. It was scary for them. Most of the time, when people came out and were booed it was panto. But that night it felt different. We’d asked those girls to go on that show. I felt the weight of that.”I tell her that my younger daughter, Maya, who was a huge fan of reality shows such as Big Brother, feels they are unreality shows these days – full of artifice and set pieces, and contested by indistinguishable, surgically enhanced influencers. We decide to ring Maya so she can say her piece.“I agreecompletely,” McCallshouts into the phone. “Completely.I think reality TV’s been going so long it’s no longer reality. People know what’s coming and they are so used to the format that they know how to prepare themselves, and it no longer feels real. I think it’s also because of safeguarding. The OG versions were where we’d get really real, with people from all walks of life who weren’t used to being on television. They wanted to be on Big Brother for an experience. But things happened that made the producers so nervous for people’s safety that they ended up going for people who maybe would be a bit more used to being on television.” Maya and McCall swap notes on favourite contestants. “Lovely to meet you!Byeeeeeeeee!”McCall insists it’s still impossible to fake it on Big Brother because the camera will eventually find you out. “To do eight weeks in a house with no contact with the outside world is really fucking difficult. After a week, even celebrities forget they’re on camera.”McCall mentions My Mum, Your Dad, the dating TV series she presented for older people looking for new love. She says that’s an example of a show where there’s still a high degree of reality. Yes, I say, but all the contestants were ridiculously gorgeous. “They had normal bodies, though. They weren’t people with loads of plastic surgery, and they had baggage. But we stopped after two series because nobody watched it.” Why? “I don’t know. I don’t know if they’re not young enough, if there wasn’t enough sex.”Did it upset her that nobody watched it? “What was nice was that those people who did watch it became obsessed with it and it was critically acclaimed. I’ve been in this game for so long that you know sometimes you do things you love and people don’t come to it.”In recent years, McCall has become something of an educator, starting with books on fitness and diet. In 2022, she published the bestselling Menopausing. “I hit menopause when I was 43 and then started talking about it when I was 45, 46. And I was so surprised that it was something all women were going to go through and yet none of us seemed to know anything about it.” Menopausing was named Book of the Year at the British Book awards in 2023.She says she no longer sees herself primarily as a presenter. So what would she call herself? “Now I’d say I’m an amplifier.” Wow, what’s one of them, I ask. “I take good news and spread it everywhere. Or I’m an information highway.” How long has she been an information highway? “Since menopause.”‘I was too good’: Sharon Stone on stardom, family secrets, sexual abuse – and her comeback after a strokeRead moreThe book she had wanted to write for two decades was about childbirth. But publishers didn’t see McCall and pregnancy as marketable bedfellows. Ironically, in her late 50s, they gave her the go-ahead. “I wanted to do this book 18 years ago when my son was born, but they thought this was a weird, left-field thing. But after I’d done the menopause book, people were like: ‘What would you like to do next?’. And I was like: ‘Yes!Now I can’t give birth any more, but I can write about it!’”I’m staring at a squiggle on her wrist as she talks. What is it? “Oh, this is a tattoo for my sister who died, Caroline. And this one is for my other sister, Milly.” Has she got any other notable tattoos? She lifts her skort to reveal an alien on her bottom. “I went to America for MTV and they wanted to film me getting a tattoo, so I was like: OK, I’m going to get HR Giger’s Alien.” Was that her first tattoo? “No.” She shows me her left wrist. “It’s supposed to be a rose, but I think it looks like a vagina with a pair of bollocks. So that’s why I got that stalk put on to make it look like a flower.”We’ve been chatting for over two hours. As I prepare to leave, I tell her that I had encephalitis as a child and I felt I came out of it a totally different person.“Yes!”She nods vigorously. “I think I’m just learning who I am without Jeffrey.” What’s changed? “When I came out of the operation, I didn’t know what country I was in, or that I’d had the operation done. I didn’t know anything. But I do remember waking up and going, ‘Oh my God, the noise. The noise in my brain,’ and I realised later they were thoughts.”What does she mean? She says she used to be so full of questions about how and why things worked. Often they were daft or inconsequential (What are the ideal-sized heels for women to wear comfortably? What is the perfect way to describe the colour of her shirt?), but they were still thoughts. “I said to Michael twice in the year-and-a-half of me leading up to finding out about the tumour: ‘Do you always think?’ And he said: ‘Yeah, I’m always thinking.’ And I remember saying to myself: ‘I used to be like that.’”About five years ago, she says, she stopped asking herself questions. “I’d stopped thinking, and I’m sure that was a symptom of the tumour.” Now, McCall couldn’t be more aware of the noise in her head, of those thoughts banging around, and she couldn’t be happier with them. “I feel I’ve got myself back,” she says.Stranded on Honeymoon Island is on BBC One and iPlayer.

To his left stood North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, the supreme leader of an increasingly strident hermit kingdom. To his right was the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, Xi’s “old friend” and China’s biggest ally in opposing the US-led world order. The last time that the leaders of these three countries were together in public was at the height of the cold war.“Humanity once again faces the choice between peace or war, dialogue or confrontation,” the Chinese president told the gathered crowds. His insistence thatChinawould “adhere to the path of peaceful development” was punctured somewhat by the country’s biggest ever military parade that marched through the square beneath his rostrum atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace, the entrance to the Forbidden City that has – on and off – been the seat of Chinese power since the 15th century.Alongside Xi, Putin and Kim, a gaggle of global autocrats solemnly watched the display of Chinese military might.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin, Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which provided a forum for networking at a level normally seen only at the United Nations.Photograph: Suo Takekuma/ReutersThe same day, more than 5,000 miles away, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his allies assembled in Paris for a summit on the future of Ukraine, a country that has been racked by war since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. The “coalition of the willing”, led by the UK and France, did not include the US. The optics of the new global order could not be clearer: an anti-western bloc, helmed by China, on one side, and a western alliance of democracies, lacking its traditional leader in Washington, on the other.China’s military parade, in which more than 10,000 soldiers marched in unison alongside a sabre-rattling lineup ofnuclear-capable missiles and underwater drones, was designed to celebrate 80 years since the end of the second world war. The parade had two aims: to promote the Chinese Communist party’s narrative about its role in defeating the Japanese in 1945, and to display Beijing’s political and military might on the world stage in 2025. Both serve to underline the legitimacy and power of the party, helmed by Xi, at home and abroad.Faced with a challenging domestic economy and a bruising trade war with the US, the parade was also a chance for China’s 72-year-old leader to whip up nationalism and provide what some analysts say is a much-needed distraction from China’s problems at home.“This kind of event is never about building bridges,” said Yu Jie, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. “It is more about building a political theatre to tell your own version of the story.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘coalition of the willing’ gather in Paris for a summit on the future of Ukraine.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockIn Washington DC, there was a growing sense of unease as Xi feted the leaders of some of the world’s most notable pariah states, including Russia, Iran andNorth Korea– a trio of countries that, along with China, has been described as “the axis of upheaval”. It is a consolidation of alliances that has been accelerated by Donald Trump’s use of political and economic pressure against his friends and foes around the world.“It’s being perceived as an inflection point here in Washington, I think also in Europe too,” said Brian Hart, the deputy director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. Western governments are “seeing thatXi Jinpingis doubling down on his relationships with these countries, despite concern around the world”.Trump, who staged his own somewhat lacklustre military parade in Washington in June, quickly responded on social media.“May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, andKim Jong-un, as you conspire against the United States of America.”A Kremlin aide denied that any conspiring was taking place in Beijing. “No one has been plotting anything,” Yuri Ushakov said. “None of these three leaders had such a thought.”Still, the show of unity among countries broadly sceptical of the US could not have been clearer.While the concrete results of the parade and the ensuing meetings between the delegations were limited – and many analysts thought that any real agreements to collude among the US’s rivals would remain hidden – foreign policymakers such as the EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas warned in strident tones that the meeting was “an authoritarian alliance seeking a rapid process towards a new world order”.View image in fullscreen‘This kind of event is never about building bridges,’ said Yu Jie, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. ‘It is more about building a political theatre to tell your own version of the story.’Photograph: China News Service/Getty ImagesBut the “axis of upheaval” is riven by significant internal fractures, analysts said, and the propaganda effect may have been greater than the real threat to the international rules-based order.“People in the west are freaking out, as if there is something that’s really big and meaningful and there is this alternative world order and everything,” said Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “And I think that the major reason here is really the dysfunction brought into the western family by Donald Trump.”A Chinese academic, who asked to remain anonymous, also said that there were cracks in the seemingly robust anti-west alliances, particularly between the two most powerful members: China and Russia.China is “pretending to have a strong relationship with Russia to push back against pressure from the US and other western countries,” the academic said.“China says there is ‘no limits’ to its relationship with Russia, but in practice, it hesitates, constantly looking over its shoulder, wary of pressure from the west, the EU and Nato.”Although China has been criticised for providing economic and political support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, the academic noted that Moscow turned to Pyongyang, not Beijing, for extra boots on the ground. North Korea is thought to have supplied about 15,000 troops to the Russian armed forces – something thatPutin thanked Kim for in Beijing.Xi, thought to be keen to assert his dominance in the Russia-North Korea relationship, also held talks with Kim this week. The Chinese leader said China and North Korea were “good neighbours, good friends and good comrades”, according to North Korean state media.The parade came shortly after the annual Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit took place in Tianjin, a city that neighbours Beijing. The blandly named conference was another diplomatic coup for Beijing. Dozens of leaders travelled to China for the economic and security conference, which provided a forum for networking at a level normally seen only at the United Nations.Most notable among the guests was India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, whose own relationship with China has been frosty owing to a border dispute and trade spats. Days after being hit with US tariffs of 50% as a punishment for buying Russian oil, Modi was tweeting in Russian about his “excellent” meetingwith Putin in Tianjin.But this week was not just about diplomacy. It was also about guns.Wednesday’s parade was closely watched by military analysts for clues about the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s modernisation. China’s military uplift has in recent years made it a naval power and put it on track to be capable of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan and the potential war with the US that such an act might spark.View image in fullscreenSeveral newly developed weapons and aircraft were revealed during China’s military parade, including hypersonic missiles designed to take out ships at sea, underwater drones, and electronic warfare planes that can fly with fighter jets to track moving targets while also drawing away fire.Photograph: China News Service/Getty ImagesSeveral newly developed weapons and aircraft were revealed, including hypersonic missiles designed to take out ships at sea, underwater drones and electronic warfare planes that can fly with fighter jets to track moving targets for them while also drawing away fire. An unnamed aircraft that was eithera real or mocked up stealth drone fighteralso turned heads. Meanwhile, the appearance of new submarine-launched and road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles confirmed that China now has a solid and diverse delivery system for nuclear strikes – from land, air and sea.“Did we know China had a nuclear triad? Yes, we did. But, that image really brings it home,” said Jennifer Parker, an adjunct fellow in naval studies at the University of New South Wales, Canberra.“That capability sets China apart from other nuclear states, alongside Russia and the US.”Still, analysts noted that none of China’s shiny new weapons have been tested in combat.And diplomatically, Beijing still faces challenges. For all its talk of being a stable alternative to Washington, it’s economy is only 60% the size of the US, and its ongoing stability is reliant on agreeing a trade deal with Trump.“China is far from being able, or willing, to replace the US as a global public goods provider,” said Alicja Bachulska, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Nevertheless, it is willing to exploit the current situation to build its image as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the US under Donald Trump, and to capitalise on it.”Additional research by Lillian YangDressing to suit the occasionView image in fullscreenIt is a sure bet that Xi Jinping’s sartorial choice of suit was as carefully selected as the spotless uniforms of the president’s synchronised soldiers.Composite: EPA, Getty ImagesIn a show as tightly choreographed as China’s biggest ever military parade, it is a sure bet that Xi Jinping’s sartorial choice of suit was as carefully selected as the spotless uniforms of the president’s synchronised soldiers.Xi presided over the 50,000 spectators in Tiananmen Square in an instantly recognisable “Mao suit”, chosen to signal the leader’s frugality and revolutionary spirit.The simple, tunic-style jacket, with four pockets said to represent propriety, justice, honesty and humility, was first adopted by Sun Yat-sen, the nationalist revolutionary who helped to overthrow the Qing dynasty in 1911. Blending Chinese and western elements, the utilitarian jacket symbolised a rejection of imperial decadence. In Chinese, the suit is still known as a “Zhongshan suit”, after the name Sun is known by in China.But to the outside world the outfit is better known as the Mao suit. Chairman Mao Zedong wore one to declare the foundation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.View image in fullscreenPosters of Mao Zedong in Beijing, who wore a Mao suit to declare the foundation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.Photograph: Jade Gao/AFP/Getty ImagesSince then, the suit has gone out of fashion among the masses, but it is still the outfit of choice for Xi when he wants to project authority as the vanguard of China’s Communist revolution.The suit is “saturated [in] political meaning,” said Sari Arho Havrén, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. “It commemorates the revolutionary past of the Communist party” and “shows the separation from the west”.For day to day diplomacy, Xi tends to favour a western-style suit and tie. But for major events, such as when he attended astate banquet at Buckingham Palace in 2015, he dons the Mao suit.Amy Hawkins"

The vaccine is a safe and effective way to protect against the infection and prevent serious symptoms.”There had been speculation at the conference from early morning that Malhotra would make the comment in his speech.A known vaccine sceptic, Malhotra had been listed in the conference programme as speaking on the topic “Make Britain Healthy Again”, a slogan borrowed from the Trump administration. Doctors had urged Farage in advance of the speech not to give him a platform.Malhotra had garbled the name of the oncologist who he cited in his speech. However, in the past hehas used X to linkto an interview with TalkTV in which Angus Dalgleish, an oncologist, linked Covid jabs to cancer.There was no immediate comment from Buckingham Palace, which first announced the king’s cancer diagnosis in February 2024. The Princess of Wales, Catherine, announced her cancer diagnosis in March 2024.View image in fullscreenKing Charles was revealed to be undergoing treatment for cancer in February 2024.Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty ImagesMalhotrahas long beena vocal figure for hesitancy about Covid vaccines, claiming they pose a greater threat than the virus itself – a view repeatedlydebunked by factcheckers.In his speech on Saturday, he referred to findings that were aired on a show presented by Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Trump. At the end of his speech, he went on to claim that the general public were being misled and that Covid vaccines had been responsible for killing and injuries.Malhotra had appeared on Friday at theReform UKconference at a fringe panel to discuss free speech, where calls were made for Britain to withdraw from the World Health Organization.The speech was one of a number of incidents that threatened to generate negative headlines over the course of a two-day conference where Reform, leading Labour and Tories in the polls, tried hard to project an image of professionalism.Signs that the party was managing to court acceptance in corporate sectors included the presence of a Heathrow International Business Lounge, along with a small number of diplomatic delegations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Previous schisms have emerged over its approach to Tommy Robinson’s supporters, while the party’s erstwhile MP for Great Yarmouth Rupert Lowe and its former deputy leader Ben Habib are among those who are now fervent critics of Farage outside the party.Farage used his closing speech on Saturday to appeal to Reform members to settle disputes in private. He asked: “Can we please exercise discipline and air our disagreements between each other in private?”However, Malhotra’s speech was not the only one to mark a descent into culture-war controversy that critics have long warned make Reform an unserious proposition for government.Earlier Sarah Pochin, the MP for Runcorn and Helsby, who has previously called for the burqa to be banned in Britain, told the conference she wanted to arrive on stage in a turquoise version of the Islamic headdress. She said the party’s deputy leader Richard Tice had said no to this.The MP was at the centre of a row in Reform UK this year when she called on the prime minister to ban the burqa and was later accused by then Reform chair Zia Yusuf of asking a “dumb” question as it was not party policy.Pochin also told members she would “not be silenced” by a new Islamophobia definition introduced by the government saying she would “see you in jail” if a new law on the issue was passed.The comments came in reference to a working group, led by the former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, which was set up earlier this year by Angela Rayner to provide recommendations on how to tackle anti-Muslim hatred in Britain, including whether to create a new definition of Islamophobia.The conference also ended with an appearance on stage by Lucy Connolly, the former childminder who was jailed after last year’s riots for a social media post calling asylum seeker hotels to be torched.Connolly said she would “love” to work with the party in the future, receiving cheers from the audience as she revealed she voted for them at the last election.There were no further high-profile defections from the Conservative party. The former Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told a fringe gathering at the conference that his teenage daughter, Mary, had joined Reform UK and that he was “having my arm twisted” by her to follow suit.Explore more on these topicsReform UKMonarchyCoronavirusVaccines and immunisationnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite being seen as one of the architects of Labour’s “new deal for working people”, Madders’ departure was not formally announced in No 10’s list of appointments. Instead, he revealed the news himself.“It has been a real privilege to serve as minister for employment rights and begin delivering on our plan to make work pay,”he said on X. “Sadly it is now time to pass the baton on – I wish my successor well & will do what I can to help them make sure the ERB is implemented as intended.”Madders’ removal, along with Rayner’s forced departure from her two government positions and post as Labour’s deputy leader, removes the key figures who helped design Labour’s employment rights bill – a policy unions praised as the government’s most ambitious commitment to workers’ rights in decades. However some within government have rowed back on this notion, insisting Starmer remains committed to the bill, describing it as good for business, workers and the economy – a central plan to make people better off.Starmer will also not attend this year’s TUC conference, a decision that has intensified concerns and rumours among unions and some inside Labour that the government is distancing itself. Rayner was the cabinet minister closest to the unions, and Madders had been given the job of turning the new deal into legislation.View image in fullscreenJustin Madders, one of the first junior ministers sacked on Saturday, was seen as one of the architects of Labour’s ‘new deal for working people’.Photograph: Mark Kerrison/AlamyPeter Kyle, a close ally of Starmer, was promoted to lead the business department on Friday, meaning he will oversee the employment rights brief.Allies of Rayner who remain in government believe a fight is looming over workers’ rights. With Rayner and Madders gone, they believe Kyle has the ability to water down the bill – a package they feel many from the centre of the party were never comfortable with. The issue is likely to become factional, given polls show stronger employment protections remain popular with voters flirting with Reform UK.The package had promised sweeping reforms including day one rights for workers, a ban on zero-hours contracts and stronger protects against fire-and-rehire. A union chief told the Guardian: “Rayner was the closest minister to the unions and her team have played an important role in pushing key parts of the employment rights bill through government.“The commitment to the bill is there from Keir so I’m less worried about that, but more worried about the broader sense of who actually understands the unions, and has the personal relationships.”Ellie Reeves has been shifted from her role as party chair to solicitor general and will no longer attend cabinet. She has been replaced by Anna Turley. Georgia Gould, from Labour’s 2024 intake, has been promoted to education minister. Abena Oppong-Asare, meanwhile, has been appointed as one of Starmer’s parliament private secretaries – a key role linking with the parliamentary Labour party.Ian Murray, who had been announced as leaving government on Friday night, has also made a comeback as a joint minister across the culture and science departments.For Starmer, the cabinet reshuffle was about showing decisive leadership in the midst of a major crisis, to which as his chief secretary, Darren Jones, alluded. But this junior reshuffle for many shows a broader ideological return that sees the government more cemented under centrist control, and potential fights with the unions along the way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mahmood, the new secretary of state, will lead a refreshed team that now includes Sarah Jones, a former shadow minister who has long wanted to return to the brief. As shadow policing minister, insiders have praised her for her work on pushing Labour’s agenda on knife crime, launching and chairing the APPG group that published investigations linking the issue to youth services and school exclusions.She will be joined by Mike Tapp from Labour’s 2024 intake, who takes up a ministerial role in the Home Office. Tapp represents a Reform-facing seat and his promotion is being read as Starmer’s attempt to toughen up Labour’s image on crime and immigration. Louise Sandher-Jones, another 2024 MP, has also been appointed as a minister of defence, underlining a new generational shift Starmer is keen to showcase in his new team.Dame Diana Johnson has been replaced by Sarah Jones and will now serve as a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, while Dan Jarvis will remain a minister in the Home Office and has also been made a Cabinet Office minister.Jason Stockwood, the former chair of Grimsby Town football club, will take a seat in the House of Lords to become investment minister as part of Starmer’s ministerial shake-up. He was Labour’s candidate for Greater Lincolnshire mayor but was beaten by Reform’s Andrea Jenkyns.The local government minister Jim McMahon has been sacked and will return to the backbenches, along with Maria Eagle, the defence minister. Catherine McKinnell resigned as minister of state for school standards, which included overseeing Send reform. She said she declined the opportunity to stay in government.Darren Jones dismissed the idea that Rayner’s departure could expose divisions within the Labour party, after Nigel Farage said “splits” will open.Explore more on these topicsLabourWorkers' rightsTrade unionsKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

At the previous major demonstration last month, 532 people were arrested for taking part. Participants gathered in Parliament Square by 1pm, many holding signs that read: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”At just after 9pm, the Metropolitan police said it had made more than 425 arrests. The Met’s deputy assistant commissioner, Claire Smart, who led the operation, said: “In carrying out their duties today, our officers have been punched, kicked, spat on and had objects thrown at them by protesters. It is intolerable that those whose job it is to enforce the law and keep people safe – in this case arresting individuals committing offences under the Terrorism Act – should be subject to this level of abuse.”Earlier, Defend Our Juriesrespondedto a similar claim by the police, saying officers “violently [assaulted] peaceful protesters including the elderly, in order to try and arrest over 1,000 people for holding cardboard signs” and shared a video of officers shoving people to the ground.A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries said: “Despite Mark Rowley insisting the police could and would arrest everyone who opposed the ban, it would take them another 36 hours to arrest everyone at this rate. Yvette Cooper launched the biggest attack on our civil liberties in living memory, and it has backfired spectacularly. Now Yvette Cooper is no longer home secretary, the ban must go with her.“This shows the new home secretary on her first day in office that the Palestine Action ban is impossible to enforce and a preposterous waste of resources. The terrorism laws were not designed to be wielded against a domestic protest group, or to arrest thousands across civil society for holding cardboard signs.”The demonstration remained largely peaceful, though there were frantic scenes on the outskirts of the square throughout the afternoon. Officers drew their batons during clashes and forced their way through crowds carrying arrested protesters. One protester was seen with blood streaming down his face, while several others were knocked to the ground in a crush.Police began making arrests shortly after the demonstration began. Officers faced chants of “shame on you” when taking two elderly people using mobility scooters into police vans.Steve Masters, 55, was among those taking part. “I’m here because I oppose genocide and I also oppose the government’s overreach in proscribing Palestine Action,” he said. “They’ve lowered the bar of what terrorism is and almost made it meaningless.”View image in fullscreenSteve Masters at the protest on Saturday. ‘While unpleasant, destruction of property to most people is not terrorism,’ he said.Photograph: SuppliedHe served in the RAF as an aircraft technician for 19 years and took part in the protest while wearing his four service medals. “As somebody who was in the air force, attacking an air force jet is not something that I would do,” he said. “While unpleasant, destruction of property to most people is not terrorism. They’re not going out to explicitly harm people. It’s a travesty of justice.”Protesters who signed up for Saturday’s demonstration wereinstructedto withhold their details from officers to force en masse processing at police stations, which organisers said would make it “practically impossible” to arrest everyone.Masters said he planned to withhold his details, meaning he would need to be transported and processed in a police station to complete his arrest. He said officers were in a “difficult position and I don’t envy them, but I also don’t have any sympathy for them either. They could stand there and say no. It takes moral courage because they may lose their jobs, but where is the red line?”Judith Gradwell, 80, who also held a sign that read, “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action”, is unafraid of being arrested. “It doesn’t matter, I’ve got my sandwiches in my backpack,” she said.Gradwell also plans on withholding her details from officers. She called the government’s decision to ban Palestine Action “ridiculous”, adding: “You would think after the Iraq war that they’d listen a bit more to what people on the streets were saying.”In the 1970s, she protested against the Vietnam war outside the US embassy in London. “I thought the world would be a better place by now but it isn’t,” she said. “It’s a much worse place.”View image in fullscreenJudith Gradwell, 80, called the ban on Palestine Action ‘ridiculous’.Photograph: Sammy Gecsoyler/The GuardianAnne Karpf was in Parliament Square to support those taking part. “I think it’s very moving and, if I didn’t have caring responsibilities, I’d be in there holding a sign myself,” she said, standing under a banner that said, “Holocaust survivor descendants against Gaza genocide”.Karpf said her mother was a survivor of Auschwitz and her father was a survivor of Russian labour camps. “What they would be thinking, seeing what is happening now and being done in their name. I feel pretty certain that they would be horrified,” she said.She called the proscription of the group “wrong on every single front” and an “outrageous curtailment of civil liberties”.View image in fullscreenAnne Karpf (third from left) called the proscription of the group an ‘outrageous curtailment of civil liberties’.Photograph: Sammy Gecsoyler/The GuardianAmnesty International said the arrests showed that “something is going very wrong here in the UK”.Kerry Moscogiuri, director of campaigns for the organisation, said: “Let’s be clear, it is disproportionate to the point of absurdity to treat people sitting peacefully in a group holding signs in support of Palestine Action as ‘terrorists’. Any restriction on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly must be lawful, necessary and proportionate to achieving a legitimate aim.“Criminalising speech in this context is only permitted when it incites violence or advocates hatred. Expressing support for Palestine Action does not, in itself, meet this threshold.”Mike Higgins, 62, a blind man who uses a wheelchair, whose arrest was seen by millions on social media, also returned. He was arrested at the demonstration last month, which hesaid“starkly highlights what an absolute waste of time” the proscription of Palestine Action was for the state, taxpayers, police resources and, “most importantly, [for] Palestine and defending the people of Palestine, because that’s actually what this is really about”.View image in fullscreenMike Higgins during his arrest on 9 August.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianSaturday’s demonstration has been the busiest by far. Hundreds of supporters gathered in Parliament Square and the anti-abortion group March for Life, set up a stage nearby with a sound system that occasionally blasted out music.Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionUK security and counter-terrorismnewsShareReuse this content"

The GPIAAF said the two investigations were entirely independent of each other and it will publish a preliminary report into the accident within 45 days.Investigators had already announced that 11 foreign nationals were among the fatalities. Three Britons, two South Koreans, two Canadians, one Frenchwoman, one Swiss, one American and one Ukrainian were identified among the victims.The families of a British couple killed, Kayleigh Smith, 36, and William Nelson, 44, paid tribute to them and said they were “heartbroken”. In a statement issued by police on Saturday, Smith’s family said: “Kayleigh was loved by family and friends for her wit and humour, her kind and caring nature came to the fore in her work as a funeral operative.“She was also a talented theatre director and had just completed a master’s degree. They both leave family and friends heartbroken.”In the same police statement, Nelson’s brother, who was not named, said: “Words cannot begin to describe how our family and friends are feeling right now but here is the best attempt. This week, due to a tragic accident in Lisbon, Portugal, we lost Will Nelson, who was not just my big brother but everyone’s.“He was always kind, selfless, and protective, and the world does not feel right or normal without him. He was and has always been my hero, and we will miss you always. Love you, rest in peace you legend.”Explore more on these topicsPortugalEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This time, the No 1’s nerves perfectly held up under pressure as she maintained her composure during a late surge from Amanda Anisimova before closing her US Open title defence with a 6-3, 7-6 (3) win.US Open tennis 2025: Aryna Sabalenka v Amanda Anisimova, women’s singles final – liveRead moreAs the best player in the world at the peak of her powers, Sabalenka continues to establish herself as one of the greatest players of her generation. She has now won four grand slam titles, drawing level with Kim Clijsters, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, Naomi Osaka and Hana Mandlikova. Sabalenka has established an era of dominance on hard courts, earning her four major titles with an equal share of victories at the Australian and US Open. She has now also reached six consecutive grand slam finals on hard courts.Eight weeks after being overpowered by Anisimova in their semi-final match at Wimbledon, Sabalenka played a smart match, maintaining pressure on Anisimova with her first strike tennis but also playing with greater margin than her opponent and making use of her more well-rounded game. Most importantly, she kept her cool even when the match became complicated at the end.“I think because of the finals earlier this season, this one felt different,” said Sabalenka. “This one felt like I had to overcome a lot of things to get this one. I knew that the hard work we put in, like, I deserved to have a grand slam title this season. So when I fell, it was like truly emotions, because it means a lot to defend this title and to bring such great tennis on court. And to bring the fight and be able to handle my emotions the way I did in this final, it means a lot. I’m super proud right now of myself.”From the beginning, both players made it clear that in a match between two of the most lethal shotmakers in the sport, nothing but the most fearless and clear-headed attacking tennis would be sufficient. After a nervous start, Anisimova worked her way into the match with the destructive ball striking off both wings that guided her through immense wins over Iga Swiatek and Naomi Osaka this week. However, under pressure on such a significant occasion and against an ultra-focused Sabalenka who pummeled her second serve, served well enough in key moments and offered few unforced errors, Anisimova was felled by her own mistakes.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka drops her racket in delight after winning the final.Photograph: Elsa/Getty ImagesDeep in the second set, Anisimova was finally granted a lifeline. With Sabalenka two points from victory on her serve at 6-3, 5-4, the Belarusian showed her nerves at 30-30 by completely misjudging a straightforward smash, slamming it into the net. Anisimova snatched the lead immediately, pounding a forehand winner to take the break before rolling through her subsequent service game.This could have been the moment she began to fall apart, all of her painful memories from this season rushing back. Instead, Sabalenka refused to let her emotions get the better of her and she closed out her fourth grand slam title with a faultless tie-break. Remarkably, Sabalenka has now won the last 19 tiebreaks she has played, a run that dates back to February.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sabalenka had entered the final convinced she was mentally and physically ready for any challenge that came her way. Instead, she fell apart mentally on the court and then lashed out afterwards in the press room, which became a source of shame as well as disappointment. Sabalenka also lost to Madison Keys in the Australian Open final.“After those two finals where I completely lost control over my emotions, I just didn’t want that to happen again,” said Sabalenka. “There were a few moments when I was this close to just let it go. I was like ‘C’mon now, you have to stay focused. Keep going, keep trying.’” It’s really helped me. I think I have to keep the same mindset every time - hopefully I’m going to make many more finals - so every time I’m in the final, I have to stick to the same plan.”On another enormous occasion against an American opponent, the New York crowd desperately cheering for her downfall all evening, Sabalenka put herself back together under some of the most challenging circumstances possible, pulling off a victory that may well guide her to even greater successes in the future.Having given herself another shot at a grand slam final at the next possible occasion after her 6-0, 6-0 defeat to Iga Swiatek at Wimbledon, this time Anisimova played a competitive match and fought hard at the end, but she was simply too erratic against the best player in the world. As Sabalenka entered her player box in the crowd to embrace her loved ones, a tearful Anisimova was comforted in her chair by the tournament director Stacey Allaster. “I think I didn’t fight enough for my dreams today,” Anisimova said.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Aryna SabalenkaUS Open tennisUS sportsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Gripping. A proper Test match. Australia put England under the most pressure they have faced in a long time with a superb first-half performance but the Red Roses pulled away in the second half to seal top spot and a quarter-final against Scotland.The victory was also England’s 30th in a row, equalling their own world record set at the last World Cup. The eventual 47-7 scoreline was not a true reflection of what a battle this final Pool A match was, with Jo Yapp’s Australia executing a successful kicking game to put the Red Roses under huge pressure in the opening half hour. England did not lead until the 33rd minute and Australia got some reward for their efforts, the result meaning they qualify for the last eight and a meeting with Canada.Ellie Kildunne ruled out of England’s Rugby World Cup quarter-final after head injuryRead moreWhile the errors made by England will be a worry, what may cause more concern are the injuries sustained to key players in the brutal encounter. The full-back Ellie Kildunne was substituted when showing concussion symptoms and will not play in the quarter-final, while Hannah Botterman went off with an acute back spasm. The back-row Morwenna Talling also came off for a head injury assessment but passed and is expected to be available for selection.Australia knew before kick-off that a win, a bonus point or a defeat by no more than 74 points would see them through to the quarter-finals. In the buildup the talk had been about causing an upset and they started on the right path with a scrum penalty leading to Adiana Talakai scoring from a rolling maul. England responded well, Jess Breach scoring on her 50th cap.View image in fullscreenSadia Kabeya scores her second try of the game.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersAs Australia cranked up the pressure, Amy Cokayne held the ball up over the line to preventanother score. Australia were almost over again when Caitlyn Halse popped a grubber kick through but Natasha Hunt picked up over the try-line and threw a pass to Kildunne who snuffed out the danger.England thought they had another try but a TMO check confirmed Cokayne had dropped the ball over the line and more bad news came when Botterman went down in considerable pain, putting her head into her shirt and heading straight down the tunnel for treatment.Errors from England stopped their usual free-flowing attack and Australia continued to orchestrate the game until Abbie Ward powered over. Australia had their own injury woes with Lydia Kavoa carried off on a stretcher before Sadia Kabeya scored to make the half-time score 19-7.View image in fullscreenKelsey Clifford scores England’s fifth try.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesA fumbled attack turned into a try early in the second half thanks to the individual brilliance of Hunt, whose footwork set up Kabeya for her second.

We were really competitive and were executing what we wanted to do but we knew England were going to come out hard in the second half. We just started to lose some of our launch plays and put ourselves under pressure a little bit.”The Red Roses continue on their unbeaten run but the performance was far from perfect.

For example, he has revoked the security clearances and details of some people in theBiden administrationand of peoplewho servedin hisfirst administrationwhom he deemed “bad” or “disloyal”; blocked somenews organizationsfrom the Pentagon workspace and White House press pool; and revoked security clearances of – and investigated –law firmsthat were “very, very dishonest”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTom HanksUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

I did what I could to recognise my wife because she was only bones … It’s a tragedy.”The Greek-born pharmacist, who met the Briton when both were university students in Germany 36 years ago, said he would be pressing charges against local authorities because of the way they had handled the case.“The investigation was not conducted properly. I have already filed a complaint against the police and the coastguard because they were criminally slow in dealing with my wife’s disappearance. Valuable time was lost and she could still be alive.”It had, he said, taken police three hours to write up a missing person’s report.The Glasgow-born mother of one was last seen on 1 August lying on a lounger on the popular beach of Ofrinio, near the northern city of Kavala, before her husband, who had nodded off on an adjacent sunlounger, awoke to find her missing.Images captured on CCTV showed the couple enjoying crepes at a beach cafe hours earlier. “Unfortunately, I fell asleep first, and when I woke up, she wasn’t there,” the 66-year-old said.View image in fullscreenAn image published by the Greek TV station ANT1 of Michele Bourda and her husband, Christos, on the beach.Photograph: ANT1Her remains were eventually found more than 25 miles (40km) along the coast. The couple, who lived inScotland, had arrived in Greece on holiday three days earlier.Bourda had a history of depression, according to Christos. But he said she was in good spirits on the day of her disappearance, and had left her personal belongings, including her medication and towel, on the lounger.Several hours later the alert was raised and the search began. But the pharmacist, who was quick to tell police that his wife had disappeared once before in the UK, after becoming despondent when she had lost her job at BT, claims that he spent much of the first day frantically looking for her on his own.“The police didn’t do anything,” he said. “One person who was there said she didn’t see any police that day either, not one single policeman at the beach. The only thing I saw was a police car driving up and down the road to the beach. Not getting out of the car, just looking in the direction of the sea.”A Greek missing persons charity, Lifeline Hellas, issued a silver alert stating her life was “in danger” and mobilising Greek authorities when it became clear she could not be found.At first the search focused almost exclusively on the sea, with the Hellenic coastguard sending out two patrol boats. Private recreational craft and five fishing boats also scoured the waters, extending rescue efforts across the entire Strymonian Gulf.When, after three days, the operation failed to yield results, the Greek police force took over, focusing their search inland.“After so many days, it’s really unusual that nothing should be found,” a coastguard official said at the time. “Protocol dictates that the police now assume responsibility for the search.”Rescue efforts intensified on 10 August, when a specialist missing persons team arrived from Athens with three sniffer dogs. “They were here for 15 days,” said Evangelos Kollias, spokesperson for the police force in Komotini overseeing the inquiry.“The scenario that she walked away was actively being examined. We had police officers out on foot and in patrol cars with drones and dogs looking for the missing woman. We had vowed to continue the search efforts until she was found.”Officials now believe that Bourda probably drowned and that her body was pushed by strong currents along the coast before it was discovered on the privately owned island. The results of an autopsy conducted by pathologists on Friday have yet to be announced.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropeScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

In the end, the film directed by Tunisia’s Kaouther Ben Hania took the runner-up Silver Lion.Divided into chapters set in New Jersey, Dublin and Paris, Father Mother Sister Brother features an ensemble cast including Tom Waits, Adam Driver, Mayim Bialik, Charlotte Rampling, Cate Blanchett, Vicky Krieps, Indya Moore and Luka Sabbat. Ina four star review, the Guardian’s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw described it as “a film to savour”.“All of us here who make films, we’re not motivated by competition. But this is something I truly appreciate, this unexpected honour,” said Jarmusch, who made his name in the 1980s with offbeat, low-budget works such as Stranger Than Paradise and Down by Law.Elsewhere, Italy’s Toni Servillo was named best actor for his wry portrayal of aweary president nearing the end of his mandate in La Grazia, directed by his longtime collaborator Paolo Sorrentino. China’s Xin Zhilei won best actress for her role in the Sun Rises on Us All, a drama directed by Cai Shangjun that delves into questions of sacrifice, guilt and unresolved feelings between estranged lovers who share a dark secret.‘Humanity is facing a reckoning’: Venice shrugs off the glamour to take aim at politicsRead moreThe Venice festival marks the start of the awards season and regularly throws up big favourites for the Oscars, with films premiering there over the past four years collecting more than 90 Oscar nominations and winning almost 20. It has often been seen as the most glamorous and least political of the major film festivals, but in 2025 the movies that made the strongest impact focused on current events, with the ongoing Israeli invasion of Gaza casting a long shadow.As he unveiled his picture last weekend, Jarmusch acknowledged that he was concerned that one of his main distributors had taken money from a company with ties to the Israeli military.The Voice of Hind Rajab, which uses the real audio of a young girl’s desperate pleas for help as her car comes under Israeli gunfire, was the fan favourite,winning a record 23-minute standing ovationat its premiere.The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw saidit was “a fierce, vehement piece of work”.In her acceptance speech, Ben Hania said: “Cinema cannot bring Hind back, nor can it erase the atrocity committed against her. Nothing can ever restore what was taken, but cinema can preserve her voice, make it resonate across borders.“Her voice will continue to echo until accountability is real, until justice is served.”The best director award went toBenny Safdie for the Smashing Machine, which starred Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson in the role of the real-life mixed martial arts pioneer Mark Kerr. Safdie said: “To be here amongst the giants of the past and the giants here this year, it just blows my mind.”The special jury award went to Italy’s Gianfranco Rosi forhis black-and-white documentary Below the Clouds, about life in the chaotic southern city of Naples, marked by repeated earthquakes and the threat of volcanic eruptions.Among the movies that left Venice empty-handed were a trio of Netflix pictures: Kathryn Bigelow’s nuclear thriller A House of Dynamite, Guillermo del Toro’s retelling of Frankenstein and Noah Baumbach’s comedy-drama Jay Kelly. No Other Choice by South Korea’s Park Chan-wook also failed to secure an award, despite strong reviews, likewise Bugonia by Yorgos Lanthimos, which starred Emma Stone.In the press conference following the ceremony, reporters expressed surprise that the Voice of Hind Rajab had been passed over for the Golden Lion. Jury president Alexander Payne said in response: “As a jury, we treasure both of those films equally, each for its own reason. And we wish both of those films a long and important life, and we hope that the support of the awards we’ve given tonight will help them, each in its own way.”Payne also denied claims that a juror threatened to quit over the awards, saying: “One of my jurors threatened to quit? … No. I think we know … not to believe everything we read online.”Explore more on these topicsFilmVenice film festivalJim JarmuschCate BlanchettAwards and prizesIsrael-Gaza warItalynewsShareReuse this content"

The death ofDonald Trumphas spawned countless tweets, TikToks and memes long before it even happens.“How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?”asked Fox News’s Peter Doocywith tongue in cheek. “Did you see that?”“No,” Trump responded flatly on Tuesday as senators and administration officials gathered around him in the Oval Office shifted their weight and smiled.The speculation that had swirled on social media over the weekend did not reveal much about the health of Trump who, at 79, is the oldest person ever to assume the US presidency.But it did offer an insight into an online culture ripe with conspiracy theories, liberal fantasies about Trump’s premature demise and an attention economy in which he has created an expectation that he will all but livestream his presidency 24/7.“This insatiable hunger for Donald Trump to be gone convinced otherwise intelligent people who pride themselves on scrutiny that here was the hope that he was dead and gone,” saidLarry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota.“It is a window into the danger of misinformation and the way in which that’s accelerated through the online memes and videos. It was quick and fairly effective in convincing thousands, maybe millions of people thatDonald Trumpwas actually gone, even though there was no evidence of that other than he hadn’t been seen for a day or two.”The rumours played out against a backdrop in which Trump has spent years lying and hiding his medical records while displaying a penchant for McDonald’s and other fast food, though he says he neither drinks nor smokes. Recently he has been seen with bruising on the back of his right hand, sometimes poorly concealed with makeup, and swelling around his ankles.The White House has said Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which means veins in the legs can’t properly carry blood back to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower legs. As for the bruising, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary,said it was from“frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin”, which Trump takes regularly to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.Trump’s second term in office has delivered a near daily onslaught of speeches, media interactions and social media tirades. But there were no events on his schedule last Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and he took the unusual decision to spend the Labor Day weekend in Washington.Meanwhile the USA Today newspaperpublished an interviewwith JD Vance. When asked if he was ready to assume the role of commander in chief, the vice-president said he was confident that Trump was “in good shape” but also suggested he was prepared to step in if anything happened to the president.Forbes reportedthat “Trump”, “is Trump dead” and “Trump dead” were among the top searches on Google as of noon on Saturday. The phrase “Where is Donald Trump” was trending on X.Over the Labor Day weekend, reporters did see Trump leaving the White House each day to visit his Virginia golf course. But he did not stop to talk and photos were blurry and distant. Adding fuel to the fire, the president posted a picture of himself playing golf with a former football coachthat was a week old.Fred Wellman, a political consultant,replied on X: “This is insane. The President of the United States is obviously lying about his activities and the lack of curiosity by the media is stunning.”There was also no shortage of witty memes and satirical videos. Danny Zukerwrote on the Bluesky platform: “Video shot earlier today shows Trump looking healthy and happy,” next to an image of a young Trump at a party with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.The president posted his own messages on social media, including the claim that he “NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE”, but conspiracy theorists were quick to dismiss them as the work of aides engaged in an elaborate cover-up.The new week began with social media usersasserting that roadshad been closed around Walter Reed national military medical center in Bethesda, Maryland, where Trump was treated for Covid-19 five years ago. Extremely online politicos worked themselves up into a frenzy, speculating that Trump was inside and at death’s door.To be, or not to be? The president, it transpired, was still very much alive. On Tuesday he held an Oval Office event to announce that the US Space Command would be relocated to Huntsville, Alabama, and fielded reporters’ questions as usual.Asked by Doocy about the intimations of mortality, the president replied: “I knew they were saying, like: ‘Is he OK? How is he feeling? What’s wrong?’” Trump said, calling the speculation “fake news” and saying he “was very active over the weekend”.The answer shed little light on Trump’s physical and mental condition, a subject that was a constant drag on his predecessorJoe Biden. But the fevered rumours did underline how Trump is missed when he is not filling the airwaves. For this president, nothing could be more shocking than the sound of silence.Reed Galen, president of the Union, a pro-democracy coalition, said: “The guy is so omnipresent that when he’s gone for 36 or 48 hours he leaves such a hole in the news. For those who make a political living on bashing Donald Trump, you need the daily tweets, you need the daily outrage, you need the insanity of a cabinet meeting or a pool spray in the Oval Office. When you don’t have it you’re like, wait!“It’s like you’re addicted, like you gotta eat ice-cream every day, and one day you don’t get your ice-cream and wait a second, something’s missing. What’s happening? The medium is the message. He has created this beast that even he must feed and, when he doesn’t, people are like, ‘wait a second, what’s going on?’ because it’s so out of character.”Others detect a double standard in the way that Biden and Trump’s age and health are scrutinised.Drexel Heard, a Democratic strategist based in Los Angeles, said: “There are the speculations: what’s happening with Donald Trump’s hand? What’s that on his head? It’s little bits and pieces. It’s almost like Swifties trying to find the clues from Taylor Swift but it’s nothing until the person actually says what it is.He added: “Donald Trump is as old as Joe Biden. How it is not being covered the same way, I’ll never know. Same thing with any of our older politicians that we’re not covering the same as we did with Joe Biden. That was started by Donald Trump, who spent most of his time during his off presidency years talking about how old Joe Biden was and laying that groundwork for people.”Like many other Trump dramas over the past decade, this one culminated in an opportunity to make money. On Thursday a pro-Trump political action committee calledNever Surrenderblasted out a fundraising email entitled “Memo from Trump” that began: “I’M ALIVE! The fake news media and the radical left tried to spread LIES, saying your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, was dead or sick. Can you believe it?“DISGRACEFUL! Let me tell you something, I’m more alive than ever! They say I wasn’t around for a couple of days, and suddenly they’re writing my obituary? Meanwhile, Crooked Joe Biden could disappear for months, and the media wouldn’t say a word. SAD!”The email invited readers to “stand with Trump” by contributing cash. But anyone itching to write the headline “Death of a Salesman” will have to wait.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJoe BidenUS politicsTikTokanalysisShareReuse this content"

I imagine you didn’t have too many expectations at the time. Why had you stopped taking photos by the time the band blew up?I told myself that I was not experiencing life, that I was looking at it through the lens of the camera. But what really happened was, after a few years, things stopped being bright and shiny and new and exciting. It was pretty clear that we were going to have a career, that this wasn’t just a 15-minute Warholian burst of fame. I just moved on to other things.It’s interesting you were bothered by that in the early 90s. Have you felt that way again now we’re all watching the world through a screen?Well, I’m not sure I was being entirely honest with myself; I think that was a convenient excuse [to stop]. But also, the rise of digital photography killed off my interest to some extent. One of the joys of photography was making something. Using film affects the way you take photos, because every time you press the shutter there’s a financial penalty involved! Whereas digital photography seems much more about the equipment.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWhat is the most chaotic thing that’s ever happened to you on stage?Once upon a time I was looking at my setlist and I didn’t recognise the name of the next song. “That’s not one of ours, is it?” I thought someone was playing a joke on me. I called my drum tech over and said, “What the hell’s that?!” He gave me this really weird look and said: “That’s one of your songs!” “Well, sing it to me then!” And he sang it into my ear and I went, “Oh yeah! That one!” Oh my God. The horror.Is it frankly a relief to havefailed in your bidto have become a UK Labour MP?Well, if I contested a seat I could actually win, I’d have to give up being inBlurand I’m not entirely sure I’m ready to do that. It’s not the job it was, I think. But you could say that about most jobs these days, couldn’t you? Being hated by 50% of the people you represent is not a position that would sit easily with me.What is your most controversial political opinion?Oh no. I don’t have controversial political opinions. You don’t get to run for office if you have those in the Labour party! They get beaten out of you at an early stage, along with your entire social media history.What is your most unpopular pop culture opinion?People are always surprised when I tell them the best music that’s ever been made is being made right now. People always think music was better in the old days, to which I say: “Bollocks!” That’s simply part of the ageing process. I was lucky enough to host a radio show a few years agofor XFMand I was blown away by the music people are making now.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were briefly, for a few months in the 90s, but actually we’ve all got on quite well since then. I get asked an Oasis question in most interviews but journalists usually leave it until last question, in case I storm off in disgust. Which always makes me laugh. As if 30 years later I’m still seething! But no, nemeses aren’t really my style. To have an effective nemesis you really have to be an effective superhero, don’t you? That’s where I fall down.What film do you always return to, and why?Bizarrely, the film I’ve watched the most is Aliens. I won’t be getting a job on any film or TV programs for that, but I love that film. It’s very well put together. I suppose Apollo 13 is the other. I’ve always had fantasies about going into space and Apollo 13 I think depicts astronauts as I would like to be.You are a proper polymath – musician,lawyer,politician,animator, photographer, pilot – but what is your secret superpower?My secret superpower is maths, rather annoyingly. I’m studying for an astronomy degree at the moment, and I was dreading maths, because I always found that very hard at school. And I was speaking to a friend of mine who is a mathematician and he said there is no such thing as hard maths, only badly taught maths. And with that attitude, I have finally conquered whatever it is that was blocking me from doing the maths!There’s hope for me yet! You really arequite the space cadet, which leads me to ask: would you rather die out in space, or at the bottom of the ocean?Out in space, yep. I’ve been to the bottom of the ocean many times, because I’m a scuba diver. I learned in Australia, actually, on my honeymoon to Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef. I can imagine what those deaths would involve and that’s not for me. But if I could sign up to go to Mars or start a colony on another planet, I would do it, even if it meant not coming home.Since you mentioned your honeymoon, what is the weirdest thing you’ve done for love?I learned just enough Sanskrit to write a love letter to a girl I knew. She was very impressed.Did it work?Of course it worked! It’s such a beautiful language.No One You Know: Dave Rowntree’s Early Blur Photos is out nowExplore more on these topicsMusic10 Chaotic QuestionsBlurfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Furthermore, they are doing so in a sporting environment that has continued to push the boundaries of what the unenhanced body can achieve, well beyond what was thought possible, or even safe, just a few decades ago.So what does it take to be able to keep leaping about a court or charging down a field at an age when many other elite athletes have called it a day and when most non-athletes are happy if they don’t slip over in the shower?View image in fullscreenLeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers takes a shot during a basketball match in 2024.Photograph: Harry How/Getty ImagesThe extraordinary longevity of these elite athletes is down to a mix of genetics, environment and lifestyle, according to associate ProfChristina Ekegren, a physiotherapist and researcher at Monash University in Melbourne.The Williams sisters, for example, no doubt have great genes, but they have also made the most of them. “The thing about Venus and Serena is that they’ve been training at a very high level from a very young age, so they’re starting out at a very high base level of fitness and strength,” Ekegren says. The younger of the two sisters retired at 40 after a stellar career that spanned decades, but her older sisterVenus is still going strong, becoming the oldest competitor to play singles at the US Open this year.View image in fullscreenVenus Williams plays against Karolína Muchová at the US Open on 25 August 2025.Photograph: AFP/Getty Images“What differentiates some of the athletes that you’re talking about is they’re very smart in their approach to healthy ageing as an athlete,” says sports and exercise physiotherapist Ben Herde at Grand Slam Physiotherapy in Melbourne.One of the normal processes of ageing is sarcopenia, or the gradual loss of muscle mass. It happens as a result of changes in hormones, in activity levels, in nutrition and in the muscle structure itself. But it’s not necessarily inevitable, and Herde says there’s increasing emphasis on strength training for older athletes, specifically to combat this decline. “If you compare that to someone who’s not training versus training, just that increased muscle mass will obviously give not only increased power and function, but it will offset the loads that go through the cartilage and the bones and even the neural structures,” he says.Like most things age-related, it’s a case of “use it or lose it”, Herde says. Elite older athletes are able to keep doing what they do because they don’t stop and let themselves decline.View image in fullscreenAustralian basketballer Lauren Jackson competes in the Olympics in Paris in August 2024.Photograph: Gregory Shamus/Getty ImagesAthletes who compete for decades also adapt to their changing bodies. They may be more selective about the competitions they enter, or play a different position on the field that exposes them to less risk of damage or demands less of them physically. “If you look at it like Australian rules football, they might have been a really dynamic, hard-running midfielder, and then as they become older, they’ll put themselves into the forward line where there’s less running,” Herde says.But older athletes aren’t invincible. Despite their carefully maintained strength, agility, body condition and skill, they do inevitably face a greater risk of injury as they age and, like the rest of us, those injuries take longer to heal. Part of remaining at the elite level in older age is taking more time to allow for a proper recovery both from injury and normal training, says ProfJeremiah Peiffer, professor of exercise science at Murdoch University in Perth.View image in fullscreenCristiano Ronaldo, 40, schedules recovery sessions to help his longevity on the field.Photograph: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images“A lot of this longevity within sport is because people are able to give the time necessary to recovery,” Peiffer says. “The more time you can give to recovery, the more time you’re not running around doing other stuff, the more likely your body’s going to adapt appropriately.” For example, football star Cristiano Ronaldo, who is still playing at 40, specifically credits scheduled recovery sessions as key to his longevity and achievement,according to Men’s Health.While elite older athletes are doing all the things the rest of us hear on a regular basis from our doctors and physios – eat well, stay active – they do pay a price for taking that healthy advice to the extreme.“The paradox to that is that there are a number of things that come with prolonged lifetime high-volume training that can be a bit detrimental as well,” Peiffer says. Elite athletes, particularly those who participate in endurance sports, have a significantly higher risk ofirregular heart rhythmsin middle age. And there are increased risks of musculoskeletal conditions such asosteoarthritis, especially in athletes who have experienced knee injuries.Despite the risks and challenges, Ekegren says, it’s important to see older people still excelling on the sports field, and to inspire the rest of us to put a little more effort into keeping up our physical activity.“We have this stigma in society that we can’t achieve to the same extent as we get older,” she says. “But I think that’s really untrue, and I think it really all comes down to how much you’re doing in your daily life.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingAgeingLeBron JamesFitnessVenus WilliamsCristiano RonaldofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Becoming single was a revelation; it gave me such a sense of empowerment as I was undergoing a big career change from teaching to social work.It was during my final placement in 2024 that I met Mill and was immediately curious about them. The working environment they created was really beautiful and safe, and they had this unusual balance of reserve and openness.We’d have these great chats on Teams, that often veered into something that felt like a real friendship, but Mill was my manager and we were both trying to keep things professional.The moment I knew: stuck in Chile in the early days of Covid, he brought me out of my anxiety loopRead moreThe potential power imbalance was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I’m actually a few years older, and once my placement was over it was me who made the first move. I asked Mill out to a gig in the work chat and the question hung in the air for weeks.At the last minute, they took me up on the invitation and we shared the quintessential queer experience of neither of us being sure if we were on a date or not.We didn’t really listen to any of the music that night; we couldn’t stop chatting. It was over the course of that evening that I realised Mill wasn’t nearly as serious as I’d thought. They have a great sense of humour and we learned we shared more in common than we realised. We’d both lived through our wild ratbag phases and were leading more wholesome lives, and knowing we shared that balance was really attractive.View image in fullscreenMill and Nikki at their favourite beach, Cape Paterson in Victoria, in January 2025.Photograph: Nikki JustineNot long after the gig, Mill went out on a limb and sent me a text sharing their feelings for me. A few weeks later we went on our first official date. We went to a soju bar for a nightcap after a comedy gig and took a long walk along the Birrarung before sharing our first kiss in front of an audience of garbage collectors as they emptied bins in the decidedly unromantic setting of a desolate Fed Square in Melbourne.I’d long wondered whether I was queer, and my previous forays, while meaningful and positive, hadn’t confirmed anything for me. I was really conscious of not wasting people’s time or messing them around while I figured myself out, but with Mill things were different. The attraction was immense, but there was also a deep sense of safety and calmness I felt around them. As we spent more time together outside work, I began to see the full form of this person. Their beauty and generosity of spirit runs so deep. Over the next few months we became a couple.Mill is always thinking of others. If you visit their house, they’ll make you a snack pack when you leave and theylove to celebrate other’s achievements.View image in fullscreenMill’s cake made for Nikki’s ‘deregistration’ milestone.Photograph: Nikki JustineAs the year came to an end and my social work studies were complete, it was time to decide if I’d continue paying fees to remain a registered teacher or let it lapse. It felt like a huge deal for me to close the door on teaching but I made the call and I was really excited to get the letter that confirmed it was official.When it arrived, Mill showed up at my front door with a homemade carrot cake decorated with the words “Happy Deregistration”.I already knew what a good sort Mill was, but in that moment it really became clear that I was with a profoundly kind human being; someone who noticed little details, cared about what was going on for me and was on my team.Even though the cake was about a bureaucratic detail, more than that it was the celebration of a new chapter, a deepening of my conviction in the life I wanted.As a younger person I always felt compelled to keep as many doors open as possible, but you can’t be all things to all people. It’s been a huge relief to shake off any lingering shackles of social expectations and my own indecisiveness. To be with someone with whom you share such a sense of being known and cherished, and really belonging, is so rare and so liberating. Being with Mill feels like the opposite of loneliness.Tell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

It was a film that sadly crumbled in its last act (and at the box office months later) but it was an admirable attempt to do the one thing people keep begging of directors: make the kind of films that they used to make.His follow-up, Fuze, also premiering at Toronto, is another hark back, just not quite as far this time. It’s closer to something that might have come out of British cinema in the early 2000s, a fruitful period for the crime thriller, spurred on by the emergence of Guy Ritchie and a desire to both return to classics of the 60s and 70s and beat Hollywood at its own game. In fact, it’s a film that would have hugely benefitted from Ritchie and his considerable swagger at the helm, resembling the kind of action thriller he might have taken on in his recent, underrated period, of expertly made if ultimately low-level winners.In Mackenzie’s hands, it’s a little flat, looking and feeling more like an ITV drama, sorely missing both a sense of cinema and a vibrant personality. The film kicks off with a burst of loud music, coupled with titles that suggest some attitude, albeit of a dated variety, and ends with something similar, with the last-minute arrival of some cheeky humour shared in some “what happened next” text and a spunky Ramones outro (Mackenzie has said the film is supposed to feel like “a heist film made by the Ramones”). But in-between these points, it’s all rather pedestrian, with a plodding TV score and a dearth of energy, a killer for a film about both a ticking bomb and a daring heist.It starts immediately with the discovery of the bomb (Mackenzie and screenwriter Ben Hopkins do get credit for keeping things at a tight 91 minutes), a second world war relic found on a construction site in London. It leads to an evacuation and the command of a military bomb expert (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) working with the local police (headed up by Gugu Mbatha-Raw). As they try to control the scene, a secret heist is under way (led by Theo James and Sam Worthington), all strands soon converging in ways that would be too spoiler-y to reveal.The Lost Bus review – Paul Greengrass wildfire movie is as stressful as you’d expectRead moreIt’s no surprise that things are not as they initially seem and the hatched plan is a fun idea, at least in practice. But while there’s something engaging in how the film takes us to a place so, literally, far from where we started, how we get there is not as entertaining or propulsive as it should be with anonymously staged action, easy-to-spot twists and a crucial lack of suspense. What had first seemed clever dissipates into silly, a masterplan reliant on far too many variables to make much sense. Yet Hopkins and Mackenzie seem convinced there’s something smarter afoot, ending their film with a baffling flashback that adds nothing but a sense of confusion to the ending and what they think their film is.Even before the mildly superior Relay fell afoul of a rotten ending, the film suffered from Mackenzie’s lack of style in certain setpieces, taking us to De Palma territory but without any of his precise choreography and sleek command. There’s a similar problem here and we maybe could have been distracted away from the script’s mediocrity by some more kinetic camerawork or by a score that made us feel something more (like the work done by the goosebump-giving music for Ritchie’s patchily plotted Wrath of Man). It’s somewhat lifted by an attractive cast who all know how to hold our attention (Mackenzie, like Ritchie, has an eye for actors who wouldn’t look out of place heading up a fashion campaign) but it’s never in service of all that much. Fuze isn’t quite a bomb but you’ll be frustrated at the lack of a spark.Fuze is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released later this yearExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalAaron Taylor-JohnsonThrillersAction and adventure filmsFestivalsCrime filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I tried 10 favourites to find outTom HuntSat 6 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Butter has a powerful place in the culinary imagination – it’s nostalgic, indulgent and rich in flavour. I love the way it holds texture, then melts into a slice of warm toast. But is that really too much to ask from a spread, let alone a plant-based one? The truth is, I haven’t eaten margarine since the 1980s – at home, it’s always butter or extra-virgin olive oil – but spreads are hugely popular. Is it mainly the convenience? Culture? Something else?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The main benefit of a spread is that it’s firm but spreadable straight from the fridge. It ought to taste good, too, but that seems to be an afterthought for many brands, which taste of seed oils and emulsifiers. It should also have a perfect melt time, so it pools slowly and satisfyingly on your toast.Once the bland, ultra-processed alternative to dairy butter, modern plant-based spreads are less processed, creamier, more flavourful and often motivated by ethics or the environment.Conventional dairy butter production carries a big environmental cost, mainly through land use andmethane emissions. By comparison, many plant-based spreads have a significantly lower carbon footprint. That said, they are not all created equal: some are ultra-processed, rely heavily onpalm oil, or come with sustainability claims that don’t quite add up.I tasted all the spreads solo, to gauge texture and flavour, and then on toast to test their melting properties. Some had that familiar, synthetic margarine smell, while others really surprised me. Butter obviously wins for its richness and depth of flavour, but some plant-based options are unexpectedly good. I gave bonus points for less processing, healthier oils, responsible sourcing and being palm oil-free, because we all deserve a spread that’s tasty, and better for the planet and our health.The best plant-based spreadsBestoverall:Naturli’ organic vegan spreadView image in fullscreen£3.90 for 450g at Sainsbury’s (87p/100g)£4.10 for 450g at Waitrose (91p/100g)★★★★☆Barley-white in colour, this isverysoft and slightly oily. There’s a refreshing scent of coconut and almond (a welcome change from the more neutral or synthetic-smelling spreads), while the flavour is enjoyable and balanced, with a light, buttery mouth-feel and good meltability that works well on warm toast. Organic-certified and palm oil-free, it also has low processing and saturated-fat levels compared with some other spreads. Fully recyclable packaging and minimal additives give this strong sustainability and health credentials, but its soft texture may not suit those seeking a firmer butter alternative.Best bargain:Flora original spreadView image in fullscreen£1.75 for 450g at Iceland (39p/100g)£2.65 for 450g at Morrisons (59p/100g)★★★☆☆Its rich, buttermilk-yellow colour and firm texture give this a butter-like feel; it melts beautifully on toast, too. Pleasantly salty and more complex than expected (thanks, perhaps, to the inclusion of coconut and fava bean), this melts nicely in the mouth and has a smooth, satisfying finish. The tub is fully recyclable, and this is one of the less processed options in this lineup, with low saturated fat and no palm oil, which is a significant ethical plus.And the rest …Pure dairy-free buttery spreadView image in fullscreen£2.15 for 500g at Ocado (43p/100g)£2.15 for 500g at Sainsbury’s (43p/100g)★★★☆☆A vibrant, candy-banana orange from natural colourings (carotenes) and the firmest texture of the entire test group, yet still perfectly spreadable and with a consistency akin to room-temperature butter. The flavour is classic margarine, with a firmer, slightly claggy mouth-feel, most likely due to the high ratio ofcertified sustainable palm oil. The tub is fully recyclable, and this is among the less processed options.Lurpak plant-based alternative to butterView image in fullscreen£4.50 for 400g at Sainsbury’s (£1.13/100g)£4.75 for 400g at Morrisons (£1.19/100g)★★★☆☆With a clean, ivory hue and a soft, easy-to-spread consistency, Lurpak’s plant-based option also melts beautifully. It’s light and mousse-like, with a pleasantly salty kick, though lacks impact overall. Its nutritional profile is a strong point: low in saturated fat, low in processing and palm oil-free. Packaging includes a non-home-recyclable insert, which is a minor letdown.ProActiv light alternative to spreadable butterView image in fullscreen£4.75 for 450g at Ocado (£1.06/100g)£4.75 for 450g at Tesco (£1.06/100g)★★★☆☆skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Sweet and pleasant, but slightly cloying. Performs solidly on taste and texture, and stands out for being low in salt and saturated fat, and relatively unprocessed. It’s palm oil-free and fully recyclable, which gives it an ethical and nutritional edge, though at a price.Tesco olive spreadView image in fullscreen£1.45 for 500g at Tesco (29p/100g)★★☆☆☆Pale yellow and extremely soft with a whipped, aerated texture. Mild and slightly sweet, with little depth, but pleasant enough. The 10% olive oil content is a bonus at this price, and the pack is fully recyclable, butit contains palm oil. While the formulation is relatively simple, it does contain artificial flavouring too. A reasonable budget choice for everyday use, though lacking in character or richness.Sainsbury’s olive spreadView image in fullscreen£1.45 for 500g at Sainsbury’s (29p/100g)★★☆☆☆Classic butter-yellow with a soft, yielding texture. Unfortunately, the texture is especially cloying, which overwhelms the mouth, but that’s less apparent on toast. Like the Tesco one, this contains 10% olive oil, and it’s a relatively simple formulation for the price, although it also features artificial flavouring – andpalmoil. Fully recyclable packaging earns it some sustainability points, but the flavour lets it down. Still, a decent pocket-friendly option.I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter original spreadView image in fullscreen£1.60 for 500g at Tesco (32p/100g)£1.60 for 500g at Iceland (32p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Corn-silk yellow with a firm, spreadable texture that melts nicely on toast. Falls short in the texture and flavour department, though: greasy, overly sweet and oily. Packaging includes a non-recyclable seal, and the ingredients feature a more processed formulation, including E471 (mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids), andpalmoil, which may be a concern for some. Despite its memorable name, this is not for anyone looking for quality.Vitalite dairy-free spreadView image in fullscreen£2 for 500g at Sainsbury’s (40p/100g)£2 for 500g at Tesco (40p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Blanched almond colour with a medium-soft texture that spreads well. The subtly sweet aroma is pleasant, and the mouth-feel is creamy and aerated. The flavour, however, has a slightly odd note reminiscent of processed soya milk, despite it being soya-free. It’s a fully recyclable tub, but theingredients list revealsa more processed formulation, containing E471 and E202 (potassium sorbate). The company says it uses only “fully segregated certified sustainable palm oil”, which means that 100% of the palm oil in its products is certified sustainable palm.Stockwell & Co soft spreadView image in fullscreen85p for 500g at Tesco (17p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Parmesan-yellow in colour, this budget spread is very soft and emulsified, and vanishes in the mouth; it’s quite greasy and lacks any real flavour definition, too. While the pack is fully recyclable, and the formulation is relatively simple for the price, it does contain artificial flavouring andpalmoil. But, at less than £1, it’s undeniably cheap and pretty good value for money.Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkThe FilterFoodDairy-freefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 22-year-old’s positive passing and physicality caught the eye at Villa Park, suggesting that he can fill a problem position in midfield forEngland, and he is in line to play again when England face Serbia in Belgrade on Tuesday night.England 2-0 Andorra: World Cup qualifier player ratings for Thomas Tuchel’s sideRead more“He’s just a very, very good football player,” Tuchel said. “He has the physicality, he’s very mobile at No 6. He has the body, he loves to defend, he loves to put his body inside to duels. He loves passing, he loves to break the lines, he’s very mobile in this game. It was a pleasure to see.“I think the team around him made it as easy as possible for him and he had a very strong performance. I think he showed today that he adapts to the situation. Can he show what he showed in training? Can he show what he showed with Nottingham and the under-21s? He played with a lot of freedom. He was very quickly in the flow. I think he has the physicality and he has the mindset to play in more difficult games. And for this performance he is clearly in the mix to play in Serbia.”England top Group K with four wins from four but they laboured at times against a stubbornAndorraside. It took an own-goal from Christian García and a header from Declan Rice to settle a dull game but Tuchel was pleased with his side’s performance.“We’re getting there,” the German said. “It was a lot of learning for me. International football is so different from club football. But we are getting there, I’m very positive about the group that was in camp now and how they presented themselves, how they behaved, how they trained and how we played today. I am absolutely convinced that we are on the right path. It’s always on us to prove it.”Tuchel insisted that Marcus Rashford, who has not scored for England in almost two years, can shine on the left flank. “He’s clearly a left winger,” he said. “He had the freedom today to go a bit more inside. He had an excellent training week and it was obvious that we want him to start because he trained so, so well on the left side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But as long as he trains like he did and behaves and is active and alive in the group, then we will always trust him and push him and support him.”Tuchel backed England to cope with a rise in quality against Serbia. Victory on Tuesday could leave them eight points clear at the top of the group.“Now we will prove a point in Belgrade,” Tuchel said. “The way is to win and to be tough. In the circumstances we expect a very emotional stadium, we expect an emotional crowd. We don’t know what the pitch looks like. Make no excuses. And then we come up against a very physical team.“We have to step up and adapt to the circumstances, adapt to the opponent and then prove the point we are a strong group and we are on the right way because I feel like we had an excellent five days now. It’s two days to prepare for Tuesday and hopefully prove the point that we are ready for that.

Part three in New York could be another classicTumaini Carayolat Flushing MeadowsSat 6 Sep 2025 13.13 EDTLast modified on Sat 6 Sep 2025 13.45 EDTShareOn a tranquil evening in Manhattan last week,Carlos Alcarazwas making his exit from an Italian restaurant with his sizeable support team when he unexpectedly found himself staring at a familiar face. There was Jannik Sinner, quietly enjoying his own dinner. This was the second occasion during the US Open Alcaraz and Sinner just so happened to be dining at the same restaurant at the same time. Neither player could hide their amusement as they greeted each other warmly.Considering the frequency of their meetings it would not be unreasonable if they were starting to get sick of each other: “On court we like to see each other, because it means that considering our ranking, we are doing well in the tournament,” said Sinner.” Off court we bump into each other at times. I don’t know if we are happy or not.”Once body-shamed by the USTA, Taylor Townsend became the US Open’s people’s champ | Andrew LawrenceRead moreThere is at least one more meeting to come in New York. The first US Open final of their rivalry also represents a historic moment. It is the first time in the Open era that two men have faced each other in three grand slam finals in one season, and in consecutive major tournaments. It also marks their fifth consecutive final, their most recent meetingcoming in Cincinnati last month, when Sinner retired trailing 5-0 due to illness. As if the stakes are not already high enough, Sinner’s ranking is also on the line. If Alcaraz wins, he will replace the Italian as the world No 1.Not only are they so much better than the rest, but the gap is widening. While the Alcaraz-Sinner era had long been under way, with the two splitting all four major titles between them in 2024, until June they had not faced each other in a grand slam final.After they faced each otherin the final of the Italian Open,Sinner’s comeback tournament from his three-month doping ban,a rematch at the French Openseemed likely.At Wimbledon, it was difficult to envision anything other than another final between them.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz, who is yet to drop a set at the US Open, celebrates during his semi-final against Novak Djokovic.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockBy the US Open, though, while they had six matches to win and the difficulty of navigating a grand slam draw should never be underestimated, this final seemed inevitable barring injury. It has made for an odd tournament over the past few weeks, with so much anticipation of this match from the first round.A month after Alcaraz demonstrated his peerless ability to produce his best in the most difficult moments by plotting one of the greatest comebacks of all time at Roland Garros, Sinner’s revenge win at Wimbledon broke a run of five victories for Alcaraz and showed Sinner a blueprint for success.The Italian suffocated Alcaraz with his destructive, relentless ball-striking off both wings. He also served well and kept Alcaraz’s offensive return position at bay by injecting more pace into his second serve. The Spaniard admitted he had been outplayed. He did not have enough time on the ball to disrupt Sinner’s game.It is for this reason that, although grass courts are supposed to be Alcaraz’s turf in this rivalry and Sinner has begun an era of dominance on the surface, Alcaraz may come to prefer facing Sinner on a medium-hard court. In addition to having slightly more time on the ball, this surface aids his kick-serve and the heavy topspin on his forehand, which are essential to his aim of constantly varying the trajectory of the ball to disrupt Sinner.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final this year, the Spaniard’s only loss since April.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAAt Wimbledon, under such suffocating pressure on the baseline, Alcaraz’s serve let him down. In New York, his improved serve has been one of the key reasons why he has been able to roll through the field, reaching a grand slam final without dropping a set for the first time. It is obvious he will need to serve extremely well against the most effective returner in the game. Every match is an opportunity to adjust and it remains to be seen what Alcaraz has learned from his most recent defeat.View image in fullscreenJannick Sinner is one of the most effective returners in the game.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockThree years on fromAlcaraz’s 2:50am, five-set winover Sinner after saving a match point, an instant classic that positioned this rivalry as the future of the sport, the pair will close that circle in New York.As they walk down the tunnel and on to the court at Arthur Ashe Stadium, it is worth sparing a thought for others. After years of being punching bags for Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer it was believed the demise of the big three would lead to a transitional era where, at least for a short time, many more would have the chance to win the biggest titles.Instead, two new legends have emerged and though they are adversaries on the court they have also conspired to ensure nobody else has a chance.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Carlos AlcarazJannik SinnerUS sportsUS Open tennisTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Onana has started only United’s Carabao Cup12-11 penalty shootout loss at Grimsby, in which he was culpable for both goals in the 2-2 draw in regular time.The terms of the deal withTrabzonsporare still being worked on before Onana makes a final decision.Manchester United seal €21m deal for goalkeeper Senne LammensRead moreOn Monday’s transfer deadline day, Unitedsigned Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerpfor €21m (£18m) to strengthen their options. With Lammens, Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton, the head coach Ruben Amorim has four goalkeepers in his squad.Yet with Onana expected to be part of Cameroon’s squad for the African Cup of Nations and so unavailable for up to six weeks from mid-December, Amorim had been relaxed about having a quartet of keepers. Trabzonspor’s interest in the 29-year-old prompted a change in his stance.Yet if Onana does complete the loan move, United could be exposed. Bayindir has made only seven Premier League appearances and has proved error-prone, while the 39-year-old Heaton last played in the league for Aston Villa in January 2020. The 23-year-old Lammens has never played in English football.On signing, the Belgian said: “I think if you want to be a good goalkeeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence. They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in. One of the best attributes you can have as a goalkeeper is staying calm under pressure, in any circumstances, even if you make a mistake or something. You just move on and try to give your best to the team.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedTrabzonsporTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Brighton had been scratchy, had struggled to create and were a goal down, but the changes transformed the game and they won 2-1. Hürzeler explained he had been guided by “a feeling that comes from inside … In some moments my body says something to me. Not just in football but generally in life you need to have the courage to take the decisions you want to.”Hürzeler had spent most of his press conference trying to deflect or at least share out the praise. He talked of his players and how important their energy and belief had been, and he stressed that the substitutions had been a collective decision made with his coaching staff. Management these days is a world of data and analysis, of careful programming and meticulous plans. But ultimately what won the game was Hürzeler’s intuition.There was something almost refreshingly old-fashioned about the revelation. That intuition, of course, does not come from nowhere, but is based on years of observation and experience. But that capacity to smell the game, not only to understand the technical detail but to ride and shape the shifting emotional dynamics of the occasion, often seems overlooked.The best recent example of a manager intuiting the psychological elements of the game and reacting accordingly perhaps came in March 2019.Manchester United went to Paris Saint-Germainhaving lost the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie 2-0. By half-time at the Parc des Princes, improbably, they led 2-1. Many would have attacked, seeking a third that would have brought an away-goals victory. But Ole Gunnar Solskjær instead had United sit off. PSG were quite happy with that: they led 3-2 on aggregate. Only in the last 15 minutes did United attack.They did so with belief. Solskjær himself was the embodiment of the club’s historic capacity to score decisive late goals. PSG wilted, as they so often had before when the line came in sight. United got a penalty, Marcus Rashford converted and Solskjær’s side went through on away goals. Attack early in the second half, and PSG might have had time to score again; the late assault, though, played on ingrained anxieties.View image in fullscreenFabian Hürzeler brought on four players and turned the game against Manchester City.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty ImagesGo back to the 80s or 90s and most of the discourse around English football centres on motivation and psychological tricks. Even 20 years ago, the conversation around the various failures of the England national team focused on their supposed absence of passion. Managers were seen as messianic figures, revered less for their tactical understanding than for their capacity to motivate.Some sort of correction was probably necessary but it may be that the reaction has gone too far. In part, that’s probably because that’s just how things are; resets never finish in the perfect spot. In part it’s probably down to the data revolution: the production of statistics that would never even have been considered a decade or so ago can create the fallacy that the game is entirely explicable by numbers. And in part it’s probably a result of the profound influence of Pep Guardiola, a tactical genius whose mastery of shape and position is so great that he has never much had to concern himself with geeing players up or instilling confidence.But, for most, football is not just about the deployment of resources and the best-laid plans. It’s also about recognising and seizing opportunity, the tide in the affairs of man which, taken at the flood, leads on to glory. Such questions are always bound up in hypotheticals, but it was hard to avoid the feeling last weekend that, an hour and a half after Brighton took their chance,Mikel Artetalet one slip through his fingers.Liverpool were vulnerable. They had conceded two goals in each of their first three games of the season. They had a midfielder playing at right-back and a new left-back who has looked extremely uncertain. There are still adjusting to the new shape in midfield. Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Newcastle had all madeLiverpoollook shaky by attacking them. What if Arsenal had done that? What if Arsenal had been aggressive from the off, had put Liverpool under pressure in the opening 20 minutes? Noni Madueke had the beating of Milos Kerkez; what if they had used him more? What if they had really tested Dominik Szoboszlai defensively?It was a similar story at the Etihad the season before last whenArsenal, on top with 20 minutes to go, seemingly opted to take the draw and protect their lead at the top of table rather than seeking a win that would have given them clear water over Manchester City, a policy that left them vulnerable to the sort of run of wins City then embarked on coupled with their own slip-up against Aston Villa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it’s true also that they were without Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz, with Martin Ødegaard fit enough only for the bench and William Saliba forced off early. But equally, what does it say about Arteta’s faith in his squad and his new signings if his response to losing players is to retreat into negativity? Even without those four, Arsenal are still man-for-man a better side than Bournemouth or Palace, perhaps even than Newcastle.By seeking control, Arsenal allowed Liverpool to stabilise. In the second half, Liverpool had two-thirds of the ball before they scored. It may have been a freakishly brilliant goal, but Arsenal created the environment in which that could occur; give a high-class team a lot of the ball and there is always the risk one of them does something exceptional.For lesser sides that may still be the way of playing most likely to bring a desirable result, but potential title winners probably need the capacity to read the mood and know when to gamble. It may even be that, in a tight race, that edge is what defines a champion. That is not a way of thinking much enjoyed by modern football. It likes statistics and provables. But sometimes, football – life – is about feel, sensing the moment and seizing it.Explore more on these topicsMikel ArtetaInside footballArsenalBrighton & Hove AlbionLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

As records fell in a blur of speed at Monza, the world champion was perhaps the most unlikely victor after an impossibly tight contest.The transformation since the 2024 Italian GP could not have been more stark. Over a tumultuous 12 months Verstappen has clung on toseal his fourth title last season, seen long-term Red Bullteam principal Christian Horner be sackedand the team comprehensively out-paced by McLaren. Here, they at last found a sweet spot that has been sorely lacking.Max Verstappen qualifies in pole position for Italian Grand Prix ahead of Lando Norris – live reactionRead moreIn beating the two McLaren title contenders, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, into second and third, Verstappen was immense. Both conceded they had been fairly bested at a track where last season an angry Verstappen described his car asan “undriveable monster”as he qualified seventh and finished sixth.TheRed Bullhas not traditionally been strong on the high-speed challenge of Monza where around 70% of the 3.6-mile circuit is taken at full throttle. Yet on Saturday in the Lombardi sunshine it was barrelling around the track with abandon in Verstappen’s hands.His final lap, with a time of 1 minute 18.792 seconds, was the fastest in F1 history, averaging more than 164.46mph and breaking Lewis Hamilton’s record set here in 2020.Quick GuideItalian F1 GP qualifying timesShow1Max Verstappen (Ned)Red Bull 1:18.792,2Lando Norris (GB)McLaren 1:18.869,3Oscar Piastri (Aus)McLaren 1:18.982,4Charles Leclerc (Mon)Ferrari 1:19.007,5Lewis Hamilton (GB)Ferrari 1:19.124,6George Russell (GB)Mercedes GP 1:19.157,7Andrea Kimi Antonelli (It)Mercedes GP 1:19.200,8Gabriel Bortoleto (Br)Kick Sauber 1:19.390,9Fernando Alonso (Sp)Aston Martin 1:19.424,10Yuki Tsunoda (Jpn)Red Bull 1:19.519,11Oliver Bearman (GB)Haas F1 1:19.446,12Nico Hulkenberg (Ger)Kick Sauber 1:19.498,13Carlos Sainz Jr (Sp)Williams 1:19.528,14Alexander Albon (Tha)Williams 1:19.583,15Esteban Ocon (Fr)Haas F1 1:19.707,16Isack Hadjar (Fr)RB 1:19.917,17Lance Stroll (Can)Aston Martin 1:19.948,18Franco Colapinto (Arg)Alpine 1:19.992,19Pierre Gasly (Fr)Alpine 1:20.103,20Liam Lawson (NZ)RB 1:20.279Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I think that final lap was pretty decent and to get pole here for us is big,” he said. “It’s not always been a good track for us, especially last year was quite a bit of a disaster, so this year much better and very happy to be first.”It was a day when the form book was being largely ignored as Ferrari, at their home race, also found another gear. Hamilton, on his debut for the Scuderia at Monza was greeted with an immense roar that echoed across the Parco di Monza as he emerged onto the track when the session opened and by its close he and teammateCharles Leclercwere in the mix at least, claiming fourth and fifth, although Hamilton will start in 10th,having incurred a five-place grid penalty at the Dutch Grand Prix.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen enjoys his performance after taking pole in Italy.Photograph: Kym Illman/Getty ImagesFourth and fifth is not whereFerrariwant to be but the fact that Hamilton and Leclerc were within two-tenths of the front will be taken as a positive result.Hamilton had also been enjoying the experience of his first Italian GP as a Ferrari driver. “So far, it has been incredible, amazing. I don’t know what other word I can find for it,” he said. “The Tifosi are everywhere, they are hiding behind trees. There are so many of them. As you leave the track they are on both sides as far as you can go and it is incredible to see the love that people have for this team. There is nothing like it.”The margins were tiny and the top spot was briefly in the hands of each of the frontrunners, only for Verstappen to come through at the last to clinch pole, a remarkable effort in a car that is not ordinarily able to compete with the dominant McLarens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pole was Mekies’ first as Red Bull team principal since he took over after the British Grand Prix and since which Verstappen has put an end to speculation surrounding his future by confirming he would definitely be driving for them next year, even if he did not go as far as saying he would stick out his contract to 2028.‘Living the dream’: Hamilton savours first Italian GP in Ferrari coloursRead moreCertainly the matter is closed for the moment at least, as he looks to focus on pulling off something of a coup against McLaren on Sunday. It will remain no little task to keep them behind him but the pace is potentially there to do so.For Norris, however, the fight is surely with his teammate more than the Dutchman. He did at least put himself ahead of Piastri, a vital moment for his title hopes given he trails the Australian by 34 points in the championship, afterhaving to retire at the last round in Zandvoort.Their battle endured its own moment of high drama when Norris had a real scare in Q2. He was too eager in to turn one and had to abort his first hot lap. He went out again and without a time, had to stay out and complete a sequence of one hot lap and two cool down laps before crossing the line at the very last to start a final quick run, which proved just enough to see him safely through to Q3. Starting 11th would have been another hammer blow to his title chances but the British driver held his nerve and the fight, likely a humdinger, goes on to Sunday.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenLando NorrisOscar PiastriCharles LeclercLewis HamiltonMcLarennewsShareReuse this content"

Her goal, a wonderfully whipped strike from outside the box after she had evaded María Pérez, to cancel out Kosovare Asllani’s opener, was the highlight, before goals from Chloe Kelly, Stina Blackstenius and Frida Maanum finished the job. A volley which flashed past a post from Alessia Russo’s lofted pass, a header wide and an effort which forced a smart save from the goalkeeper Elene Lete showed Smith has settled into the side very quickly after joining early in the transfer window from Liverpool.“It’s very special,” said the manager Renée Slegers on Smith’s goal. “It was a fantastic individual action, a lot of players had good individual actions but of course people come to the stands to watch good goals.”Arsenal is a club that has mastered the art of building a committed fanbase for its women’s team and on a warm Saturday lunchtime fans snaked towards the stadium in a show of strength, 17,000 season tickets (a mixture of full season and six-game bundles) sold before their 2025-26 opener. Between tiers in the stadium is a new significant feature in the team’s full-time WSL home, their record-breaking trophy haul displayed alongside the years each was won, the men’s to the left, the women’s to the right of the date.

London City were a complete unknown, 16 new signings contributing six to the starting XI and they shocked the bumper crowd by opening the scoring. It was a cruel goal to concede for the Gunners, 18-year-old Katie Reid culpable for conceding the penalty after starting ahead of both Lotte Wubben-Moy and Laia Codina with Leah Williamson absent. The WSL2 2024-25 top scorer Isobel Goodwin was dispossessed well by Reid but then she lunged in late on Asllani as she sought to pick up the loose ball.

Now we just need to create a team. I have a job to do to create cohesion.”The equaliser came via Smith’s stunning strike before Arsenal took the lead in added time at the end of the first half. Elena Linari’s pass was intercepted by Emily Fox who fed Russo and the England forward turned it across the face of goal for Kelly to tap in.Blackstenius added a third, converting from fellow substitute Beth Mead’s ball and a minute later it was four, those two combining before Mead crossed for Maanum to nod in.It was not a game where you can draw any real conclusions about how London City will do in their maiden WSL season but it showed them and watching billionaire owner Michele Kang just what can be achieved. Founded in 1987, the Gunners have a 36-year head start on London City, Kang having bought the club in 2023. Money cannot buy history, but it can kickstart a journey.

The stage ended without a winner after organisers decided to take the time at three kilometres before the line as police struggled to contain hundreds of Palestinian flag-waving protesters in Bilbao. The Israel-Premier Tech team were also stopped on the road by a group holding Palestinian flags during last week’s team time trial in Figueres.“In the interest of prioritising the safety of our riders and the entire peloton, in light of the dangerous nature of some protests at the Vuelta, Israel-Premier Tech has issued riders with team monogram-branded kit for the remainder of the race,” the team said on Saturday.“The team name remains Israel-Premier Tech, but the monogram kit now aligns with the branding decisions we have previously adopted for our vehicles and casual clothing.“The decision drew praise from Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who posted on X: “Great job to Sylvan [Adams] and Israel’s cycling team for not giving in to hate and intimidation. You make Israel proud!”Before stage 11, the Professional Cyclists’ Association had called for better security at the Vuelta after a number of incidents involving protesters led to concern over rider safety, with the Israel-Premier Tech team the main target. After Wednesday’s incident, the team said they remained committed to continuing the race and respected everyone’s “right to protest, as long as those protests remain peaceful and do not compromise the safety of the peloton”.Saturday’s stage 14 was won by Spain’s Marc Soler, who left the competition far behind with a solo attack on a climactic category one climb.

The British rider said: “I lost a bit more time, but I’m getting better and better at these longer efforts.”The race continues on Sunday with a 167.8km ride from Vegadeo to Monforte de Lemos.Meanwhile, Remco Evenepoel (Soudal Quick-Step) denied British duo Thomas Gloag (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Oscar Onley (Picnic PostNL) in a sprint finish to win stage five of the Tour of Britain.The Belgian took the queen stage of the tour at the top of The Tumble in South Wales to move up to second in the overall standings, two seconds behind Romain Grégoire (Groupama-FDJ) who finished fifth on the same time.Evenepoel now has his sights on overall victory with the final stage from Newport to Cardiff on Sunday. He said: “To go out with a GC win, it would be a really good confidence boost for myself after a long period out of competition.

Rapists count on this being untrue – and Trump is proving them rightSat 6 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 6 Sep 2025 06.04 EDTShareRape is a crime against democracy in the most immediate sense of equality between individuals and the premise that we’re all endowed with certain inalienable rights. Most rapists operate on the premise that they can not only overpower the victim physically, but can do so socially and legally. They count on a system that discounts the voices of victims and only too often cooperates in silencing them, through shame, intimidation, threats, discrediting, the obscene legal instrument known as a nondisclosure agreement and a system too often run by men for men at the expense of women and children. That is to say, rapists count on getting away with it because of a system that hands them power and steals it from their victims. They count on a silencing system. On profound inequality.Which is what makes rape such a peculiar crime: it is the ritual enactment of the perpetrator’s power and the victim’s powerlessness, buttressed by the circumstances that puts and keeps each of them in those roles. It’s driven by the desire to use sexuality to cause physical and psychic injury, to dominate, to celebrate the rapist’s power and the victim’s powerlessness, to treat another human being as a person without rights, including the right to set boundaries, to say no and to speak up afterward. A society that perpetuates and protects this desire and arrangement is rape culture, and it’s been our culture throughout most of its existence.I dated Jeffrey Epstein. The files must be released | Stacey WilliamsRead moreDemocracy, in this context, means a society and system in which everyone’s rights matter, everyone’s voice is heard and everyone is equal under the law. Rapists count on this not being true, but is has become more true over the past half century, thanks to feminism, and changed a lot more over the past dozen years, thanks to more feminism. There has been a shift toward equality of of voice, rights and support from the legal system, from arresting officers to investigations, judges and juries (who, thanks to feminism, are no longer exclusively male). It hasn’t changed enough, but it’s changed a lot, which is how a hundred survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s rape club were able to gather with the support of Thomas Massie, a Republican congressperson from Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative from California, on Wednesday morning to speak to the world about their experiences and demand justice.They became victims, and some were abused for years, because of the power differential between Epstein and the girls and young women. His power consisted not only of his immense and still-unexplained wealth, but of aid from a host of others. Some actively cooperated in manipulating and abusing them, as groomer and pimp-in-chiefGhislaine Maxwelldid, along with the fellow rapists to whom Epstein offered these children and young women. Others knew and chose to protect him and his fellow abusers, and some still do, all the way to the very top.Mike Johnson, the House speaker, adjourned Congress earlier this summer to prevent votes on measures relating to Epstein and thereby protect Donald Trump. As the New Republicreportedon Tuesday, “House Speaker Mike Johnson is offering Republicans a cowardly out to avoid voting on a bipartisan discharge petition to release the Epstein files in full.” Johnson’s main concern in this (and pretty much everything else he does) is to protect Trump. He is not alone. Jamie Raskinsaidin July: “They’d conscripted a thousand FBI agents to be working around the clock 24 hours going through a hundred thousand Epstein documents and told them to flag any mentions of Donald Trump ... This might be one of the most massive cover-ups in the history of the United States unfolding before our eyes.”The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, ordered this frantic censorship scheme to protect Trump, which should have begotten a thousand front-page news stories demanding to know what exactly it took a thousand agents to hide from us and who exactly Trump is that he requires this kind of anti-democratic protection. Like Johnson, and like Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, who conducted a long, deeply wrong exculpatory softball interview with Maxwell, she’s serving one man rather than the 342 million people of this country. Trump himself, who over the summer seemed terrified and eager to distract from whatever there is to be found out about his role in all this, once again attempted to silence victims by calling the whole thing “a Democrat hoax” immediately after the news conference. Survivor Haley Robson called out Trump and declared: “I cordially invite you to the Capitol to meet me in person so you can understand this is not a hoax.”The women who spoke at Wednesday morning’s press conference made it clear they still fear they face threats, that the machinery of silencing is still at work. Katie Tarrant of the Washington Postwrites, “Lisa Phillips, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, and her lawyer Brad Edwards, said victims were scared to speak publicly about other abusers for fear of legal action. Her response came in response to a question about a client list some victims said they are compiling.” Another Post journalist reports, “Anouska De Georgiou, who said she was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, said she and her daughter were threatened when she volunteered to be a witness in a lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell.”And this attempt to suppress the truth about crimes and silence victims is only too consistent with the Republican party and theTrump administration. The attacks on immigrants, refugees, Black and brown people, women, trans people, the positioning of the administration as above the law with the cooperation of the rogue conservatives of the supreme court: all this is an attempt to roll back not only the democratic gains of the past several decades, but the democratic principles of universal rights and equality under the law embedded in the constitution and the Bill of Rights.Rendering women second-class or maybe 11th-class citizens again is at the heart of the current rightwing agenda, with its pursuit of criminalization of pregnancy, denial of reproductive rights including access to birth control, the right to choose whether to bear children, and life-saving care for women who have miscarriages or otherwise need a pregnancy terminated. But this is only part of the attack on women. The administration has disproportionately fired Black women from government jobs. 300,000 Black womenhave left– or been pushed out of – the workforce in the last three months.Pete Hegseth, who himself settledrape allegationsout of court, has fired women in high positions in the military, claims women are less qualified than men and hasbeen repostingvideos from Christian fanatics asserting women should not have the right to vote. Trump’s is quite literally a pro-crime administration, as major branches of federal government are pulled away from pursuing criminals to persecuting immigrants, often violating the law to do so. The administration has sought tocutfunding for and dismantle programs addressing domestic violence. And of course the Trump administration is headed by Donald J Trump – a judge found in a civil claim that it was “substantially true” that Trump raped journalist E Jean Carroll. It’s rapists all the way down, and enablers all the way up.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

And baby boomers could be her first target.At the moment the chancellor gives away more than £50bn in tax relief for pension saving, most of which goes to wealthier boomers and better-paid gen Xers who do not need the money and would save anyway if state support was more limited.A remodelling of pension subsidies – cutting the 40p higher rate to a flat rate of 25p for all savers – could claw back £10bn to £20bn in extra income tax and national insurance payments, depending on how the new regime is constructed.In a separate but related move, Reeves could reduce or scrap the tax-free allowance, a privilege that allows for a quarter of retirement savings to be taken as a tax-free lump sum.Boomers have been exercising their “right” to tax-free cash for decades at everyone else’s expense. While some savers need the money to pay off debts or help with the cost of living, it has always been unclear why this indiscriminate benefit should be gifted to those who, by definition, have more money than most by virtue of having a pension.Fears that pension reform is imminent have already triggered a rush of older savers keen to exit with the biggest bag of tax-free cash they can muster.According to a freedom of information request by the wealth manager Evelyn Partners, figures from the Financial Conduct Authority show that individuals withdrew £18.1bn from their pension pots in the year to the end of March, up from £11.25bn in the previous year.The figures showed that most of the money taken out was in the second half of the tax year, after it became clear that Labour would need to raise more cash to keep the public finances in balance over the rest of the parliament.Such is the yawning gap in the public finances that Reeves, one of the few senior ministers to remain in the same post inFriday’s post-Angela Rayner reshuffle, needs to consider big, bold reforms to taxes that are outmoded and unfair. But what kind of reforms and how to do it? On the question of wealth and how to go about taxing it, the Treasury is sailing on an open sea without the navigational instruments needed to give a sense of direction.One of the main problems is the total lack of agreement among the UK’s main thinktanks, academics and the population at large about which taxes are most in need of being reworked.There was a time when the government of the day would sponsor a royal commission to consider the best way forward. But these days ministers are always in too much of a hurry. Or consider that a commission will choose remedies they find awkward, placing them in a politically difficult position.TheMirrlees Reviewof 2010-11 attempted to clean up a complex tax system and eliminate many of the most egregious tax breaks. There is little sign of a follow-up.In addition to pensions, ministers could overhaul council tax, which has a special place in the pantheon of bad taxes. The arguments for a change are many when the annual payments are based on property values from a previous century and the limited number of bands mean that the most expensive homes pay little more than the cheapest.Oxford University’s John Muellbauer suggests the government switch to a tax based on a percentage of a property’s value. A veteran housing expert, the Nuffield College professor would abolish the top two tax bands – G and H – and instead levy a charge of 0.5% of the property’s value. For the first time the tax on a £10m home would not be £3,000 to £4,000 a year, but more like £50,000.This shift would involve valuing about 1.1m homes in the G and H bands, which is much easier than valuing all 29m homes, which many economists and thinktanks advocate as part of a complete overhaul.Muellbauer calculates that the new property tax levy could raise up to £10bn for Reeves, who under his plan would cream off the excess generated by the shift, leaving councils no worse off. Older boomers who refuse to downsize could defer their payments with a small surcharge. Over time, band by band, the whole council tax system could be modernised.This proposal satisfies the most immediate need for money to fill Reeves’s budget shortfall while putting in place a system that can be expanded over time.Muellbauer lacks public backers, despite presenting his work inside Whitehall and to various thinktanks. And yet without the kind of support that gives such proposals momentum, the Treasury can be expected to dither.There are rival proposals aimed at the main wealth taxes already on the statute book – council tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty on property purchases – but they all call for a more comprehensive overhaul, one that will be politically more difficult for Reeves to pursue.Given the need for No 10 and the Treasury to agree a plan ahead of the autumn budget, thinktank rivalry and academic competition could be the boomers’ saviour. Pension changes and Muellbauer’s plan deserve support, yet without a coalition behind them, ministers will probably want to stick with their standard mode of operation: muddling through.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyEconomics viewpointEconomic growth (GDP)Rachel ReevesBudget deficitTax and spendingPensionsPensions industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps instead she should ask her husband to stop gutting public educationSat 6 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 6 Sep 2025 13.27 EDTShareMelanAI is coming for your kids“The robots are here,”proclaimedMelania Trump during an AI event at the White House on Thursday. It can be hard to parse the first lady’s poker face and expressionless voice, but this certainly wasn’t a statement of regret. Rather Trump, reading from a script encased in a very analogue binder, was taking it upon herself to help America’s children navigate AI, which she touted as the “greatest engine of progress in the history of the United States of America”.“As leaders and parents, we must manage AI’s growth responsibly,” she said in her speech. “During this primitive stage, it is our duty to treat AI as we would our own children.”Does that mean foisting them off to anannyor, as Donald Trump once did with Donald Trump Jr, abandoningthem at the airportbecause they’re five minutes late? No, it means “empowering, but with watchful guidance”, apparently.Melania Trump doesn’t grace the White House with her presence particularly often. The first lady has made clear that she is not beholden to things like “duty” or “tradition” like her predecessors. She does what she wants, when she wants. And Thursday’s roundtable on AI is the latest indication that she wants to position herself as a leading figure in the future of technology. Like the rest of her family, the first lady has enthusiastically embraced NFTs and cryptocurrency – and their amazing ability to rapidly generate the Trumps an immenseamount of wealth. She’s alsoboastedabout using an AI version of her voice to narrate the audiobook version of Melania.And last monthshe launched an AI contest for kids in grades K-12.The first lady isn’t just positioning herself as a leading voice in technology; she’s trying to brand herself as the face of responsibleinnovation. While announcing her AI contest for kids, for example, she boasted that she’d “championed online safety through theTake It Down Act” (TDA). It’s true that Melania advocated for the TDA, which passed Congress with bipartisan support earlier this year and criminalizes the nonconsensual distribution of intimate imagery (NDII, once known as “revenge porn”.) Nevertheless, the legislation is rather more complicated than she’d have it seem.Image-base sexual abuse (both authentic imagery and AI-generated content) is a serious problem that scholars and activists have been trying to address via legislation for along time. While it’s commendable that Trump wanted to get involved with the TDA, some people believe she swooped in at the last minute and put her name to a dangerously bastardized version of a model statute that experts developed. Numerous civil rights activists havewarnedthat the TDA has been broadened so much that it will be weaponized against free speech.“I am gratified that the [TDA] incorporates much of the language of the model federal statute against NDII I first drafted in 2013,” wrote Dr Mary Anne Franks, president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, in astatementearlier this year. “But the Take It Down Act also includes a poison pill: an extremely broad takedown provision that will likely end up hurting victims more than it help.”TheElectronic Frontier Foundationhas similarly warned that the TDA is so broad that it gives the “powerful a dangerous new route to manipulate platforms into removing lawful speech that they simply don’t like”. Indeed, the president has said as much himself. “I’m going to use that bill for myself too if you don’t mind, because nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody,”he tolda joint session of Congress.All of which to say: Melania Trump may not be the best person to help manage AI’s growth responsibly and shield children from potential harm from the technology. But if she is keen on doing this work then I suggest she stop convening taskforces on how to integrate AI into childhood education, and simply ask her husband to stopgutting public educationinstead. The Trump administration is, for example, attempting todefund Head Start, a federally funded early childhood program for low-income families, andcancelleda grant program that has historically funded educational children’s programs like Sesame Street. The Trump administration is also trying tocurtail educationabout slavery and Republicans are waging war on Wikipedia totry to remove criticismof Israel. More broadly,book bansandcensorshipare flourishing under Trump.Melania Trump is right that the robots are here, and they’re here to stay. But I’m not convinced that the Trump administration is going to responsibly integrate AI into our schools in a way that increases equity and the sum of human knowledge. Rather I think it’s more likely that all these AI taskforces will succeed in doing is diverting large sums of taxpayer money towards the tech CEOs who have been busy bowing to Trump.AI “will make a few people much richer and most people poorer”, Christopher Hinton, the so-called godfather of AI, told the Financial Timeson Friday. Which, I suspect, is precisely why Melania Trump and the coterie of billionaires and tech executives gathered around her at the White House are so excited about it.Accused rapist Conor McGregor wants to be the next president of IrelandMcGregorrecently lost an appealover a civil court ruling last year awarding damages to a woman who accused him of rape.

I was in a rehearsal room in London surrounded by the shellshocked and outraged. The media I read on the tube home reiterated what I’d heard all day: these leave voters were ignorant and racist. My townvoted just over 70% for leave. Three years later the constituencyvoted Conservativefor the first time in its history. In a recent council election itvoted Reform. There comes a time when the unthinkable becomes inevitable.My town is in the East Midlands. Where it was once coal mining and manufacturing that provided work for many people, it is nowa huge distribution warehouse for Sports Direct. Many eastern European people have made Shirebrooktheir home and work at the warehouse. I have been thinking about towns such as mine – and there are many of them – with the recent outpouring of anger and xenophobia towards asylum seekers and migrants.One of the things I treasure most about writing plays is the opportunity to suspend judgment – my characters speak and I listen; my characters do and I watch. I find it freeing and am astonished how much they have surprised me: characters are as vast as we allow them to be – and people in real life are no different. Yet we are often at pains to shrink people, simplify them: I can do it in my own life as well. It allows us to tell that joke or “win” that argument.View image in fullscreenShirebrook, Derbyshire in 2019.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianI have no argument to win in my play, Till the Stars Come Down–and the jokes are never at the characters’ expense.The play takes place on the day of a wedding between a local woman and a Polish immigrant. It is the story of a multigenerational working-class family grappling with a changing community and world, as well as their own swelling desires and losses. It is passionate and hilarious and deeply political, but you won’t hear characters arguing about Brexit or Reform. They are living politics, not commenting on them.I’m inspired by Chekhov, whose plays are not immediately thought of as political. He doesn’t tell us what his own political opinions are and his characters very rarely do. And yet the plays are about families living through significant cultural and economic changes in societies that are on the brink of revolution. When Chekhov is writing, the first Russian Revolution of 1905 is still some time away, but listen carefully and you will hear the bomb ticking underneath the floorboards of the families’ homes.I think there is a ticking to be heard now, not under dusty floorboards, but in the bellies of the people I am writing about. They want more, and often demand it. They are unfiltered and flammable. There are moments in the play where they sense their own place in the cosmos, when their lives have a sudden grandeur and mystery, and also moments when they feel small and frustrated, and they lash out.It’s not often I see that range of experience in our cultural landscape. When I do see representations of white working-class lives in the Midlands or the north of England, they are often set in the past. As if there’s a great uncertainty about who these people are now: better to revert back to when we did know. But we have to get to know them because they aren’t only in the past; it’s quite possible that they are going to define the future.I can be suspicious of pronouncements about the arts changing society. But I do believe the theatre can be a place where, among other things, we sit and listen to people we wouldn’t otherwise encounter and experience their life with them as it unfolds in front of us. We can’t change channels, block them online, cross the road; wecanstill shrink them with our prejudices, refuse their vastness, but many of us won’t. Instead we will sit in the dark, laughing and crying, falling in love with them one moment, only to be infuriated the next. A lot like spending time with your own family.View image in fullscreenA scene from Beth Steel’s Till the Stars Come Down at the National Theatre.Photograph: Manuel HarlanI never imagined this play would be performed around the world, from Tokyo to Athens to Montreal. That failure of imagination stemmed from not believing that a story about a particular working-class family in a particular Midlands town could be seen as universal. How could I not know that we are all profoundly different and exactly the same? The larger human family we are a part of cuts across cultures and classes when it lays bare our emotional lives: what it is to feel joy, shame, love, grief, desire, to fear the future rushing towards us – and not be ready for it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the real problem is a system that pits tenants against each otherSat 6 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 6 Sep 2025 12.32 EDTShareLast week, I came across a flurry of ads on the house-share site SpareRoom sounding less like they were for cosy, inviting living arrangements than for boarding schools. “Please note – no surprise guests, no music and no use of the living room because it doubles as a bedroom,” wrote one “current flatmate”. Reading it, I wondered if there would be a curfew too.The tendency of some landlords to police their tenants’ behaviour has been well documented, imposing rules that range from the reluctantly accepted, such as no pets allowed, to the absurd: not using the kitchen at night; ideally being away at weekends; and, in one case,effectively restricting use of the toiletdue to a noise ban after 8.30pm extending to the sound of walking.But ads from flatmates stipulating rules for house-sharing are becoming more common. One person requests that her new flatmate isn’t a big kitchen user. “I’m in and out of the kitchen within 10 minutes,” she clarifies. “Ideally looking for someone similar.” What I personally can cook in just 10 minutes, I’m not sure – but perhaps that’s the point.Of the new rules being set, limitations on working from home have emerged as the most restrictive. Out of the 30 ads for house-shares I trawl through a day, more than half say that a suitable flatmate is someone who “ideally works full-time out of the house”. Hopefully, you’re kind, friendly and considerate, butideally,you’re not actually there. Welcome to a rental market where you have the privilege of paying for a room you’re ideally not using for anything but sleep.On the one hand, the “no WFH” camp argues these rules are just about maintaining the home as a space for rest, recreation and domestic order, rather than office chatter: no one wants to be tiptoeing around someone’s Teams conversations in the living room, or being privy to a six-hour call on synergies. But for the vast majority of people who work from their bedrooms rather than in communal areas in the house, it’s hard to see why working from home has become such a deal breaker.Much of this dispute of course comes down to money. Rent continues to chip away at income, with tenants in England spending an average of36% of their earningson housing, climbing to 42% if you live in London. Renting is expensive enough, and so the argument goes that if you’re spending more time at home then you’re probably using more utilities, and disproportionately adding to bills. Take one scenario from the Guardian’s You Be the Judge series earlier this year. One flatmate, lamenting the “constant boiling of the kettle”, started countinghow many cups of teatheir flatmate drinks in a day (eight, if you’re curious) when they work from home.But if we are breaking down everything into bite-size, invoiceable proportions, where do we draw the line? What happens when someone’s partner comes over for a few nights? What happens to the person who loves batch-cooking weeks in advance? I don’t think it’s simply about people being hostile or inconsiderate to their flatmates: it’s that it’s difficult to shake off the nagging sense of being one light-switch flick away from an eye-watering bill when the cost of everything is always soaring.The explosion of rules on SpareRoom hasn’t emerged from nowhere. It’s a symptom of a wider malaise – a broader sense of dissatisfaction and powerlessness against a backdrop of unaffordable housing, financial uncertainty and life milestones that are perpetually delayed. No one, it seems, has quite become comfortable with the joys of house-sharing either: a recent survey of 2,000 renters aged 20 to 40 by the co-living brand Ark found that74% had issueswith it, with flatmates monopolising the shower or raising energy bills being sources of resentment.Perhaps, then, it makes sense that people are clinging to the things they can control about their housing conditions – so they’ll vet prospective flatmates to eliminate anyone who works “flexibly” or insists on preheating the oven. You can’t argue with the property market or fix the damp in a flat without being subjected to a degrading six-month-long email chain with an uncaring landlord. But you can set out rules that’ll give you some sense of agency.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Prime minister Narendra Modi’s performative courting of King Donald, both in and out of office, suggested a special chemistry between these two titans of the hard right.As Trump set about remaking global trade and geopolitics by weaponising tariffs,Indiagot into trade negotiations with the US early. New Delhi accepted that negotiations would be difficult, given its red lines on agricultural and dairy products. Yet it was optimistic about getting a deal commensurate with India’s economic heft – and strategic value to the US as a counterweight to China.Instead, Trump first slapped India, in April, with a 25% tariff that in itself exceeded the rate levied on most US allies. This has nowdoubled to 50%, as punishment for India for buying, refining and exporting Russian oil during that country’s war on Ukraine. This tariff rate will make all nonexempt Indian exports to the US uncompetitive.Modi’s much-toutedspecial relationship with Trumpnow looks risible. Andit wasn’t just the tariffs. India’s short war with Pakistan after the Pahalgam terrorist atrocity in April saw Trump, and his vice-president JD Vance, treat India and Pakistan as squabbling south Asian neighbours that had to be brought to order by US intervention. Trump’s insistence that his telephoned threats had forced India and Pakistanto stop fightingseemed to bracket India and Pakistan as unruly nuisances, a humiliating equivalence thatIndia felt duty-bound to repudiate. It has sincebeen suggestedthat the real trigger for the 50% tariff was India denying Trump, desperate for a Nobel peace prize, credit for peacemaking.Trump made it clear that this was a punishment beating. He dismissed India as a “dead economy” while his chief trade adviser, Peter Navarro, accused India of war profiteering by buying discounted Russian oil. He even described the Ukrainian conflict as “Modi’s war”.This mortifying breakdown of relations has discredited Modi’s decade-long effort to play the well-connected world statesman. The energetic hugging and over-the-top bonhomie that characterised his photo ops with world leaders seem gauche in retrospect. But it would be a mistake to think of this turn in Indo-US relations purely in terms of a powerful individuals.Large countries such as India have geopolitical moorings that aren’t easily loosened. Non-alignment – India’s cold-war-era positioning as neither capitalist nor communist – isn’t a fashionable term in Modi’s India because of its Nehruvian antecedents, but his foreign policy has tried to maintain India’s freedom of action in a multipolar world. Non-alignment might now fly under the flag of “strategic autonomy” but its aim is not dissimilar. India’s ability to buy Russian oil, refine it and re-export it to Europe with the tacit blessing of the Biden administration was, until recently, seen as an example of this bloc-straddling suppleness.What changed was that over the past quarter of a century, India’s political class began to see the US as the country’s natural partner. It was the main destination of India’s exports and also the aspirational destination for the children of its ruling elite. Since the time of Modi’s predecessor, Manmohan Singh, who signed the Indo-US nuclear deal, India has tilted towards Washington. The Quad, a grouping of four countries – Japan, Australia, the US and India – designed to foil China’s designs in the Indo-Pacific, was widely read as a sign of this westward tilt.This tilt has led to a curious unbalancing of India’s foreign policy. Its feet firmly planted in strategic autonomy, India has leaned towards the US to get close and personal, via alliances that aren’t quite alliances, and vibes that aren’t matched by substance. India’s policymakers under Modi assumed that India’s aggregate economic heft and its growth rate had elevated it to the world’s top table.The fact is, India isn’t rich enough or white enough or English-speaking enough to be a charter member of either the west or the anglophone world. Modi’s mandarins forgot that – outside the charmed circle of the west – the US doesn’t have allies, it has clients. Trump’s decision to further raise tariffs on India out of resentmentwas a reminder that US presidents have often seen India as either a supplicant or a nuisance or both.Pundits argue that Trump is a maverick, that the Indo-US relationship is too important both economically and geopolitically for this froideur to last. It’s much more likely that Trump is ahead of the curve, that he is saying out loud what other western leaders are still too constrained by liberal convention to utter.Western benevolence has always been predicated on western hegemony. Once the climate crisis and China’s rise made it clear that the west’s supremacy wasn’t future-proofed; once the promise of steady economic growth, the modern measure of secular progress, became unredeemable, western centrists began to secede from the world order they had created in their pomp. Gaza is the sum of this secession. The WTO, overseas aid, due process for asylum seekers, international humanitarian law, the UN system – the whole postwar order built by the west and led by the US – is being cast aside as rich countries circle their wagons against a needy, unruly world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump-like and Trump-lite demagogues have become inevitable. Nigel Farage, Jordan Bardella, Alice Weidel, Viktor Orbán are living proof that Trump’s mix of nativism and protectionism is the reality that India and non-western countries more generally will have to contend with for the foreseeable future. (One of the revelations of Trump’s second term has been the willingness of European leaders to abase themselves to propitiate the US.)For all the liberal hand-wringing about Trump’s crudities, where he leads, the European political class will follow. Trump’s tariffs aren’t whims, they are portents. They are bricks in the wall that the west is building to fortify its compound.Modi, like Indian prime ministers before him, is learning that geography can’t be transcended, that non-alignment isn’t a choice – it is a necessity. India’s place in the world will often present it with grim, constrained choices. It can’t square up to the US, as China does, as an equal. Nor can it kowtow to Trump as the EU has, like a client looking for protection. India will continue to walk a tightrope, teetering this way then that, as it negotiates a hostile world under the watchful eyes of its vulnerable people.Mukul Kesavan is an Indian historian, novelist and political and social essayistExplore more on these topicsIndiaOpinionNarendra ModiTrump tariffsSouth and central AsiaAsia PacificDonald TrumpTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

Organizers decided to cancel El Grito Chicago, an event that drew 24,000 people last year, and was scheduled for 13-14 September.“It was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake – and that’s a risk we are unwilling to take,” theevent’s websitestated. “While we’re torn by this decision, when we brought this celebration back, our aim was to create a safe, affordable, family-friendly, community festival for all.”The anxiety in the country’s third-largest city comes after Trump deployed national guard troops toLos AngelesandWashington DC.Contrary to the president’s assertions, Chicago is not among the country’s most dangerous cities, and the number of homicides decreased from last year to this year, theGuardian reported.Illinois had about 550,000 unauthorized immigrants in 2023, according to thePew Research Center. The governor,JB Pritzker, said that he was concerned about Ice agents targeting attendees at the Mexican Independence Day events.“We have reason to believe that Stephen Miller [the White House deputy chief of staff] chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,”Pritzker said at a news conference.In addition to El Grito, the Mexican Independence Day parade and festival in the suburb of Waukegan was postponed until November, and the Latin Heritage Fest in Wauconda was canceled, a localFox affiliatereported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The situation is horrific,” Ingram added.Gaza City, once a busy commercial and cultural hub, is now the target of a new Israeli offensive which threatens to displace its million or more estimated inhabitants. Israeli officials have described the city as a “bastion” of Hamas.Israel’s military has ordered Palestinians to leave the city for the south before the assault, but has given no timeline for the offensive, which it has previously indicated would not be announced in advance.The offensive threatens to displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians weakened by nearly two years of bombing, malnutrition, and now famine. Many will previously have been displaced, some repeatedly, and some Gaza City residents have said they will refuse to endure it again.In May, Israel eased a two-month total blockade on supplies entering Gaza but supplies remain inadequate.UN agencies are working to overcome massive logistical difficulties, continuing Israeli restrictions and bureaucratic obstacles to supply a small number of community kitchens and bakeries, while private commercial trucks transport limited quantities of rice, sugar, instant noodles and other dry foodstuffs. Fresh vegetables are rare and cost as much as $50 (£37) for a kilo, a price few can afford.“The story is the same – a bowl a day from the community kitchen, almost always lentils or rice, shared among the family, parents skipping so children can eat. No nutrients. No other options – aid is scarce, and the market is far too expensive,” said Ingram.View image in fullscreen‘It is crystal clear that people are starving, that there is a famine unfolding in Gaza City, and Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis are not far behind,’ a Unicef spokesperson has said.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesResidents have described being faced with an “impossible choice”: to remain in makeshift homes in Gaza City and hope to survive a possible Israeli onslaught or flee to massively overcrowded coastal areas where there is little space and almost no services, water supplies or health provision.Aid workers in al-Mawasi, the main coastal zone designated by Israel for those fleeing Gaza City, say hundreds of thousands of displaced people are already packed on to its sandy dunes and fields. A tent-sized plot on any land that remains clear costs the equivalent of $300 per month and there is little room for new arrivals.Graph showing hospital admissions for malnutrition“Water supply is insufficient, the tents and shelters are very flimsy, there’s no garbage or solid waste disposal to speak of, no shade and no room for anyone else already … It’s totally unfit for human habitation even now,” said one aid worker in al-Mawasi.Israeli officials blame the UN for failing to distribute aid and have repeatedly claimed Hamas is stealing much of the assistance, though aninternal US government reportsaid this was not true.Last month, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a globally recognised organisation that classifies the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition, found three key thresholds for famine had been met in Gaza City.Children are among the most vulnerable. From 2,000 in February, enrolments in Unicef clinics in Gaza for under-fives with acute malnutrition had risen to 5,500 in May. In July, the total reached more than 13,000.The number of under-fives screened by Unicef went from 82,000 to 144,000 over the period.Hospital admissions for the most life-threatening cases of severe acute malnutrition rose from 20 in March to 40 in July, though this was down from a peak of more than 50 in June. Outpatient cases increased from 380 in March to 2,846 in July, of whom 1,248 were in Gaza City.View image in fullscreenPalestinian children queue to receive a hot meal from a charity kitchen in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesDespite opposition from within the military high command, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, remains committed to the new offensive. Wide gaps remain between Israel’s demands and those of Hamas, and any ceasefire currently looks unlikely.Far-right members of the ruling coalition have threatened to bring down Netanyahu’s government if Israel makes concessions to bring back about 50 hostages still held in Gaza, of whom fewer than 20 are thought to be alive.On Friday, Israel’s military announced in a statement it would target a range of structures identified as being used by Hamas, particularly tall buildings.“In the coming days, the [Israeli military] will strike structures that have been converted into terrorist infrastructure in Gaza City: cameras, observation command centres, sniper and anti-tank firing positions, command-and-control compounds,” the statement said.Last week, officials said Israel would stop airdrops over Gaza City in the coming days and reduce the number of aid trucks arriving in the north as the new offensive ramps up and preparations are made to order hundreds of thousands of people south.The UN and partners have said the pauses, airdrops and other measures fell far short of the 600 trucks of aid needed daily in Gaza.The current war started aftera Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023which killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and led to 250 being abducted. The Israeli offensive that followed has killed more than 63,000, mostly civilians, and destroyed much of Gaza.Clea Skopeliti contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warFamineIsraelPalestinian territoriesMalnutritionMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We are not making any money from hosting the Ukrainian lady. The whole thing feels like bureaucracy gone mad.”View image in fullscreenThe Ducketts inside the garage room.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe Ducketts live in Henley-on-Thames, an upmarket areadescribed as “arguably one of the most beautiful towns in England”. Rents are high and available properties in the area are scarce.They first offered to accommodate Ukrainian refugees when thegovernment appealed for people to come forwardsoon after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.Officials from South Oxfordshire and Vale of White Horse district council visited the couple’s home and approved the room as suitable for Ukrainian refugees.Liubava Ignatcko and her daughter Ariana stayed there for a year before the current Ukrainian guest moved in. She has a job as a cleaner and the couple do not charge her rent, due to her low income. They ask her only to cover the cost of the utilities like electricity and heating that she uses.As a host of Ukrainian refugees, Duckett was invited by the prime minister to a reception at 10 Downing Street in February of this year marking the anniversary of the invasion ofUkraine.But her current guest now faces having to leave with little prospect of finding alternative affordable accommodation in the area. Even if the application fee is paid, there is no guarantee it will be successful.Dr Krish Kandiah of the Sanctuary Foundation, which supports Ukrainian refugees and knows the couple, said: “The Homes for Ukraine scheme was a historic moment of Great British hospitality. One of the big challenges has been long-term independent accommodation. Rosemary and Tony represent the best of us – both in their 80s and yet willing to offer kindness and hospitality to people in need.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And this is our mega year where everything’s come up completely brilliantly, and we’re now experimenting.”She has been very concerned about the health impacts of using harsh, synthetic chemical dyes, which require users to be swaddled in protective clothing, which natural dyes made of flowers do not.“There used to be a thing called dyer’s nose, which is basically when the aniline dyes came in,” Honeybone said, “They used to destroy your nasal membrane. So artificial dyes have long history of being pretty bad for you, and I’m still quite haunted by the fact that I knew this fantastic woman who was a top dyer when I was just this little bug, and she dyed for years, and when she retired she just died instantly. You’re left with these things, and you do worry – however ‘health and safety’ you are, there’s these chemicals around.”The theatre is planning to use natural dyes from the garden in every production at the South Bank going forwards, starting with Playboy of the Western World, which is on this autumn and winter.Claire Wardroper, costume production supervisor at the theatre, said it was “a beautiful early 19th century piece, with lots of nice woolly jumpers, because it’s set in rural Ireland, and we can certainly get some nice colours into them. The designer for that is fully onboard with producing some things that are naturally dyed as well.”The pair say they are trying to bring a gentler, more environmentally friendly way of dying into the mainstream. “We are saying that if you want to use this horrible synthetic dye, you can do that, but you can achieve this beautiful look by using a natural dye, and we can do it a little bit slower and a bit more sort of organically,” said Honeybone.Wardroper added: “It’s unfortunate to say, but the theatre and film and anything creative in one-shot opportunity entertainment has a history of being incredibly wasteful.”The garden has provided a bounty of flowers to be boiled up and turned into dye. Their indigo plants, which provide a beautiful deep blue, have done particularly well.View image in fullscreenThe garden has provided a bounty of flowers to be boiled up and turned into dye.Photograph: Dan Neidle/Rory MurphyHoneybone said: “It’s been such a good harvest.

They loved it, it wasn’t hard to get and all the tapestries that were up on the wall were a riot of colour. What we’re seeing now is the sad, faded leftovers,” she said.Honeybone says she has become “obsessed” with natural dying. “My daughter gave me a bunch of flowers on Mother’s Day, and I noticed there was some golden rod in it, so whisked that out and dyed with it just to see what it yielded. And it was the most glorious, strong yellow.”The garden is not only used for dyes but also as a refuge from the hustle and bustle of the theatre. The pair said actors were frequently seen pacing among the flowers, or sitting down on benches to learn their lines.The space is also a haven for wildlife. The grey concrete of the South Bank does not have a huge amount to offer pollinators, and they have been swarming to the garden to sample the nectar from the varied dye plants.View image in fullscreenThe natural dye and wellbeing garden.

And they’re loving the variety of plants that we’ve planted as well. These are a new stock of plants that they just haven’t had access to. So the bee person that comes in and caters to the bees is very happy.”The pair hope that most if not all of the costumes at the theatre can eventually be produced using natural methods. But for now, Honeybone is enjoying the opportunity to start using these dyes.She said: “This is such an all round sensory experience, totally engulfed in the smells and the feeling. And you’re touching petals and you’re crushing leaves, and you know it’s so fully sensory, the smell, the look – it is just wonderful.”Explore more on these topicsNational TheatreTheatreTextile artGardensWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

That means a trend toward more lightning-caused fires is also probably making wildfires more deadly by producing more wildfire smoke and helping to drivea surge in air quality issuesfrom coast to coast,especially over the past several years.Over the last 40 years, thunderstorms and other weather conditions favoring lightninghave been happening more oftenacross many parts of the US west, including western Washington, western Oregon, the California Central valley, and higher elevations throughout the Rocky Mountains.This trend isn’t just in the US. This year’s fire season has beenthe worst in European history, driven in part bylightning-caused wildfires in Spain. In Canada, huge fires this year have burned more than 200% of normal forest area, the vast majority of which were caused by lightning.Despite the well-documented trend toward worsening fires, most climate models have been too coarse to resolve how the relationship between lightning and wildfires will change as the climate crisis deepens.Anew studypublished last week is the first to use machine learning techniques to tackle this problem, simultaneously looking at future changes in lightning frequency and changes in weather variables like air temperature, humidity, wind and soil moisture that can predict how likely a fire is to spread.“The overall signal is that we will have more risk of lightning-caused fires,” said Dmitri Kalashnikov, a climate scientist at the Sierra Nevada Research Institute at University of California-Merced and the study’s lead author.The findings come as this year’s wildfire season in the US is shifting into high gear in a manner eerily similar to what Kalashnikov imagines for the future – lurching forward after a series of dry thunderstorms tore through California earlier this week.Thousands of lightning strikesthis week have sparked at least 20 new fires and burned tens of thousands of acres across California’s Central valley and into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, withone fire destroying several structuresin the Gold Rush-era settlement of Chinese Camp east of Modesto.Kalashnikov’s team found that some places, like the inland Pacific north-west, will see a surge of lightning with a relatively small increase in overall fire risk due to a moistening environment. Other places, like the desert south-west, will see an increase in wildfire risk without much of a change in the number of days with lightning due to an overall trend towards more pervasive drought.Despite these regional differences, the result was clear: virtually everyone will be dealing with more wildfire risk in the future. In fact, Kalashnikov’s team found future increases in the number of lightning-caused wildfires across a robust 98% of the western US “due to more lightning, or more fire weather, or both”, he said.In a future world with limited firefighting resources, the implications of more lightning-caused wildfires are worrying.Over a recent 15-year span,wildfire smoke killed about a thousand peoplein the US each year. A surge in lightning-caused fires could cause America’s smoke epidemic to take the lives of potentiallymore than 20,000 people a year by mid-century.In addition to the increase in wildfire risk, Kalashnikov’s study found the biggest impact from the expected increase in thunderstorms and lightning across some parts of the west could be an increase in flash flooding and mudslides, especially in recently burned areas. More smoke from more lightning-caused fires may also coat glaciers in Canada, Greenland and Europe with dark particlesthat can make them melt more quickly.Due to their remote nature, lightning-caused wildfires also tend to drain emergency response capacity away from urban areas.Even today, a sudden lightning storm “can stretch resources really, really thin” for weeks during peak wildfire season, said Max Moritz, a University of California Cooperative Extension wildfire specialist and adjunct professor at University of California-Santa Barbara.“Maybe a week or two later you may have a big Santa Ana wind event,” said Moritz, “then you have a real recipe for catastrophe.”When coupled withthe trend of urbanization of wildfire-prone areasthat we are seeing across the west, a world with worse wildfires could place additional pressure on the insurance industry which is digestingbillions of dollars of claims from this year’s fires in Los Angeles alone.In the US, firefighting resources are stretched thin nationwide as a result of the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Park Service and a host of other federal agencies with staff throughout the west.As of late July, more than one-quarter of all firefighting jobs remained vacant at the US Forest Service, anda recent immigration raid within an active firefighting crewin Oregon hasreportedly reduced firefighter morale.Moritz sees a possible partial solution – change the way we build cities in fire-prone regions.In addition to instituting basic fire safety building codes, Moritz envisions agricultural buffers surrounding cities that could effectively shield homes and people from encroaching fire.“There’s a growing awareness now that live fuel moisture, the amount of water in green living twigs and leaves, is also a really strong control on fire dynamics,” said Moritz. “That’s what we have here in Santa Barbara. We’ve got an existing old agricultural belt that’s relatively thin. In the places where it still exists, wildfires cannot sweep out of the national forest and into neighborhoods.”Explore more on these topicsUS wildfiresClimate crisisWildfiresHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

He had just started year 7 but, thanks to Covid, he was stuck knocking about at home in Camden, north London.“It was kind of a family pandemic project,” said his mother, Alexandra Milenov. “He sat down with my husband and did the calculations on the microplastic release of three items of his uniform: the blazer, the PE T-shirt and the shorts.”What he found out was to significantly affect his school career.I used to work with Pfas, but they do need to be banned | LetterRead moreAlmost every child in England spends about 195 days a year in uniform. They are not a legal requirement, but the Department for Educationinsiststhey promote “the ethos of a school”, provide “a sense of belonging and identity” and set “an appropriate tone for education”.But the widespread use of uniforms has a hidden cost: most of them are made from polyester, the synthetic, petroleum-derived fibre that is one of the world’s most significant environmental pollutants, leading some to question our reliance on it, and whether it is a suitable fabric in which to dress our children.View image in fullscreenA British advertisement for Terylene polyester fibre by ICI. The image was shot in 1957.Photograph: Neil Baylis/AlamyPolyester, the “miracle fabric”, was invented in Britain in the 1940s as a new synthetic fabric that followed the popularity of nylon in the 1930s. Thanks to its durability, economy and ease of production, it has come to dominate the global garment industry, and by 2023, 71.1m tonnes of polyesterwere producedaround the world–57% of global textile production.“Polyester is, in fact, the most-used synthetic fabric globally,” said Dr Melis Duyar, an associate professor in chemical and process engineering at the University of Surrey. “Since there is no need to grow the fibres needed to make this fabric, it can be made cheaply and quickly in vast quantities, which is why it has become the fabric of choice for the fast fashion industry.”But in common with other petroleum-derived plastics, polyester is not biodegradable. “Washing causes each item of clothing to shed tiny strands, or microfibres, which are carried down the drain and into our water systems,” Duyar said. “Microplastics are particularly hard to remove from the environment and are easily ingested by organisms across the food chain.”The infiltration of these microfibres into the biosphere is now well known–these insidious chemical pollutants have been detected from the Mariana Trench to the peak of Mount Everest, and in almost every organ of the human body. Researchers have estimated that synthetic textiles are responsible for35% of the microplastics in the planet’s oceans. But the long-term effects of them remain uncertain.View image in fullscreenA Sports Illustrated magazine advert from 1971.Photograph: Patti McConville/AlamyAt home, using a Plymouth University study which estimated that between700 and 4,000 microplastic fibres are released per gram in a single wash, Hugo calculated that just a year’s worth of washing and everyday wear of the uniforms worn by the 125 boys in his year would shed 6.4bn plastic microfibres.When school Covid restrictions ended, Hugo presented his findings at his student council and in class. Teachers were enthusiastic about his advocacy, and helped him take it to the headteacher and the board of governors. “And you know everyone was very supportive and excited about his work,” said Milenov. Meanwhile, she had managed to source a cotton alternative to nearly every item of school uniform, but not the blazer, which in any case had been temporarily waived for fear that such an infrequently washed item would be a vector for Covid transmission.Milenov lobbied the school, but the headteacher was not interested in changing direction, and by the time Hugo entered year 8, William Ellis reimposed all uniform requirements, including the wearing of its polyester blazer. “We wrote to the head of year 8, and we attached Hugo’s presentation, and we said for environmental reasons, and because we want to support our son’s advocacy, we are unable to purchase or have him wear polyester items in the school uniform,” said Milenov.Her persistence worked; Hugo was granted an exemption. The school agreed that his objections to the pollution caused by polyester schoolwear had the status of a protected belief. To forestall disciplinary action from over-keen teachers, he was issued with a card: “Notification of non-compliance with school uniform,” reason: “Sustainability ethical issue.”Hugo became his school’s – and perhaps the country’s – first conscientious objector to school uniform. But he is not unique in expressing concerns about the synthetic fabrics used for uniforms.View image in fullscreenSome parents have opted to buy school uniform in organic cotton to avoid the use of synthetic fabrics.Photograph: Loop Images Ltd/AlamyNazia Habib’s daughter, Monica, was a pandemic baby and came through bouts of Covid before she was able to walk. “We only have one child and we want to give the best like all parents,” Habib said. “We wanted to make sure not only that the food that she eats is good, but the clothes that she wears are also very healthy.”Habib, a professor at the University of Cambridge and the director and founder of itsCentre for Resilience and Sustainable Development, studies synthetic materials supply chains andadvises the textile recycling industry. Naturally, for her own family, she chose cotton and other natural fibres. But when Monica started school, Habib found that choice taken away. Even at the age of five, pupils were required to wear a polyester uniform, branded with the school’s insignia, and available from just a single supplier.“Polyester [clothes] in general are not very good for skin,” Habib said. “They are OK for a short period of time if you are going for hikes, jogging, or you want to be very, very warm, so you have polyester jackets. But on a daily basis, for a long period of time, [wearing] polyester means that your skin is not able to breathe.“Unbreathable children’s skin basically means that you’re sweating your dust and dirt and everything is getting stuck to you, and if you have a child with a skin problem then it’s going to worsen the symptoms.“Number two, there is already now more than enough evidence that shows thatpolyester also releases microplastics, and by rubbing and using it on a daily basis you are inhaling the microplastics.“My daughter also had multiple Covid, so her lungs were already weakened. So as a conscious, academic parent I could not imagine giving her more polyester so that she has more micro[-fibre] sedimentation in her young lungs, because you can never process those microplastics out of your body.”Habib was finally able to reason with her daughter’s school and its supplier. She provided the cotton garments – bought easily online – and the supplier provided the school’s logos to apply to them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The first flaw is that those chemicals are not covalently, or not strongly bonded, to the polymer, so they leach out and they get into us and harm our health. The second flaw is that plastic fragments [break] into micro and even smaller nanoplastics.”Phthalates, for example, are often used to make plastics more flexible and durable and a2020 study of preschool children’s clothingby scientists in China found them in all samples examined. But some phthalates are an endocrine disruptor and have beenlinked to a decline in sperm counts worldwide: the EU and US have been so concerned about the effects they may have on children that they have restricted their use in toys, childcare items and food packaging.Another endocrine disrupting chemical, bisphenol A (BPA), is used in the textile industry in polyester-based clothing to improve the lifespan of fabrics, to add moisture-wicking or anti-static properties, or to fix dyes. Researchers and campaigners have found high levels ofit in sportswear, or in therecycled polyesterthat is sometimes used in ‘eco-friendly’ school uniform items. This chemical has beenbanned for usein food contact materials by the EU, although the UScontinues to judgeit safe.Manufacturers are also coating children’s clothes in even more chemicals once they are made. “We see in a lot of childrenswear especially, that we put a lot more into it than we would potentially on other products,” said David Megson, a reader in chemistry and environmental forensics at Manchester Metropolitan University.“[In] trying to make it stain resistant, trying to make it water resistant, trying to make it flame retardant … we get a lot of additives that are added within that process.”I feel like there’s so little I can do. I can’t find out what’s in these products, so I can’t make an informed choiceSuppliers are not required to reveal the ingredients used to formulate their plastic fibres and garment coatings, even for children’s clothes. And even when they do, details can be unclear. Often it is only laboratory analysis that can reveal what we are dressing our children in.“I wish I had more say over what I could dress my daughter in,” said Megson, who also recently bought his daughter a school uniform. “I’d rather take my chances on having something that isn’t flame retardant, because she’s not smoking and to me there’s a very low risk of my daughter catching fire, so I don’t really think she needs a flame retardant pair of knickers.“The same with the stain resistance, like she spills something on her I’ll wipe it off. I’d much rather have that minor inconvenience than increase her risk of developing a serious disease later in life and hampering her potential fertility.“It really annoys me. I feel like there’s so little I can do about it because I can’t find out what is in these products, so I can’t make an informed choice.”Specialist retailers exist that supply basic school uniform items in organic cotton, but these can be expensive and they do not solve the problem of the liveried garments that so many schools now insist on.A new children’s and schools bill going through parliament will restrict the number of branded items a school can prescribe to just four, but some say it could go further. Peers including Rosie Boycott and Natalie Bennett have tabled amendments that would ban the use ofperfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl Substances (Pfas)or “forever chemicals” and polyester in school uniforms, but look to be defeated by the government.Bennett said she backed parents who were prepared to face down schools that prescribed uniform items made of polyester. But, she added: “When you think about the inequality in our society and the health inequality in our society, the time, the access to information, the chutzpah to do that sort of thing is not equally spread around society.“I think it’s great any parent who’s able to do it absolutely. But what I’m trying to do is start at the structural end and say no school should be prescribing, that’s kind of the right word, that their children wear unhealthy clothes that are bad for their health.“And it shouldn’t be up to individual parents to have to fight their corner.”Hugo is now in sixth form, and no longer needs to wear a blazer. But “parents can refuse”, said Milenov. “The law protects people who believe that they need to take action to protect the environment.” That’s if, after a long summer, parents have the energy.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsSchoolsPollutionFashion industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Steiner said this was shortsighted.“The more we defund [aid to and cooperation with developing countries], the more we lose the ability to act,” he said. “There is a loss of control, because you no longer can cooperate with countries that you depend on to solve these problems [such as the climate]. You are curtailing your own ability to create a more resilient national economy, in this world of interconnectedness.”The climate crisis will potentially spiral out of control unless countries recognise their international obligations, he warned. “The greatest risk is not necessarily the territorial threat of a neighbouring country’s army, though that will always remain a potential risk,” he said. “It is cyberterrorism; the next pandemic for which we are not prepared; and most certainly the domino effect of runaway climate change.”Governments should plan for the medium and longer term by viewing spending onclimate finance for the poorest countries, and on development and cooperation with the developing world, in that light, perhaps even classing it under, or allied to, defence budgets.“That kind of security perspective could make it much more justifiable that we have a defence and deterrence track in which we invest, but also a development and resilience track that by definition will have to have a strong international component, and both are ultimately integral to a national security strategy,” Steiner said.A growing number ofnational security experts want governments to remodel their approach to climate breakdown, which has the potential to trigger problems that swiftly turn into security crises, such as migration and food price rises.Donald Trump, the US president, has demanded Nato allies commit 5% of their GDP to defence, of which 3.5% would be on weapons and soldiery but 1.5% could encompass broader areas such as cybersecurity and infrastructure. The UK has pledged to meet the spending target by 2035, after raising the defence budget earlier this year to 2.5% of GDP, partly paid for bycutting spending on international aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GDP.Other countries are taking similar actions, but a few have proposals that could allow national security to be defined in a broader sense to encompass some “soft power” spending, on issues such as the climate or food security. For instance, Germany is expanding infrastructure alongside defence, with climate projects included. Spain is going further, earmarking €1.75bn (£1.5bn) of its defence budget for climate-related activities.The UN is under almost unprecedented pressure, with the world at one of the most dangerous points in recent history, in Steiner’s view. The US has abruptly wound down itsUSAID agency, and is withdrawing cash from the UN and other multilateral institutions, whiledisabling domestic agencies that deal with the climate crisis. Other major developed economies such as the EU, Canada, Japan and the UK are also under pressure.“We are at a moment of deep disruption,” warned Steiner. “The deep geopolitical and geo-economic tensions that are now playing out are in danger of paralysing cooperation and multilateralism. Development [in the form of overseas aid] is about prevention, investing in solving problems before they become deep schisms in society.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They’re taking money from their health and education budgets and using it to service the interest payments of their national debt. They’re certainly unable to raise the capital to invest in the foundations of future development.”Fixing that can only be done with a rethink of where countries’ real national interests lie, which requires taking a global view, he concluded. “The basic DNA of national security in our time must have a component that de-risks some of the threats that are, by definition, only reducible by international cooperation.”A successor for Steiner, who was at UNDP from 2017 until this June after heading the UN Environment Programme, has not yet been appointed.

But I’m not the gay Jeremy Clarkson – I’m only a tiny cog in a large wheel here.”View image in fullscreenEverett said local people realised they needed the pub for community cohesion.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianUnlike most actors, Everett has not been working behind the bar because he has fallen on hard times. Instead, it is as part of a grand community effort to save the Swan, which faced closure until villagers stepped in and began to maintain a building that has been at the heart of the village for more than 350 years.He also joinedthe Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), which fights for the future of pubs such as the Swan, andan image of him working at the pub went viral.Everett told the Guardian he had lived in the area the Swan serves since he was a boy.“I’ve known the pub through various incarnations,” he said. “It’s closed a couple of times and the people in our village suddenly realised we needed it for some kind of community cohesion.View image in fullscreenThe building has been at the heart of the village for more than 350 years.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“It’s a difficult time in the countryside. The farmers around us have all had a terrible harvest. Morale is slightly down. Your village pub suddenly seems like an important asset that we all feel we need to defend.”The Swan is seeking a new professional publican after the previous one left in June. “But in the meantime, everybody in the village felt incredibly galvanised to keep the pub and the garden looking good,” Everett said. “It’s a difficult business. Beer only lasts a week – if you order too much, you’re fucked.”Everett’s preferred drink is a beer called Pigswill,an amber-coloured tipple from Stonehenge Ales. “I’m incredibly fat so I try not to drink too much of it because once you get started, you never stop. But I’m committed to drinking non-stop to get a new publican,” he added.The actorquoted figures from the British Beer and Pub Association, claiming that for every £3 spent in a pub, £1 goes to tax. “They take a healthy chunk of every pub’s earnings. The government could ease off on its own take. That would help.”View image in fullscreenOne local man said the pub was a vital lifeline for him.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianWhen the Guardian visited on Thursday, Everett was off-duty.He is busy promoting his well-received collection of stories, The American No. But the place was bustling with young and old.Clive Bullen, one of the lead organisers of the Swan’s rescue, said the response from the community had been phenomenal. “The garden had become overgrown and inside needed a re-deck,” he said. “Up to 30 people a day were helping, working on the garden, painting inside and so on.View image in fullscreenClive Bullen is one of the major forces behind the pub’s rescue.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“We put a note out saying we needed volunteers for shift work and Rupert said he’d like to help. I took him through the training. It’s a bit of a surprise when he’s doing a shift late on a Saturday afternoon and a random person walks in.”David Holmes, a Swan regular for more than half a century and known in the village as “Sheriff”, described how the pub was a vital lifeline for him. “I wouldn’t see anyone from week to week if I didn’t come here.”Iris Daunt-Withers, a relative newcomer, said the pub was one of the draws of moving to Enford. “We met everyone there and came to realise this is such a wonderful place with a great sense of community,” she said.View image in fullscreenIris Daunt-Withers said the pub was one of the main draws of moving to the village.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianCamra said so far in 2025, 230 pubs in the UK had been demolished or converted and lost to communities for ever. The campaign group is calling for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to do her bit at the budget by scrapping the increase in employer national insurance contributions, and reducing business rates bills and VAT and duty on beer and cider served in pubs.Everett said the community effort had created a celebratory feel at the pub. “In this world where we’re all increasingly detached in our own individual mad bubbles, it’s really refreshing. We’ve felt our village coming together to try to keep this pub going. It’s built energy in all of us.”Explore more on these topicsRupert EverettPubsHospitality industryWiltshireTaxCommunitiesTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

I can’t wait for what will be a fantastic next series.”Galetti said: “To have Matt join us is really exciting. Seeing what skills our contestants showcase and tasting their culinary creations is always a delight – Marcus and I look forward to welcoming Matt to the MasterChef studios and discovering our next champion.”The most recent series of MasterChef: The Professionals, which featured Wallace, continued to air last year amid the allegations against him, but two MasterChef celebrity Christmas specials were pulled from the BBC’s schedule in December.David Ambler, the MasterChef executive editor, said: “It’s a great pleasure to welcome Matt on board for the next series of MasterChef: The Professionals.“His career as a chef, restaurateur and food broadcaster makes him an ideal choice to join this year’s judging lineup and we can’t wait to discover the crop of exciting new talent.”The series will be aired onBBC Oneand iPlayer, with a transmission date yet to be confirmed.Explore more on these topicsMasterChefBBC OneBBCGregg WallaceMarcus WareingFood TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Smoke was still billowing from the rooftop rotunda late on Saturday morning as firefighters used a drone to help tackle the blaze and crowds gathered on the street to watch and take photos.Fire crews were drafted in from Hammersmith, North Kensington, Kensington and Chiswick. Two 32-metre turntable ladders are also in use as water towers to extinguish the fire from above. The cause of the fire is unknown.The fire service said in a statement: “The fire is currently affecting floors towards the top of the building. A restaurant, external decking and ducting is currently alight. An unknown number of flats have also potentially been affected by the fire.”Nearby buildings in the White City area are being evacuated by LFB and the Metropolitan police as a precaution. A rest centre has been set up for those who had to leave their homes, and the London ambulance service said it had sent an ambulance crew, an incident response officer and a hazardous area response team to the scene.The Salvation Army could be seen handing out sandwiches to emergency workers.A London ambulance service spokesperson also confirmed that one person was treated on the scene.One resident of the flats in the oldBBCTelevision Centre said: “I got woken up by my girlfriend at 3am, who was coming back from work. We could really smell the smoke, it was quite thick.“We could see about 100 firefighters and at least eight or nine fire engines that were all parked up. I could just see a red glow. It was glowing really intensely, it almost looked like a portal to the underworld. It was quite sinister.”Li Mei, who lives in a block of flats across the road, was alerted by their partner in the early hours of the morning about the fire. “There was so much smoke – we were worried it was going to get worse,” they said. “Thank God it seems like nobody has died.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t want to have this coming up in the future because someone’s not reading the correct details and not inputting the correct details.”Jones said he initially struggled to get the council to provide a written apology, but had thought the matter was closed after he received an email apologising for the “administrative error”.However, Jones then received a further letter in the post, dated 28 August, saying he had been convicted and fined. “I just find it incredible that I’ve been convicted in my absence,” he said. ‘“I mean, that sounds really serious.”“I haven’t been convicted of anything [before],” he added, “so it’s like, blimey, that’s really heavy.”Jones is also concerned the same thing might happen to somebody else who may not have the capacity to challenge the fine. “If that had been sent to someone who was elderly, or with other needs, I could see how that could be really quite stressful and really it could cause a lot of pain and agitation,” he said.Jones said that in his initial dealings with the council he felt “annoyance, more than anything”, but now he was feeling “really frustrated” after the prosecution went ahead anyway.“This is really serious for me,” he said, “and I don’t feel confident that they are going to overturn it.”A Manchester city council spokesperson said: “The council is now doing everything in its power to have the conviction set aside at the next available opportunity to avoid any action being taken against Mr Jones to recover the penalty.“We do, of course, apologise unreservedly for any distress or inconvenience caused to Mr Jones.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterLocal governmentPrivatisationnewsShareReuse this content"

These include a splinter from his wooden bed, a fragment of a jumper and a piece of the sheet used to cover him after his death. Locks of his hair are on display in other churches in the Italian capital and beyond.Acutis, the London-born Italian who on Sunday will become the Catholic church’s first millennial saint, built websites to spread Catholic teaching, earning him the nickname “God’s Influencer” after his death, aged 15, from leukaemia.Shrines such as this form part of an ancient ritual bestowed upon the church’s highest-ranking dead and will provide believers with tangible reminders of his life. Minuscule though the relics at Sant’Angela Merici are, Danilo Spagnoletti, the parish priest, believes they help instil courage in pilgrims.“Praying close to a saint’s remains helps them to face difficulties in life,” he said. “In particular, this saint, who had a short life but was far advanced in many ways, is a source of inspiration for young people.”Acutis, who died in 2006, willbe canonised by Pope Leoalongside Pier Giorgio Frassati, another young Catholic activist who died a century ago. The event is expected to bring thousands of people to Rome.The church categorises relics of its saints into first, second and third class. Those at Sant’Angela Merici fall into the latter two, and while the items attract a steady flow of pilgrims, it is the first-class relics – a saint’s body and its parts – that pull in the crowds.Over the past year, more than 1 million people have flocked to the central Italian town of Assisi, where Acutis’s body – covered in a wax mould of his likeness and dressed in his blue tracksuit top, jeans and trainers – is on view behind a glass-panelled case in Santa Maria Maggiore church. His heart is in a gold casket in the town’s San Rufino cathedral, while pieces of tissue from his pericardium – the membrane enclosing the heart – have toured the world in the lead-up to his canonisation.His mother, Antonia Salzano, has also travelled across the globe, delivering speeches to Catholic communities about her son’s life, bringing strands of her son’s hair as gifts.The relics have been donated by his family, although once he is canonised they will become the possession of theVatican.Acutis was born in London, where his father worked in insurance, before the family moved to Milan when he was four months old.The family was not necessarily religious, Salzano told the Guardian, but her son showed a deep devotion to the Catholic faith from a young age.“He would go to mass and do the rosary each day,” she said, adding that he was a child who “could not be indifferent to sorrow”. “We lived in the centre of Milan in a building surrounded by beggars. He wanted to help them, speak to them, bring them food and blankets.”She added that Acutis was otherwise an average child, hanging out with friends or playing sports. A skilful coder, his whiz-kid reputation started to grow when he created websites for Catholic organisations, includingone that listed miracles. He enjoyed playing on his PlayStation too, although limited its use to an hour a week. “Carlo was an internet geek, but he had the temperance to use technology for good, and was not exploited by it,” said his mother.The movement that had built up around Acutis was evident from the day he died, as seriously ill people began praying to him for cures. His funeral was attended by a host of people he had helped, among them immigrants and bullied children.His mother claims it was around the time of his funeral that he started to work miracles, and last year the late Pope Francis credited Acutis with two.The first, the Vatican said, involved the recovery of a boy in Brazil from a rare congenital disease affecting his pancreas; the second was the healing of a student in Florence with bleeding on the brain after suffering a head trauma, and whose mother had prayed at Acutis’s tomb in Assisi.The speed at which Acutis has been canonised, especially when compared with Frassati, is part of the church’s quest to attract more young people to the faith.While non-Catholics might regard worshipping the relics as bizarre or even gruesome, it appeals to a lot of people, especially the young.“That’s exactly the point,” said Andrea Vreede, Vatican correspondent for NOS, the Dutch public radio and TV network. “The church wants to have a young saint who is a millennial, somebody who belongs to the modern age.”She drew a parallel with Maria Goretti, who was born into poverty in 1890 and brutally assaulted at the age of 11 in Nettuno, south of Rome, by a farmhand after refusing his advances. The church claims Goretti died from her wounds after forgiving her assailant. She became a saint in 1950.“She died peacefully and devotedly and that was it,” said Vreede. “She was turned into a perfect saint because they needed a role model for young women, especially after the second world war, to re-establish morality.”But as much as Acutis has gathered a huge following, with criminals exploiting the fascination and attempting to sell relicspurported to be his online, there has been criticism about the buzz created around him.“There have been questions raised about how appropriate it is for the church to idealise him as a supermodel,” said Vreede.Supermodel or not, his mother believes his relics are a reminder that “each one of us is called upon to become holy”. “Carlo reminds us that it’s possible for everyone to become a saint,” she said.Explore more on these topicsVaticanItalyCatholicismPope Leo XIVEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Will doctors and nurses protect us? Or will they report us?”On 1 September, Burkina Faso’s minister of justice and human rights, Edasso Rodrigue Bayala, announced an amendment to theCode of Persons and Family(CPF) which came into force in 1990, establishing for the first time a prison sentence of between two and five years and a fine for those who “promote homosexuality”.The amendment is “a historic reform linked to a legal innovation, respect for cultural values and the will to build a Burkinabé family”, says Bayala. He says homosexuality will be detected in people who show “bizarre behaviour”.Exiles from Uganda’s harsh anti-gay laws now fear ‘moral panic’ legislation could follow themRead moreFirst approved by the president, Ibrahim Traoré, in July 2024, it was unanimously passed by the transitional legislative assembly, which has replaced parliamentsince a coup d’état in September 2022.The new law has sent shock waves through the country’s queer community.“Talking too much could complicate life for those of us who live here,” says Jules*, a homosexual man living in Ouagadougou, the country’s capital. “It could harm us if suddenly our mutual support networks were cut off or if our meeting spaces were identified; we live hidden, but we live.”Agathe*, a lesbian, says: “I’m very stressed about the situation and the safety of LGBTQ+ people.”Until now, homosexuality did not appear in any legal document inBurkina Faso, which made the country a relatively safe space where gay people from across west Africa could live without fear of criminalisation or imprisonment.The amendment – which also provides for the expulsion of any non-national found to be engaging in homosexual practices and states that“it will not be possible to adopt Burkinabé children without accepting the country’s rules” – is seen by many aspart of a wider push across Africato promote what are called “family values”, but which oppose abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.View image in fullscreenA town roundabout in the Centre-Nord region of Burkina Faso bering a photo of President Ibrahim Traoré alongside Vladimir Putin.

It spread quickly across social networks, WhatsApp groups and Facebook, one of the most widely used platforms in the country. There was shock and fear, but also hateful and discriminatory messages. “What’s the point of showing how we feel in the media if it makes us more vulnerable and accessible?” says Jules*. “Since yesterday I’ve only seen hateful comments on social media.”Paul says: “I don’t know if someone is going to monitor us, if the population will revolt against us or persecute us – that’s what scares me the most. Luckily, my mother and sisters protect me.”Since thecoup, Burkinabé authorities have launched a programme focused on highlighting national sovereignty, local traditions, values and anti-colonial struggle. In January 2023, theyexpelled French soldiersfrom their territory and ended military cooperation agreements with the former colonial power. Traoré’s speeches have gone viral on social networks, and he enjoys strong popularity among young people.But the new law has left many of the country’s youth despairing. “My wish is to leave the country.

He had died in the water.Shark’s big bite of surfer’s board forces beach to close on Australia’s east coastRead moreThe victim, Mercury Psillakis, a 57-year-old father of one, was an experienced surfer who was part of the area’s tight-knit surfing community.The Dee Why and neighbouring Long Reef beaches are known surf spots, framed by two sweeping headlines on the coastline in the northern suburbs of Sydney. In the hours after the attack, a handful of friends, some still in wetsuits from the water, and family, who arrived after the tragedy, consoled each other, hugging as they sat in a tight knot on the sand.Metres away, emergency services workers had pitched a marquee, cordoned off by police tape. Police boats and surf lifesavers on jetskis patrolled the otherwise empty water off the beach – along with drones and a helicopter – looking for the shark.“It’s a terrible, terrible thing,”New South Walespolice Supt John Duncan said later. “It’s one of those freak incidents that happens very, very rarely … a great tragedy.”Map showing Long Reef beachThe return of warmer weather heralds a return to the beach for this part of the world.Within weeks across Australia, weekends at beaches will soon be dominated by junior lifesavers – known as “nippers” – swimming and board-riding along thousands of kilometres of coastline. A junior surfing competition was being held nearby at the time of the attack on Saturday.Rod McGibbon, of NSW Surf Life Saving, told reporters on Saturday that the attack was a deeply confronting scene. “We understand both him and his board disappeared underwater and it’s quite brave of those people to go in and rescue him while there’s a shark in the water,” he said.“It’s a very considerate community,” he reflected. “They look after one another. If they see somebody in trouble, they generally help out.”Local surfer Bill Sakula was preparing to go in when news of the attack broke.“It’s going to send shock waves through the community,” he said. “Everyone is going to be a little bit nervous for a while.”Sakula described the attack as “absolutely tragic”. But he said surfers understood and accepted the risk of shark attack: “At some point, we’re all going to paddle back out … it’s a passion”.Two sections of Psillakis’s surfboard were recovered from the water and are being examined to help determine the species of shark.There have been several fatal shark attacks along different Australian coastlines in recent years.In February,17-year-old Charlize Zmudasuffered fatal wounds when she was attacked while swimming at Woorim beach in south-east Queensland. She died shortly after being pulled from the water.And in March, Victorian holidaymakerSteven Payne, 37, died after he was bitten by a great white shark as he surfed on a West Australian beach near Esperance. His remains were never recovered.There is increased awareness of sharks – there has been a surge in amateur and professional drone presence monitoring the water, and online apps now alert swimmers to the presence of tagged sharks near beaches – but attacks are not common in Sydney.The last fatal attack in the city was in 2022 when British diving instructorSimon Nellistwas taken by a great white while swimming in deep water off rocks in Little Bay, south of the city.A swimmer wasattacked by a bull sharkoff a wharf in Elizabeth Bay, also inside the harbour, in 2024, but survived.Prof Charlie Huveneers of Flinders University, research leader of theSouthern Shark Ecology Group, said despite the “high variability” in risk, Australia was following a global trend of increasing numbers of shark attacks.Huveneers said the risk of shark bite was difficult to predict and influenced by a wide range of factors, including human population growth, habitat modification and destruction, declining water quality, climate change and anomalous weather patterns.“It is likely to be due to a combination of these factors, rather than just one.”View image in fullscreenSigns near the site of a fatal shark attack at Dee Why beach on Saturday.Photograph: Mark Baker/APSaturday’s attack is likely to refocus debate on Sydney’s coastline over the use of shark nets on city beaches. Psillakis was surfing on a stretch of beach in between Dee Why and Long Reef beaches, about 100 metres north of the Dee Why surf club. Dee Why has a shark net installed about 500 metres from shore: Long Reef, immediately north, is not netted.The nets are not comprehensive shields protecting beachgoers; rather, they are nets about 150m long and sixm deep, set 10-12m below the surface, about 500m from the shore.Sharksand other marine animals can swim over, under or around.Trial to remove shark nets from three Sydney and Central Coast beaches a good first step, scientists sayRead moreCritics argue they offer little protection – “like a table tennis net on a soccer pitch” – citing research that shows 40% of the sharks caught in nets are on entrapped on the inside, and that the nets also indiscriminately catch other marine life.Researchpublished in 2024 found no difference in unprovoked human-shark interactions at netted versus un-netted beaches since the 2000s.NSW – Australia’s most populous state – first introduced nets in the 1930s, but their use has since expanded to include 51 beaches between Newcastle, north of Sydney, and Wollongong to the south.The state has a broader shark management program, which includes drone surveillance, shark tagging, and real-time detection, as well as SMART drumlines (where sharks are caught, tagged and released) and community education.On Saturday night, locals had begun sharing tributes to Psillakis online. One posted that the Sydney surf community had lost one of its own.“A man doing what he loved – chasing waves – never made it back to shore. Our thoughts are with his family, his mates, and every surfer feeling this hit tonight,” they wrote. “For all who live and breathe the saltwater life, we ride on.”“To lose such a keystone in Mercury in so radical a sudden way leaves anyone with a sense of heritage stone cold heartbroken,” wrote another.“There, but for the Grace of God, go us.”–with AAPExplore more on these topicsSydneySharksNew South WalesMarine lifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their construction was placed at the heart of the German Democrat Republic dictatorship’s social policy and also largely underpinned its industrialraison d’etre.“It’s about the ‘slab’ or prefab as a place and memory of living, as a symbol of social utopias and as a canvas for social change,” says Kito Nedo, the curator of the exhibition at theMinsk galleryin Potsdam, itself an important architectural monument of the so-called Ostmodern, which narrowly escaped demolition after local protests.“The biggest question in the room, more relevant than ever in Germany and cities acrossEurope, is how to create affordable, quality housing,” Nedo adds. “The housing plan of the GDR was an historic attempt to address this question. It’s one politicians are called on to find an answer to today.”View image in fullscreenA photograph by Seiichi Furuya.Photograph: SuppliedFrom the time it went into mass production in the 1970s, a flat in a standardised concrete prefab complex was considered a veritable “des res” by many East Germans, lured by the promise of their own indoor toilet (an IWC), an open-plan kitchen/dining area with a pass-through hatch and reliable district heating, plus the amenities provided in each housing development, such as public transport links, akaufhalle(department store), childcare facilities, schools, youth clubs and polyclinics, or large health centres. Green areas for leisure were also promised, if sometimes slow to materialise.The speed with which they were erected is depicted in Sonya Schönberger’s archaeological-style sculptures, which capture in silicone the shoe and paw prints of residents left on the still wet concrete slabs of the Baltic Sea Quarter, built in Berlin-Neu-Hohenschönhausen and Lichtenberg, between 1984 and 1988.The design of the housing estates – childcare provision, proximity to the workplace – was seen as progressive, and intended to reinforce gender equality, as laid out in the GDR’s constitution, with women and men expected to work, even if, in reality, as referred to inKurt Dornis’ painting Second Shift, which views a woman through a hatch into the kitchen, many women still ended up, after work, carrying out the bulk of domestic tasks at home.View image in fullscreenZweite Schicht by Kurt Dornis.Photograph: Elke Estel/Hans-Peter Klut, SKDThe standardisation of the flats, and life in general, was reflected in jokes at the time, including how, even when blindfolded, electricians were able to immediately locate the outlets for power sockets.“East Germans joked about never having to ask where the toilet was if they visited a stranger’s home,” says Nedo, who grew up close to one of the GDR’s largest complexes in Leipzig.The author and director Grit Lemke describes the strong sense of community that existed growing up in a high-rise complex in Hoyerswerda, designated a socialist model city “where everyone knew everyone else … we kids playedplattenhasche(prefab tag) … where I had taken a bath in everyone’s tub … a childhood in a large collective that was wild and free.”While they were admired by many, because of their lack of comfort and individuality, the prefabs also drew derogatory nicknames, such asArbeiterschließfächeror workers’ lockers. The writer Heiner Müller, who lived on the 14th floor in a 166 metre sq flat in Berlin-Lichtenberg, mocked them as “fuck cells with district heating”.Brigitte Reimann, whose critical take on GDR housing is thematised in her 1974 novel Franziska Linkerhand, about an architect whose dreams of creating a city of the future fail due to the strict ideological dictates of the construction rules, called theplattenbau“faceless and interchangeable”, “that hive of dozens of cells stacked next to and on top of each other”.The exhibition documents these and other observations in paintings, photographs, sculpture and an accompanying programme of readings, films and walking tours.A series of black and white photographs by Sibylle Bergemann shows how people sought to bring individuality to the grid-like uniformity of their homes through the use of wallpaper, lamps and cuddly toys.View image in fullscreenA photograph by Sibylla Bergemann.Photograph: OSTKREUZ - Agentur der Fotografen GmbHBalkonkulturalso developed, whereby residents would pep up their balconies with awnings, decorative antique wagon wheels, brick-patterned linoleum and flower boxes, leading the architectural sociologist Bruno Flierl to comment at the time that the phenomenon was an expression of “anti-authoritarian self-help”, and a “subjective form of architectural critique” by the residents, whose “imagination and courage should be admired”.As much as it was once sought after, theplattenbau’s image plummeted after the fall of the Berlin Wall, becoming a symbol of social decline. Housing blocks were either demolished en masse, reduced in size as whole storeys were removed, renovated or rebuilt.Henrike Naumann’s still life installations Amnesia and Terror refer to the radicalisation of the far-right terror cell NSU in prefabs in the city of Jena as well as the series of racist pogroms that took place in cities such as Hoyerswerda and Rostock-Lichtenhagen as the once-new housing developments became places of painful transition.Places such as Hoyerswerda rapidly shrank as factories closed, people moved away and state-subsidised demolitions took place.“Now finally the connection between utopia and reality could materialise,” Lemke says. “But it slipped through our fingers.”Nedo says the exhibition is not about nostalgia but recognising the continuing existence of theplattenbau. “When we talk about the GDR, history stops in 1990,” he says. “Much of the representative architecture has been torn down. But theplattenbauare still there, and so too is the collective experience of living in them. You can still visit them, acknowledge they are part of the present, even if people almost never do.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyExhibitionsEuropeArchitecturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was destabilising and demoralising. Throughout high school I was bullied for my accent, clothes and looks. While Australian girls seemed like flowers thriving under the brutal sun, I felt like a sweaty, acne-prone gremlin who craved the dark and cold of home.Shortly after moving, I befriended a girl who had lost her mum. Suffering in our own ways, we found release in watching the 1998 action comedy Rush Hour, starringJackie Chanand Chris Tucker as detectives trying to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a Chinese diplomat. My friend had the film on VHS, and we put it on one night when I was sleeping over. This became a regular activity, and we would fling ourselves around her living room recreating fight scenes. It was the silly, uninhibited fun we both desperately needed, and my first taste of kung fu.Through my early teens, more films came out that connected kung fu to romance, coolness and fearlessness in my mind. Romeo Must Die; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; more Chan and Tucker hijinks in Rush Hour 2. In my imagination I became a mysterious kung fu master, defeating her adversaries without breaking a sweat. Way cooler than being a sad, homesick girl who let other people’s opinions cut her so deeply.I loved Romeo Must Die in particular and rented it repeatedly, enamoured of its R&B soundtrack (15-year-old me adored Aaliyah, who played Trish), and the agility of Han, played by Jet Li. Watching it for about the sixth time one night, I decided to stop just imagining doing kung fu – I had to learn it for real.In my imagination I was a mysterious kung fu master. Way cooler than being a sad, homesick girlSo, aged 15, I joined a school that taught a style called Choy Li Fut and took to it immediately. I trained as often as I could after school and on weekends,continuing into my university degree. When I trained, I no longer felt ashamed of my body, because now it was strong, skilful and graceful. While I still struggled to connect with my peers at school and later at university, within the corrugated iron warehouse of the kung fu school I felt confident.My cultural awakening: an ancient statue made me fall in love with my fat bodyRead moreAfter four years, I quit training, unable to find time for it between university and casual jobs. I graduated, got married and moved back to England just before the first Covid lockdown. In that time I’d tried to fill the kung fu void through the classes I could find – kickboxing, karate, judo – but none quite clicked.In 2021, then 34 and settled in Oxford, I found myself a bit lost and socially isolated once more. I was in the early days of my career as a freelance writer, and I spent a lot of time alone. Again, I felt the pull of kung fu. Luckily, Oxford is home to one of only two UK clubs for Wudang kung fu, a style practised by Daoist monks in China.When I visited the club, I felt an instant connection to it, like my body was returning home. I decided to certify as an instructor, which involved training for three intense and amazing weeks in China’s Wudang Mountains.I’ve now been teaching for two years, and it brings out the best in me. Unusually, our club is not-for-profit – we do it for the love of the art. My husband has always encouraged me, and he still waits for me to get home late after teaching so we can eat dinner together.Movies remain a part of my kung fu life: our club rented a whole cinema to watch Jet Li’s Hero, attended a 50th anniversary screening of Enter the Dragon, and saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with a live orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall. I still get a kick out of these films, but really they’re an excuse to hang out with some of my favourite people. It turns out what I’ve needed all this time isn’t just some self-esteem – it’s a place in a community I can call my own.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

The Euphoria grad, who gave a resonant performance inReality, scored a sleeper hit with glossed-up romcomAnyone But Youbut audiences were more impressed than critics, including myself (I found her performance strangely stilted). There was little interest from either side in her nun horrorImmaculate, and earlier this summer her incredulously plotted Apple movieEcho Valleywent the way of many Apple movies (no one knows it exists).Saipan review – football scandal makes for thrilling big-screen dramaRead morePost-thinkpieces, two of her festival duds (Eden and Americana) disappeared at the box office and she now arrives at Toronto in need of a win. And what better way to achieve that by going for an old-fashioned awards play, taking on the role of alternately inspiring and tragic boxer Christy Martin. It’s a role that’s already been buzzed about for months (Sweeney has been busy laying the standard “gruelling physical routine” groundwork) and at a time when movies about female sport stars still remain thin on the ground despite a swell of interest in them off screen, it’s a needed push in the right direction. But, as perfectly timed as this narrative might be, Christy just isn’t nearly good enough, a by-the-numbers slog that fails to prove Sweeney’s status as a one to watch.She’s a convincing force to be reckoned with inside of the ring, her training clearly having paid off as she confidently glides from fight to fight, but she can’t get us to believe in all that much outside of it, an actor still trying too visibly hard to make it all seem effortless (a few scenes with a more-at-ease Katy O’Brian, as another boxer, hint that she might have been the better choice). It’s a hefty ask, Sweeney playing the boxer over 20 years as she faced various struggles, and ultimately an impossible one too, her unsureness preventing us from getting beyond the film’s surface. Not that there’s much more here, though, despite the wealth of detail at play, Australian director David Michôd mostly sticking to the dog-eared playbook, at times that often make the film feel like Walk Hard but with boxing. There’s an excess of loudly soundtracked montages in the first act, yet with such little development outside of them we’re never quite sure what we should be feeling throughout, other than what we know from other boxing movies (it pales in comparison to last Toronto’s far smarter female boxer biopicThe Fire Inside).It’s a disappointingly rote way to tell the extraordinary life of Christy, who came from a mining family in West Virginia and found herself in the ring at a time when women weren’t seen there, a rise that sadly involved Jim Martin (Ben Foster), an older manager who takes her on as client and then wife, controlling her career and entire sense of self. Even as she became a groundbreaking name in boxing, as Don King’s first female star, her husband was there to bring her crashing back down to Earth. Over a fatiguing 135 minutes, we watch the rise and inevitable fall.Michôd broke out with the blazing crime drama Animal Kingdom, but there’s none of that fire still burning here. The only real connection would be a continued interest in showing us the very worst of human behaviour, as we bear witness to Jim’s vile treatment of his wife. It has an obvious visceral impact, but in how he chooses to linger on his final act of unspeakably awful violence, it can feel needlessly explicit. We know the beats of a boxing movie and a domestic violence drama all too well and neither side of the story is told in a way that doesn’t feel overly reliant on cliche. Foster sticks to an overfamiliar odious mode (he might as well have been introduced with red flags) and while the excellent Merritt Wever is saddled with a one-note bad mum role, she does more with it than the film deserves from her.Christy herself isn’t written with any more depth than a Wikipedia summary (Don King tells her in one scene that she has “some real personality” but where that is, I couldn’t tell you) and it betrays what could have been in smarter hands. The more uniquely interesting details of who she was – the wrestle between masculinity and femininity, how this played into struggles over her queerness and marital gender roles, how being crafted by a man turned her into a distrustful anti-feminist unwilling to recognise her groundbreaking impact and influence – are told to us in brief moments, but they never inform an otherwise ripped-from-a-TV-movie character. No wonder Sweeney struggles.Christy Martin’s life was filled with devastating blows but in her biopic, we barely feel the impact.Christy is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released later this yearExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewSydney SweeneyBen FosterBoxingToronto film festivalFestivalsDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a “blue shirt, white tee” (fans will get the reference), he is softly spoken with a hint of a Geordie accent. Herron is often described as the heir to John le Carré and“the best spy novelist of his generation”, according to the New Yorker. Unlike le Carré, he’s not, and never has been, a spy. Mysteriously, though, Wikipedia has given him “an entirely fictitious” birthday. “I got cards. I got a cake,” he says.For the uninitiated, the novels andaward-winning TV seriesfollow a bunch of misfit spooks exiled to Slough House from MI5 for various mishaps and misdemeanours, so far away from the shiny HQ in Regent’s Park that it may as well be in Slough. The joke is that these hapless underdogs (nicknamed “slow horses”), under the grubby reins of Lamb, always triumph over the slicker agents and “the Dogs” at the Park.“In its bare headlines, it’s not that promising is it?” Herron says modestly. “A bunch of people who aren’t very good at their jobs and don’t like each other, forced to work in an office. I mean, why would you want to read it?” It’s great fun, for starters. In a genre dominated by sinister psychological dramas and slick spin-offs, Herron’s mix of high jeopardy, low comedy and political satire might be described as a breath of fresh air, if the air in Slough House was not fetid with farts and frustration.Will Smith, co-writer of The Thick of It and Veep, was the ideal person to bring Herron’s world to the screen: Lamb is MI5’s Malcom Tucker, only dirtier. A cold war wreck, held together by booze, fags and loyalty to his “joes”, Lamb is one of the great characters of contemporary fiction.Like a modern-day Falstaff or Fagin, he is now part of the public imagination, thanks to an affectionate portrayal byGary Oldmanalongside a regally icy Kristin Scott Thomas as MI5 chief Diana Taverner in the TV show.This autumn, Oldman and co return with season five, based on the fifth Slough House novel,London Rules. On the back of its success, Apple TV+ will also launch an adaptation of Herron’s lesser-known 2003 debutDown Cemetery Road, with Emma Thompson as Oxford private detective Zoë Boehm. And this week, the author publishes the ninth in the Slough House series, Clown Town.The new novel is inspired by the true story of an IRA informant and murderer, codenamedStakeknife, real name Freddie Scappaticci. “An appalling human being”, Herron says, who was given protection by the British intelligence services in the 70s and 80s, in one of “the most morally dubious operations that the intelligence services had been involved in”, as one senior civil servant told him. Perfect Herron material. Players in the Slough House novels tread the murky line between protecting the nation and the interests of GCHQ.Stakeknife died“peacefully in his bed” in 2023 after Herron was well under way with Clown Town. The author didn’t stick too closely to historical events. “It hampers the imagination,” he says. “Also, I’m quite lazy when it comes to research.”You don’t have to know anything about politics to be a victim of political terror, to have bombs go off around youClown Town opens with a leftwing government finding its feet, a PM with a penchant for designer specs and “who happens to be a lawyer”, says Herron. There might be a new broom at No 10, but the dark corners of the British establishment are as grimy as ever. “I’m writing about how power corrupts,” he says. “It’s hardly an original observation, but it doesn’t matter who’s in power. Things are going to go wrong, either wilfully or by cock-up. I’m more prone towards the cock-up view of history than I am conspiracy, but that doesn’t alter the effect.”Herron may not have any experience of working for the intelligence service, but he has done his time in an office. “In many ways, I’m writing more about office life than about spies,” he says. “The intelligence service is essentially a big office. They’ll have a kitchen with fridges. The same things are going to happen as in any other office. I imagine,” he adds. James Bond it is not.Getting Herron to admit his books have been a runaway hit is like trying to persuade Lamb to take a shower. “Failure is always more interesting to me than success,” he maintains. “It would be stupid to deny that I am now successful, but I was that far away from being a failure,” he says, holding his thumb and forefinger together. “It could all have gone very differently. I was very lucky.”His is one of the great success stories of recent publishing history: an inspiration to slow horses everywhere. On his walk to the office of the legal journal where he worked as a subeditor for many years, he would pass an unhappy-looking building on Aldersgate Street. “I didn’t know I was going to write a book, let alone a series of books about it,” he says, of what would become Slough House. “I’ve been ‘living’ there ever since.” It is the very building on the TV show. “They went the extra mile there. They could have shown any building; they didn’t.” On the train back to Oxford each evening he would mull over his ideas so that by the time he got home, he knew exactly where he was going. “I had an hour of work in me,” he says, which averaged 360 words a day.After trying his hand at poetry and literary fiction, he turned to crime with his Zoë Boehm series. On 7 July 2005 he was waiting on the platform at Paddington when the bomb exploded at Edgware Road, one tube stop away. “You don’t have to know anything about politics to be a victim of political terror, to have bombs go off around you,” he says. “That made me realise I could write about events like that without necessarily understanding how they would come about.” So he changed tack and started writing espionage novels.View image in fullscreenHerron with Gary Oldman on the Slow Horses set.Photograph: Jack English/AppleSlow Horses was published in 2010. But he couldn’t find a UK publisher for its sequel, Dead Lions, a couple of years later. “What even is this?” one publisher asked, unable to work out if it was a thriller or a comedy. “The books didn’t sell at first,” Herron says mildly now. “It didn’t surprise me. I wasn’t wailing and gnashing my teeth or anything. I was just getting on with my life.”An editor at John Murray happened to pick up Slow Horses at Liverpool Street station and decided to back it. The first two novels were republished in 2015. The following year, Herron took a four-month sabbatical to try writing fiction full time. By 11am of the first morning he knew he could do it and on his return to the office he handed in his notice.But it was in 2016 that things really took off. “It was Brexit,” the author says definitively. “The country’s misfortune was my good luck.” His post-referendum novelLondon Ruleswas published in 2018. Suddenly, his populist floppy-haired, bicycle-riding MP, Peter Judd, seemed all too familiar. The echoes between PJ and BJ were impossible to ignore. Herron was at Balliol College, Oxford at the same time as Boris Johnson, not part of the Bullingdon set. “PJ was just my sort of rightwing bogeyman figure,” he says now. “Public-school educated, a sense of entitlement, self-obsession, complete disregard for ethics or morality or integrity.” He looks over the rooftops and their old college. “I mean, Boris Johnson fits that,” he says. “But so do many other politicians.”Just as le Carré’s novels resonated with the disillusionment and failure of the 70s, Herron captured the anger and frustration felt by many across the country. By the time the TV series launched in 2022, he was in full control of his material. “I’m more popular now, but I don’t feel that I’ve disconnected from the characters because of that,” he says. “When I sit down to write, I still feel like exactly the same person I’ve always been.”Growing up in Newcastle upon Tyne, the fourth child in a Catholic family of six, Herron describes his childhood as a happy one. His father was an optician, his mother a nursery school teacher who taught him to read before he started school. He read obsessively, preferring a fictional world to reality. “There was nothing wrong with the real world,” he says, “but I’d certainly rather have read a story than been at school.”View image in fullscreenThe cast of Slow Horses.Photograph: Jack English/PRIn 1979 he sat down with his parents to watch the TV serialisation of le Carré’sTinker Tailor Soldier Spy. He was hooked. The next day he borrowed a copy from his local library. He watched the BBC’s 1982 adaptation of Smiley’s People on a tiny portable black-and-white TV in a student house in Oxford. It is almost too neat a twist that Oldman playedSmileyin the 2011 film.“He was exactly the right novelist to be writing his books at that time,” Herron says of le Carré. “He saw the Berlin Wall going up. That was a gift to all of us. Brexit doesn’t compare,” he says, brushing off any parallels with his own historical moment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Rereading Smiley’s People,Herron was delightedto spot a foul-mouthed taxi driver called J Lamb, lurking in his subconscious all those years.Lamb was born, Herron says, out of “an unfiltered love of language”. He is the only character into whose mind the author doesn’t venture. To know if he means the outrageous things he says would be to “render the character useless”, Herron says. “Either he’s an absolutely despicable human being or he’s just pretending.” Some readers assumed he was a mouthpiece for Herron’s own views and sent him vile letters in support. Jumping between the different characters’ perspectives – Lamb’s faithful secretary Catherine Standish and tech geek Roddy Ho are his favourites – makes the reader work harder and is against all the rules of creative writing, the author points out. “And I love doing things that are against the rules.”One of which is killing off your core characters, even one of the good guys such as Min Harper. He wants the reader to have a sense that “nobody’s safe”. But it isn’t just for shocks. “It was about grief,” he says. His father died a few years before he started writing the series, but the decision was mainly a literary one. “I thought: I’ve got these people now. If I kill one of them, how are the others going to feel?”I like writing genre stuff. I like the structure, and knowing a book will have an actual ending, rather than just stopDuring lockdown Herron moved in with his partner Jo Howard (a publishing headhunter) and now writes in his old flat. His commute is a 10-minute walk and he aims for between 500 and 600 words a day. LikeZadie SmithandJonathan Franzen, he doesn’t have a smartphone and there’s no wifi. “We hang out and fax each other,” he shoots back. More unusually, he reads throughout the day. “I can go straight from the laptop to the sofa,” he says. “I’m a reader before I’m a writer. Reading words keeps my brain alert.”He doesn’t have to worry about money like he used to, and he gets to meet other writers, “which is great fun”. But for the most part, he leads a quiet life with Howard and their two cats (if hewerea spy the cats would be his soft spots). Howard is his first reader, but he never discusses a book until it’s finished. She is a keen walker, and can tell when he hits a tricky point in a novel by his pace. “I’m a plodder,” he says of his writing.At the moment he is working on a non-Slow Horses novel. “It’s about spies,” he reveals, helpfully. “I like writing genre stuff,” he says. “I like having that structure. I like knowing that a book is going to have an actual ending rather than just stop.”He was surprised to discover how much he enjoyed being part of the writers’ room for the TV series.“I never felt particularly collaborative even when I was in an office.” He will miss showrunner Smith, whorecently announcedthat season five would be his last.Herron even had a couple of cameo appearances. You would be forgiven for not spotting him and Howard in the first episode, coming out of Lamb’s favourite Chinese restaurant. In season four, they are leaving a hotel. He got to hail a taxi, he says, repeating the action now. They each had their own trailers. Could he ever have imagined such a scenario? “There was never a moment in my previous life where I thought this was possible,” he says.Seasons five and six are in the can (the latter based on two novels, Joe Country and Slough House). Filming of season seven, adapting Bad Actors, is due to begin this month, which leaves only Clown Town to be adapted. Does he have an endgame in sight?“There’s an awareness that there should be an endgame.” But there’s no danger he’s putting his horses out to grass for a while yet. He was tempted to blow up Slough House at the end of the first novel, to close with Lamb and Standish, the only survivors, running away on a ferry. “That didn’t happen,” he deadpans. “It would have been a good ending, actually. But my life would be very different.”Clown Town is published by Baskerville on Thursday. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply. Slow Horses season five is on Apple TV+ from 24 September. On 23 September, Mick Herron will join Richard Osman on stage at a specialGuardian Live eventto discuss their latest novels with Alex Clark.

Pavale, who lives in Bengaluru, India, had just finished some jobs around the house when he spotted the pair in their favourite spot, on a couch near a window.“They love it there, I think because it gets just the right amount of afternoon light,” Pavale says. “They often nap together, especially when the weather is calm. Kalya the black cat, who was four at the time, is a little reserved, but incredibly affectionate when he trusts you. The lighter one, Mani, was two. She’s playful and a bit mischievous. Despite the age gap, and the fact that they’re not littermates, they’ve formed a really strong bond. Kalya has a protective, big-brother energy about him, and they’re always grooming, chasing or cuddling.”‘I didn’t want to miss this crazy-looking ghost rainbow’: Bobby Beasley’s best phone pictureRead morePavale reached for his phone when he spotted them, noting the way the light helped bring out the contrasting tones of their fur. He moved quietly and slowly, and “they stayed snuggled up. I think they were too comfortable to care.”Afterwards, Pavale sat nearby for a while, watching them sleep. “It was a peaceful, grounding moment,” he says. “It served as a reminder of the quiet beauty in everyday life, of how love and comfort don’t always need grand gestures; they often live in the small, unspoken things. This is not just a cute moment – it’s a real expression of companionship.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This sexy oedipal thriller may be too shocking for vanilla viewersRobin Wright has a steamy relationship with her son as he embarks on a new romance with Olivia Cooke. This drama is the perfect show – and I say this with love – for pervertsRhik SamadderSat 6 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareThe thriller genre is amazingly malleable. You can start with an escaped monkey, a mystery corpse in frozen tundra, or just two women who can’t bear to be in a room together. You can make your own rules, as long as you do it with style, and take us somewhere surprising. Like using a tricycle to break into the Met Gala.The Girlfriend (Prime Video, from Wednesday 10 September), is a great example. It takes a relatable premise – what if your mother and your partner don’t get on? – and pushes it to extremity. When privileged surgeon Daniel takes new girlfriend Cherry, played byOlivia Cooke, to meet his family, things are tense from the outset. Daniel’s mother, Laura, is extremely protective, and senses Cherry is hiding something. The women strain to remain outwardly polite while their real relationship grows into one of covert threats, secrets and lies, outmanoeuvring and betrayal. There are chills. But it’s also hot.The show will appeal, and I say this lovingly, to perverts. Much of its steam comes from teasing the relationship between Daniel (Laurie Davidson) and his possessive mother, played by an imperious Robin Wright. Even Daniel’s father – with whom Laura has an open arrangement – remarks that it’s weird. We first see mother and son together when he surprises her in her private pool, practising her stroke. They wrestle underwater, and later relax in the sauna, her foot resting on his thigh. Cherry sees them kiss on the lips. There are many scenes where Laura and Cherry lock eyes while one or the other is having an intimate moment with Daniel.The show winks at us, enjoying its mischief. Cherry goes on a Spanish holiday with Daniel’s extended family, including Laura’s best friend and her daughter Brigitte. Cherry is mortified to learn that Daniel lost his virginity to Brigitte. He reassures her “she’s the closest thing I have to a sister”. If incest-tickling isn’t your bag, you may wish to find a more vanilla twisty thriller. Perhaps it’s crass to even name it, but if you’re in the market for a loaf of white bread, it can be a shock to open up a sack of oedipal snakes. I’ll be watching the entire series, purely for work reasons, you understand.View image in fullscreenLaurie Davidson and Olivia Cooke in The Girlfriend.Photograph: Prime VideoThe Girlfriend is not courting the clammy-handed, though. Its theme is how dangerous any of us might become – or be perceived to be – in protecting what we love. It’s a slippery, clever game of consequences and when violence arrives, it ups the stakes. It uses the Rashomon effect to scale its story. Within each episode, we shift between Laura and Cherry’s perspective – each announced with a bold red title card, like a Sergio Leone film or Lana Del Rey album cover. Going over the same events from opposing points of view makes us question reality. Is Cherry a gold-digging psychopath? Is Laura a smothering narcissist with a vendetta? Both could be true, or neither.‘We had to up the ante’: Robin Wright on her tense TV tale of incest and violence among London’s billionairesRead moreAmbiguities can keep us up all night, baby. Did we catch a knowing smirk on a colleague’s face? A double meaning to an offhand remark? Was the kiss on the lips? The show’s structure raises another question with an existential sting: who is the protagonist and who the antagonist here? We see ourselves as main characters, our actions perfectly understandable. But everyone thinks this: every dipshit playing crap music off a phone on the bus, every romantic prospect who ghosts, every unreasonable ex, antisocial neighbour or Stasi-like boss. They’re all main characters, and we’re in their way. Brrr.The Girlfriend has a twisting plot, unreliable narrators, hair-raising revelations. It probes status and influence. Cherry is young, beautiful and working class – implicitly a threat to old money gatekeepers. It also suggests how grief within families can cast a long, dark shadow. Any show that pits one woman against another, with a man as the prize, is a risk. But this show is agile. Based on the Michelle Francesnovel, it has been adapted byGabbie Asherand rising star Naomi Sheldon, a performer-writer who co-hostsThe Pleasure Podcast. Robin Wright directs half of the series. It is, in every sense, a sophisticated power play.You may want to skip it on family viewing night, unless you like awkward conversations.

The most impressive of these performers was Graham Greene, who has died aged 73.Costner was not intending to cast Greene after his first audition until the casting director Elisabeth Leustig prevailed upon him to reconsider. Greene recalled: “Elisabeth and the girls ganged up on Kevin and said, ‘This guy’s right for the part, you’ve got to hire him, he’s a very experienced actor.’”Experienced but not fluent. “It took three months to learn the dialogue,” he told True West magazine in 2021. “I had no idea what I was saying and I had to learn it phonetically. I’d be running 10 miles a day with my headphones on, listening to the translations, mumbling away in Lakota, and people were looking at me funny. But I got it down.”Greene, an Oneida who grew up on the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario, starred as Kicking Bird, the Sioux holy man who accepts Lieutenant Dunbar, a white Union lieutenant played by Costner, into his community and forms an alliance with him. The film was steeped in sentimentality, but Greene brought an effortless integrity, as well as humility and a dry wit, to his performance.View image in fullscreenGreene in Dances With Wolves. He was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actor.Photograph: Orion/Kobal/ShutterstockThat humility thrived off-screen as well. When the Oscars shortlist was announced in early 1991, Greene’s best supporting actor nod was one of 12 nominations the movie received. (It eventually won seven prizes, including best picture.) In the same week, he was  starring in an Ottawa production of Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing, by the Indigenous Canadian writer Tomson Highway. Aghast to discover that the theatre marquee was now adorned with the words “starring Oscar nominee Graham Greene”, the actor demanded their removal. “Take it down,” he said. “It’s not about me.”Though he did not win the Oscar, Dances with Wolves accelerated his career, which was already a decade old by then. Significant roles followed in films includingMichael Apted’s thriller Thunderheart (1992), withVal KilmerandSam Shepard, and the comic western Maverick (1994), with Mel Gibson. He was an NYPD officer in the Bruce Willis action sequel Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995), and found himself on the other side of the law in the mystical death row dramaThe Green Mile(1999) starring Tom Hanks.He was a rancher coming to the aid of a transgender woman (Felicity Huffman) inTransamerica(2005), and a tribal elder inThe Twilight Saga: New Moon(2009). He also played a judge in Aaron Sorkin’s dramaMolly’s Gameand a tribal police chief inWind River(both 2017), a thriller about a murder on an Indian reservation.Each of these roles represented a broadening of opportunities for Greene personally and a more general move away from old pervasive stereotypes. “I’m tired of being mystical and stoic,” he said in 1992.When he first worked in Hollywood, he recalled being “handed scripts and you’d have to speak the way they thought Native people spoke. In order to get my foot in the door, I did it; I went along with it a little while. ‘Ok, you gotta look stoic. And don’t smile … And stand there like this’ [folds arms and tilts head back]. And grunt a lot.’”Matters improved but there was still prejudice to overcome, even after that Oscar nomination. Explaining why he wasn’t going to cast him in Crimson Tide, the 1995 thriller set on a nuclear submarine, the directorTony Scotttold Greene: “I can’t see a Native American on a sub.”After pointing out that, in fact, he had four uncles who had worked on submarines, Greene exited the audition room. Asked later how he dealt with that kind of attitude, he was sanguine. “Just let ‘em go … I’m not gonna chase you round, saying ‘Oh, Mr Scott, I really need this role!’ To hell with you.”Describing himself as a “passive activist”, he tended not to be drawn into wider debates about representation. He told the Orlando Sentinel in 1992 that he was “[not] a big political animal. I don’t care what’s going on with politics. I have too much trouble worrying about my mortgage and how to run my fax machine properly.”He was born in Ohsweken in Ontario, to John Greene, a paramedic, and his wife, Lilian. He later moved to Hamilton and took various jobs: carpenter, carpet layer, welder, ironworker, bricklayer, roadie.View image in fullscreenGreene as officer Ben Shoyo alongside Elizabeth Olsen in Wind River, 2017.Photograph: Weinstein Company/Everett/ShutterstockHis first taste of acting came in the early 70s when he agreed to help a friend workshop a script. He then studied at the Centre for Indigenous Theatre in Toronto in 1974 and did stage work for several years, getting his first TV roles at the end of that decade.He made his film debut in Running Brave (1983), which starred the Jewish Texan Robby Benson as the Indigenous athlete Billy Mills. After the success of Dances with Wolves, Greene starred in several episodes of the whimsical TV series Northern Exposure in 1992 and 1993.In a later series, Longmire (2014-17), he indulged his fondness for playing villains. “They said, ‘He’s a bad guy’,” Greene recalled of the day he was offered the role of Malachi Strand. “I said, ‘Oh goodie!’” In seven episodes of Goliath (2019), he played a menacing casino boss suspected of turning into a crow at night. “Being nice all the time, it’s boring,” Greene reasoned.More recently, he played Corin in an all-male version of As You Like It (2019) shot in Death Valley. He starred in Taika Waititi’s TV comedy-dramaReservation Dogsand in the acclaimed adaptation of the zombie videogame The Last of Us (both 2023). In the comic horror film Seeds (2024), Greene played himself, reimagined as the host of a true-crime series and the protagonist’s spirit guide into the bargain.Kaniehtiio Horn, the director of Seeds, first saw Greene in the 1991 film Clearcut. “He was playing this playful, badass character,” she said. “He was one of the first roles that I think we saw where we could actually cheer for the Indigenous character as he enacted some revenge. It was really cathartic … for a lot of Indigenous people.”In June, Greene was presented with the Canadian governor general’s award for lifetime artistic achievement. Always ready with advice for younger actors, he recommended a grounding in theatre “because you’ve got to learn discipline or you won’t last very long. They ask, ‘How did you last this long, Mr Greene, 40-some years?’ And I say, ‘I’ve got a thick skin and a hard head.’”He is survived by his wife, Hilary Blackmore, and a daughter, Lilly, from another relationship.Graham Greene, actor, born 22 June 1952; died 1 September 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmKevin CostnerIndigenous peoplesobituariesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.After a year of musical chairs in the fashion industry, September is poised to be one of its biggest show months ever, with debut collections from 15 creative directors.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Rather than waiting for the catwalk, over the past 10 days brands including Chanel and Dior have given themselves a head start at theVenice film festival, using its starry red carpets and even gondolas to soft launch looks from their newly installed designers.Unlike the Oscars, which is one night of intense red-carpet scrutiny, or the Cannes film festival, whichcomes with strict rules, the focus at Venice is very much on notable art house films.With the pressure off, it allows designers, stylists and their Hollywood clients the opportunity to have a bit more fun. Amanda Seyfried even borrowed the same Versace look from Julia Roberts. A triumph for sustainability or a marketing stunt? Either way, it was front-page news.Jonathan Anderson,who took over at Dior in June, teased more than a dozen looks on actors including Greta Lee and Alba Rohrwacher before his womenswear debut in Paris next month. Lee wore a deconstructed minidress that riffed on the brand’s signature bar jacket, while Rohrwacher wore a navy gown with a padded bustle.View image in fullscreenBroken English star Tilda Swinton.Photograph: Gisela Schober/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Tilda Swinton hinted at what we can expect from Matthieu Blazy, the French-Belgian designer who recentlylanded the top job at Chanel, when she stepped off a water taxi wearing loosely cut white trousers and a short-sleeved blouse featuring tiny shimmering interlocking CC buttons.Henrik Lischke, the senior fashion features editor at Grazia, likens this new preview strategy to the press tour of theBarbie film in 2023. “That proved that the more hype you create, the more attention you get. These fashion brands are giving us a glimpse of what to expect,” he said. “It gets people excited long before a look even hits the catwalk.”It can also catapult relatively unknown names into the spotlight. In April,when it was announcedDario Vitale would be taking over from Donatella Versace, he was a designer only industry insiders were familiar with. But this week he was the talk of the lido, thanks to that sneak peek via Roberts and Seyfried.Pop stars such as Taylor Swift are known for planting Easter eggs, hidden clues about future projects for fans to decipher. Paparazzi shots of actors on set are used as unofficial teasers. And now it appears fashion designers are embracing the art of the promotional sneak peek too.View image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet gives a subtle nod to Bob Dylan’s style in Haider Ackermann’s first collection for Tom Ford.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersFashion’s new soft launch was first embraced by the actor Timothée Chalamet, who woreHaider Ackermann’s first outfit for Tom Fordto the Golden Globes, two months before the designer’s debut show. He also wore Sarah Burton’s first menswear look for Givenchy,a butter-yellow suit, to the Oscars days before her inaugural Paris show. Vicky Krieps and Julianne Moore have also worn previews of Louise Trotter’s Bottega Veneta.But similar to how on-set images have been blamed forruining movie magic, could these early teasers backfire? Some online users have accused Versace of becoming boring, while others say Anderson’s purposefully chaotic pieces for Dior do not exactly scream Hollywood glamour.Amy Odell, a fashion commentator andauthor of Gwyneth: The Biography, says while designers will be aware of early criticism, it is important to remember “not every look is for everybody”. As for disclosing too much, Odell is not worried. “I don’t think a whole lot is given away by one or two looks at a film festival – I view it as a nice teaser of what’s to come, an amuse bouche versus a big spoiler.”Best looksWhen the Hollywood stylist Elizabeth Saltzman posted a photo of Julia Roberts in a striped shirt, straight jeans and blazer from Versace on her Instagram account, Seyfried gushed: “Please let me wear the same outfit.” Two days later, Saltzman granted her wish, thanking Roberts for her “generosity and sustainability. Sharing is caring!” as she posted a photo of Seyfried in the same look, albeit with different shoes. Roberts wore black pumps; Seyfried chose strappy sandals.The internet was quick to chime in, placing photos of the stars side by side and debating who wore it best. Some are even calling it the most memorable look of the festival. But while it has cemented the idea of the BJT (blazer, jeans, top) as a form of modern power dressing (see the front row and the “girl boss” portrait era), it wasn’t the festival’s greatest red carpet hit. Here are three looks I would have borrowed instead.Ayo Edebiri in ChanelView image in fullscreenAyo Edebiri at the After the Hunt photocall. The actor’s outfit echoes Chanel’s spring 1999 collection.Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty ImagesFor her Venice debut, rather than going for a classic red carpet dress, Ayo Edebiri chose a white two-piece fromChanel. It hints at the direction Blazy wants to take the house. He was the designer who masterminded Bottega Veneta’s trompe l’œil pieces, including flannel shirts and jeans that were made from leather. Edebiri’s look riffs on Chanel’s spring 1999 collection, which featured asymmetrical jackets and cuffed trousers. It instantly feels more relatable than a tulle gown, although who but a Hollywood star can realistically wear an all-white look without the fear of spilling their lunch down themselves.Jacob Elordi in Bottega VenetaView image in fullscreenFrankenstein star Jacob Elordi’s white ensemble marks an end to method dressing.Photograph: Daniele Venturelli/WireImageOK, so Jacob Elordi in an all-white look from Bottega Veneta isn’t exactly novel, but hey, it’s not a suit, which for a man on the red carpet is kind of a big deal. It also marks an end to method dressing, a painful red carpet trend where actors felt the need to reference their characters. Although, given that Elordi will next be seen inEmerald Fennell’s sexy adaptation of Wuthering Heights, I am now thinking those sideburns and that billowing shirt are in fact quite Heathcliff.Greta Lee in DiorView image in fullscreenGreta Lee, star of Late Fame, wears a palette-cleansing outfit with too-serious stilettos on the red carpet.Photograph: Aldara Zarraoa/Getty ImagesDuring Anderson’s tenure at Loewe, Lee starred in numerous campaigns for the brand and was a regular on the front row. Now the Irish designer has hot-footed it to Dior, it seems Lee has followed. The Past Lives star has worn almost exclusively Dior throughout her stint at Venice. This look is Anderson’s take on the label’s new look – the silhouette that emerged during Christian Dior’s debut in 1947. For anyone bored with stunt dressing, it is a nice palette cleanser. I would have liked a more playful shoe – after all, Anderson created thosebroken egg Loewe heelsandviral pigeon bag– but maybe the witty accessories will come during his official hard launch at Paris fashion week next month.Explore more on these topicsFashionVenice film festivalFestivalsChanelDiorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Slabs of hake and golden chips sizzled, green chillies were being chopped and homemade sauces distributed liberally into packed sandwiches.Food influencer and radio DJ Nick Hamman stepped behind the counter and was greeted as an old friend by Yoonas and Mohammed Akhalwaya, the father-son duo behind the family business in Fordsburg, a historical south Asian and Middle Eastern area.View image in fullscreenMohammed and Yoonas Akhalwaya.Photograph: James Oatway/The GuardianHamman, who has more than 200,000 followers on bothInstagramandTikTok, has made it his mission for the past two years to boost food businesses across South Africa, highlighting the country’s diverse cuisine and bringing South Africans together across their often divided cultures.Each video opens with a cheerful: “I’m Nick Hamman!” He then goes on to state his goal for the day, such as looking for the best burgers, boerewors sausages or breyani (biriyani). From mala mogodu intestine stew to magwinya doughnuts slathered with liver, there is seemingly nothing that Hamman won’t wholeheartedly enjoy.“I started seeing food as a common theme in binding all of what I was interested in: culture, family, history, heritage,” said the 34-year-old, who also hosts the breakfast show on the radio station 5FM. “I believe food is political. I think food is very deeply tied to memory and nostalgia and history. And it tells the story of our country in a very special way.“It’s a democracy in one way, so we get a lot of suggestions on social media … If you start to see a place being suggested 100 times or more, you get a good sense that you should probably go there.”View image in fullscreenNick Hamman samples a kota sandwich at Siga Culinary restaurant in Johannesburg.Photograph: James Oatway/The GuardianThe entrepreneurs tick certain boxes: passionate about their food and culture, often with stories of overcoming adversity. Solly’s Corner also epitomises a type of business Hamman is fond of covering: a legendary spot that nevertheless remains something of a hidden gem.Founded in 1956 by Yoonas’s mother, Khadija, the restaurant survived eviction in 1968 by the apartheid government’s Group Areas Act, which forced people to live in racially designated areas. It also made it through the Covid-19 pandemic and an electrical fire in 2021 that gutted the shop. “We’ve had our ups and downs, but we thank God above,” said Yoonas. “It’s an absolute blessing feeding people,” Mohammed added.Footage of someone preparing sandwiches at Solly’s CornerSandwich preparation at Solly’s Corner.Hamman’s videos about Solly’s Corner have been viewed more than 1.7m times onTikTok,Instagramand Facebook since October 2023. The Akhalwayas were so appreciative of the extra 50-60% business that Hamman brought in, they plastered a huge image of him on a wall andnamed a burger after him. “Nick, also, he’s from the man upstairs,” Mohammed said warmly.About 12 miles (19km) north, the township of Alexandra, often called just Alex, sits on steep slopes either side of a river. The towers of Sandton, known as “Africa’s richest square mile”, loom on the horizon. In a more affluent part of the township there is another type of entrepreneur that Hamman is drawn to: the young chef trying to uplift their area.Gift Sedibeng founded Siga Culinary restaurant in 2018 in his parents’ old house, after a year working in a Mexican restaurant in Texas. The 33-year-old wanted to broaden his township’s tastebuds with fusion food, such as atowering “MexiKasi” kota burrito. An adaptation of the classic kota street food, a hollowed-out quarter white loaf is filled with everything from chips to chopped steak, a cheese burger and fried egg, plus Mexican twists including homemade pineapple salsa.View image in fullscreenGift Sedibeng with his iteration of a kota.Photograph: James Oatway/The Guardian“I like it when you make a meal for a person and they express their love … It makes my heart melt,” Sedibeng said.Sedibeng, who plans to open a culinary school next year, said about 60% of his customers come from outside Alex, then tell their friends that it is safe. “Crime is still there, but it’s not as bad as before,” he said.Food being prepared at Siga Culinary restaurant.Food being prepared at Siga Culinary restaurant.Hamman hopes his videos can help to boost the local economy: “Places like Alex, for example, where there is brilliance … if we don’t present these spaces in ways that people are going to be enticed to come into them, the money’s never going to come into these areas and they aren’t going to be given a fair chance to develop.”One of the worst-reputed places in Alex is Madala hostel, one of many built in townships by the apartheid government as men-only housing to control thousands of black male migrant workers. They became synonymous with the deadly political violence of the early 1990s, xenophobic killings in 2008 and continuing crime.Hamman wanted to show that hostels are also host to a vibrant food culture.

Well, wethinkshe was 92, but no one recorded her birth date, so we can only estimate. What we do know about her, though, is that she had a very cheeky laugh, and that she loved lager tops, penny slot machines and tucking £10 notes down her bra, ready to hand out to an unsuspecting grandchild as a gift. She never asked if I was happy, only if I’d eaten well, which I assume to her were the same thing. At this time of year, eating well for her meant tucking into sweetcorn, so, in her memory, I’m going to do the same.Kidney bean and sweetcorn curryPrep10 minCook40 minServes43 tbsp rapeseed oil25 fresh curry leaves(ie, from about 2 sprigs)1 tsp cumin seeds1 brown onion, peeled and chopped2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1-2 green finger chillies, or 1 tsp kashmiri chilli powder400g tin finely chopped tomatoes, or passata1½ tsp garam masala2400g tins kidney beans in water, drained and rinsed1¾ tsp fine sea salt150g frozen sweetcorn, defrostedChapatis and greek yoghurt, to serveHeat the oil in a large, deep-sided frying pan and test it’s up to temperature by dipping in a wooden spoon: if bubbles form around the spoon immediately, the oil is ready. Drop in the curry leaves and cumin seeds, leave them to splutter for a minute, then add the onion. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, until the onion is glossy and soft enough to cut with a wooden spoon; don’t skimp on the time here.Add the ginger, garlic and chilli to the softened onions and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes. Tip in the tomatoes and leave to cook for eight or so minutes, until the mix splits and the tomatoes start to release oil back into the pan.Add the garam masala, stir for a minute, then add the kidney beans, salt, 250ml cold water and the sweetcorn, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer and leave to cook for a further 10 minutes.Serve with chapatis and thick Greek yoghurt.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"

We’re permeable,” write Rick Smith and Bruce Lourie in their book Slow Death By Rubber Duck: The Secret Danger of Everyday Things. While the permeability of our cells is key to being alive, it also means we absorb more potentially harmful substances than we realise.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Studies have found a number of chemical residues in human breast milk, urine and water systems. Many of them are endocrine disruptors, which can interfere with the body’s natural hormones. “They can mimic, block or otherwise disrupt normal hormone function, leading to adverse health effects,” says Dr Shanna Swan, professor of environmental medicine and reproductive health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. We (often unknowingly) ingest, inhale or otherwise absorb them, and while toxicity depends on dosage, the reality is that a lot of us are exposed to them daily.So what to do about it? There are apps that will give you information about the ingredients in products, such asYuka,Think DirtyandEWG’s Healthy Living, but there are some key “nasties” worth knowing about. Because science is always evolving, navigating these issues can be tricky – even for the experts. That’s why many specialists recommend looking at your overall lifestyle and habits, rather than fixating on individual substances in isolation. The list that follows is far from exhaustive, but it highlights 15 ingredients that science suggests may pose risks to our health.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ben Wiseman/The GuardianCosmeticsPhthalatesThis group of chemicals is found in fragrances, plastic (including children’s toys) and other cosmetics and personal care products – such as hairspray and nail polish. Some phthalates are deemed endocrine disruptors “linked to preterm birth, fertility issues, early puberty and some cancers”, says Alexa Friedman, a senior scientist at non-profit health organisation Environmental Working Group. Swan adds that they canlower testosterone levelsand increase ouroestrogenic response, in turn affecting sperm, egg health and fertility, and increasing the risk of miscarriage andbirth defects. While some are considered safer than others at low doses, many are still linked with negative health concerns and/or are currently under-researched.To reduce exposure, avoid vague “fragrance” labels and ingredients ending in “phthalate”, such as dibutyl phthalate or diethyl phthalate. Brands such asIlia,Westman Atelier,Refy,Merit Beauty,Weleda,Olaplex,Charlotte TilburyandPaula’s Choiceavoid using them, but if in doubt check the EWG’sSkin Deep cosmetics databaseto learn exactly what’s in every formula you use.ParabensUsed as preservatives in makeup, skincare, haircare and some processed food, parabens extend shelf life and prevent microbial growth. Long-chain parabens, such as propylparaben, butylparaben and isobutylparaben, are endocrine disruptors thatmimic oestrogenand “may contribute to hormonal imbalances, reproductive harm,asthma, allergies,obesityand possiblyhormone-sensitive cancerslater in life”, says Dr Federica Amati, head nutritionist atZoe, the personalised nutrition app.Though some argue low doses are safe, many brands now offer paraben-free options. Look toDrunk Elephant,The Ordinary, Paula’s Choice,Tata HarperandLiving Proof, as well as mostCeraVeandLa Roche-Posayformulas too.FragranceThey may smell good, but many fragrance chemicals are phthalates or volatile compounds that release gas into the air. Often not fully disclosed on labels, they cantrigger allergiesanddisrupt hormones, says Amati. One example, Lilial (butylphenyl methylpropional) was widely used in cosmetics until it was banned in the UK and EU in 2022. “Beware of ingredient lists that use the words ‘fragrance’ or ‘parfum’ as they can hide phthalates and other chemicals,” advises Amati. Opt for fragrance-free skincare (AvèneandDermaticado great formulas, whileBioderma’s SensibioandLa Roche-Posay’s Tolerianelines are also good options) and haircare (such asPhilip Kingsley’s No Scent No Colour shampoo) and again, always read the label.Formaldehydeor formaldehyde-releasers“Used in nail and hair products as preservatives, formaldehyde is aknown carcinogenand can cause respiratory irritation and skin allergies, whileformaldehyde-releasing preservativesare associated with adverse skin reactions,” says Friedman. Black and Latino women, who often use hair relaxers,face higher exposureand potentially health risks over time.For safer haircare options, try formaldehyde-free keratin treatments from brands such asKerasilkandCezanne. Nail strengtheners – at home or in salon – often contain formaldehyde, so check before use, althoughBIABandCND Shellacare formaldehyde-free. As well as formaldehyde itself, watch out for ingredients such as DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, quaternium-15 and sodium hydroxymethylglycinate, which can also be found in self-tanners, makeup products such as blush, mascara, concealer and foundation, shampoo and conditioner, and skincare formulas too.OxybenzoneOxybenzone, a chemical filter in some sunscreens, is anendocrine disruptorandharmful to coral reefs. Cosmetic biochemist Nausheen Qureshi explains that it is absorbed by the skin and converts UVA rays to prevent damage – its intended function – but there are nonetheless concerns about (and ongoing research into) its impact on our health. It maypotentially affect our thyroidand reproductive hormones, and affect kidney and immune system function. Friedman recommends looking for EWG-verified sunscreens, which avoid harmful ingredients such as oxybenzone, but brands such asMedik8offer effective and safe options too. Mineral sunscreens that utilise zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are a good alternative because they sit on the skin and reflect UV light (without absorption) instead.FoodArtificial sweeteners“Artificial sweeteners, like sucralose and saccharin, can disruptgut microbiotaand impair glucose metabolism, potentially leading to metabolic disorders like diabetes,” says Amati. These low-calorie sugar substitutes are often found in products that are labelled “diet” or “sugar-free”. Studies also link intake with increased risk ofcardiovascular diseaseand unnecessaryappetite stimulation. When buying supermarket products, be wary of low-sugar marketing claims and prioritise eating whole foods (raspberries are a great high-fibre, low-sugar snack) over processed foods and diet drinks. Swap fizzy beverages (which are often full of artificial sweeteners) forDalston’s SodaorMomo’s raw and unfiltered kombucha, which is also great for gut health.High-fructose corn syrupHigh-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a sweetener commonly found in processed foods, fizzy drinks, sweets, sauces, breakfast cereals, baked goods and even certain yoghurts and flavoured dairy products in the UK, and especially in the US. It is inflammatory, “disrupts the metabolismand contributes to insulin resistance,blood sugar instability,obesityandtype 2 diabetes,” says Rhian Stephenson, nutritionist, naturopath and founder ofArtah, which sells supplements and nutrition programmes. “It also offers little nutritional value and negatively affects energy levels, hormones and metabolic health.”In the UK, HFCS may appear on labels as glucose-fructose syrup or isoglucose, but elsewhere it goes by other names, such as maize syrup. Stephenson advises reading full ingredient lists, “not just the front label, because marketing claims – such as ‘natural’ or ‘low fat’ – can be misleading,” she says. “In fact, they are usually a warning sign.” For some extra assistance, Amati recommends theZoe processed food risk scale, a science-backed tool that offers guidance on what’s in processed foods. Ultimately, cooking whole foods at home is the best way to avoid HFCS and similar additives.EmulsifiersWidely used to improve the texture and shelf life of packaged foods, emulsifiers have “been shown (inanimal studies) to causegut inflammationand glucose intolerance, and many worsen intestinal diseases like ulcerative colitis”, says Amati. It is found in products such as ice-cream, mayonnaise, chocolate, packaged bread and oat milk (common examples include polysorbate 80, carboxymethyl cellulose or CMC and carrageenan). Emulsifier-free supermarket buys includeJason’s Sourdough(which also doesn’t contain sweeteners),Plenish’s Oat Milk,Yeo Valley’s Organic Vanilla Ice-CreamandKallo’s Belgian Milk Chocolate Organic Rice Cake Thins. While currently deemed safe in small amounts, emulsifiers are worth watching as research in humans evolves.NitritesWhether it’s bacon, salami or hotdogs, most processed meats are preserved using nitrites. These can form carcinogenic nitrosamines in the body, and have been scientifically linked to an increased risk ofcolorectal cancer, rates of which arerising globally. The World Health Organization advises limiting intake, and to be particularly wary of heating them above 130C, which is when nitrosamines can form – and havebeen linked tostomach andbowel cancer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

While the most concerning culprits – red 3 (E127) and red 40 (E129) – are no longer widely used in the UK, some are, including ponceau 4R (E124), sunset yellow (E110), quinoline yellow (E104), carmoisine (E122) and tartrazine (E102), but holdFood Standards Agency warnings. They are still considered safe overall, but are linked to “neuroinflammation[potentially leading to diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s],hormone disruptionandbehavioural issuessuch as hyperactivity and attention difficulties, especially insensitive individuals like children,” says Stephenson. “There are concerns about their impact on developing brains and nervous systems.”You’ll find them in some fizzy drinks, sweets, canned fruit, jellies, mushy peas, ready meals and products imported from the US, including various sweets. Most food companies in the UK now avoid them. However, if they are used, it is a legal requirement that the products carry a warning (“may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children”), so check the label.Trans fatsTrans fats – especially those that are artificially made – raise LDL (bad) and lower HDL (good) cholesterols, and are linked tochronic inflammationandheart disease. They can also “disrupt hormone balance, impair insulin sensitivity, and affect everything from mood and metabolism to fertility and menstrual health,” says Stephenson. Found in ultraprocessed foods, such as frozen pizza, chips, doughnuts, cakes and margarine, they also contribute to the unhealthy visceral fat that builds up around key organs such as the liver and intestines, which raises inflammation and increases the risk of a number of diseases. If “partially hydrogenated oil” is listed on the label, take it as an immediate red flag, while interesterified fats, hydrogenated vegetable oil and shortening (a type of fat used to create crumbly pastry) are other warning signs, says Stephenson.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ben Wiseman/The GuardianKitchenPfasOwn a Teflon pan? Then you will have encountered Pfas (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), a family of “forever chemicals” that are in some non-stick coatings. They are also used for water- or smudge-resistance in cosmetics, textiles and outdoor clothing. “Pfas degrade incredibly slowly,” explains Jonatan Kleimark, head of corporate sustainability at ChemSec. This allows them to build up in the body and the environment, which is worrying as they arecarcinogenicand candisrupt our hormones,reduce immune functionand causereproductive issues.To avoid them, swap non-stick pans for carbon, ceramic or stainless steel: brands such asOur PlaceandLe Creusetoffer highly Instagrammed, Pfas-free pots and pans. Many brands now make it clear that their products are Pfas-free, so keep an eye out. In makeup and skincare, beware of ingredients that feature “fluor” somewhere in their name (see: perfluorooctanesulfonic acid), especially if they are in long-wear or waterproof products as these are often Pfas, says Kleimark.BPAAn industrial chemical used to make rigid plastics, bisphenol A (or BPA) is a “well-studied endocrine disruptor associated with hormone-sensitive diseases (such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian, breast, prostate and thyroid cancers and postpartum depression) and metabolic disorders,” says Amati. It also affectscognitive functionand raisesrisk of obesity. Like Pfas, itaccumulates in the bodyover time, increasing long-term disease risk. Research in 2020 foundBPA in the urine of 92% of adultsin 11 European countries.ThoughTupperwareis BPA-free, the substance is still found in many plastic containers, refillable drinks bottles and tin can linings. (The EU banned it in food-contact materials in 2025, but the UK has not done the same.) To avoid it, switch to glass containers (VonShefandPyrexare good options), buy BPA-free water bottles, such asOcean Bottle, and look for a “BPA-free” label on cans. If the can’s recycling code is 3 or 7 (see the green triangle), chances are it contains a BPA lining.TriclosanThere are a number of ingredients in cleaning products that can affect human health. Triclosan, an antimicrobial agent that’s linked to oxidative stress,hormone disruptionandgenotoxicity(the ability to damage our genes), is worth avoiding. Brands such asDr Bronner,MethodandEcoveroffer triclosan-free formulas.VOCsVolatile organic compounds (VOCs), found in ingredients such as denatured alcohol (meths) and some fragrances, are linked tocancer and respiratory issues. Choose fragrance-free cleaning products, such as those fromPurdy & Figg,Kit & KinandBio-D, which avoid triclosan, parabens and other concerning chemicals, as well as formulas such asM&S’s Sensitive Multi-Surface CleanerandThe Lab Co’s Fragrance Free Washing Up Liquid.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingNutritionFood scienceMakeupFragrancePfasBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But I had come to Trieste to experience, if not a cuisine, then a culinary tradition which, to me at least, does seem unmistakable: theosmizascene of the surrounding countryside.Anosmiza(orosmizein the plural) is a Slovene term for a smallholding that produces wine in the Karst Plateau, a steep rocky ridge scattered with pine and a patchwork of vineyards that overlooks the Adriatic Sea. Visitingosmizeis a centuries-old tradition in which these homesteads open their doors to the public for a fleeting period each year. Guests order their food and wine at a till inside – where a simply tiled bar, often set into local stone, might boast family photos, halogen lights and a chalkboard menu – before heading outside to feast at long Oktoberfest-style tables and benches.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian Graphics“On the Italian side of the border, we just serve cold food,” Jacob Zidarich tells us, as he places down plates of pickled courgette, house-curedsalumi, local cow’s milk cheese and a homemade sausage with mustard and grated horseradish. “But in Slovenia, you find cooked food.”I am sitting with my partner on the hot terrace at Zidarich’s family home, looking out over a glittering Adriatic. To accompany our food, Zidarich pours two glasses of liquid goldvitovska, a white wine indigenous to this corner of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, the north-eastern Italian region that borders Slovenia, and which is home to the port city of Trieste.To understand the tradition of visitingosmizeis to grasp something of Trieste’s complex history and multifaceted cultural identity. The word derives from the Slovenianosem, meaning “eight”, a reference to a decree by 18th-century Holy Roman empress Maria Theresa that farmers in the Karst could sell their wares for eight consecutive days each year.You’ll pay little more than €2-3 for a quarter-litre carafe of wine and €12-15 for an abundant platter of cold cutsThe result is an enduring tradition in which farmers only open for a short time each season, although almost all of them are now open for more than eight days a year. For this reason, no twoosmiza-based itineraries are the same. Turn up at virtually any time of year and there will beosmizeopen – especially over the warmer months – all offering an affordable flavour of the Friulian countryside.You’ll pay little more than €2-3 for a quarter-litre carafe of wine and €12-15 for an abundant platter of cold cuts, pickles and pillowy white bread. The tradition is particular to this tiny nook of Friuli, although as Zidarich indicated, it also exists – with differences – over the Slovenian border. Our focus is the Italian side where you can check whichosmizeare open (on the day of writing, there are 13) and at what time on the websiteosmize.com.View image in fullscreenAnosmizaspread for one at Verginella Dean, including home-cured salumi and hams, local cow’s milk cheese, pickles, olives and sun-dried tomatoes.Photograph: Mina HollandI base myself at the charmingHotel Albero Nascostoin the centre of Trieste for three nights and, with the intention of visiting as many of theosmizeas possible, hire a car. I make it to fourosmize, and realise quickly thatZidarichis something of an exception. Although his family had been making simple white and red wines for generations, it was his father, Benjamin, who transformed the farm into one of the most respected wine producers in the region. At otherosmizewe mostly drink wine from kegs. Some might describe these places as rustic, but even the table wines here have a clear style and moreish complexity to them.Next up isVerginella Dean, anosmizabustling with both locals and visitors and known for its peerless view of the Gulf of Trieste. From here the city’s Piazza Unità d’Italia is just visible, as is the brutalist Temple of Monte Grisa (which we visit afterwards). From an outdoor bar with two wine taps, I order a quarter ofmalvasiafor two of us and a mixed platter of pork cuts, triangles of salty cheese and sun-dried tomatoes “for one” (it could feed four).Osmizearen’t so much a cuisine as a gastronomic tradition, but I might have put to Jan Morris that theyareemblematic of a place that, although bureaucratically Italian, has strong Slovenian influences. Zidarich’s vineyards straddle the border with most of the land being in Italy, but Slovenian is the language spoken at home, as with all the farmers I met.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The daughter of Trieste Slovenians, she tells me she grew up without any Italian traditions – “no lasagne, no ravioli” – and that when she met her Milanese husband she gave him a copy of Morris’s book “to explain what I was”.Trieste, then, is at a crossroads between three great European cultures: Roman, Slavic and Austrian. But it doesn’t stop there – it’s a multi-faith, “inter-racial jumble”, as Morris had it, home to one of the largest synagogues in Europe alongside Greek and Serbian Orthodox churches. Its significant immigrant communities rub shoulders.Rather magically, we are the only ones here, and sip our drinks to a soundtrack of cattle lowing and stamping their hoovesBesidesosmize, there are plenty of reasons for hungry travellers to visit Trieste, from its quirky coffee culture complete with its own vocabulary (here an espresso is anero, which could refer to a glass of red wine elsewhere in the region) to fresh fish and seafood at restaurants such asTrattoria NerodiseppiaandLe Barettine, which are both within spitting distance of the hotel.View image in fullscreenMimì e Cocotte, which specialises in regional natural wines.Photograph: Lavinia Colonna PretiWe also lovedMimì e Cocotte, a centrally located seasonal restaurant that combines the humility of home-cooked food with a sense of occasion, and specialises in regional natural wines. With these we wash down courgette frittata and two plates of pasta –cacio e pepe, andcavatelliwith tomatoes andstracciatella. Just outside Trieste, in the seaside village of Duino,AllaDama Bianca has the fading charm of a 1970s hotspot. Here we eat razor clams and watch swans glide across the water as the sun sets.Back in Trieste, on Via Giusto Muratti, we discover Pagna, an artisanal bakery and natural wine bar run by the Serbian pastry chef Pedja Kostic, who was drawn to Trieste from Belgrade via the US, by the wine scene. At Pagna I eat the almond croissant of my life: a perfect crisp pastry with a pillowy interior hugging not-too-much frangipane.View image in fullscreenDrinks and nibbles at Pagna, which specialises in natural winesBut it was forosmizethat I came, where each one reflects the people behind it. At Šuc Erika, anosmizain the middle of a farmyard, whose walls are adorned with a picture depicting ricotta production and felt-tip drawings by previous child guests, we order from a woman in a Metallica T-shirt. Afterwards, we sit under a pergola of ripening grapes. Rather magically, we are the only ones here, and sip our drinks (which, unusually, include a delicious cloudy beer brewed in-house) to a soundtrack of cattle lowing and stamping their hooves.Unable to resist just one more before we leave, we head toOsmiza Borisin Medeazza, where Boris’s wife, Patricia, is behind the bar. She tells us about thesalumi, wine vinegars, olive oil and honey they make on-site, while two teenage sons pad in and out of a courtyard in flip-flops. Boris was recommended to us by a waiter at La Dama Bianca as one of his favourites to visit before work, which gives you some indication of how widely enjoyedosmizeare here – democratic and available to everybody, when they happen to be open.The trip was provided byPromo Turismo FVG, the tourist board of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia.

Though I’ve been watching the water level dropping since spring, it’s a shock to be down here among exposed rocks, their coating of liverworts and mosses crusty and dry. Surprising too, the lack of cold that I normally feel through the neoprene. That I can walk to the other side of the East Allen is a strange experience; were this river to be at flood levels – which it often is – I would be underwater now.Familiar landmarks are unfamiliar. The large square block of stone where I’ve seen otter spraint is beached, its halfway tidemark showing where water normally laps. Roots are exposed, pools stand stagnant, the river usually coloured by peat from higher up is clear to the bottom. No wonder the herons have been patrolling as sluggish fish try to hide in oxygen‑depleted, shrinking waters.View image in fullscreenA shrunken River East Allen.Photograph: Susie WhiteI explore the burn that runs into the main river. Its usual rush is stilled, and in places it is almost a barranco with just a trickle filtering through.Plantsnow grow in the middle of the stream: willowherb, buttercup, common hemp-nettle and bittercress. Water mint flowers purple the banks, unperturbed by the lack of moisture, releasing scent as I clamber out.England has had a summer of four heatwaves and trees are under stress, shedding their leaves prematurely as an act of survival, not from less daylight and cooler temperatures. In this “false autumn” the hawthorns are dropping their berries, woods along the valley are changing colour, the ochre and yellow of alder and birch leaves are clogging pools in the slow moving river. Even if rain comes, it will take a while for the levels to rise again.Birds and animals rely on food stocks to prepare for winter. Jays squabble over wild raspberries, thrushes devour berries of holly and bramble. Everything is out of sync. This year fruits are smaller and less juicy, nuts dropping too soon, and animals that hibernate will struggle. Insects, mammals, fish, birds, all in the interconnected food chain are affected by a false autumn, my small patch by the river being just one piece of this network.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsRiversCountry diaryTrees and forestsRural affairsPlantsBirdsAnimalsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

At least someone can relate to my holiday state of mindTim DowlingSat 6 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 6 Sep 2025 13.42 EDTShareIam on holiday, standing on a coastal headland under a bright blue dome of sky, the wind light and warm, looking at the weather app on my phone. The forecast and the scene are in agreement: it’s a nice day.I scroll through all the locations where I’ve previously felt the need to check the weather – Exeter, Marseille, York – until I get to London, where, it turns out, it’s also pretty nice.Normally when I’m on holiday I only check the weather in London in order to gloat. To justify the trouble and expense of travel, you really want it to be 17C and raining at home. But we’ve pushed back an urgent meeting with a roofer in order to go ahead with our holiday plans, so my mood is doubly weather dependent. I would rather it rained on this headland than over the hole in my roof.“Try to look as though you’re having a good time,” my wife says, catching me up on the path down to the beach.“I am,” I say.“You’ve got this terrible pained expression on your face,” she says.“The pained expression,” I say, “is me trying.”The dog is capering up and down the narrow, winding path, occasionally disappearing over seemingly sheer drops. I don’t suffer from a fear of heights, but I am susceptible to a form of acrophobia-by-proxy: I feel it on behalf of other people, even strangers, who don’t appear to possess my judicious good sense with respect to precipices. Whatever’s wrong with me, the dog is setting it off.I’m worried that if the dog gets into difficulty I’ll be obliged to swim out and drown while attempting to rescue it“I’m just going to wait here,” I say, my heart rate beginning to climb. Our friends, and their dog, are ahead of us.“Relax,” my wife says. “The dog isn’t going to just jump off a cliff.”“I’m not sure what you’re basing that belief on,” I say. “But I will relax, as soon as you’re all out of sight.”I sit on a rock and wait, staring out at the sea and resisting the urge to consult my phone again. After five minutes, when I feel sufficiently alone, I clamber down the rest of the way comfortably, even a little recklessly. Maybe this is the solution, I think: going on holiday by myself.The tide is out; the flat expanse of sand between our blanket and the water’s edge is immense. The sky, even over the sea, remains cloudless. On Wednesday, I discover, there’s a 35% chance of rain in London.“What a spot!” says our friend, whom I’ll call Paul, because his name is Piers. “It’s so remote!”“But with a surprisingly good signal,” I say, waving my phone.“I’m going swimming,” my wife says. “Will you come?”“I’ll wait and go in after,” I say.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

As soon as my wife wades out and dives in, the dog starts barking and leaping into the waves, then panicking and bounding back out. It’s very hard for me to watch. The dog can swim – I’ve seen it swim – but I’m also pretty certain it lacks my judicious good sense. I’m worried that if the dog gets into difficulty I will be obliged to swim out and drown while attempting to rescue it. That’s just how these things work.I resist the urge to stomp down to the shore, clip the lead to the dog’s collar and stand there waiting, because I’ve been doing that all week, and my wife has made it clear I’m killing the vibe.Instead I compose a text suggesting a Wednesday meeting with the roofer, even though that would mean coming back a day early, and I would have to wait to consult my wife about that. She probably won’t want to, but looking at my phone slows my anxious heart, so I write the text and then don’t send it.An extra large wave thunders in. The dog turns and runs up the beach in my direction, spraying sand in its wake. Sitting down next to me, the dog scans the sea in a posture of unrelieved vigilance. Every time my wife’s head disappears behind a giant wave, the dog stands, whimpers, waits, eyes fixed on the spot. When my wife bobs up again, the dog sits.“Do you do this when I’m in the sea?” I ask it. “Just out of interest.”The dog shudders along the length of its flank, letting out a high-pitched keening sound.“I find it helps to look away,” I say. “Slow breath, look away.”Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now the one constant in digital publishing is undergoing a transformation that may completely change the landscape.”Last week, the owner of the Daily Mail revealed in its submission to the Competition and Markets Authority’s consultation on Google’s search services that AI Overviews have fuelled a drop in click-through traffic to its sites by as much as 89%.DMG Media and other leading news organisations, including Guardian Media Group and the magazine trade body the Periodical Publishers Association (PPA), have urged the competition watchdog tomake Google more transparentand provide traffic statistics from AI Overview and AI Mode to publishers as part ofits investigation into the tech firm’s search dominance.Publishers – already under financial pressure from soaring costs, falling advertising revenues, the decline of print and thewider trend of readers turning away from news– argue that they are effectively being forced by Google to either accept deals, including on how content is used in AI Overview and AI Mode, or “drop out of all search results”, according to several sources.On top of the threat to funding, there are concerns about AI’s impact on accuracy. While Google has improved the quality of its overviews since earlier iterations advised usersto eat rocks and add glue to pizza, problems with “hallucinations” – where AI presents incorrect or fabricated information as fact – remain, as do issues within-built bias, when a computer rather than a human decides how to summarise sources.View image in fullscreenGoogle Discover has replaced search as the main source of traffic click-throughs to content.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIn January, Apple promised to update an AI feature thatissued untrue summaries of BBC news alerts, stamped with the corporation’s logo, on its latest iPhones; alerts incorrectly claimed that the man accused of killing a US insurance boss had shot himself and that tennis star Rafael Nadal had come out as gay.In a blogpost last month, Liz Reid, Google’s head of search, said the introduction of AI in search was“driving more queries and quality clicks”.“This data is in contrast to third-party reports that inaccurately suggest dramatic declines in aggregate traffic,” she said. “[These reports] are often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the rollout of AI features in search.”However, she also said that while overall traffic to all websites is “relatively stable” she admitted that the “vast” web means that user trends are shifting traffic to different sites “resulting in decreased traffic to some sites and increased traffic to others”.In recent years, Google Discover, which feeds users articles and videos tailored to them based on their past online activity, has replaced search as the main source of click-throughs to content.However, David Buttle, founder of the consultancy DJB Strategies, says the service, which is also tied to publishers’ overall search deals, does not deliver the quality traffic that most publishers need to drive their long-term strategies.“Google Discover is of zero product importance to Google at all,” he says. “It allows Google to funnel more traffic to publishers as traffic from search declines … Publishers have no choice but to agree or lose their organic search. It also tends to reward clickbaity type content. It pulls in the opposite direction to the kind of relationship publishers want.”Meanwhile, publishers arefighting a wider battlewith AI companies seeking to plunder their content to train their large language models.The creative industry is intensively lobbying the government to ensure that proposed legislationdoes not allow AI firms to use copyright-protected workwithout permission, a move that would stop the “value being scraped” out of the £125bn sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is an existential crisis.”While publishers are pursuing action on multiple fronts – from dealmaking and legal action to regulatory lobbying – they are also implementing AI tools into newsrooms and creating their own query-answering tools. The Washington Post and the FT have launched their own AI-powered chatbots, Climate Answers and Ask FT, that source results only from their own content.Christoph Zimmer, chief product officer at Germany’s Der Spiegel, says that while its traffic is currently stable he expects referrals from all platforms to decline.“This is a continuation of a longstanding trend,” he says. “However, this affects brands that have not focused on building direct relationships and subscriptions in recent years even more strongly. Instead, they have relied on reach on platforms and sometimes generic content.“What has always been true remains true – a focus on quality and distinct content, and having a human in charge rather than just in the loop.”One publishing industry executive says the battle to strike deals to help train AI models to aggregate and summarise stories is rapidly being superseded by advances that are seeing models interpret live news.“The first focus has been on licensing deals for training AI, to ‘speak English’, but that is becoming less important over time,” says the executive. “It is becoming about delivering the news, and for that you need accurate live sources. That is a potentially really lucrative market which publishers are thinking about negotiating next.”Saj Merali, chief executive of the PPA, says a fair balance needs to be struck between a tech-driven change in consumers’ digital habits and the fair value of trusted news.“What doesn’t seem to be at the heart of this is what consumers need,” she says. “AI needs trustworthy content. There is a shift in how consumers want to see information, but they have to have faith in what they are reading.“The industry has been very resilient through quite major digital and technological changes, but it is really important we make sure there is a route to sustain models. At the moment the AI and tech community are showing no signs of supporting publisher revenue.”Explore more on these topicsNewspapers & magazinesDigital mediaGoogleSearch enginesArtificial intelligence (AI)AlphabetComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her social media described her as a yoga teacher and practitioner of biodecoding, an obscure alternative therapy that claims to cure illness by resolving past traumas.Her husband, Juan Carlos Cortegoso, 61, built and raced go-karts. Like many in this neighbourhood, the couple were comfortably off, and discreet. “Patri was an excellent person”, one neighbour said. “Nice, well educated,” said another.Then, last month, they put their house up for sale. A photographer from a local estate agent, Robles Casas y Campos, came round to shoot the spacious, elegantly furnished interiors. The pictures went up. And their quiet existence came crashing down.The fifth photograph on the agency’s listing showed a general view of the villa’s living room. Hanging on the wall, above a buttoned sofa in plush green velvet and next to a polished antique commode, was a highly distinctive oil painting of a woman.View image in fullscreenThe painting by Italian artist Ghislandi in the living room in Mar del Plata.Photograph: Robles Casas & CamposMore than 11,000km away, the Dutch news outlet AD had, for several years, been quietly investigating the fate of old master paintings looted by the Nazis and stilllisted by the Dutch culture ministry as “unreturned”after the second world war.Journalists had made several attempts to speak to Patricia Kadgien, the owner of the property, and to her elder sister, Alicia, the daughters of a high-ranking Nazi official Friedrich Kadgien, who was known to have settled in Argentina after the war.Their calls and messages had consistently gone unanswered, or been rebuffed. But then a Dutch reporter based in Buenos Aires, Peter Schouten, went knocking on the door of the villa – and spotted a “for sale” sign.Old master painting looted by Nazis spotted in Argentinian property listingRead moreWhat followed, after Schouten and his colleagues in Rotterdam clicked on the link to the property and instantly recognised the work,made headlines around the worldas the story unfolded of the unlikely recovery of an 18th-century portrait missing for 80 years.“It’s very surreal – a little absurd, too,” Schouten said after a packed court hearing during which Kadgien and Cortegoso were charged with aggravated concealment for allegedly hiding Portrait of a Lady, by the late-baroque portraitist Giuseppe Ghislandi.The federal prosecutor, Carlos Martínez, told the court that the concealment charge “must be understood as linked to the crime of genocide … This is theft in the context of genocide. It is connected to the most serious crimes known to humanity.”A judge imposed a 180-day travel ban on the couple and barred them from leaving their home for more than 24 hours without approval as Martínez said the plundering of cultural assets “was part of a systematic plan … to enrich the Nazi regime and its members”.View image in fullscreenPatricia Kadgien attends a hearing on charges of concealment and obstruction of justicePhotograph: Jose Scalzo/ReutersAfter the media reports of the work’s likely location, and before a police search, the couple had tried to obstruct the investigation, the prosecutor argued, by taking down the online property listing and for sale sign andreplacing the portrait with a tapestry.Despite knowing they were under investigation, it was alleged that the defendants had also attempted a civil action claiming the painting was rightfully theirs, turning it over only after they wereplaced under house arrestand facing further police raids.Through their lawyer, Kadgien and Cortegoso have denied concealment, saying they had always been willing to hand over the painting, and obstruction, arguing that their civil action was aimed at establishing ownership and not at hiding the artwork.During a series of raids this week on properties owned by members of the Kadgien family, police seized engravings, prints, drawings and two 19th-century paintings, officials have said, with further charges likely if those works, too, prove to have been looted.Portrait of a Lady belonged to Jacques Goudstikker, a Jewish-Dutch art dealer who fled Amsterdam in mid-May 1940 to escape the Nazis, but died after falling through an open hatch into the hold of the SS Bodegraven, the ship carrying him to the UK.Goudstikker carried with him a notebook detailing his collection of more than 1,100 artworks, including pieces by Rubens, Giotto, Titian, Rembrandt and Van Gogh, all of which were snapped up for a fraction of their value by Nazi officials.Some were later recovered and displayed as part of the Dutch national collection in the Rijkmuseum, before 202 works were restored to the dealer’s sole heir, his daughter-in-law, Marei von Saher, in 2006. Portrait of a Lady was not among them.Chief among the buyers in a forced sale typical of second world war art thefts was Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, one of whose senior aides, in the early years of the war, was a 33-year-old official called Friedrich Gustav Kadgien.Born in 1907, Kadgien joined the Nazi party in 1932 and the SS in 1935. By 1938, he was a special representative working for Göring on the four-year economic plan drawn up by Adolf Hitler to rearm Germany and prepare it for self-sufficiency by 1940.A key player in the Third Reich’s foreign currency dealings, Kadgien was also, according to a 1996 Swiss report, “heavily involved in criminal methods for the acquisition of cash, securities and diamonds stolen from Jewish victims”.Kadgien “confiscated a large amount of property from Jewish merchants, including jewellery and diamonds in Amsterdam, and oversaw the sale of expropriated shares and securities through banks and front companies in Switzerland”, Martínez said.He fled to Zurich early in 1945, then to nearby Baden, where in 1948 he set up a successful finance and trading firm, Imhauka. With pressure growing after questioning by Swiss and US investigators, Kadgien left for South America in 1949.Thousands of Nazis fled to the continent after the war, settling in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay. With a few notable high-profile exceptions, most lived out their lives undisturbed, sometimes without even changing names.Kadgien resurfaced in Rio de Janeiro in 1951, settling in the Santa Teresa district and establishing a Brazilian branch of Imhauka with Ludwig Haupt, a former colleague from the four-year-plan, and Anna Imfeld, the wife of his Swiss associate.By whatever means it was acquired, his wealth was sufficient for him to invest in an 85,000-hectare ranch with 20,000 cattle. A Buenos Aires branch of Imhauka followed in 1951, and Kadgien – now Federico Gustavo – won Argentinian citizenship soon after.Imhauka secured valuable contracts with Juan Perón’s government, including acting as an intermediary for major German engineering firms such as Siemens, while a second company, Dryamin, launched in 1973, specialised in food and drugs.In the Argentinian capital, Kadgien married Hildegard Strauss, with whom he had Patricia and Alicia. He died, without being held accountable for his wartime and subsequent actions, in 1978 or 1979, and is reportedly buried in the German cemetery.Alicia became a model and is locally well known, unlike Patricia, whose unwanted fame is more recent. “If you hadn’t told me I would never have known,” a neighbour said. Another said she was being “held responsible for her father’s mistakes”.Even those sympathetic to her, however, admit it was strange that she did not hand over the painting immediately.The fate of Portrait of a Lady, which will be registered with Argentina’s supreme court, is now uncertain.Prosecutors have requested it be held, but not displayed, at the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires while its ultimate ownership is determined. This week von Saher, Goudstikker’s heir, lodged a legal claim to the work with the FBI in New York.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaAmericasNazismSecond world warArt theftArtnewsShareReuse this content"

The couple left for the United States, where they recently had a baby.Despite broad public support for changing the succession rules, away from the pageantry, people are focused on other issues such as rising inflation, royal historian Hideya Kawanishi said.“If people who are generally supportive [of female emperors] become a bit louder, then politicians can become more serious,” Kawanishi said.“But when ceremonies end, society, including the media, calms down and moves on.”Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

To his left stood North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, the supreme leader of an increasingly strident hermit kingdom. To his right was the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, Xi’s “old friend” and China’s biggest ally in opposing the US-led world order. The last time that the leaders of these three countries were together in public was at the height of the cold war.“Humanity once again faces the choice between peace or war, dialogue or confrontation,” the Chinese president told the gathered crowds. His insistence thatChinawould “adhere to the path of peaceful development” was punctured somewhat by the country’s biggest ever military parade that marched through the square beneath his rostrum atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace, the entrance to the Forbidden City that has – on and off – been the seat of Chinese power since the 15th century.Alongside Xi, Putin and Kim, a gaggle of global autocrats solemnly watched the display of Chinese military might.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin, Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which provided a forum for networking at a level normally seen only at the United Nations.Photograph: Suo Takekuma/ReutersThe same day, more than 5,000 miles away, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his allies assembled in Paris for a summit on the future of Ukraine, a country that has been racked by war since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. The “coalition of the willing”, led by the UK and France, did not include the US. The optics of the new global order could not be clearer: an anti-western bloc, helmed by China, on one side, and a western alliance of democracies, lacking its traditional leader in Washington, on the other.China’s military parade, in which more than 10,000 soldiers marched in unison alongside a sabre-rattling lineup ofnuclear-capable missiles and underwater drones, was designed to celebrate 80 years since the end of the second world war. The parade had two aims: to promote the Chinese Communist party’s narrative about its role in defeating the Japanese in 1945, and to display Beijing’s political and military might on the world stage in 2025. Both serve to underline the legitimacy and power of the party, helmed by Xi, at home and abroad.Faced with a challenging domestic economy and a bruising trade war with the US, the parade was also a chance for China’s 72-year-old leader to whip up nationalism and provide what some analysts say is a much-needed distraction from China’s problems at home.“This kind of event is never about building bridges,” said Yu Jie, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. “It is more about building a political theatre to tell your own version of the story.”View image in fullscreenThe ‘coalition of the willing’ gather in Paris for a summit on the future of Ukraine.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockIn Washington DC, there was a growing sense of unease as Xi feted the leaders of some of the world’s most notable pariah states, including Russia, Iran andNorth Korea– a trio of countries that, along with China, has been described as “the axis of upheaval”. It is a consolidation of alliances that has been accelerated by Donald Trump’s use of political and economic pressure against his friends and foes around the world.“It’s being perceived as an inflection point here in Washington, I think also in Europe too,” said Brian Hart, the deputy director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. Western governments are “seeing thatXi Jinpingis doubling down on his relationships with these countries, despite concern around the world”.Trump, who staged his own somewhat lacklustre military parade in Washington in June, quickly responded on social media.“May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, andKim Jong-un, as you conspire against the United States of America.”A Kremlin aide denied that any conspiring was taking place in Beijing. “No one has been plotting anything,” Yuri Ushakov said. “None of these three leaders had such a thought.”Still, the show of unity among countries broadly sceptical of the US could not have been clearer.While the concrete results of the parade and the ensuing meetings between the delegations were limited – and many analysts thought that any real agreements to collude among the US’s rivals would remain hidden – foreign policymakers such as the EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas warned in strident tones that the meeting was “an authoritarian alliance seeking a rapid process towards a new world order”.View image in fullscreen‘This kind of event is never about building bridges,’ said Yu Jie, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. ‘It is more about building a political theatre to tell your own version of the story.’Photograph: China News Service/Getty ImagesBut the “axis of upheaval” is riven by significant internal fractures, analysts said, and the propaganda effect may have been greater than the real threat to the international rules-based order.“People in the west are freaking out, as if there is something that’s really big and meaningful and there is this alternative world order and everything,” said Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “And I think that the major reason here is really the dysfunction brought into the western family by Donald Trump.”A Chinese academic, who asked to remain anonymous, also said that there were cracks in the seemingly robust anti-west alliances, particularly between the two most powerful members: China and Russia.China is “pretending to have a strong relationship with Russia to push back against pressure from the US and other western countries,” the academic said.“China says there is ‘no limits’ to its relationship with Russia, but in practice, it hesitates, constantly looking over its shoulder, wary of pressure from the west, the EU and Nato.”Although China has been criticised for providing economic and political support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, the academic noted that Moscow turned to Pyongyang, not Beijing, for extra boots on the ground. North Korea is thought to have supplied about 15,000 troops to the Russian armed forces – something thatPutin thanked Kim for in Beijing.Xi, thought to be keen to assert his dominance in the Russia-North Korea relationship, also held talks with Kim this week. The Chinese leader said China and North Korea were “good neighbours, good friends and good comrades”, according to North Korean state media.The parade came shortly after the annual Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit took place in Tianjin, a city that neighbours Beijing. The blandly named conference was another diplomatic coup for Beijing. Dozens of leaders travelled to China for the economic and security conference, which provided a forum for networking at a level normally seen only at the United Nations.Most notable among the guests was India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, whose own relationship with China has been frosty owing to a border dispute and trade spats. Days after being hit with US tariffs of 50% as a punishment for buying Russian oil, Modi was tweeting in Russian about his “excellent” meetingwith Putin in Tianjin.But this week was not just about diplomacy. It was also about guns.Wednesday’s parade was closely watched by military analysts for clues about the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s modernisation. China’s military uplift has in recent years made it a naval power and put it on track to be capable of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan and the potential war with the US that such an act might spark.View image in fullscreenSeveral newly developed weapons and aircraft were revealed during China’s military parade, including hypersonic missiles designed to take out ships at sea, underwater drones, and electronic warfare planes that can fly with fighter jets to track moving targets while also drawing away fire.Photograph: China News Service/Getty ImagesSeveral newly developed weapons and aircraft were revealed, including hypersonic missiles designed to take out ships at sea, underwater drones and electronic warfare planes that can fly with fighter jets to track moving targets for them while also drawing away fire. An unnamed aircraft that was eithera real or mocked up stealth drone fighteralso turned heads. Meanwhile, the appearance of new submarine-launched and road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles confirmed that China now has a solid and diverse delivery system for nuclear strikes – from land, air and sea.“Did we know China had a nuclear triad? Yes, we did. But, that image really brings it home,” said Jennifer Parker, an adjunct fellow in naval studies at the University of New South Wales, Canberra.“That capability sets China apart from other nuclear states, alongside Russia and the US.”Still, analysts noted that none of China’s shiny new weapons have been tested in combat.And diplomatically, Beijing still faces challenges. For all its talk of being a stable alternative to Washington, it’s economy is only 60% the size of the US, and its ongoing stability is reliant on agreeing a trade deal with Trump.“China is far from being able, or willing, to replace the US as a global public goods provider,” said Alicja Bachulska, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Nevertheless, it is willing to exploit the current situation to build its image as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the US under Donald Trump, and to capitalise on it.”Additional research by Lillian YangDressing to suit the occasionView image in fullscreenIt is a sure bet that Xi Jinping’s sartorial choice of suit was as carefully selected as the spotless uniforms of the president’s synchronised soldiers.Composite: EPA, Getty ImagesIn a show as tightly choreographed as China’s biggest ever military parade, it is a sure bet that Xi Jinping’s sartorial choice of suit was as carefully selected as the spotless uniforms of the president’s synchronised soldiers.Xi presided over the 50,000 spectators in Tiananmen Square in an instantly recognisable “Mao suit”, chosen to signal the leader’s frugality and revolutionary spirit.The simple, tunic-style jacket, with four pockets said to represent propriety, justice, honesty and humility, was first adopted by Sun Yat-sen, the nationalist revolutionary who helped to overthrow the Qing dynasty in 1911. Blending Chinese and western elements, the utilitarian jacket symbolised a rejection of imperial decadence. In Chinese, the suit is still known as a “Zhongshan suit”, after the name Sun is known by in China.But to the outside world the outfit is better known as the Mao suit. Chairman Mao Zedong wore one to declare the foundation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.View image in fullscreenPosters of Mao Zedong in Beijing, who wore a Mao suit to declare the foundation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.Photograph: Jade Gao/AFP/Getty ImagesSince then, the suit has gone out of fashion among the masses, but it is still the outfit of choice for Xi when he wants to project authority as the vanguard of China’s Communist revolution.The suit is “saturated [in] political meaning,” said Sari Arho Havrén, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. “It commemorates the revolutionary past of the Communist party” and “shows the separation from the west”.For day to day diplomacy, Xi tends to favour a western-style suit and tie. But for major events, such as when he attended astate banquet at Buckingham Palace in 2015, he dons the Mao suit.Amy Hawkins"

She responded by founding Sup and launching legal action accusing him of spreading conspiracy theories during the campaign.Fiame was elected as the country’s first female leader in 2021.

It came amidpublic criticismof the extension of the “longstanding collaboration”, in which the gas company supports the museum’s biodiversity research along the WA coastline.Woodside had launched an advertising blitz celebrating the continuation of the deal for a further five years, as the state reeled from a record-breaking marine heatwave thatkilled corals over a 1,500km stretch of ocean.Climate advocates criticised Coles’s email, with Bill Hare, a renowned WA-based climate scientist saying it was “disturbing” it contained “absolutely no expression of alarm or concern about the catastrophic bleaching of Western coral reefs, which is driven by fossil fuel emissions causing marine heatwaves”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailColes wrote to staff before a protest organised by climate activist groups for the open day, acknowledging staff might want to know more “or even be uneasy about our relationship with Woodside, given recent negative coverage” of the company’splans at Murujuga, including the provisionally approved extension of its North West Shelf processing plant to 2070.Coles said he guessed many within the museum saw the climate crisis “as one of the greatest existential threats, if not the greatest, facing our planet”, adding that it could only be addressed if “we understand the environment and the effects that human activity can have upon it”.He wroteWoodsidehad for 28 years supported the museum “to do just that by funding extensive marine biodiversity studies” that had contributed to an “extraordinary level of knowledge” about the region’s coastal species and ecosystems.“Obviously, if you accept the threat of human-induced climate change, which I suspect most people do, then burning fossil fuels is clearly a contributing factor, something, regrettably, almost all of us are guilty of in one way or another,” Coles wrote.WA government put ‘very rosy spin’ on report into Woodside emissions at Murujuga, scientist’s private email saysRead more“Arguments about the need, or not, for extended gas supplies are polarised, but what is pretty clear is that we cannot switch off fossil fuels overnight as there is no existing adequate replacement capacity.”Whether or not there was a need to continue gas production to 2070, he added, was something that “I, like most people, am not well enough qualified to comment on with any authority”.The WA Greens fossil fuels and climate action spokesperson, Sophie McNeill, who received a copy of the email, expressed concern that after the museum’s signing of a deal with the state’s biggest emitter, Coles’s email appeared to “put that climate guilt back on his employees” by focusing on their personal fossil fuel use.McNeill said that it was “shocking” for the museum head to say he was not qualified to comment on climate science and continued gas production while considering whether to extend a sponsorship from a major fossil fuel company.“He is the boss of hundreds of scientists and science educators,” she said. “It is completely pathetic for him not to be fully informed on the latest climate science.”Coles wrote in his email that the museum supported people’s right to protest peacefully at the open day and did not expect staff or volunteers to defend the museum’s decision, then sharing its public statement in response to criticism, which emphasised that “engaging constructively and transparently with industry” allowed WA Museum to expand knowledge of the state’s ecosystems.3:44A major decision on a Woodside gas plant's future hinges on WA rock art – video“Ultimately our intentions are just the same as the protestors: we want to save the planet. We just have different methods and different approaches,” Coles wrote.He told staff it was largely industry funding that made the museum’s research possible, and said the world-recognised and peer-reviewed work of the museum’s scientists was “never influenced by financial, political or ideological interests”.In a statement to Guardian Australia, a museum spokesperson reiterated this position, saying the museum “remains independent, science-led, and committed to the people and the environment of Western Australia”.They said the museum relied on “a diverse range of funding sources – including government, competitive research grants, philanthropic contributions, and corporate support” and that Woodside’s contributions had enabled scientists to survey “over half-a-million square kilometres of the Indian Ocean, leading to the discovery of no less than 700 species of animals and plants previously unknown to science”.Hare, however, said it was “a matter for serious concern that the head of a science based body is not aware of the science of climate change and how it is to be combated”.He said everyone in the field knewthe International Energy Agency positionthat no new fossil fuel resources should be developed if the world is to limit warming to 1.5C as set out in the Paris agreement.“It’s just basic logic extending a massive gas plant owned by Woodside until 2070 is completely inconsistent with that,” Hare said.The executive director of the Conservation Council of WA, Matt Roberts, said his organisation (which protested in August) acknowledged the “critical” importance of funding research, “but not when it’s a cynical exercise designed to buy social licence for one of Australia’s biggest polluters”.Woodside declined to comment.In a statement in August, the company said its ongoing collaboration with the museum had “significantly increased understanding of the marine environment of Western Australia”.Explore more on these topicsWoodsideWestern AustraliaFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

It will ensure koalas survive into the future so our grandchildren will still be able to see them in the wild.”Minns said the government had “listened carefully” during consultation on the park and would make sure “workers, businesses and communities are supported every step of the way”.The temporary logging moratorium was due to commence Monday and would remain in place until legislation was enacted to formally establish the park. This would happen after the government had resolved whether or not it could register a carbon credit project under a new method being considered by the Albanese government.The government said the new national park covered 21% of the forests in the north coast region and protection of the area would affect timber supply. It said the moratorium would have an impact on six timber mills and about 300 jobs.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAs part of a “comprehensive assistance” package for affected workers and businesses, the government said jobkeeper-style payments would support workers by covering their salaries, and financial assistance would be offered for businesses to put towards operating costs.The support package also included free mental health, financial and legal counselling services and training support for workers and their families.The government said it had contacted every affected mill and would begin discussions about long-term options for workers, endeavouring to support communities in the transition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its conservation status wasupgraded to endangered in 2022– meaning its trajectory had worsened – with habitat destruction and fragmentation identified as a major and increasing threat.The ACF analysis examined project approvals under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act that affect koala habitat. The nature group separately used state government land-clearing data in NSW and Queensland to calculate how much koala habitat had been cleared in those states from 2011 to 2023 – the most recent year for which data was available.A tree a minute for 24 hours: the young Victorian forest that was planted in a dayRead moreIt found 2,295,134 ha of bushland that was likely koala habitat – more than twice the size of greater Melbourne – had been destroyed in that period. More than 1.9m ha of that clearing was in Queensland. The ACF said 98% of the clearing had not been referred for any assessment for its environmental impacts under national law, with agriculture the biggest driver of the destruction.“The very law meant to protect nature is so poorly enforced that it has failed to stop nearly 2.3m hectares of likely koala habitat from being bulldozed and cut down,” Carruthers said.The analysis found native forest logging, particularly in NSW, was also contributing to koala habitat loss, with 391,170 ha of likely koala habitat destroyed by logging operations over the 12-year period.Carruthers said a forthcoming overhaul of the EPBC act “must set clear rules to protect habitat for threatened species like the koala, close loopholes that enable rogue bulldozers and establish an independent watchdog to enforce the law”.The environment minister, Murray Watt, has said the promised reformswill be put to the parliament this yearand that delay would hold up investment in projects and cause more environmental destruction.A2020 review of the EPBC Actby the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel found successive governments had failed to protect Australia’s unique species and ecosystems, which were in unsustainable decline.Dr Kita Ashman, an adjunct professor at Charles Sturt University, urged the government to adopt Samuel’s recommendation to abolish theeffective exemption from environment laws granted to all native forest loggingcovered by regional forestry agreements between the federal and state governments.“The way regional forests agreements operate under the EPBC Act is effectively as a backdoor for destructive practices like logging to continue with very little scrutiny,” she said.0:39Brush-tailed bettongs released into Mount Gibson sanctuary – video“If we remove this loophole, it will mean climate refuges and places that are critical for the survival of the species will remain intact.”A spokesperson for the federal environment department said all projects referred to the government were assessed on a “case-by-case basis” and developers were required to demonstrate they had avoided and mitigated potential damage to the environment to the greatest extent possible.“The Australian Government is committed to strengthening and streamlining our national environmental laws and establishing a national environment protection agency (EPA),” they said.“One of the key pillars of the new laws will be stronger environmental protection and restoration including through introducing new national environmental standards. These standards will improve environmental protection and guide decision making.”They said Watt was consulting extensively ahead of the reforms, which would deliver “a balanced package of changes, based around the recommendations of the 2020 Samuel Review”.The spokesperson said the federal saving koalas fund had invested more than $76m in koala conservation measures.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeDeforestationTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

But they shouldn’t be.There has indeed been a well publicised surge in net overseas migration since late 2022.But those getting angry over migration aresuffering from recency bias, and ignoring the 18 months before when more people left our shores than arrived.Taking in the entirety of the pandemic and its aftermath, we can see that net overseas migration over the past five years is not much larger than it was in the five years leading up to the outbreak of Covid in early 2020.Graph showing net overseas migration over the five years to December is only 141,000 high than in the previous five-year periodSome seem to be blaming migrants for unaffordable homes; that ignores the fact that property prices were going bananas when the international borders were closed.Indeed, the housing crisis isdecades in the making.And if you look at the jobs market, there’s no evidence that migration has been too high: unemployment has remained low at a bit over 4% and the workforce participation rate (67%) is near record highs.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailEmployers are still complaining of chronic skills shortages, not least in the trades we need to build more homes, which is the actual solution to cheaper housing.Australia has benefited and continues to benefit hugely from migration, in tangible and intangible ways.But with all that said, we are entitled to ask our leaders: what’s the plan?We might agree that the peak annual net migration rate of more than 500,000 in September 2023 was too high, buthowdo we know that? And what should it be?In other words: what does a well-reasoned migration program look like, one that matches our need for skilled workers with our capacity to house and service a growing population?Housing crisis. We could fix it easily we just don’t want to! It would make us very unpopular with people like us | First Dog on the MoonRead moreOn this, the government is silent.Labor in August 2023 committed to working with the states to develop a comprehensive, “principles-based” plan around the number of permanent settlements “to ensure migration meets the local needs of communities across the country”.We’ve seen nothing since.Instead, after anti-immigration protests, the minister for home affairs, Tony Burke, rushed outa three-line press releasestating the permanent migration cap in 2025-26 would be the same as last year: 185,000.When it comes to the more important net overseas migration figure, Jim Chalmers has made it clear that this “isn’t a government policy or a government target”.“It’s not a floor or a ceiling. It’s not something that the government determines,” the treasurer said in May 2023.Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of the immigration department before it was absorbed into home affairs, reckons that’s not good enough.Rizvi believes the lack of a clear migration plan has created a vacuum, allowing misinformation and extremist views to flourish.“We need something that resembles a plan. One that makes sense and ministers are willing to explain to the Australian public,” he said, adding that it can’t be limited to permanent migration.“But they (the government) consistently have backed off doing that.”Terry Rawnsley, an urban economist at KPMG, agrees that it would be a “very smart idea” to have a more scientific approach to net migration – one that balances the economic benefits of migration with our capacity to house and service these additional people.Rawnsley said one option would be to target a range for annual net overseas migration, in a way similar to how the Reserve Bank targets inflation, and to revisit the target.The targeted range could be something like 250,000 to 350,000, for example.“We need aged care workers, and care workers, and IT workers, and we can think through those numbers and then triangulate that with what’s coming through the pipeline in the housing system.”The government has funded and supported institutions to provide the data we would need to start developing a more scientific approach to net migration in this country.For example, Jobs and Skills Australia creates detailed lists of skill shortages, while the new NationalHousingSupply and Affordability Council publishes an annual “state of the housing system” report.Of course it wouldn’t be easy, but Rizvi and Rawnsley reckon it is eminently doable.Politically, it would require some bravery.But a reasoned and transparent approach to migration could be an antidote to the politics of division and grievance that threatens to undermine what has long been one of Australia’s greatest strengths.Explore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumHousingAnthony AlbaneseLabor partyAustralian politicsAustralian economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

In the end, the film directed by Tunisia’s Kaouther Ben Hania took the runner-up Silver Lion.Divided into chapters set in New Jersey, Dublin and Paris, Father Mother Sister Brother features an ensemble cast including Tom Waits, Adam Driver, Mayim Bialik, Charlotte Rampling, Cate Blanchett, Vicky Krieps, Indya Moore and Luka Sabbat. Ina four star review, the Guardian’s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw described it as “a film to savour”.“All of us here who make films, we’re not motivated by competition. But this is something I truly appreciate, this unexpected honour,” said Jarmusch, who made his name in the 1980s with offbeat, low-budget works such as Stranger Than Paradise and Down by Law.Elsewhere, Italy’s Toni Servillo was named best actor for his wry portrayal of aweary president nearing the end of his mandate in La Grazia, directed by his longtime collaborator Paolo Sorrentino. China’s Xin Zhilei won best actress for her role in the Sun Rises on Us All, a drama directed by Cai Shangjun that delves into questions of sacrifice, guilt and unresolved feelings between estranged lovers who share a dark secret.‘Humanity is facing a reckoning’: Venice shrugs off the glamour to take aim at politicsRead moreThe Venice festival marks the start of the awards season and regularly throws up big favourites for the Oscars, with films premiering there over the past four years collecting more than 90 Oscar nominations and winning almost 20. It has often been seen as the most glamorous and least political of the major film festivals, but in 2025 the movies that made the strongest impact focused on current events, with the ongoing Israeli invasion of Gaza casting a long shadow.As he unveiled his picture last weekend, Jarmusch acknowledged that he was concerned that one of his main distributors had taken money from a company with ties to the Israeli military.The Voice of Hind Rajab, which uses the real audio of a young girl’s desperate pleas for help as her car comes under Israeli gunfire, was the fan favourite,winning a record 23-minute standing ovationat its premiere.The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw saidit was “a fierce, vehement piece of work”.In her acceptance speech, Ben Hania said: “Cinema cannot bring Hind back, nor can it erase the atrocity committed against her. Nothing can ever restore what was taken, but cinema can preserve her voice, make it resonate across borders.“Her voice will continue to echo until accountability is real, until justice is served.”The best director award went toBenny Safdie for the Smashing Machine, which starred Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson in the role of the real-life mixed martial arts pioneer Mark Kerr. Safdie said: “To be here amongst the giants of the past and the giants here this year, it just blows my mind.”The special jury award went to Italy’s Gianfranco Rosi forhis black-and-white documentary Below the Clouds, about life in the chaotic southern city of Naples, marked by repeated earthquakes and the threat of volcanic eruptions.Among the movies that left Venice empty-handed were a trio of Netflix pictures: Kathryn Bigelow’s nuclear thriller A House of Dynamite, Guillermo del Toro’s retelling of Frankenstein and Noah Baumbach’s comedy-drama Jay Kelly. No Other Choice by South Korea’s Park Chan-wook also failed to secure an award, despite strong reviews, likewise Bugonia by Yorgos Lanthimos, which starred Emma Stone.In the press conference following the ceremony, reporters expressed surprise that the Voice of Hind Rajab had been passed over for the Golden Lion. Jury president Alexander Payne said in response: “As a jury, we treasure both of those films equally, each for its own reason. And we wish both of those films a long and important life, and we hope that the support of the awards we’ve given tonight will help them, each in its own way.”Payne also denied claims that a juror threatened to quit over the awards, saying: “One of my jurors threatened to quit? … No. I think we know … not to believe everything we read online.”Explore more on these topicsFilmVenice film festivalJim JarmuschCate BlanchettAwards and prizesIsrael-Gaza warItalynewsShareReuse this content"

The GPIAAF said the two investigations were entirely independent of each other and it will publish a preliminary report into the accident within 45 days.Investigators had already announced that 11 foreign nationals were among the fatalities. Three Britons, two South Koreans, two Canadians, one Frenchwoman, one Swiss, one American and one Ukrainian were identified among the victims.The families of a British couple killed, Kayleigh Smith, 36, and William Nelson, 44, paid tribute to them and said they were “heartbroken”. In a statement issued by police on Saturday, Smith’s family said: “Kayleigh was loved by family and friends for her wit and humour, her kind and caring nature came to the fore in her work as a funeral operative.“She was also a talented theatre director and had just completed a master’s degree. They both leave family and friends heartbroken.”In the same police statement, Nelson’s brother, who was not named, said: “Words cannot begin to describe how our family and friends are feeling right now but here is the best attempt. This week, due to a tragic accident in Lisbon, Portugal, we lost Will Nelson, who was not just my big brother but everyone’s.“He was always kind, selfless, and protective, and the world does not feel right or normal without him.

I did what I could to recognise my wife because she was only bones … It’s a tragedy.”The Greek-born pharmacist, who met the Briton when both were university students in Germany 36 years ago, said he would be pressing charges against local authorities because of the way they had handled the case.“The investigation was not conducted properly. I have already filed a complaint against the police and the coastguard because they were criminally slow in dealing with my wife’s disappearance. Valuable time was lost and she could still be alive.”It had, he said, taken police three hours to write up a missing person’s report.The Glasgow-born mother of one was last seen on 1 August lying on a lounger on the popular beach of Ofrinio, near the northern city of Kavala, before her husband, who had nodded off on an adjacent sunlounger, awoke to find her missing.Images captured on CCTV showed the couple enjoying crepes at a beach cafe hours earlier. “Unfortunately, I fell asleep first, and when I woke up, she wasn’t there,” the 66-year-old said.View image in fullscreenAn image published by the Greek TV station ANT1 of Michele Bourda and her husband, Christos, on the beach.Photograph: ANT1Her remains were eventually found more than 25 miles (40km) along the coast. The couple, who lived inScotland, had arrived in Greece on holiday three days earlier.Bourda had a history of depression, according to Christos. But he said she was in good spirits on the day of her disappearance, and had left her personal belongings, including her medication and towel, on the lounger.Several hours later the alert was raised and the search began. But the pharmacist, who was quick to tell police that his wife had disappeared once before in the UK, after becoming despondent when she had lost her job at BT, claims that he spent much of the first day frantically looking for her on his own.“The police didn’t do anything,” he said. “One person who was there said she didn’t see any police that day either, not one single policeman at the beach. The only thing I saw was a police car driving up and down the road to the beach. Not getting out of the car, just looking in the direction of the sea.”A Greek missing persons charity, Lifeline Hellas, issued a silver alert stating her life was “in danger” and mobilising Greek authorities when it became clear she could not be found.At first the search focused almost exclusively on the sea, with the Hellenic coastguard sending out two patrol boats. Private recreational craft and five fishing boats also scoured the waters, extending rescue efforts across the entire Strymonian Gulf.When, after three days, the operation failed to yield results, the Greek police force took over, focusing their search inland.“After so many days, it’s really unusual that nothing should be found,” a coastguard official said at the time. “Protocol dictates that the police now assume responsibility for the search.”Rescue efforts intensified on 10 August, when a specialist missing persons team arrived from Athens with three sniffer dogs. “They were here for 15 days,” said Evangelos Kollias, spokesperson for the police force in Komotini overseeing the inquiry.“The scenario that she walked away was actively being examined. We had police officers out on foot and in patrol cars with drones and dogs looking for the missing woman. We had vowed to continue the search efforts until she was found.”Officials now believe that Bourda probably drowned and that her body was pushed by strong currents along the coast before it was discovered on the privately owned island. The results of an autopsy conducted by pathologists on Friday have yet to be announced.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropeScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Pictures byJulia KochetovaSat 6 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShare“It’s more exhausting,” says Afer, a deputy commander of the “Da Vinci Wolves”, describing how one of the best-known battalions inUkrainehas to defend against constant Russian attacks. Where once the invaders might have tried small group assaults with armoured vehicles, now the tactic is to try and sneak through on foot one by one, evading frontline Ukrainian drones, and find somewhere to hide.Under what little cover remains, survivors then try to gather a group of 10 or so and attack Ukrainian positions. It is costly – “in the last 24 hours we killed 11,” Afer says – but the assaults that previously might have happened once or twice a day are now relentless. To the Da Vinci commander it seems that the Russians are terrified of their own officers, which is why they follow near suicidal orders.View image in fullscreenAt the command centre of the Da Vinci Wolves battalionView image in fullscreenAt the command centre of the Da Vinci Wolves battalionReconnaissance drones monitor a burnt-out tree line west of Pokrovsk; the images come through to Da Vinci’s command centre at one end of a 130-metre-long underground bunker. “It’s very dangerous to have even a small break on watching,” Afer says, and the team works round the clock. The bunker, built in four or five weeks, contains multiple rooms, including a barracks for sleep. Another is an army mess with children’s drawings, reminders of family. The menu for the week is listed on the wall.It is three and a half years into the Ukraine war and Donald Trump’s August peace initiative has made no progress. Meanwhile the conflict evolves. Afer explains that such is the development ofFPV (first person view) drones, remotely piloted using an onboard camera,that the so-called kill zone now extends “12 to 14 kilometres” behind the front – the range at which a $500 drone, flying at up to 60mph, can strike. It means, Afer adds, that “all the logistics [food, ammunition and medical supplies] we are doing is either on foot or with the help of ground drones”.View image in fullscreenHeavy machine guns near the temporary base of the Da Vinci battalionFurther in the rear, at a rural dacha now used by Da Vinci’s soldiers, several types of ground drones are parked. The idea has moved rapidly from concept to trial to reality. They include remotely controlled machine guns, and flat bed robot vehicles. One,the $12,000 Termit, has tracks for rough terrain and can carry 300kg over 12 miles with a top speed of 7 miles an hour.Termit land drones equipped for cargo, assault and mine layingView image in fullscreenUkrainian defence ministry photograph of its Termit drone.Land drones save lives too. “Last night we evacuated a wounded man with two broken legs and a hole in his chest,” Afer continues. The whole process took “almost 20 hours” and involved two soldiers lifting the wounded man more than a mile to a land drone, which was able to cart the victim to a safe village. The soldier survived.While Da Vinci reports its position is stable, endless Russian attempts at infiltration have been effective at revealing where the line is thinly held or poorly coordinated between neighbouring units. Russian troops last month penetrated Ukraine’s lines north-east of Pokrovsk near Dobropillya by as much as 12 miles – a dangerous moment in a critical sector, just ahead of Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska.At first it was said a few dozen had broke through, but the final tally appears to have been much greater. Ukrainian military sources estimate that 2,000 Russians got through and that 1,100 infiltrators were killed in a fightback led by the 14th Chervona Kalyna brigade from Ukraine’s newly created Azov Corps – a rare setback for an otherwise slow but remorseless Russian advance.MapThat evening at another dachaused by Da Vinci, people linger in the yard while moths target the light bulbs. Inside, a specialist drone jammer sits on a gaming chair surrounded by seven screens arranged in a fan and supported by some complex carpentry.It is too sensitive to photograph, but the team leader Oleksandr, whose call sign is Shoni, describes the jammer’s task. Both sides can intercept each other’s feeds from FPV drones and three screens are dedicated to capturing footage that can then help to locate them. Once discovered, the operator’s task is to find the radio frequency the drone is using and immobilise it with jammers hidden in the ground (unless, that is,they are fibre optic dronesthat use a fixed cable up to 12 miles long instead of a radio connection).“We are jamming around 70%,” Shoni says, though he acknowledges that the Russians achieve a similar success rate. In their sector, this amounts to 30 to 35 enemy drones a day. At times, the proportion downed is higher. “During the last month, we closed the sky. We intercepted their pilots saying on the radio they could not fly,” he continues, but that changed after Russian artillery destroyed jamming gear on the ground. The battle, Shoni observes, ebbs and flows: “It is a war of drones now and there is a shield and there is a sword. We are the shield.”View image in fullscreenOleksandr, call sign Shoni, having a break at the kitchenA single drone pilot can operate 20 missions in 24 hours says Sean, who flies FPVs for Da Vinci, for several days at a stretch in a crew of two or three, hidden a few miles behind the frontline. Because the Russians are on the attack the main target is their infantry. Sean frankly acknowledges he is “killing at least three Russian soldiers” during that time, in the deadly struggle between ground and air. Does it make it easier to kill the enemy, from a distance? “How can we tell, we only know this,” says Dubok, another FPV pilot, sitting alongside Sean.Other anti-drone defences are more sophisticated. Ukraine’s third brigade holds the northern Kharkiv sector, east of the Oskil River, but to the west are longer-range defence positions. Inside, a team member watches over a radar, mostly looking for signs of Russian Supercam, Orlan and Zala reconnaissance drones. If they see a target, two dash out into fields ripe with sunflowers to launch an Arbalet interceptor: a small delta wing drone made of a black polystyrene, which costs $500 and can be held in one hand.View image in fullscreenBuhan, a pilot of the drone crew with the Arbalet interceptor at the positions of the 3rd Assault Brigade in Kharkiv regionView image in fullscreenArbalet interceptors at the dugout of the 3rd Assault Brigade in Kharkiv regionThe Arbalet’s top speed is a remarkable 110 miles an hour, though its battery life is a shortish 40 minutes. It is flown by a pilot hidden in the bunker via its camera using a sensitive hobbyists’ controller. The aim is to get it close enough to explode the grenade it carries and destroy the Russian drone. Buhan, one of the pilots, says “it is easier to learn how to fly it if you have never flown an FPV drone”.It is an unusually wet and cloudy August day, which means a rare break from drone activity as the Russians will not be flying in the challenging conditions. The crew don’t want to launch the Arbalet in case they lose it, so there is time to talk. Buhan says he was a trading manager before the war, while Daos worked in investments. “I would have had a completely different life if it had not been for the war,” Daos continues, “but we all need to gather to fight to be free.”So do the pilots feel motivated to carry on fighting when there appears to be no end? The two men look in my direction, and nod with a resolution not expressed in words.Explore more on these topicsUkraineDrones (military)EuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The situation is horrific,” Ingram added.Gaza City, once a busy commercial and cultural hub, is now the target of a new Israeli offensive which threatens to displace its million or more estimated inhabitants. Israeli officials have described the city as a “bastion” of Hamas.Israel’s military has ordered Palestinians to leave the city for the south before the assault, but has given no timeline for the offensive, which it has previously indicated would not be announced in advance.The offensive threatens to displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians weakened by nearly two years of bombing, malnutrition, and now famine. Many will previously have been displaced, some repeatedly, and some Gaza City residents have said they will refuse to endure it again.In May, Israel eased a two-month total blockade on supplies entering Gaza but supplies remain inadequate.UN agencies are working to overcome massive logistical difficulties, continuing Israeli restrictions and bureaucratic obstacles to supply a small number of community kitchens and bakeries, while private commercial trucks transport limited quantities of rice, sugar, instant noodles and other dry foodstuffs. Fresh vegetables are rare and cost as much as $50 (£37) for a kilo, a price few can afford.“The story is the same – a bowl a day from the community kitchen, almost always lentils or rice, shared among the family, parents skipping so children can eat. No nutrients. No other options – aid is scarce, and the market is far too expensive,” said Ingram.View image in fullscreen‘It is crystal clear that people are starving, that there is a famine unfolding in Gaza City, and Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis are not far behind,’ a Unicef spokesperson has said.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesResidents have described being faced with an “impossible choice”: to remain in makeshift homes in Gaza City and hope to survive a possible Israeli onslaught or flee to massively overcrowded coastal areas where there is little space and almost no services, water supplies or health provision.Aid workers in al-Mawasi, the main coastal zone designated by Israel for those fleeing Gaza City, say hundreds of thousands of displaced people are already packed on to its sandy dunes and fields. A tent-sized plot on any land that remains clear costs the equivalent of $300 per month and there is little room for new arrivals.Graph showing hospital admissions for malnutrition“Water supply is insufficient, the tents and shelters are very flimsy, there’s no garbage or solid waste disposal to speak of, no shade and no room for anyone else already … It’s totally unfit for human habitation even now,” said one aid worker in al-Mawasi.Israeli officials blame the UN for failing to distribute aid and have repeatedly claimed Hamas is stealing much of the assistance, though aninternal US government reportsaid this was not true.Last month, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a globally recognised organisation that classifies the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition, found three key thresholds for famine had been met in Gaza City.Children are among the most vulnerable. From 2,000 in February, enrolments in Unicef clinics in Gaza for under-fives with acute malnutrition had risen to 5,500 in May. In July, the total reached more than 13,000.The number of under-fives screened by Unicef went from 82,000 to 144,000 over the period.Hospital admissions for the most life-threatening cases of severe acute malnutrition rose from 20 in March to 40 in July, though this was down from a peak of more than 50 in June. Outpatient cases increased from 380 in March to 2,846 in July, of whom 1,248 were in Gaza City.View image in fullscreenPalestinian children queue to receive a hot meal from a charity kitchen in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesDespite opposition from within the military high command, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, remains committed to the new offensive. Wide gaps remain between Israel’s demands and those of Hamas, and any ceasefire currently looks unlikely.Far-right members of the ruling coalition have threatened to bring down Netanyahu’s government if Israel makes concessions to bring back about 50 hostages still held in Gaza, of whom fewer than 20 are thought to be alive.On Friday, Israel’s military announced in a statement it would target a range of structures identified as being used by Hamas, particularly tall buildings.“In the coming days, the [Israeli military] will strike structures that have been converted into terrorist infrastructure in Gaza City: cameras, observation command centres, sniper and anti-tank firing positions, command-and-control compounds,” the statement said.Last week, officials said Israel would stop airdrops over Gaza City in the coming days and reduce the number of aid trucks arriving in the north as the new offensive ramps up and preparations are made to order hundreds of thousands of people south.The UN and partners have said the pauses, airdrops and other measures fell far short of the 600 trucks of aid needed daily in Gaza.The current war started aftera Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023which killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and led to 250 being abducted. The Israeli offensive that followed has killed more than 63,000, mostly civilians, and destroyed much of Gaza.Clea Skopeliti contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warFamineIsraelPalestinian territoriesMalnutritionMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

By Wednesday, many woke to find their fears realised as the worst floods in more than three decades ravaged their farms and decimated their livelihoods.Hundreds of thousands of acres of bright green rice paddies – due to be harvested imminently – as well as crops of cotton and sugar cane were left destroyed as they became fully submerged in more than five feet of muddy brown flood waters. The bodies of drowned cattle littered the ground.“The crops are ruined, and even our homes are in danger of collapsing,” said Parmpreet Singh, 52, a farmer from Ajnala in Amritsar district, Punjab. His family, including his elderly mother and two young children, were now living on the roof of their house to stay safe from the murky flood waters.“My entire livelihood depends on my seven hectares of farmland, all of which has been destroyed by flood waters,” he said, despairing that his only option left would be to sell his land and abandon farming. “I had already invested most of my money into seeds and fertilisers for the previous crop. Now everything is gone.”‘The water left nothing’: Pakistan’s Punjab province reels from deadly floodsRead moreWhile monsoon season usually brings heavy rain, the extreme levels of rainfall that fell across northern India this week caused untold damage in Punjab, resulting in flash floods and swollen rivers breaching their banks and overflowing into fields and villages. So far, 43 people have lost their lives and almost 2,000 villages in the state have been affected, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without electricity and access to clean water. The stench of rotting animal carcasses hangs over many villages.View image in fullscreenRescue workers evacuate people affected by rising flood waters in Multan district, Punjab province, Pakistan.Photograph: Mansoor Abbas/EPA“This is the worst time Punjab has ever faced,” said Parminder Singh Pinki, a lawmaker from Firozpur district in western Punjab, one of the areas badly hit by floods.“I have never witnessed such devastation in my lifetime. Entire farmlands are submerged under water, now layered with mud and sand.”India’s farmers have already faced mounting hardship, with millions saddled with high debts, low incomes and heavy crop losses in the face of increasingly extreme and unpredictable weather conditions brought on by the climate crisis.Pinki was among those who accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, led by Narendra Modi, of negligence towards farmers and simply abandoning them to their fate during this year’s extreme monsoon.“The government had been aware for months about the weather forecasts and should have put proper measures and emergency responses in place,” he said. “But that never happened, and this failure has led to destruction on such a massive scale.”He was echoed by Surinder Singh, 75, a farmer from Sarala Kalan village in Patiala. For days, he had watched the canal near to their village getting higher and higher, but had been powerless to stop it.“The government will make promises of relief, but the farmers will end up receiving nothing,” he said. “In the end, we are left to take care of ourselves.” Like many, he questioned the long-term viability of Indian agriculture, which employs half the country’s workforce and keeps food on the country’s tables.“I cannot imagine what is left for our future generations,” he said. “Floods and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, and the future does not look any better. If the farmers of Punjab – the food bowl of India – cannot even feed themselves, how will they feed others?”View image in fullscreenGovernments in India and Pakistan have been criticised for their inadequate response as villages across the region are submerged.Photograph: Mansoor Abbas/EPAThis crisis has not been India’s alone. Across the border, in Pakistan’s agriculture-heavy province also called Punjab, the devastation caused by floods has been even more catastrophic, with almost 2 million people evacuated and about 4,000 villages submerged in flood waters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

There is flood water everywhere now. This is not the fault of India; it was [Pakistani] Punjab government negligence which swept away my farmland,” he said.He added: “This is not only my story – our farmers have been witnessing the worst time in the country’s history.”0:54Pakistan’s Punjab province hit by 'biggest flood in its history' – videoIt was not only farmland that was affected. Residents of the highly affluent housing development Park View Society in Lahore, recently constructed just a few hundred metres away from the bank of the Ravi, also found their multimillion-rupee homes filled with murky flood water. Experts said that rapid deforestation and development along the waterways was only worsening the likelihood of floods in the area.Umar, a resident who moved to the development this year, said his home had been filled with five feet of river water. “Many of us have invested our life savings in buying or constructing a dream house here,” he said. “But how could they be allowed to build it if it is at such risk of flooding?”Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the chief minister of Pakistani Punjab, who is also the niece of Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, was accused of doing little to help those affected by the flooding. In a social media post, she highlighted how portable toilets were being installed at a relief camp to help the displaced – however, the image she shared was revealed to be from two years ago.Explore more on these topicsIndiaFloodingPakistanSouth and central AsiaExtreme weatherFarmingClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers are also close to agreeing a returns deal with Germany, having already secured one with France, the Daily Telegraph reported.One government source said “nothing is off the table” for Mahmood as she assumes her new brief, which puts her in charge of borders and asylum policy. She has previously signalled a willingness to look at reform of the European convention of human rights within domestic law.It comes after the prime minister carried out a major reshuffle including wide-ranging changes at theHome Officeas he seeks to tighten his grip on immigration and draw a line under Angela Rayner’s resignation.The chief secretary to the prime minister, Darren Jones, earlier denied that the government was in crisis and insisted Starmer now has the “strongest team” in place around the cabinet table following Rayner’s departure.The most significant moves as Starmer reshuffles cabinet after Rayner exitRead moreHe ruled out the prospect of an early election amid opposition claims that the upheavalcould open splits within Labourand collapse the prime minister’s authority.Speaking to broadcasters on Saturday, Jones dismissed suggestions that the rejig could delay the Starmer’s self-described “phase two” of government by moving senior figures to unfamiliar briefs.“It’s not instability insofar as the outcomes that we’re delivering are the same,” Jones, who is also the newly appointed chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, told BBC Breakfast.He rejected the ideaYvette Cooperhad been moved out of the Home Office because she was failing to control immigration, adding she would be “brilliant” in her new role as the UK’s top diplomat.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumLabourShabana MahmoodYvette CooperHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Despite being seen as one of the architects of Labour’s “new deal for working people”, Madders’ departure was not formally announced in No 10’s list of appointments. Instead, he revealed the news himself.“It has been a real privilege to serve as minister for employment rights and begin delivering on our plan to make work pay,”he said on X. “Sadly it is now time to pass the baton on – I wish my successor well & will do what I can to help them make sure the ERB is implemented as intended.”Madders’ removal, along with Rayner’s forced departure from her two government positions and post as Labour’s deputy leader, removes the key figures who helped design Labour’s employment rights bill – a policy unions praised as the government’s most ambitious commitment to workers’ rights in decades. However some within government have rowed back on this notion, insisting Starmer remains committed to the bill, describing it as good for business, workers and the economy – a central plan to make people better off.Starmer will also not attend this year’s TUC conference, a decision that has intensified concerns and rumours among unions and some inside Labour that the government is distancing itself. Rayner was the cabinet minister closest to the unions, and Madders had been given the job of turning the new deal into legislation.View image in fullscreenJustin Madders, one of the first junior ministers sacked on Saturday, was seen as one of the architects of Labour’s ‘new deal for working people’.Photograph: Mark Kerrison/AlamyPeter Kyle, a close ally of Starmer, was promoted to lead the business department on Friday, meaning he will oversee the employment rights brief.Allies of Rayner who remain in government believe a fight is looming over workers’ rights. With Rayner and Madders gone, they believe Kyle has the ability to water down the bill – a package they feel many from the centre of the party were never comfortable with. The issue is likely to become factional, given polls show stronger employment protections remain popular with voters flirting with Reform UK.The package had promised sweeping reforms including day one rights for workers, a ban on zero-hours contracts and stronger protects against fire-and-rehire. A union chief told the Guardian: “Rayner was the closest minister to the unions and her team have played an important role in pushing key parts of the employment rights bill through government.“The commitment to the bill is there from Keir so I’m less worried about that, but more worried about the broader sense of who actually understands the unions, and has the personal relationships.”Ellie Reeves has been shifted from her role as party chair to solicitor general and will no longer attend cabinet. She has been replaced by Anna Turley. Georgia Gould, from Labour’s 2024 intake, has been promoted to education minister. Abena Oppong-Asare, meanwhile, has been appointed as one of Starmer’s parliament private secretaries – a key role linking with the parliamentary Labour party.Ian Murray, who had been announced as leaving government on Friday night, has also made a comeback as a joint minister across the culture and science departments.For Starmer, the cabinet reshuffle was about showing decisive leadership in the midst of a major crisis, to which as his chief secretary, Darren Jones, alluded. But this junior reshuffle for many shows a broader ideological return that sees the government more cemented under centrist control, and potential fights with the unions along the way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mahmood, the new secretary of state, will lead a refreshed team that now includes Sarah Jones, a former shadow minister who has long wanted to return to the brief. As shadow policing minister, insiders have praised her for her work on pushing Labour’s agenda on knife crime, launching and chairing the APPG group that published investigations linking the issue to youth services and school exclusions.She will be joined by Mike Tapp from Labour’s 2024 intake, who takes up a ministerial role in the Home Office. Tapp represents a Reform-facing seat and his promotion is being read as Starmer’s attempt to toughen up Labour’s image on crime and immigration. Louise Sandher-Jones, another 2024 MP, has also been appointed as a minister of defence, underlining a new generational shift Starmer is keen to showcase in his new team.Dame Diana Johnson has been replaced by Sarah Jones and will now serve as a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, while Dan Jarvis will remain a minister in the Home Office and has also been made a Cabinet Office minister.Jason Stockwood, the former chair of Grimsby Town football club, will take a seat in the House of Lords to become investment minister as part of Starmer’s ministerial shake-up. He was Labour’s candidate for Greater Lincolnshire mayor but was beaten by Reform’s Andrea Jenkyns.The local government minister Jim McMahon has been sacked and will return to the backbenches, along with Maria Eagle, the defence minister. Catherine McKinnell resigned as minister of state for school standards, which included overseeing Send reform. She said she declined the opportunity to stay in government.Darren Jones dismissed the idea that Rayner’s departure could expose divisions within the Labour party, after Nigel Farage said “splits” will open.Explore more on these topicsLabourWorkers' rightsTrade unionsKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

At the previous major demonstration last month, 532 people were arrested for taking part. Participants gathered in Parliament Square by 1pm, many holding signs that read: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”At just after 9pm, the Metropolitan police said it had made more than 425 arrests. The Met’s deputy assistant commissioner, Claire Smart, who led the operation, said: “In carrying out their duties today, our officers have been punched, kicked, spat on and had objects thrown at them by protesters. It is intolerable that those whose job it is to enforce the law and keep people safe – in this case arresting individuals committing offences under the Terrorism Act – should be subject to this level of abuse.”Earlier, Defend Our Juriesrespondedto a similar claim by the police, saying officers “violently [assaulted] peaceful protesters including the elderly, in order to try and arrest over 1,000 people for holding cardboard signs” and shared a video of officers shoving people to the ground.A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries said: “Despite Mark Rowley insisting the police could and would arrest everyone who opposed the ban, it would take them another 36 hours to arrest everyone at this rate. Yvette Cooper launched the biggest attack on our civil liberties in living memory, and it has backfired spectacularly. Now Yvette Cooper is no longer home secretary, the ban must go with her.“This shows the new home secretary on her first day in office that the Palestine Action ban is impossible to enforce and a preposterous waste of resources. The terrorism laws were not designed to be wielded against a domestic protest group, or to arrest thousands across civil society for holding cardboard signs.”The demonstration remained largely peaceful, though there were frantic scenes on the outskirts of the square throughout the afternoon. Officers drew their batons during clashes and forced their way through crowds carrying arrested protesters. One protester was seen with blood streaming down his face, while several others were knocked to the ground in a crush.Police began making arrests shortly after the demonstration began. Officers faced chants of “shame on you” when taking two elderly people using mobility scooters into police vans.Steve Masters, 55, was among those taking part. “I’m here because I oppose genocide and I also oppose the government’s overreach in proscribing Palestine Action,” he said. “They’ve lowered the bar of what terrorism is and almost made it meaningless.”View image in fullscreenSteve Masters at the protest on Saturday. ‘While unpleasant, destruction of property to most people is not terrorism,’ he said.Photograph: SuppliedHe served in the RAF as an aircraft technician for 19 years and took part in the protest while wearing his four service medals. “As somebody who was in the air force, attacking an air force jet is not something that I would do,” he said. “While unpleasant, destruction of property to most people is not terrorism. They’re not going out to explicitly harm people. It’s a travesty of justice.”Protesters who signed up for Saturday’s demonstration wereinstructedto withhold their details from officers to force en masse processing at police stations, which organisers said would make it “practically impossible” to arrest everyone.Masters said he planned to withhold his details, meaning he would need to be transported and processed in a police station to complete his arrest. He said officers were in a “difficult position and I don’t envy them, but I also don’t have any sympathy for them either. They could stand there and say no. It takes moral courage because they may lose their jobs, but where is the red line?”Judith Gradwell, 80, who also held a sign that read, “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action”, is unafraid of being arrested. “It doesn’t matter, I’ve got my sandwiches in my backpack,” she said.Gradwell also plans on withholding her details from officers. She called the government’s decision to ban Palestine Action “ridiculous”, adding: “You would think after the Iraq war that they’d listen a bit more to what people on the streets were saying.”In the 1970s, she protested against the Vietnam war outside the US embassy in London. “I thought the world would be a better place by now but it isn’t,” she said. “It’s a much worse place.”View image in fullscreenJudith Gradwell, 80, called the ban on Palestine Action ‘ridiculous’.Photograph: Sammy Gecsoyler/The GuardianAnne Karpf was in Parliament Square to support those taking part. “I think it’s very moving and, if I didn’t have caring responsibilities, I’d be in there holding a sign myself,” she said, standing under a banner that said, “Holocaust survivor descendants against Gaza genocide”.Karpf said her mother was a survivor of Auschwitz and her father was a survivor of Russian labour camps. “What they would be thinking, seeing what is happening now and being done in their name. I feel pretty certain that they would be horrified,” she said.She called the proscription of the group “wrong on every single front” and an “outrageous curtailment of civil liberties”.View image in fullscreenAnne Karpf (third from left) called the proscription of the group an ‘outrageous curtailment of civil liberties’.Photograph: Sammy Gecsoyler/The GuardianAmnesty International said the arrests showed that “something is going very wrong here in the UK”.Kerry Moscogiuri, director of campaigns for the organisation, said: “Let’s be clear, it is disproportionate to the point of absurdity to treat people sitting peacefully in a group holding signs in support of Palestine Action as ‘terrorists’. Any restriction on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly must be lawful, necessary and proportionate to achieving a legitimate aim.“Criminalising speech in this context is only permitted when it incites violence or advocates hatred. Expressing support for Palestine Action does not, in itself, meet this threshold.”Mike Higgins, 62, a blind man who uses a wheelchair, whose arrest was seen by millions on social media, also returned. He was arrested at the demonstration last month, which hesaid“starkly highlights what an absolute waste of time” the proscription of Palestine Action was for the state, taxpayers, police resources and, “most importantly, [for] Palestine and defending the people of Palestine, because that’s actually what this is really about”.View image in fullscreenMike Higgins during his arrest on 9 August.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianSaturday’s demonstration has been the busiest by far. Hundreds of supporters gathered in Parliament Square and the anti-abortion group March for Life, set up a stage nearby with a sound system that occasionally blasted out music.Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionUK security and counter-terrorismnewsShareReuse this content"

The vaccine is a safe and effective way to protect against the infection and prevent serious symptoms.”There had been speculation at the conference from early morning that Malhotra would make the comment in his speech.A known vaccine sceptic, Malhotra had been listed in the conference programme as speaking on the topic “Make Britain Healthy Again”, a slogan borrowed from the Trump administration. Doctors had urged Farage in advance of the speech not to give him a platform.Malhotra had garbled the name of the oncologist who he cited in his speech. However, in the past hehas used X to linkto an interview with TalkTV in which Angus Dalgleish, an oncologist, linked Covid jabs to cancer.There was no immediate comment from Buckingham Palace, which first announced the king’s cancer diagnosis in February 2024. The Princess of Wales, Catherine, announced her cancer diagnosis in March 2024.View image in fullscreenKing Charles was revealed to be undergoing treatment for cancer in February 2024.Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty ImagesMalhotrahas long beena vocal figure for hesitancy about Covid vaccines, claiming they pose a greater threat than the virus itself – a view repeatedlydebunked by factcheckers.In his speech on Saturday, he referred to findings that were aired on a show presented by Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Trump. At the end of his speech, he went on to claim that the general public were being misled and that Covid vaccines had been responsible for killing and injuries.Malhotra had appeared on Friday at theReform UKconference at a fringe panel to discuss free speech, where calls were made for Britain to withdraw from the World Health Organization.The speech was one of a number of incidents that threatened to generate negative headlines over the course of a two-day conference where Reform, leading Labour and Tories in the polls, tried hard to project an image of professionalism.Signs that the party was managing to court acceptance in corporate sectors included the presence of a Heathrow International Business Lounge, along with a small number of diplomatic delegations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Previous schisms have emerged over its approach to Tommy Robinson’s supporters, while the party’s erstwhile MP for Great Yarmouth Rupert Lowe and its former deputy leader Ben Habib are among those who are now fervent critics of Farage outside the party.Farage used his closing speech on Saturday to appeal to Reform members to settle disputes in private. He asked: “Can we please exercise discipline and air our disagreements between each other in private?”However, Malhotra’s speech was not the only one to mark a descent into culture-war controversy that critics have long warned make Reform an unserious proposition for government.Earlier Sarah Pochin, the MP for Runcorn and Helsby, who has previously called for the burqa to be banned in Britain, told the conference she wanted to arrive on stage in a turquoise version of the Islamic headdress. She said the party’s deputy leader Richard Tice had said no to this.The MP was at the centre of a row in Reform UK this year when she called on the prime minister to ban the burqa and was later accused by then Reform chair Zia Yusuf of asking a “dumb” question as it was not party policy.Pochin also told members she would “not be silenced” by a new Islamophobia definition introduced by the government saying she would “see you in jail” if a new law on the issue was passed.The comments came in reference to a working group, led by the former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, which was set up earlier this year by Angela Rayner to provide recommendations on how to tackle anti-Muslim hatred in Britain, including whether to create a new definition of Islamophobia.The conference also ended with an appearance on stage by Lucy Connolly, the former childminder who was jailed after last year’s riots for a social media post calling asylum seeker hotels to be torched.Connolly said she would “love” to work with the party in the future, receiving cheers from the audience as she revealed she voted for them at the last election.There were no further high-profile defections from the Conservative party. The former Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told a fringe gathering at the conference that his teenage daughter, Mary, had joined Reform UK and that he was “having my arm twisted” by her to follow suit.Explore more on these topicsReform UKMonarchyCoronavirusVaccines and immunisationnewsShareReuse this content"

One of the sources told the Times that Patriot 2.0 was focused on targeting immigrants who had been released from custody despite Ice agents attempting to pick them up from local jails.It was not immediately clear how many federal officers were involved in the crackdown, which comes asChicago bracesfor a Trump administration ramp-up of deportations in the third-largest US city.NBC10 Boston quoted a statement from a DHS spokesperson as deriding the Boston mayor Michelle Wu’s so-called sanctuary policies.“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens. ICE is arresting sex offenders, pedophiles, murderers, drug dealers, and gang members released by local authorities,” the statement reported by NBC10 said.Tensions between Wu and the Trump administration have been steadily building since March when Wutestifiedbefore Congress alongsidethree other Democratic mayorsto defend their cities’ immigration policies – specifically so-called sanctuary city laws thatlimit state and local law enforcement cooperationwith federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).Critics of these policiesclaimthat sanctuary laws undermine federal law enforcement’s ability to arrest and deport individuals with criminal records.As part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, it has pushed for mass deportations and targeted “sanctuary cities” in particular.Wu has defended her city’s policies in a letter to US attorney general Pam Bondi: “The City ofBostonis the safest major city in America,” she wrote. “Our progress is the result of decades of community policing and partnership between local law enforcement and community leaders, who share a commitment to making Boston a safe and welcoming home for everyone.”In response, the acting Ice director, Todd Lyons, said that the agency intended to “flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions”.As the threat of federal actions looms, Wu said last week that her administration was actively preparing for the possibility of a federal national guard deployment.Wu also said her administration was reviewing relevant legal precedents and working “very closely” with community members “to ensure people know what’s happening and that this is not something that is needed or wanted or legally sound”.Anna Betts contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsMassachusettsIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

For example, he has revoked the security clearances and details of some people in theBiden administrationand of peoplewho servedin hisfirst administrationwhom he deemed “bad” or “disloyal”; blocked somenews organizationsfrom the Pentagon workspace and White House press pool; and revoked security clearances of – and investigated –law firmsthat were “very, very dishonest”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTom HanksUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

Organizers decided to cancel El Grito Chicago, an event that drew 24,000 people last year, and was scheduled for 13-14 September.“It was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake – and that’s a risk we are unwilling to take,” theevent’s websitestated. “While we’re torn by this decision, when we brought this celebration back, our aim was to create a safe, affordable, family-friendly, community festival for all.”The anxiety in the country’s third-largest city comes after Trump deployed national guard troops toLos AngelesandWashington DC.Contrary to the president’s assertions, Chicago is not among the country’s most dangerous cities, and the number of homicides decreased from last year to this year, theGuardian reported.Illinois had about 550,000 unauthorized immigrants in 2023, according to thePew Research Center. The governor,JB Pritzker, said that he was concerned about Ice agents targeting attendees at the Mexican Independence Day events.“We have reason to believe that Stephen Miller [the White House deputy chief of staff] chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,”Pritzker said at a news conference.In addition to El Grito, the Mexican Independence Day parade and festival in the suburb of Waukegan was postponed until November, and the Latin Heritage Fest in Wauconda was canceled, a localFox affiliatereported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The factory manufactures batteries to power Hyundai, Kia and Genesis electric vehicles.The company asked those currently on business there to return to Korea immediately and said its executive would travel to the US on Sunday in response to the arrest of its staff.The raid is the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which was created in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001terrorist attackson the US in New York and Washington DC.Although US immigration officials on Friday said there had been 475 arrests, the Korea Economic Daily earlier reported that about 560 workers at the Hyundai facility and LGES, had been detained, citing unidentified industry sources. Hyundai Motor is a South Korean car company but has many international operations.The raid on Thursday dealt a setback to the company’s substantial project in Georgia and was a dramatic iteration of theTrump administration’s harsh crackdown on immigrants in the US.The facility is part of what would be the biggest industrial investment in the state’s history and had been hailed as a huge boost for the economy by Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp.From Uncle Sam to social media memes: inside homeland security’s push to swell Ice ranksRead moreThe raid showed the disruptive impact thatDonald Trump’s mass deportation agenda is having on businesses, even as the White House tries to spur more inflows from foreign investors.An agent at the DHS said multiple federal agencies, including Ice, the FBI and the DEA, “conducted a judicially authorised enforcement operation, as we are actively conducting an investigation into unlawful employment practices”.“Arrests are being made,” Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of homeland security investigations for Georgia, said in a news briefing.A South Korean government official said those arrested were being held at an Ice detention facility.The factory is a joint venture between the South Korean battery maker LGES and Hyundai Motor and was due to start operations at the end of this year, according to LGES.The arrests could exacerbate tensions between Washington and Seoul, a key ally and investor in the US. The countries have been at odds over the details of a trade deal that includes $350bn of investments. At a summit last month, South Korea pledged $150bn in US investments, including $26bn from Hyundai Motor.A spokesperson at the Hyundai-GA battery company in Georgia said in a statement that it was cooperating fully and that it had paused construction work.DHS officials said the workers who were arrested were barred from working in the US after crossing the border illegally or overstaying visas, following an investigation lasting several months.A Hyundai Motor spokesperson said none of the people detained was employed directly by the automaker, which complied “with all laws and regulations wherever we operate”.Hyundai Motor also said its production of electric vehicles at the sprawling site was not affected.The workers were being held at Ice’s facility in Folkston, Georgia, Schrank said.In 2023, Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution (LGES) announced the $4.3bn venture to produce EV battery cells, with each company holding a 50% stake.The battery factory is part of Hyundai’s $12.6bn investments in Georgia, including the automaker’s just-opened car factory, in what would be “the largest economic development project in the state’s history” and is part of a bigger investment in US industry by the South Korean company,announced in Marchas Trump was ramping uptariffs.Social media video footage showed a man wearing a vest with the letters HSI, an acronym forhomeland security investigations, telling workers in yellow safety vests: “We have a search warrant for the whole site. We need construction to cease immediately. We need all work to end on the site right now.”Trump has said he wants to deport “the worst of the worst” criminals, but Ice figures have shown a rise in non-criminals being picked up. Rights advocates have denounced such raids.While HSI led the raid, federal officers were assisted by the Georgia department of public safety and state troopers, according tolocal media.Dozens of warehouse workers detained in New Jersey immigration raidRead moreMeanwhile in upstate New York, another Ice raid took place at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners facilities near Syracuse, where snack bars are made at a family-owned concern, drawing anger from the state governor.Officers forced entry to the industrial facility and detained dozens of workers.“I am outraged by this morning’s Ice raids in Cato and Fulton, where more than 40 adults were seized, including parents of at least a dozen children at risk of returning from school to an empty house,” Kathy Hochul, New York’s Democratic governor, said in a statement released by her office.“I’ve made it clear, New York will work with the federal government to secure our borders and deport violent criminals, but we will never stand for masked Ice agents separating families and abandoning children,” she added.The immigrant advocacy group Rural & Migrant Ministry said on Facebook that it estimated more than 70 workers had been arrested.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationGeorgiaIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)South KoreaAutomotive industryMotoringElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsnewsShareReuse this content"

This time, the No 1’s nerves perfectly held up under pressure as she maintained her composure during a late surge from Amanda Anisimova before closing her US Open title defence with a 6-3, 7-6 (3) win.US Open tennis 2025: Aryna Sabalenka v Amanda Anisimova, women’s singles final – liveRead moreAs the best player in the world at the peak of her powers, Sabalenka continues to establish herself as one of the greatest players of her generation. She has now won four grand slam titles, drawing level with Kim Clijsters, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, Naomi Osaka and Hana Mandlikova. Sabalenka has established an era of dominance on hard courts, earning her four major titles with an equal share of victories at the Australian and US Open. She has now also reached six consecutive grand slam finals on hard courts.Eight weeks after being overpowered by Anisimova in their semi-final match at Wimbledon, Sabalenka played a smart match, maintaining pressure on Anisimova with her first strike tennis but also playing with greater margin than her opponent and making use of her more well-rounded game. Most importantly, she kept her cool even when the match became complicated at the end.“I think because of the finals earlier this season, this one felt different,” said Sabalenka. “This one felt like I had to overcome a lot of things to get this one. I knew that the hard work we put in, like, I deserved to have a grand slam title this season. So when I fell, it was like truly emotions, because it means a lot to defend this title and to bring such great tennis on court. And to bring the fight and be able to handle my emotions the way I did in this final, it means a lot. I’m super proud right now of myself.”From the beginning, both players made it clear that in a match between two of the most lethal shotmakers in the sport, nothing but the most fearless and clear-headed attacking tennis would be sufficient. After a nervous start, Anisimova worked her way into the match with the destructive ball striking off both wings that guided her through immense wins over Iga Swiatek and Naomi Osaka this week. However, under pressure on such a significant occasion and against an ultra-focused Sabalenka who pummeled her second serve, served well enough in key moments and offered few unforced errors, Anisimova was felled by her own mistakes.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka drops her racket in delight after winning the final.Photograph: Elsa/Getty ImagesDeep in the second set, Anisimova was finally granted a lifeline. With Sabalenka two points from victory on her serve at 6-3, 5-4, the Belarusian showed her nerves at 30-30 by completely misjudging a straightforward smash, slamming it into the net. Anisimova snatched the lead immediately, pounding a forehand winner to take the break before rolling through her subsequent service game.This could have been the moment she began to fall apart, all of her painful memories from this season rushing back. Instead, Sabalenka refused to let her emotions get the better of her and she closed out her fourth grand slam title with a faultless tie-break. Remarkably, Sabalenka has now won the last 19 tiebreaks she has played, a run that dates back to February.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sabalenka had entered the final convinced she was mentally and physically ready for any challenge that came her way. Instead, she fell apart mentally on the court and then lashed out afterwards in the press room, which became a source of shame as well as disappointment. Sabalenka also lost to Madison Keys in the Australian Open final.“After those two finals where I completely lost control over my emotions, I just didn’t want that to happen again,” said Sabalenka. “There were a few moments when I was this close to just let it go. I was like ‘C’mon now, you have to stay focused. Keep going, keep trying.’” It’s really helped me. I think I have to keep the same mindset every time - hopefully I’m going to make many more finals - so every time I’m in the final, I have to stick to the same plan.”On another enormous occasion against an American opponent, the New York crowd desperately cheering for her downfall all evening, Sabalenka put herself back together under some of the most challenging circumstances possible, pulling off a victory that may well guide her to even greater successes in the future.Having given herself another shot at a grand slam final at the next possible occasion after her 6-0, 6-0 defeat to Iga Swiatek at Wimbledon, this time Anisimova played a competitive match and fought hard at the end, but she was simply too erratic against the best player in the world. As Sabalenka entered her player box in the crowd to embrace her loved ones, a tearful Anisimova was comforted in her chair by the tournament director Stacey Allaster. “I think I didn’t fight enough for my dreams today,” Anisimova said.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Aryna SabalenkaUS Open tennisUS sportsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The 2-0 loss against the Taeguk Warriors on a steamy and damp evening at Sports Illustrated Stadium may have provided US head coach Mauricio Pochettino with valuable new insights about his additions to the US player pool, as he said was his goal for this international window. It may have confirmed pre-conceived theories about which players from an MLS-heavy roster can make the step up to the international level. It may have done none of those things. Whichever way, it certainly served as a continuation of a malaise for a team that desperately needs to break out of its slump just 279 days before hosting the first game of a home World Cup that is meant to be transformative.There was no such malaise for South Korea, even with head coach Hong Myung-bo under heavy criticism at home for the team’s recent stale performances. The capacity crowd in Harrison, New Jersey certainly had something to do with that apparent rejuvenation, with the vast majority cheering for the visitors – a fact that may appear surprising until you consider the town is just down the way from Fort Lee, home to a growing South Korean diaspora. The nation’s traditional “Daehan minguk” chants broke out more than 20 minutes before kickoff, and continued throughout as wild cheers accompanied every thrust from Hong’s counterattacking side.Steely and strangely divisive, Michael Bradley’s playing career cut to the id of US soccer fandomRead moreThe US can reasonably expect more favorable crowds at a homeWorld Cup, but they’ll hope to leave the form they showed on Saturday far behind. Pochettino’s side started decently, and had the better of play through much of the opening 15 minutes. But as it was in a similarly experimental game against Turkey earlier this year, initial flashes did not pan out into anything positive over the 90 minutes.Asked afterward when it was time to start turning his ongoing evaluation of the US program into results, Pochettino said: “When the World Cup starts.”Pochettino said there were numerous examples of teams that won plenty heading into World Cups that disappointed once there, using his experience as a player on the 2002 Argentina team taht exited the 2002 World Cup in the group stage as an example. Pochettino promised that the team would be ready and in top form come the World Cup opener, but it was hard to see on Saturday how a lackluster performance against the Korean would lead to that.Key among the side’s failings was a lack of communication in defense. Tristan Blackmon, the 29-year-old debutant who was one of a couple surprise inclusions in Pochettino’s squad, was at the center of a few of them, but no US player was immune. Time and again, players as experienced as Tyler Adams, Tim Ream, and Sergiño Dest were scrambling to catch up with a Korea team that seemed one step ahead throughout.As was suspected, Son Heung-min began the game in a relatively new role as the Taeguk Warriors’ starting striker. The newly signed LAFC man made it clear that he can be a difference maker in that position – scoring the game’s opening goal in the 18th minute in what was a crystal clear example of both US disjointedness and South Korean verve. With the US flat-footed and with huge gaps within and between the midfield and defensive lines, Son read the situation, parked himself in between Ream and Blackmon, got the ball, turned, and made no mistake with his finish.“I thought we started the game in a very positive way, but we conceded in a way we should not concede,” Pochettino said. “We worked this week not to give a player like Son the possibility to run. We were so passive to provide the space to score.”For the second goal, Son was played through on a simple give-and-go at the top of the box, and slipped past Ream and Blackmon to poke the ball away from the onrushing goalkeeper Matt Freese. Lee Dong-gyeong’s flicked finish was far from simple and well-executed, but the circumstances that led to it were hard to fathom from a team hoping to make noise on the world’s stage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just six minutes after conceding, Christian Pulisic and Adams left large gaps in the Americans’ shape by sprinting to the same spot, where Korea cut off access to both with a well-coordinated high press that eventually forced Freese into one of several close-call clearances on the night.South Korea did make mistakes of their own, but the US repeatedly failed to capitalize. In the 27th minute, a sloppy giveaway while playing out of the back put the combination of Diego Luna, Josh Sargent, Pulisic and Tim Weah in on goal. They couldn’t find a decent window on goal though, and Weah’s effort was saved.“Overall, I think we we re better than South Korea, but in the end, if you are not clinical … it’s difficult,” Pochettino said afterward. “If we put the result to another side, I am so pleased with the way that we are evolving.”Pochettino opted to make a rash of subs in the 61st minute, bringing on Alex Freeman for Dest, Chris Richards for Weah, Folarin Balogun for Sargent, and Cristian Roldan for Adams. Along with those introductions came a shift in formation, from a back four to a back, five with Freeman and Max Arfsten pushing forward on either touchline.The US do not often play with a back five, and neither have most of Pochettino’s sides throughout his time as a manager. On this occasion, a few more scoring chances did follow the shift, though it’s difficult to say if the new arrangement or the US’s increasing desperation was to thank for the improvement.It culminated in a couple of chances that were inches away from breakthroughs. In one, a set-piece fell to Richards, who looked like the central defender he is, as the ball ricocheted off his thigh and into the grateful arms of goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo. In another, Jo was the hero again, saving two consecutive point-blank efforts from Balogun before the striker had a third bite of the cherry, putting his final effort off the crossbar. Balogun was put through on goal again in the game’s dying moments, and Jo saved again.Missed chances, big and small, continue to follow this team as their moment in the spotlight looms, increasingly ominously.Explore more on these topicsUSASouth KoreaUS sportsWorld Cup 2026World Cupmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Part three in New York could be another classicTumaini Carayolat Flushing MeadowsSat 6 Sep 2025 13.13 EDTLast modified on Sat 6 Sep 2025 13.45 EDTShareOn a tranquil evening in Manhattan last week,Carlos Alcarazwas making his exit from an Italian restaurant with his sizeable support team when he unexpectedly found himself staring at a familiar face. There was Jannik Sinner, quietly enjoying his own dinner. This was the second occasion during the US Open Alcaraz and Sinner just so happened to be dining at the same restaurant at the same time. Neither player could hide their amusement as they greeted each other warmly.Considering the frequency of their meetings it would not be unreasonable if they were starting to get sick of each other: “On court we like to see each other, because it means that considering our ranking, we are doing well in the tournament,” said Sinner.” Off court we bump into each other at times. I don’t know if we are happy or not.”Once body-shamed by the USTA, Taylor Townsend became the US Open’s people’s champ | Andrew LawrenceRead moreThere is at least one more meeting to come in New York. The first US Open final of their rivalry also represents a historic moment. It is the first time in the Open era that two men have faced each other in three grand slam finals in one season, and in consecutive major tournaments. It also marks their fifth consecutive final, their most recent meetingcoming in Cincinnati last month, when Sinner retired trailing 5-0 due to illness. As if the stakes are not already high enough, Sinner’s ranking is also on the line. If Alcaraz wins, he will replace the Italian as the world No 1.Not only are they so much better than the rest, but the gap is widening. While the Alcaraz-Sinner era had long been under way, with the two splitting all four major titles between them in 2024, until June they had not faced each other in a grand slam final.After they faced each otherin the final of the Italian Open,Sinner’s comeback tournament from his three-month doping ban,a rematch at the French Openseemed likely.At Wimbledon, it was difficult to envision anything other than another final between them.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz, who is yet to drop a set at the US Open, celebrates during his semi-final against Novak Djokovic.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockBy the US Open, though, while they had six matches to win and the difficulty of navigating a grand slam draw should never be underestimated, this final seemed inevitable barring injury. It has made for an odd tournament over the past few weeks, with so much anticipation of this match from the first round.A month after Alcaraz demonstrated his peerless ability to produce his best in the most difficult moments by plotting one of the greatest comebacks of all time at Roland Garros, Sinner’s revenge win at Wimbledon broke a run of five victories for Alcaraz and showed Sinner a blueprint for success.The Italian suffocated Alcaraz with his destructive, relentless ball-striking off both wings. He also served well and kept Alcaraz’s offensive return position at bay by injecting more pace into his second serve. The Spaniard admitted he had been outplayed. He did not have enough time on the ball to disrupt Sinner’s game.It is for this reason that, although grass courts are supposed to be Alcaraz’s turf in this rivalry and Sinner has begun an era of dominance on the surface, Alcaraz may come to prefer facing Sinner on a medium-hard court. In addition to having slightly more time on the ball, this surface aids his kick-serve and the heavy topspin on his forehand, which are essential to his aim of constantly varying the trajectory of the ball to disrupt Sinner.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final this year, the Spaniard’s only loss since April.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAAt Wimbledon, under such suffocating pressure on the baseline, Alcaraz’s serve let him down. In New York, his improved serve has been one of the key reasons why he has been able to roll through the field, reaching a grand slam final without dropping a set for the first time. It is obvious he will need to serve extremely well against the most effective returner in the game. Every match is an opportunity to adjust and it remains to be seen what Alcaraz has learned from his most recent defeat.View image in fullscreenJannick Sinner is one of the most effective returners in the game.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockThree years on fromAlcaraz’s 2:50am, five-set winover Sinner after saving a match point, an instant classic that positioned this rivalry as the future of the sport, the pair will close that circle in New York.As they walk down the tunnel and on to the court at Arthur Ashe Stadium, it is worth sparing a thought for others. After years of being punching bags for Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer it was believed the demise of the big three would lead to a transitional era where, at least for a short time, many more would have the chance to win the biggest titles.Instead, two new legends have emerged and though they are adversaries on the court they have also conspired to ensure nobody else has a chance.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Carlos AlcarazJannik SinnerUS sportsUS Open tennisTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As records fell in a blur of speed at Monza, the world champion was perhaps the most unlikely victor after an impossibly tight contest.The transformation since the 2024 Italian GP could not have been more stark. Over a tumultuous 12 months Verstappen has clung on toseal his fourth title last season, seen long-term Red Bullteam principal Christian Horner be sackedand the team comprehensively out-paced by McLaren. Here, they at last found a sweet spot that has been sorely lacking.Max Verstappen qualifies in pole position for Italian Grand Prix ahead of Lando Norris – live reactionRead moreIn beating the two McLaren title contenders, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, into second and third, Verstappen was immense. Both conceded they had been fairly bested at a track where last season an angry Verstappen described his car asan “undriveable monster”as he qualified seventh and finished sixth.TheRed Bullhas not traditionally been strong on the high-speed challenge of Monza where around 70% of the 3.6-mile circuit is taken at full throttle. Yet on Saturday in the Lombardi sunshine it was barrelling around the track with abandon in Verstappen’s hands.His final lap, with a time of 1 minute 18.792 seconds, was the fastest in F1 history, averaging more than 164.46mph and breaking Lewis Hamilton’s record set here in 2020.Quick GuideItalian F1 GP qualifying timesShow1Max Verstappen (Ned)Red Bull 1:18.792,2Lando Norris (GB)McLaren 1:18.869,3Oscar Piastri (Aus)McLaren 1:18.982,4Charles Leclerc (Mon)Ferrari 1:19.007,5Lewis Hamilton (GB)Ferrari 1:19.124,6George Russell (GB)Mercedes GP 1:19.157,7Andrea Kimi Antonelli (It)Mercedes GP 1:19.200,8Gabriel Bortoleto (Br)Kick Sauber 1:19.390,9Fernando Alonso (Sp)Aston Martin 1:19.424,10Yuki Tsunoda (Jpn)Red Bull 1:19.519,11Oliver Bearman (GB)Haas F1 1:19.446,12Nico Hulkenberg (Ger)Kick Sauber 1:19.498,13Carlos Sainz Jr (Sp)Williams 1:19.528,14Alexander Albon (Tha)Williams 1:19.583,15Esteban Ocon (Fr)Haas F1 1:19.707,16Isack Hadjar (Fr)RB 1:19.917,17Lance Stroll (Can)Aston Martin 1:19.948,18Franco Colapinto (Arg)Alpine 1:19.992,19Pierre Gasly (Fr)Alpine 1:20.103,20Liam Lawson (NZ)RB 1:20.279Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I think that final lap was pretty decent and to get pole here for us is big,” he said. “It’s not always been a good track for us, especially last year was quite a bit of a disaster, so this year much better and very happy to be first.”It was a day when the form book was being largely ignored as Ferrari, at their home race, also found another gear. Hamilton, on his debut for the Scuderia at Monza was greeted with an immense roar that echoed across the Parco di Monza as he emerged onto the track when the session opened and by its close he and teammateCharles Leclercwere in the mix at least, claiming fourth and fifth, although Hamilton will start in 10th,having incurred a five-place grid penalty at the Dutch Grand Prix.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen enjoys his performance after taking pole in Italy.Photograph: Kym Illman/Getty ImagesFourth and fifth is not whereFerrariwant to be but the fact that Hamilton and Leclerc were within two-tenths of the front will be taken as a positive result.Hamilton had also been enjoying the experience of his first Italian GP as a Ferrari driver. “So far, it has been incredible, amazing. I don’t know what other word I can find for it,” he said. “The Tifosi are everywhere, they are hiding behind trees. There are so many of them. As you leave the track they are on both sides as far as you can go and it is incredible to see the love that people have for this team. There is nothing like it.”The margins were tiny and the top spot was briefly in the hands of each of the frontrunners, only for Verstappen to come through at the last to clinch pole, a remarkable effort in a car that is not ordinarily able to compete with the dominant McLarens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pole was Mekies’ first as Red Bull team principal since he took over after the British Grand Prix and since which Verstappen has put an end to speculation surrounding his future by confirming he would definitely be driving for them next year, even if he did not go as far as saying he would stick out his contract to 2028.‘Living the dream’: Hamilton savours first Italian GP in Ferrari coloursRead moreCertainly the matter is closed for the moment at least, as he looks to focus on pulling off something of a coup against McLaren on Sunday. It will remain no little task to keep them behind him but the pace is potentially there to do so.For Norris, however, the fight is surely with his teammate more than the Dutchman. He did at least put himself ahead of Piastri, a vital moment for his title hopes given he trails the Australian by 34 points in the championship, afterhaving to retire at the last round in Zandvoort.Their battle endured its own moment of high drama when Norris had a real scare in Q2. He was too eager in to turn one and had to abort his first hot lap. He went out again and without a time, had to stay out and complete a sequence of one hot lap and two cool down laps before crossing the line at the very last to start a final quick run, which proved just enough to see him safely through to Q3. Starting 11th would have been another hammer blow to his title chances but the British driver held his nerve and the fight, likely a humdinger, goes on to Sunday.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenLando NorrisOscar PiastriCharles LeclercLewis HamiltonMcLarennewsShareReuse this content"

Then my Buffalonian boyfriend’s family brought me into the fold – and I discovered how failure, fandom and community intertwineFrancesca CaringtonSat 6 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 6 Sep 2025 04.04 EDTShareOn 14 October 2024, having never supported a team before, or, to be honest, especially liked sports at all, I became aBuffalo Billsfan. I’d been going out with my Buffalonian boyfriend for more than a year, which I think in his parents’ eyes meant my introduction to the team that animates their entire hometown was overdue. They drove down to New York City, kitted me out in a Bills baseball cap, hoodie and blanket (and plastic Bills bag to hold it all in) – and took me to a game.I thought I’d seen enough Super Bowls to know I didn’t care about football, but wrapped in that staticky blanket, one of the few spots of Buffalo blue in a snake-green sea of Jets supporters at MetLife Stadium, I realized what I’d been missing: a team. Or more specifically:thisteam.NFL 2025 season predictions: will it be Mahomes, Jackson or Allen in the Super Bowl?Read moreIn Buffalo, the Bills are everywhere. I used to find this bewildering on my trips up to western New York (never call it upstate); now I find it comforting. Signs saying “Billieve” welcome you into people’s houses; babies wear Bills onesies; coats, T-shirts, jewellery and underwear all feature the team’s chic streaking buffalo. Even in the off-season, a car’s horn tooting “Let’s go Buffalo!” can set off canon of identical beeps from nearby vehicles. “Go Bills” means both hello and goodbye, sometimes even the last goodbye, as I discovered in a local cemetery, where a grave featured the phrase as an epitaph. I’m sure it’s not the only one.That’s because the BillsareBuffalo. They’re the spirit of the city, and for many Buffalonians, a metaphor for it too. Buffalo’s boom times are long behind it, though the architectural marvels built by the money flowing through the Erie Canal speak to its former importance as an industrial hub. The city is generally depicted as hard on its luck, featuring in the news usually only when there’s a disaster, like theshooting of 10 Black people in 2022, or the more recentbus crash that killed five. But what that narrative misses is the story of a town that’s quietly been undergoing an economic and cultural revival thanks to significant public spending and committed local preservationists.Buffalo’s state of almost-thereness is reflected back to it by its beloved home team, who’ve gotso closebut never quite secured the win. There were the devastating four Super Bowl losses in a row from 1991 through 1994, then a play-off drought that lasted for nearly a generation. The Bills kept inching ever closer to Super Bowl greatness, their efforts turbocharged by Josh Allen, the NFL’s reigning MVP and widely considered one of its best quarterbacks. “You have to be pretty tough in a place like this,” Allenhas saidof his adopted hometown. “We feel like we have guys in this locker room that maybe haven’t gotten all the recognition they deserve, coming here on the last leg of their career and just coming here trying to prove something to not just the world but to themselves.”View image in fullscreenBuffalo Bills have long been known as among the NFL’s most passionate.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesThe Bills are no hardscrabble minor team – next year they’ll move into a new$2.1bn stadium– but this kind of underdog tale is addictive. It’s a story of hard work and capability, of striving for something that’s always just out of reach. When the Kansas City Chiefscrushed the Bills’ dreamsin last season’s AFC Championship Game, I almost felt the whole city’s heart breaking.But here’s the thing: failure bonds people, and there’s nothing like rooting for a losing team to glue a community together. The immense positivity required to defend a team – or a town – you love when it’s on the back foot can be an irresistible draw. You’ll find none of the hauteur of the fans of a winning team up in Buffalo. I’ve yet to attend one of their legendary tailgates outside the stadium – I’ll admit that I’m somewhat scared of doing so, having seen thevideos of fanshurling themselves around trying to break tables – but you needn’t look far to see their dedication. When one of Buffalo’s regular snowstorms roll around, Bills fans turn up toclear the snowfrom the stadium. It goes without saying that these are not fair-weather fans; indeed, the trick to keeping chills at bay in freezing temperatures, my boyfriend’s mother explained, is bringing cardboard to stand on.The idea of home means a lot in team sports. People rarely root for a team based on performance – allegiance is usually inherited, or geographical. But what I’ve learned as a previously teamless person is that it can also be gifted. I thought I wasn’t into football because it was hard to follow or boring or maybe even just too male, but I realise now that the only thing I needed was a person to extend a hand to me and say: you can be part of our team.My boyfriend and I moved to London earlier this year, and he’s further than he’s ever been from the town that calls itself the “city of good neighbors”. But every once in a while, we see a blue No 17 jersey or spy a Buffalo keyring dangling off a bag, reminding us that his neighbors, his community and his family are closer than we think. So we say hello, Buffalo-style: “Go Bills.”Explore more on these topicsBuffalo BillsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The reality was always going to be that the United States would pick up a first win of the tournament and inflict a third straight defeat on Samoa. That was never really up for debate.But it was always going to be about how many points the Eagles could rack up to pile the pressure on Australia later in the day. Nobody really knew what would be enough. Some were saying 60, some were saying 70; others felt they might need as many as 80 to stand a chance.A 135-point swing across two games is not insignificant, especially when the onus was on a USA team who are traditionally not heavy scorers: this was the biggest score they have racked up since defeating Kazakhstan in 2014. You can not argue they did not do their best to hold up their end of the bargain.View image in fullscreenFly-half Kristin Bitter attacks the Samoan defensive line during the second half.Photograph: Molly Darlington/World Rugby/Getty ImagesBut it just was not enoughas England beat Australia 47-7. It was not this game, and this scoreline, that cost them. It wastheir 69-7 loss to Englandon the opening night that proved to be significant in denying them a place in the quarter-finals – but they certainly ended their group stage campaign in some style.Not at any stage did they relent in their pursuit to rack up as many points as possible against a Samoa side who were well supported. That was evident right up to the very last moments, when the Eagles hurried to restart the game after Olivia Ortiz’s try two minutes from time, their 10th of the contest.“They did a great job, but when we got the opportunity to score I was delighted with how we did,” said the USA coach, Sione Fukofuka, said. “We rise and fall as a team.”The tone was set within six minutes by the game’s undisputed star, flanker Freda Tafuna. The first of her four tries was a wonderful solo finish that caught the Samoa defence off-guard and by half-time the States had already secured the bonus point that was the bare minimum they needed.Two tries from Hope Rogers continued their dominance after Tafuna’s early try before Cassidy Bargell and Erica Coulibaly followed suit. Leading 27-0 at the break, the platform had been laid and they did not let up after half-time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two more for the flanker followed either side of the hour mark and at that stage it was 53-0 and a huge score looked possible.But the scoring was stunted in the final quarter after Kristin Bitter was sent to the sin-bin and it looked like Samoa would produce the biggest cheer of the afternoon with their first try. However, while USA held firm to deny them, there was no shortage of spirit from Samoa. “It’s a learning curve for our players,” Ramsey Tomokino, their coach, said. “We’ve enjoyed our time here.”There was time for one more USA try when Ortiz forced her way over the line to make it 60-0, but you always had the suspicion it would not quite be enough.

It was incredible quarterback play.”The Brady Exception is another case of the NFL jettisoning objectivity and integrityRead moreLos Angeles’ Quentin Johnston had five receptions for 79 yards and two touchdowns and Keenan Allen added seven catches for 68 yards and a score. Herbert was 25 of 34 passing and also rushed for 32 yards.Patrick Mahomes completed 24 of 39 passes for 258 yards and one touchdown for the defending AFC champion Chiefs. Mahomes also led Kansas City with 57 rushing yards, while Travis Kelce hauled in a touchdown pass.The Chiefs were hoping for one last chance but Herbert scrambled for 19 yards on third-and-14 just before the two-minute warning. That allowed the Chargers to run out the clock on kneeldowns.With the win, the Chargers snapped a seven-game slide against the Chiefs.“It was just another game for us,” Herbert said afterward in a YouTube on- field interview. “We came out here and executed and did what we needed to do. ... We have a lot of respect for them. We knew it would be a dogfight.”Los Angeles had a 394-347 edge in total offense over Kansas City, which lost receiver Xavier Worthy (right shoulder) on the third offensive play.The Chiefs finally scored a touchdown on Mahomes’ 11-yard run with 8:05 left in the third quarter to pull within 13-12. But Harrison Butker was wide right on the extra point.“We can learn from this,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “Moving forward, I have to make sure I get my team in a better state coming out and playing with more emotion. ... There were some good things, but we have to make sure we take care of business, and that’s my responsibility.”The Chargers pushed their lead to eight when Herbert hit Allen on an 11-yard scoring pass with 32 seconds left in the third period.Kansas City answered early in the fourth quarter when Mahomes hit a wide-open Kelce at the 25-yard line and the latter completed the 37-yard scoring pass to bring the Chiefs within 20-18. The ensuing two-point conversion failed when Teair Tart swatted away Mahomes’ throw with his left hand.The Chargers then moved 74 yards on 11 plays with Herbert tossing a 23-yard touchdown pass to Johnston to make it a 27-18 lead with 5:02 left.Butker’s 27-yard field goal pulled the Chiefs within six with 2:34 to play.The Chargers scored the game’s first 10 points. Herbert threw a 5-yard scoring pass to Johnston to cap the team’s first drive and Cameron Dicker kicked a 39-yard field goal with 13:47 left in the first half.Kansas City got on the board on Butker’s 35-yard field goal with 4:50 left. The 16-play drive included two fourth-down conversions.“I think in general they came out with more energy than we did,” Mahomes said. “We didn’t execute. I missed some throws down the field and obviously we didn’t play good enough in the first half.”Dicker booted a 36-yard field goal to give the Chargers a 13-3 lead with 45 seconds left in the half. However, rookie Omarion Hampton ran out of bounds on the previous play instead of sliding down inbounds, and that cost his team three points when the Chiefs took advantage of the remaining time.Kansas City was able to put together a five-play drive, and the field-goal unit scrambled on in the final seconds. Butker kicked a 59-yard field goal to end the half and cut Los Angeles’ lead to 13-6.Explore more on these topicsNFLLos Angeles ChargersKansas City ChiefsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

There was little to see here at Villa Park. Or get excited about. England beatAndorra, as they always do. They did not concede against them, as always. And Thomas Tuchel’s record in World Cup qualifying Group K now shows the maximum number of points from four ties – and four clean sheets.The manager had talked about bringing greater aggression; more speed and penetration, helped by a cleaner and simpler approach. But it was not a game that demanded intense analysis. Rather it was one to tick off and move on from.Thomas Tuchel hints Elliot Anderson will start for England in SerbiaRead moreIt was better than theaway fixture against Andorra, which was played in Barcelona in June, when England grubbed home by the only goal after a flat performance, hearing boos at half-time and full-time. But long before this one was over, the thoughts of most supporters had begun to turn to the tie against Serbia in Belgrade on Tuesday. That promises to be hostile; the acid test of qualification.Tuchel had likened the challenge of getting through Andorra’s low block to chewing gum. In other words, deeply monotonous, something to make your face muscles ache. Noni Madueke forced an own goal from the Andorra defender, Christian García, midway through the first half and Declan Rice made it 2-0 midway through the second.The statistics showed that Andorra touched the ball four times inside theEnglandarea. The number was five in June. It was attack versus defence throughout, almost like a training session. The international break for England was always going to be all about Serbia.Tuchel had sought to set the tone by going with his strongest possible lineup, one that featured players in their very best positions as he sees it, although there were exceptions. The manager had suggested Dan Burn and Marc Guéhi were in competition at left centre-half. He started both, Guéhi preferred to Ezri Konsa in the right-sided role. Rice and Elliot Anderson are the No 8s in the squad. Tuchel put them both in, too, giving the latter his debut as the No 6.In possession, England were more 4-3-3 than 4-2-3-1, Eberechi Eze in a right-sided No 8 position, Rice to his left. No prizes for guessing how Andorra set up – in a resolute 5-4-1. Tuchel had actually described them on Friday as using a 5-5-0 system.View image in fullscreenAndorra’s Christian García scores England’s first with an own goal.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersHow do the people of Andorra live these ties? Do they even watch? Because there is literally nothing from their team; zero adventure. They have been managed by the same manager, Koldo Álvarez, for the last 15 years. He does what he does. They do what they do. Then again, this is a nation of 82,000 – roughly the same population as Ashford in Kent.England needed a goal before the half hour mark, the point at which it was possible to wonder whether the crowd might grow frustrated. They got it. Anderson was lively, looking to progress the ball and he sparked a move that got Madueke into a crossing position. The right winger floated it over towards Rice, who had made a late run for the six-yard box, and it came off the head of García to nestle inside the far corner.Tuchel watched, at times, from a seated position on top of a Lucozade drinks cooler. Where was the energy, Thomas! But he celebrated the breakthrough with aggressively clenched fists. Relief was a part of it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And Madueke was game, direct; he tried to make things happen. He had teed up Eze for a shot in the 15th minute, which ended up too close to the goalkeeper, Iker Álvarez. Eze saw another one cleared off the line on 23 minutes by Max Llovera after a cut-back from Rice.It was thin gruel in the first half, England not sharp enough. The tempo was missing. It was sideways stuff, too often. At least they were not booed off by the sell-out crowd. The fans’ commitment was hugely impressive. It always is.England pushed after the restart and they looked more creative. Eze worked the goalkeeper after a Madueke burst while Marcus Rashford bent the follow-up wide. Anderson went close after Harry Kane had helped to force a turnover high up, a potential moment to cherish denied by Álvarez’s diving save. Eze lashed high when well placed but the offside flag had gone up – it was not his day – before Rice scored the second with a downwards header from Reece James’s cross.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersEnglandAndorramatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He was 78.The Canadiens announced his death early Saturday, saying Dryden’s family asked for privacy. A team spokesperson said a close friend of Dryden’s appointed by the family contacted the organization, adding he died peacefully Friday at his home.The NHL preached inclusion. So why has it got into bed with Donald Trump?Read more“Ken Dryden was an exceptional athlete, but he was also an exceptional man,” Canadiens owner Geoff Molson said. “Behind the mask he was larger than life. We mourn today not only the loss of the cornerstone of one of hockey’s greatest dynasties but also a family man, a thoughtful citizen and a gentleman who deeply impacted our lives and communities across generations.”Dryden backstopped the NHL’s most successful franchise to championships in six of his eight seasons in the league from 1970-71 to ’78-79. He won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year, the Vezina as the best goalie five times and the Conn Smythe as playoff MVP in 1971, while being a six-time All-Star.“Ken embodied the best of everything the Montreal Canadiens are about,” Molson said.Known for resting his blocker and glove hands on top of his stick in a relaxed manner that became one of hockey’s most recognizable poses, the 6ft 4in Dryden retired at just 31 in 1979.“From the moment Ken Dryden joined the Montreal Canadiens as a 23-year-old rookie in 1971, he made an immediate and lasting impact on the NHL, the Canadiens franchise and the goaltending position,” NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said. “Ken’s love for his country was evident both on and off the ice.”Inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983, Dryden was 258-57-74 with a .922 save percentage, 2.24 goals-against average and 46 shutouts in just over seven seasons and went 80-32 in the playoffs.Canadian prime minister Mark Carney posted on social media he was “deeply saddened to learn of the passing of the Hon. Ken Dryden, a Canadian hockey legend and hall of famer, public servant and inspiration.”“Few Canadians have given more, or stood taller, for our country,” Carney said. “Ken Dryden was BigCanada. And he was Best Canada. Rest in peace.”From Hamilton, Ontario, Dryden played three seasons at Cornell University from 1966-69, leading the Big Red to the 1967 NCAA title and finishing with a career record of 76-4-1.Dryden entered the NHL in 1971 and spent just six games in the crease before making his NHL postseason debut. He and Montreal upset rival Boston in the first round and beat Chicago in the final.He then was a cornerstone of Canada’s 1972 Summit Series team that defeated the Soviet Union, starting in goal in the decisive 6-5 victory in Game 8.“I feel the history of that tournament, the legacy of that team just as strongly as all Canadian fans do,” Dryden told The Canadian Press in a 2022 interview. “It never goes away. It’s kind of like a good wine, I guess. Actually, the legacy of it grows.”He also worked at a Toronto law firm while sitting out the 1973-74 NHL season – after previously earning a law degree at Montreal’s McGill University.After retiring as a player, he went into broadcasting and wrote The Game, one of the best known books about the sport, after publishing Face-off at the Summit as part of an accomplished career as an author. He was the color analyst alongside Al Michaels for the Miracle on Ice when the US beat the Soviet Union and went on to win the gold medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics.Dryden served as president of the Toronto Maple Leafs from 1997 through 2004 – a stretch accented by trips to the Eastern Conference final in both 1999 and 2002 – before resigning to enter politics. He ran for the federal Liberals in 2004 and was named minister of social development in prime minister Paul Martin’s cabinet.Dryden, who also taught at various universities across Canada, held onto his seat in Toronto’s York Centre riding in 2006 when the Liberals were ousted, and again in 2008, but lost in 2011.Dryden is survived by wife Lynda and their two children.Brother Dave Dryden was a longtime NHL and WHA goalie. He died in 2022 at the age of 81.Explore more on these topicsMontreal CanadiensNHLUS sportsCanadaShareReuse this content"

The 22-year-old’s positive passing and physicality caught the eye at Villa Park, suggesting that he can fill a problem position in midfield forEngland, and he is in line to play again when England face Serbia in Belgrade on Tuesday night.England 2-0 Andorra: World Cup qualifier player ratings for Thomas Tuchel’s sideRead more“He’s just a very, very good football player,” Tuchel said. “He has the physicality, he’s very mobile at No 6. He has the body, he loves to defend, he loves to put his body inside to duels. He loves passing, he loves to break the lines, he’s very mobile in this game. It was a pleasure to see.“I think the team around him made it as easy as possible for him and he had a very strong performance. I think he showed today that he adapts to the situation. Can he show what he showed in training? Can he show what he showed with Nottingham and the under-21s? He played with a lot of freedom. He was very quickly in the flow. I think he has the physicality and he has the mindset to play in more difficult games. And for this performance he is clearly in the mix to play in Serbia.”England top Group K with four wins from four but they laboured at times against a stubbornAndorraside. It took an own-goal from Christian García and a header from Declan Rice to settle a dull game but Tuchel was pleased with his side’s performance.“We’re getting there,” the German said. “It was a lot of learning for me. International football is so different from club football. But we are getting there, I’m very positive about the group that was in camp now and how they presented themselves, how they behaved, how they trained and how we played today. I am absolutely convinced that we are on the right path. It’s always on us to prove it.”Tuchel insisted that Marcus Rashford, who has not scored for England in almost two years, can shine on the left flank. “He’s clearly a left winger,” he said. “He had the freedom today to go a bit more inside. He had an excellent training week and it was obvious that we want him to start because he trained so, so well on the left side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He trains at the moment with the right attitude, with a smile and with a lot of quality. He struggles a bit with numbers and with the ‘wow’ performance in an England shirt, I agree. But as long as he trains like he did and behaves and is active and alive in the group, then we will always trust him and push him and support him.”Tuchel backed England to cope with a rise in quality against Serbia. Victory on Tuesday could leave them eight points clear at the top of the group.“Now we will prove a point in Belgrade,” Tuchel said. “The way is to win and to be tough. In the circumstances we expect a very emotional stadium, we expect an emotional crowd. We don’t know what the pitch looks like. Make no excuses. And then we come up against a very physical team.“We have to step up and adapt to the circumstances, adapt to the opponent and then prove the point we are a strong group and we are on the right way because I feel like we had an excellent five days now. It’s two days to prepare for Tuesday and hopefully prove the point that we are ready for that.

Everton’s women have played five Merseyside derbies at Anfield and have won them all without conceding a goal. Three have come during Sorensen’s tenure and his side begin the new season there on Sunday.Women’s Super League previews No 5: EvertonRead moreLiverpool are winless in their past seven WSL meetings with Everton, losing five, and that record was is something bothering the Liverpool midfielder Marie Höbinger. “It’s due, isn’t it? It’s about time,” she said of her club’s desire to end that run. “Everton are a tough team to play against. I feel like they step up their game every time they play against us. It’s about time we make them lose at Anfield. We’re all super motivated for that.”The fixture already carries extra significancefor Liverpool as it will be Gareth Taylor’s first competitive game in charge and Sorensen stressed that past success at Anfield will mean little: “It always gives you confidence, but it’s water under the bridge. It’s history.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s new manager, Gareth Taylor, won eight of nine fixtures against Everton while at Manchester City.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“We have quite a new team; they have a new manager. We feel we’re ready and we’re really looking forward to a repeat and hopefully history continues in our favour, but we know it’s going to be a hard game.”Sorensen spent much of last season with a thin squad hampered by injuries, but this summer, boosted by the club’s new owners, The Friedkin Group, Everton have broken their club record to sign the England midfielder Ruby Mace from Leicester as well as bringing in three Japan internationals – Yuka Momiki, Hikaru Kitagawa and Rion Ishikawa. The contrast to last term is such that Sorensen said: “It’s a bit nice as a coach now, I actually have a headache in team selections because of the quality we have.”Liverpool were also active in the transfer market, signing four players on deadline day, including the Swedish striker Beata Olsson. Höbinger feels that starting the campaign at Anfield speaks volumes about the trajectory of the women’s game.Women’s Super League 2025-26 previews No 7: LiverpoolRead more“It’s just amazing to play in the big stadiums, especially to see how big women’s football is in England,” she says. “Being a part of that is really special. Feeling that is special for me, coming from Austria, where it’s not like that.”“It couldn’t have been any better for us, playing Everton here at Anfield. It gives us the best possible chance to start the season really well and it’s going to give us a massive push and motivation to do well for the fans.”Last season. Liverpool finished seventh in the WSL, one point ahead of eighth-placed Everton, and will gain confidence by the fact that Taylor, the former Manchester City manager, has won eight of his nine previous league meetings with Everton. A derby victory would be a good way to quickly endear himself to his new club’s supporters.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueEverton WomenLiverpool FC WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her goal, a wonderfully whipped strike from outside the box after she had evaded María Pérez, to cancel out Kosovare Asllani’s opener, was the highlight, before goals from Chloe Kelly, Stina Blackstenius and Frida Maanum finished the job. A volley which flashed past a post from Alessia Russo’s lofted pass, a header wide and an effort which forced a smart save from the goalkeeper Elene Lete showed Smith has settled into the side very quickly after joining early in the transfer window from Liverpool.“It’s very special,” said the manager Renée Slegers on Smith’s goal. “It was a fantastic individual action, a lot of players had good individual actions but of course people come to the stands to watch good goals.”Arsenal is a club that has mastered the art of building a committed fanbase for its women’s team and on a warm Saturday lunchtime fans snaked towards the stadium in a show of strength, 17,000 season tickets (a mixture of full season and six-game bundles) sold before their 2025-26 opener. Between tiers in the stadium is a new significant feature in the team’s full-time WSL home, their record-breaking trophy haul displayed alongside the years each was won, the men’s to the left, the women’s to the right of the date.

London City were a complete unknown, 16 new signings contributing six to the starting XI and they shocked the bumper crowd by opening the scoring. It was a cruel goal to concede for the Gunners, 18-year-old Katie Reid culpable for conceding the penalty after starting ahead of both Lotte Wubben-Moy and Laia Codina with Leah Williamson absent. The WSL2 2024-25 top scorer Isobel Goodwin was dispossessed well by Reid but then she lunged in late on Asllani as she sought to pick up the loose ball.

Now we just need to create a team. I have a job to do to create cohesion.”The equaliser came via Smith’s stunning strike before Arsenal took the lead in added time at the end of the first half. Elena Linari’s pass was intercepted by Emily Fox who fed Russo and the England forward turned it across the face of goal for Kelly to tap in.Blackstenius added a third, converting from fellow substitute Beth Mead’s ball and a minute later it was four, those two combining before Mead crossed for Maanum to nod in.It was not a game where you can draw any real conclusions about how London City will do in their maiden WSL season but it showed them and watching billionaire owner Michele Kang just what can be achieved. Founded in 1987, the Gunners have a 36-year head start on London City, Kang having bought the club in 2023. Money cannot buy history, but it can kickstart a journey. Arsenal, meanwhile, kept pace with Chelsea on the opening day. It’s a long season, but it’s a start.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueArsenal WomenLondon City LionessesWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Onana has started only United’s Carabao Cup12-11 penalty shootout loss at Grimsby, in which he was culpable for both goals in the 2-2 draw in regular time.The terms of the deal withTrabzonsporare still being worked on before Onana makes a final decision.Manchester United seal €21m deal for goalkeeper Senne LammensRead moreOn Monday’s transfer deadline day, Unitedsigned Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerpfor €21m (£18m) to strengthen their options. With Lammens, Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton, the head coach Ruben Amorim has four goalkeepers in his squad.Yet with Onana expected to be part of Cameroon’s squad for the African Cup of Nations and so unavailable for up to six weeks from mid-December, Amorim had been relaxed about having a quartet of keepers. Trabzonspor’s interest in the 29-year-old prompted a change in his stance.Yet if Onana does complete the loan move, United could be exposed. Bayindir has made only seven Premier League appearances and has proved error-prone, while the 39-year-old Heaton last played in the league for Aston Villa in January 2020. The 23-year-old Lammens has never played in English football.On signing, the Belgian said: “I think if you want to be a good goalkeeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence. They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in. One of the best attributes you can have as a goalkeeper is staying calm under pressure, in any circumstances, even if you make a mistake or something. You just move on and try to give your best to the team.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedTrabzonsporTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Brighton had been scratchy, had struggled to create and were a goal down, but the changes transformed the game and they won 2-1. Hürzeler explained he had been guided by “a feeling that comes from inside … In some moments my body says something to me. Not just in football but generally in life you need to have the courage to take the decisions you want to.”Hürzeler had spent most of his press conference trying to deflect or at least share out the praise. He talked of his players and how important their energy and belief had been, and he stressed that the substitutions had been a collective decision made with his coaching staff. Management these days is a world of data and analysis, of careful programming and meticulous plans. But ultimately what won the game was Hürzeler’s intuition.There was something almost refreshingly old-fashioned about the revelation. That intuition, of course, does not come from nowhere, but is based on years of observation and experience. But that capacity to smell the game, not only to understand the technical detail but to ride and shape the shifting emotional dynamics of the occasion, often seems overlooked.The best recent example of a manager intuiting the psychological elements of the game and reacting accordingly perhaps came in March 2019.Manchester United went to Paris Saint-Germainhaving lost the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie 2-0. By half-time at the Parc des Princes, improbably, they led 2-1. Many would have attacked, seeking a third that would have brought an away-goals victory. But Ole Gunnar Solskjær instead had United sit off. PSG were quite happy with that: they led 3-2 on aggregate. Only in the last 15 minutes did United attack.They did so with belief. Solskjær himself was the embodiment of the club’s historic capacity to score decisive late goals. PSG wilted, as they so often had before when the line came in sight. United got a penalty, Marcus Rashford converted and Solskjær’s side went through on away goals. Attack early in the second half, and PSG might have had time to score again; the late assault, though, played on ingrained anxieties.View image in fullscreenFabian Hürzeler brought on four players and turned the game against Manchester City.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty ImagesGo back to the 80s or 90s and most of the discourse around English football centres on motivation and psychological tricks. Even 20 years ago, the conversation around the various failures of the England national team focused on their supposed absence of passion. Managers were seen as messianic figures, revered less for their tactical understanding than for their capacity to motivate.Some sort of correction was probably necessary but it may be that the reaction has gone too far. In part, that’s probably because that’s just how things are; resets never finish in the perfect spot. In part it’s probably down to the data revolution: the production of statistics that would never even have been considered a decade or so ago can create the fallacy that the game is entirely explicable by numbers. And in part it’s probably a result of the profound influence of Pep Guardiola, a tactical genius whose mastery of shape and position is so great that he has never much had to concern himself with geeing players up or instilling confidence.But, for most, football is not just about the deployment of resources and the best-laid plans. It’s also about recognising and seizing opportunity, the tide in the affairs of man which, taken at the flood, leads on to glory. Such questions are always bound up in hypotheticals, but it was hard to avoid the feeling last weekend that, an hour and a half after Brighton took their chance,Mikel Artetalet one slip through his fingers.Liverpool were vulnerable. They had conceded two goals in each of their first three games of the season. They had a midfielder playing at right-back and a new left-back who has looked extremely uncertain. There are still adjusting to the new shape in midfield. Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Newcastle had all madeLiverpoollook shaky by attacking them. What if Arsenal had done that? What if Arsenal had been aggressive from the off, had put Liverpool under pressure in the opening 20 minutes? Noni Madueke had the beating of Milos Kerkez; what if they had used him more? What if they had really tested Dominik Szoboszlai defensively?It was a similar story at the Etihad the season before last whenArsenal, on top with 20 minutes to go, seemingly opted to take the draw and protect their lead at the top of table rather than seeking a win that would have given them clear water over Manchester City, a policy that left them vulnerable to the sort of run of wins City then embarked on coupled with their own slip-up against Aston Villa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it’s true also that they were without Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz, with Martin Ødegaard fit enough only for the bench and William Saliba forced off early. But equally, what does it say about Arteta’s faith in his squad and his new signings if his response to losing players is to retreat into negativity? Even without those four, Arsenal are still man-for-man a better side than Bournemouth or Palace, perhaps even than Newcastle.By seeking control, Arsenal allowed Liverpool to stabilise. In the second half, Liverpool had two-thirds of the ball before they scored. It may have been a freakishly brilliant goal, but Arsenal created the environment in which that could occur; give a high-class team a lot of the ball and there is always the risk one of them does something exceptional.For lesser sides that may still be the way of playing most likely to bring a desirable result, but potential title winners probably need the capacity to read the mood and know when to gamble. It may even be that, in a tight race, that edge is what defines a champion. That is not a way of thinking much enjoyed by modern football. It likes statistics and provables. But sometimes, football – life – is about feel, sensing the moment and seizing it.Explore more on these topicsMikel ArtetaInside footballArsenalBrighton & Hove AlbionLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

Now it is on the verge of becoming reality and the implications will be far reaching if, as widely expected, La Liga and Serie A are given permission in the coming weeks to host domestic games abroad. The sport risks being ripped from its fabric should Barcelona andVillarrealbe allowed to break the mould and stage a top-flight fixture in Miami this December.The topic has dominated discussion in football’s corridors of power recently and, at the heart of a complex and deeply emotive problem, the immediate equation is simple.If Uefa’s executive committee agrees to the planswhen it convenes in Tirana on Thursday the final say will be down to Fifa, probably at a meeting of its council on 2 October. The global governing body would be unlikely to put up opposition and the question, at that point, will be just how earth-shattering a precedent has been set.Fifa urged to block ‘disarray’ of major European fixtures being played on different continentsRead moreIn some cases, Uefa’s chiefs will cast their votes after considerable soul-searching. The Guardian understands they will be asked to approve the La Liga andSerie Agames – the latter a match between Milan and Como that would be played in Perth, Australia, next February – on an exceptional basis rather than to wave through the blanket concept of foreign-based fixtures.One executive committee member, the German football league supervisory board chair, Hans-Joachim Watzke, has stated his opposition. The Bundesliga, he said this week, would not be following its peers in upping sticks. Others may seek further information before deciding on a stance.There are no illusions that, even if permission is granted only for these individual cases, this genie can be squeezed back into the bottle. Nobody could consider that realistic having heard the Serie A president, Ezio Simonelli, say last month that he would have liked to play the league’s entire first round on foreign soil.But the ground has been cleared for Uefa to sign off the games currently proposed. Blocking them could, senior figures believe, require a change to its statutes that cannot be made in short order. Even then,the settlement agreedwith Fifa by the US-based promoter Relevent Sports last year, dismissing the global governing body from a lawsuit contesting its policy banning league games from taking place overseas, has left legal wriggle room at a minimum.If Europe’s football authorities are serious about opposing such a fundamental uprooting of the game’s principles, it is worth pointing out they have had plenty of time to act. Even if the Premier League’s “39th game” died a slow death in the late 2000s, La Liga and Relevent first showed their handwhen attempting in 2018to stage a match between Barcelona and Girona in Miami.View image in fullscreenMilan’s match against Como in December could be played in Perth, Australia.Photograph: Claudio Villa/AC Milan/Getty ImagesThat move was blocked byFifa, leading to the suit filed by Relevent. It is hard, though, to overlook the bond forged between Uefa and Relevent since then. Relevent was awarded the global commercial rights to Uefa’s club competitions for the 2027-2033 cycle this year and has made no secret of its desire to push past some of football’s more conservative ways. Some onlookers have wondered whether two parties with diametrically opposed views about staging games abroad would really enter into business.Regardless, the likelihood is that football will once again be required to find reactive solutions to a long-burning hot potato. In May 2024, Fifa confirmed a working group would be created to review the rules governing potential relocation of domestic league games. The following October it predicted the group would make recommendations “in the coming months”.So far no outcomes have been reached; the group is understood to have met twice, in January and June, with an as-yet unconfirmed third date lined up this month. Initially Fifa had promised supporter organisations would be represented but in fact they are not included in its 15 members. Those to have been selected include the president ofLa Liga, Javier Tebas, and representatives from the US and Saudi federations. Daniel Sillman, the chief executive of Relevent, is also among those tasked with forging proposals that will shape football’s future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All parties profess an enthusiasm to impose limits on the number of matches a league can transport abroad, as well as the number a single territory can host, but those restraints will have to be imposed after the horse has bolted.

Perhaps there is fatigue, too, bred by the consistent prioritising of corporate imperatives over the forces that have forged the game’s soul. Football Supporters Europe, however,has released a statementagainst the proposals that has been signed by more than 500 fan groups from 28 countries. Their voices have so far been sidelined from the discussion.The logic used by proponents of exportable domestic football states foreign markets and fanbases have swelled to the extent everyone deserves a sample of the product. That ignores the fact the product is, to a large extent, the country and culture in which it is rooted. It also neglects to consider that offering a match to 65,000 supporters at Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium is unlikely to energise an entire nation. The financial considerations driving the Spanish and Italian top flights, dwarfed by the Premier League’s power, are clear; rather than address the cause, the appetite is seemingly to barrel on and risk irreversible harm.This week the European commissioner for intergenerational fairness, youth, culture and sport, Glenn Micallef, warned, in an opinion piece published by several outlets, that the plans put the European sport model at risk of collapse. “Taking competitions away from [the fans] is not innovation but a betrayal of trust,” he wrote. Micallef was promptly accused by Tebas, in a lengthy social media post, of jumping on this issue while staying silent on matters such as the Club World Cup and state ownership. Tebas claimed bringing a match to fans in the US “does not break tradition … it projects it”. Time may very soon tell who is correct.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballUefaBarcelonaVillarrealLa LigaSerie AMilanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gripping. A proper Test match. Australia put England under the most pressure they have faced in a long time with a superb first-half performance but the Red Roses pulled away in the second half to seal top spot and a quarter-final against Scotland.The victory was also England’s 30th in a row, equalling their own world record set at the last World Cup. The eventual 47-7 scoreline was not a true reflection of what a battle this final Pool A match was, with Jo Yapp’s Australia executing a successful kicking game to put the Red Roses under huge pressure in the opening half hour. England did not lead until the 33rd minute and Australia got some reward for their efforts, the result meaning they qualify for the last eight and a meeting with Canada.Ellie Kildunne ruled out of England’s Rugby World Cup quarter-final after head injuryRead moreWhile the errors made by England will be a worry, what may cause more concern are the injuries sustained to key players in the brutal encounter. The full-back Ellie Kildunne was substituted when showing concussion symptoms and will not play in the quarter-final, while Hannah Botterman went off with an acute back spasm. The back-row Morwenna Talling also came off for a head injury assessment but passed and is expected to be available for selection.Australia knew before kick-off that a win, a bonus point or a defeat by no more than 74 points would see them through to the quarter-finals. In the buildup the talk had been about causing an upset and they started on the right path with a scrum penalty leading to Adiana Talakai scoring from a rolling maul. England responded well, Jess Breach scoring on her 50th cap.View image in fullscreenSadia Kabeya scores her second try of the game.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersAs Australia cranked up the pressure, Amy Cokayne held the ball up over the line to preventanother score. Australia were almost over again when Caitlyn Halse popped a grubber kick through but Natasha Hunt picked up over the try-line and threw a pass to Kildunne who snuffed out the danger.England thought they had another try but a TMO check confirmed Cokayne had dropped the ball over the line and more bad news came when Botterman went down in considerable pain, putting her head into her shirt and heading straight down the tunnel for treatment.Errors from England stopped their usual free-flowing attack and Australia continued to orchestrate the game until Abbie Ward powered over. Australia had their own injury woes with Lydia Kavoa carried off on a stretcher before Sadia Kabeya scored to make the half-time score 19-7.View image in fullscreenKelsey Clifford scores England’s fifth try.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesA fumbled attack turned into a try early in the second half thanks to the individual brilliance of Hunt, whose footwork set up Kabeya for her second.

The replacement prop scored again and Sarah Bern added to the scoreline before also being shown a yellow card for shoulder to head contact.The Australia head coach and former England captain Yapp, who is leaving her role after the World Cup, said: “The scoreline just blew out in the second half, in the first half we were really in the game. We were really competitive and were executing what we wanted to do but we knew England were going to come out hard in the second half. We just started to lose some of our launch plays and put ourselves under pressure a little bit.”The Red Roses continue on their unbeaten run but the performance was far from perfect.

Slotted into hosting Friday’s US Open women’s doubles trophy presentation, the respected former American great kicked off the festivities at Arthur Ashe Stadium by inviting the runners-up to the mic on center court to speak freely. “Really? I just get to talk?” Taylor Townsend said. “As long as you want,” Rubin warmly assured.The 29-year-old American and world No 1 in doubles had already made quite the statement over the past fortnight. Well, three weeks if you count her run in the mixed doubles bracket with compatriot Ben Shelton in the US Open’s newly extended format. After that came a dazzling unseeded run to the fourth round of the singles that saw her beat the Russian prodigy Mirra Andreeva for her third ever victory against a top-five player before taking a tough three-set loss to two-time slam champion Barbora Krejcikova, the American matching the career high-water mark she reached in 2019. Thirteen years after becoming tennis-famous as the world’s No 1 junior, Townsend had became an overnight mainstream sensation: No player in New Yorkgained more Instagram followersin week one.Seeded first in the doubles draw with 10-time grand slam winner Katerina Siniacova, Townsend didn’t drop a set until third-seeded Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe beat them 6-4, 6-4 in a final that drew a surprisingly large and enthusiastic crowd for a women’s doubles match. In her concession speech, Townsend – who ultimately came up short of bracketing the year with grand slam doubles titles after winning the Australian Open with Siniakova – called her US Open experience this year life-changing and “monumental”. It wasn’t hyperbole.Ever since first picking up a racket at age four, Townsend has had to fight against her sport’s stubbornly intractable biases. In a world that twee country club princess who can play against type, Townsend has always stood out as a Black woman from Chicago’s rough and tumble South Side and considered less of a Big Babe than just plain big – reportedly playing at around 170lb even though just 5ft 7in. Famously, while the world’s top-ranked junior at age 16, Townsend became a cultural flashpoint after her mother, a former college player, went public about the the United StatesTennisAssociation denying her travel funding for the 2012 US Open because coaches insisted she improve her “overall fitness”.View image in fullscreenTaylor Townsend of the United States poses with the WTA Doubles World No 1 trophy ahead of this year’s US Open on 21 August 2025.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesEven as then player development chief Pat McEnroe made clear that the USTA was really looking out for Townsend’s “long-term health and development” and was seemingly telegraphing to her peers that the federation prized fitness more than results, the controversy made Townsend something of a Rorschach test for cultural debates around race, body image and gender politics – with Townsend supporters quick to point that American greats Serena Williams and Lindsay Davenport were singled out for having “unconventional” body types, even as they piled up grand slam hardware. But though initially hyped as a Williams sister-level prospect – with coaching from Wimbledon finalist Zina Garrison, Donald Young Sr and Kamau Murray (the corner man for Sloane Stephens’s 2018 US Open title) to recommend her – Townsend has had a mostly workaday career in her 13 years on WTA tour, going six years before cracking the top 75 on the singles chart.And yet: The harder the tennis establishment tries to submit her as an example of what a pro tennis careershouldn’tlook like, the more fans seem to relate and take inspiration from her insurgent campaign. Since 2021, Townsend has pursued tennis while raising her son, Adyn – “a great accident,” she called him recently. “It was a complete shocker to me to find out I was pregnant.” After giving birth, Townsend challenged herself to step up her health and fitness commitments and wound up losing 80lb.Inan interviewearlier this year with the American sports journalist Jemele Hill, Townsend was candid about the dismal financial margins for players at her level, itemizing the litany of expenses that she has to cover just to put herself in position to earn a prize check. “In 2017 I played a pro tournament, and I made $66,” Townsend recalled. “Minus the $40 entry fee. I drove to the tournament. So I had $26 that I left aprofessionaltournamentwith – and I was like,this can’t even fill up my gas tank!”Where another player might connect with a sports apparel powerhouse to help fund their playing endeavors, Townsend was never approached to model and had to mix and match her own bought clothes instead. In fact, she’s been doing it for so long that she just went ahead and launched own clothing line this year in collaboration with creative director Alexander John (of LA Gear and Puma fame) and debuted the “TT”-logoed fits at the French Open. (“I’m just taking things into my own hands,” shesaid.) Given the unfairness that she’s experienced in tennis, it’s in some ways inevitable that Townsend would become most known for her patch sponsorship deal with the law firm ofBen Crump– the civil rights advocate who the Rev Al Sharpton fondly calls “Black America’s attorney general”.Crump was among many fans who would make a civil rights case out of thealtercationthat followed Townsend’s straight sets second-round defeat of 25th-seeded Jelena Ostapenko. The Latvian, apparently bitter toward Townsend for not raising an apologetic hand after a net cord that turned a critical point in her favor, told the American she was “disrespectful”, had “no education” and “no class”. On the internet, the snapshot image of Townsend calmly smiling on as Ostapenko melted down was seen emblematic of Black women’s experiences with Karens on the job, while Ostapenko’s “no education” comment triggered somerefreshingly nuanced tennis commentaryabout the insidious nature of racism the responsibility Ostapenko’s has, as a privileged white woman in the sport, to recognize it anyway. “One of the worst things you could say to a Black tennis player” is how Naomi Osaka described the “no education” line by Ostapenko, who ultimately walked the insults back without apologizing to Townsend directly. Townsend, for her part, didn’t take the comments aboard and rejected the idea that they were racially coded despite the tournament-seizing controversy.View image in fullscreenTaylor Townsend’s altercation with Jelena Ostapenko became one of the defining episodes of this year’s US Open.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesIn general, Townsend’s graceful, easygoing nature has a habit of seeing her through. Before the Ostapenko incident, Townsend was winning over fans for the compassion she showed Danielle Collins during a physical and emotional match at this year’s Cincinnati Open. After Collins unraveled during the match and marched off the court in tears following the straight sets loss, Townsend gathered up Collins’s belongings andhoisted them up to her teamin a shocking display of sportsmanship. Collins later revealed that she was playing through the pain of a herniated disc, which pitched up her frustration.Townsend’s chill vibes and deft lefty game are what ultimately led Siniacova to recruit her for doubles in May 2024 – and the partnership has produced Townsend’s best results and forged a strong bond between the two players. (After their post-match news conference in English, Townsend insisted on staying for a bit of Siniacova’s Czech interviews and having her partner teach her a few words forthank you.) Their successful collaboration has also produced some genuinely delightful social media posts that have lent further insight into Townsend’s winsome personality. After the pair won Wimbledon last year, Townsend’s first major championship, she posted a video of herself staggering around her hotel room in the afterglow victory and bubbly. “Y’all, I’m fucked up,” she beamed. “They kept bringing me champagne. I ain’t drank in months.”After congratulating her vanquishers and moving on to thanking the locker room attendants and security guards in her US Open concession speech on Friday, Townsend reemerged inside of the main interview room at Arthur Ashe Stadiumwith a Honey Deuce in hand, no worse for wear. As symbolic as it would have been to see her win a maiden US Open after her early trials in the USTA – with Althea Gibson looming large over this year’s spectacle and Rubin, the first Black woman to win a grand slam doubles title after Gibson, on court – Townsend will totally take this result. Between her split of the $500,000 runner-up check (which should cover a fair number of travel expenses and fuel-ups) and the Tiffany finalists plate (which she was thinking might make a posh charcuterie platter), Townsend has much to savor about her finest ever year on tour to date.But as it turns out there was an even bigger consolation prize that Townsend didn’t expect to receive during her time in Queens: statements of respect delivered by her counterparts at random. “I really feel like the type of tennis that I played and just the way that the person and the player that I am now really gained a lot of respect in the locker room,” she said. “Even Novak [Djokovic] said something to me. Jannik [Sinner] said something to me – like, ‘Hey, you played really well. Keep going.’Everyonewas watching. The biggest thing that has changed for me, too, is just being able to truly show up as myself publicly and for people to be able to receive that as it is. It’s very liberating and freeing.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025TennisUS Open tennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The world No 1 prevailed 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in three hours and 21 minutes on Friday night, booking a third consecutive grand slam final against the Spaniard and underlining a rivalry that has already reshaped the men’s game.The win made Sinner only the fourth man in the Open era, after Rod Laver, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, to reach all four major finals in a single season, and at 24 the youngest to do so. His streak of 27 straight victories at the hard-court majors equalled Djokovic’s best, with only Federer’s 36 still ahead. He has now reached five consecutive major finals, lifting trophies in Melbourne and at Wimbledon and standing one point from victory at Roland Garros before Alcaraz turned the match around. The No 1 ranking will also be on the line in Sunday’s final.US Open tennis 2025: Jannik Sinner defeats Félix Auger-Aliassime in men’s semi-final – as it happenedRead more“It’s been an amazing season,” Sinner said. “The grand slams are the most important tournaments and to find myself in another final here, with such an amazing crowd, it doesn’t get better. It was very tough tonight but I’m happy I managed it. Sunday will be very special. Carlos and I know each other so well.”Sinner looked on course for a routine evening as he broke twice in the opening set, taking it 6-1 in 43 minutes while Auger-Aliassime’s forehand betrayed him. When the Canadian squandered three break points early in the second, all on second serves, the momentum seemed to be tilting further towards the top seed. Instead the match flipped. The 25-year-old Auger-Aliassime, seeded 25th and playing his second slam semi-final after reaching the last four here in 2021, caught fire with thumping serves and bold groundstrokes, tearing off 12 of the final 13 points. He broke for 5-3 with a blistering inside-out forehand and sealed the set with successive aces, an Ashe crowd packed to the corners roaring behind the underdog.View image in fullscreenAuger-Aliassime on the stretch against Sinner.Photograph: John Angelillo/UPI/ShutterstockBy then Sinner had summoned the trainer for treatment on his stomach, feeling what he called “a small twitching” after a serve late in the second set. He left the court but returned reassured: “After the treatment I was feeling much better. At some point I didn’t feel anything anymore, so it was all good. Nothing to worry about.”With a first-serve percentage already hovering below 50% dipping even further, Sinner steadied himself. At 3-2 in the third set he escaped danger with a run of aces, then broke when Auger-Aliassime’s forehand faltered at 2-4. He closed the third with a love hold, relying on placement and resilience to move within a set of the finish line.The fourth was the best passage of the night, both men trading hellfire and forcing each other into lung-busting rallies. At 2-2 Sinner faced three break points but wiped them away with trademark composure. In the next game Auger-Aliassime broke down again and Sinner pounced, painting the line with a forehand that his opponent could not chase down to break for 3-2. The Canadian continued to fight, but after more than three hours his legs looked heavy and Sinner never loosened his grip, closing the match with authority.Alcaraz too strong as he beats Djokovic in straight sets to reach US Open finalRead moreThe numbers told the story for the No 1 seed: four breaks from 10 chances, nine of 10 break points saved, 33 winners to 22 unforced errors. Auger-Aliassime, who has beaten Alexander Zverev, Andrey Rublev and Alex de Minaur in a revitalising fortnight, will return to the top 20 and leaves New York reminded of his ability to trouble the elite. But the consistency of Sinner’s steel outweighed even his opponent’s purple patch in the second set. “There are many things I can be pleased with: the way I served, the way I hit the forehand, the belief I had that I could win these matches,” Auger-Aliassime said. “Even when I was struggling, I kept believing my time would come. That mentality is something I’ve been working on.”The Canadian admitted the turning point came at the start of the fourth set, when he could not convert five break points. “If one of those forehands goes in, maybe I’m in a fifth set,” he said. “But I don’t have regrets. I played my way. You live and die with your choices.”For Sinner the result confirmed the inevitability of Sunday’s final, where US president Donald Trumpwill be part of a sold-out crowdof more than 23,000 spectators. Earlier in the day Alcarazhad dismantled Djokovic in straight setsto reach his second US Open final. Together the pair have bent the sport to their will: by Sunday night they will have shared the past eight slam titles and 10 of the last 13, laying the foundation for a rivalry that already feels era-defining. Alcaraz leads the count five majors to four, and with the No 1 ranking also at stake, their duel at the summit could scarcely be more sharply defined.“I love these challenges,” Sinner said when asked about facing Alcaraz again. “He’s someone who pushes me to the limit, which is great, because then you have the best feedback you can have as a player … But it’s also nice sometimes to not play against him,” he added with a smile.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Jannik SinnerCarlos AlcarazTennisUS Open tennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Pictures byJulia KochetovaSat 6 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShare“It’s more exhausting,” says Afer, a deputy commander of the “Da Vinci Wolves”, describing how one of the best-known battalions inUkrainehas to defend against constant Russian attacks. Where once the invaders might have tried small group assaults with armoured vehicles, now the tactic is to try and sneak through on foot one by one, evading frontline Ukrainian drones, and find somewhere to hide.Under what little cover remains, survivors then try to gather a group of 10 or so and attack Ukrainian positions. It is costly – “in the last 24 hours we killed 11,” Afer says – but the assaults that previously might have happened once or twice a day are now relentless. To the Da Vinci commander it seems that the Russians are terrified of their own officers, which is why they follow near suicidal orders.View image in fullscreenAt the command centre of the Da Vinci Wolves battalionView image in fullscreenAt the command centre of the Da Vinci Wolves battalionReconnaissance drones monitor a burnt-out tree line west of Pokrovsk; the images come through to Da Vinci’s command centre at one end of a 130-metre-long underground bunker. “It’s very dangerous to have even a small break on watching,” Afer says, and the team works round the clock. The bunker, built in four or five weeks, contains multiple rooms, including a barracks for sleep. Another is an army mess with children’s drawings, reminders of family. The menu for the week is listed on the wall.It is three and a half years into the Ukraine war and Donald Trump’s August peace initiative has made no progress. Meanwhile the conflict evolves. Afer explains that such is the development ofFPV (first person view) drones, remotely piloted using an onboard camera,that the so-called kill zone now extends “12 to 14 kilometres” behind the front – the range at which a $500 drone, flying at up to 60mph, can strike. It means, Afer adds, that “all the logistics [food, ammunition and medical supplies] we are doing is either on foot or with the help of ground drones”.View image in fullscreenHeavy machine guns near the temporary base of the Da Vinci battalionFurther in the rear, at a rural dacha now used by Da Vinci’s soldiers, several types of ground drones are parked. The idea has moved rapidly from concept to trial to reality. They include remotely controlled machine guns, and flat bed robot vehicles. One,the $12,000 Termit, has tracks for rough terrain and can carry 300kg over 12 miles with a top speed of 7 miles an hour.Termit land drones equipped for cargo, assault and mine layingView image in fullscreenUkrainian defence ministry photograph of its Termit drone.Land drones save lives too. “Last night we evacuated a wounded man with two broken legs and a hole in his chest,” Afer continues. The whole process took “almost 20 hours” and involved two soldiers lifting the wounded man more than a mile to a land drone, which was able to cart the victim to a safe village. The soldier survived.While Da Vinci reports its position is stable, endless Russian attempts at infiltration have been effective at revealing where the line is thinly held or poorly coordinated between neighbouring units. Russian troops last month penetrated Ukraine’s lines north-east of Pokrovsk near Dobropillya by as much as 12 miles – a dangerous moment in a critical sector, just ahead of Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska.At first it was said a few dozen had broke through, but the final tally appears to have been much greater. Ukrainian military sources estimate that 2,000 Russians got through and that 1,100 infiltrators were killed in a fightback led by the 14th Chervona Kalyna brigade from Ukraine’s newly created Azov Corps – a rare setback for an otherwise slow but remorseless Russian advance.MapThat evening at another dachaused by Da Vinci, people linger in the yard while moths target the light bulbs. Inside, a specialist drone jammer sits on a gaming chair surrounded by seven screens arranged in a fan and supported by some complex carpentry.It is too sensitive to photograph, but the team leader Oleksandr, whose call sign is Shoni, describes the jammer’s task. Both sides can intercept each other’s feeds from FPV drones and three screens are dedicated to capturing footage that can then help to locate them. Once discovered, the operator’s task is to find the radio frequency the drone is using and immobilise it with jammers hidden in the ground (unless, that is,they are fibre optic dronesthat use a fixed cable up to 12 miles long instead of a radio connection).“We are jamming around 70%,” Shoni says, though he acknowledges that the Russians achieve a similar success rate. In their sector, this amounts to 30 to 35 enemy drones a day. At times, the proportion downed is higher. “During the last month, we closed the sky. We intercepted their pilots saying on the radio they could not fly,” he continues, but that changed after Russian artillery destroyed jamming gear on the ground. The battle, Shoni observes, ebbs and flows: “It is a war of drones now and there is a shield and there is a sword. We are the shield.”View image in fullscreenOleksandr, call sign Shoni, having a break at the kitchenA single drone pilot can operate 20 missions in 24 hours says Sean, who flies FPVs for Da Vinci, for several days at a stretch in a crew of two or three, hidden a few miles behind the frontline. Because the Russians are on the attack the main target is their infantry. Sean frankly acknowledges he is “killing at least three Russian soldiers” during that time, in the deadly struggle between ground and air. Does it make it easier to kill the enemy, from a distance? “How can we tell, we only know this,” says Dubok, another FPV pilot, sitting alongside Sean.Other anti-drone defences are more sophisticated. Ukraine’s third brigade holds the northern Kharkiv sector, east of the Oskil River, but to the west are longer-range defence positions. Inside, a team member watches over a radar, mostly looking for signs of Russian Supercam, Orlan and Zala reconnaissance drones. If they see a target, two dash out into fields ripe with sunflowers to launch an Arbalet interceptor: a small delta wing drone made of a black polystyrene, which costs $500 and can be held in one hand.View image in fullscreenBuhan, a pilot of the drone crew with the Arbalet interceptor at the positions of the 3rd Assault Brigade in Kharkiv regionView image in fullscreenArbalet interceptors at the dugout of the 3rd Assault Brigade in Kharkiv regionThe Arbalet’s top speed is a remarkable 110 miles an hour, though its battery life is a shortish 40 minutes. It is flown by a pilot hidden in the bunker via its camera using a sensitive hobbyists’ controller. The aim is to get it close enough to explode the grenade it carries and destroy the Russian drone. Buhan, one of the pilots, says “it is easier to learn how to fly it if you have never flown an FPV drone”.It is an unusually wet and cloudy August day, which means a rare break from drone activity as the Russians will not be flying in the challenging conditions. The crew don’t want to launch the Arbalet in case they lose it, so there is time to talk. Buhan says he was a trading manager before the war, while Daos worked in investments. “I would have had a completely different life if it had not been for the war,” Daos continues, “but we all need to gather to fight to be free.”So do the pilots feel motivated to carry on fighting when there appears to be no end? The two men look in my direction, and nod with a resolution not expressed in words.Explore more on these topicsUkraineDrones (military)EuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Now the one constant in digital publishing is undergoing a transformation that may completely change the landscape.”Last week, the owner of the Daily Mail revealed in its submission to the Competition and Markets Authority’s consultation on Google’s search services that AI Overviews have fuelled a drop in click-through traffic to its sites by as much as 89%.DMG Media and other leading news organisations, including Guardian Media Group and the magazine trade body the Periodical Publishers Association (PPA), have urged the competition watchdog tomake Google more transparentand provide traffic statistics from AI Overview and AI Mode to publishers as part ofits investigation into the tech firm’s search dominance.Publishers – already under financial pressure from soaring costs, falling advertising revenues, the decline of print and thewider trend of readers turning away from news– argue that they are effectively being forced by Google to either accept deals, including on how content is used in AI Overview and AI Mode, or “drop out of all search results”, according to several sources.On top of the threat to funding, there are concerns about AI’s impact on accuracy. While Google has improved the quality of its overviews since earlier iterations advised usersto eat rocks and add glue to pizza, problems with “hallucinations” – where AI presents incorrect or fabricated information as fact – remain, as do issues within-built bias, when a computer rather than a human decides how to summarise sources.View image in fullscreenGoogle Discover has replaced search as the main source of traffic click-throughs to content.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIn January, Apple promised to update an AI feature thatissued untrue summaries of BBC news alerts, stamped with the corporation’s logo, on its latest iPhones; alerts incorrectly claimed that the man accused of killing a US insurance boss had shot himself and that tennis star Rafael Nadal had come out as gay.In a blogpost last month, Liz Reid, Google’s head of search, said the introduction of AI in search was“driving more queries and quality clicks”.“This data is in contrast to third-party reports that inaccurately suggest dramatic declines in aggregate traffic,” she said. “[These reports] are often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the rollout of AI features in search.”However, she also said that while overall traffic to all websites is “relatively stable” she admitted that the “vast” web means that user trends are shifting traffic to different sites “resulting in decreased traffic to some sites and increased traffic to others”.In recent years, Google Discover, which feeds users articles and videos tailored to them based on their past online activity, has replaced search as the main source of click-throughs to content.However, David Buttle, founder of the consultancy DJB Strategies, says the service, which is also tied to publishers’ overall search deals, does not deliver the quality traffic that most publishers need to drive their long-term strategies.“Google Discover is of zero product importance to Google at all,” he says. “It allows Google to funnel more traffic to publishers as traffic from search declines … Publishers have no choice but to agree or lose their organic search. It also tends to reward clickbaity type content. It pulls in the opposite direction to the kind of relationship publishers want.”Meanwhile, publishers arefighting a wider battlewith AI companies seeking to plunder their content to train their large language models.The creative industry is intensively lobbying the government to ensure that proposed legislationdoes not allow AI firms to use copyright-protected workwithout permission, a move that would stop the “value being scraped” out of the £125bn sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is an existential crisis.”While publishers are pursuing action on multiple fronts – from dealmaking and legal action to regulatory lobbying – they are also implementing AI tools into newsrooms and creating their own query-answering tools. The Washington Post and the FT have launched their own AI-powered chatbots, Climate Answers and Ask FT, that source results only from their own content.Christoph Zimmer, chief product officer at Germany’s Der Spiegel, says that while its traffic is currently stable he expects referrals from all platforms to decline.“This is a continuation of a longstanding trend,” he says. “However, this affects brands that have not focused on building direct relationships and subscriptions in recent years even more strongly. Instead, they have relied on reach on platforms and sometimes generic content.“What has always been true remains true – a focus on quality and distinct content, and having a human in charge rather than just in the loop.”One publishing industry executive says the battle to strike deals to help train AI models to aggregate and summarise stories is rapidly being superseded by advances that are seeing models interpret live news.“The first focus has been on licensing deals for training AI, to ‘speak English’, but that is becoming less important over time,” says the executive. “It is becoming about delivering the news, and for that you need accurate live sources. That is a potentially really lucrative market which publishers are thinking about negotiating next.”Saj Merali, chief executive of the PPA, says a fair balance needs to be struck between a tech-driven change in consumers’ digital habits and the fair value of trusted news.“What doesn’t seem to be at the heart of this is what consumers need,” she says. “AI needs trustworthy content. There is a shift in how consumers want to see information, but they have to have faith in what they are reading.“The industry has been very resilient through quite major digital and technological changes, but it is really important we make sure there is a route to sustain models. At the moment the AI and tech community are showing no signs of supporting publisher revenue.”Explore more on these topicsNewspapers & magazinesDigital mediaGoogleSearch enginesArtificial intelligence (AI)AlphabetComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps instead she should ask her husband to stop gutting public educationSat 6 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 6 Sep 2025 13.27 EDTShareMelanAI is coming for your kids“The robots are here,”proclaimedMelania Trump during an AI event at the White House on Thursday. It can be hard to parse the first lady’s poker face and expressionless voice, but this certainly wasn’t a statement of regret. Rather Trump, reading from a script encased in a very analogue binder, was taking it upon herself to help America’s children navigate AI, which she touted as the “greatest engine of progress in the history of the United States of America”.“As leaders and parents, we must manage AI’s growth responsibly,” she said in her speech. “During this primitive stage, it is our duty to treat AI as we would our own children.”Does that mean foisting them off to anannyor, as Donald Trump once did with Donald Trump Jr, abandoningthem at the airportbecause they’re five minutes late? No, it means “empowering, but with watchful guidance”, apparently.Melania Trump doesn’t grace the White House with her presence particularly often. The first lady has made clear that she is not beholden to things like “duty” or “tradition” like her predecessors. She does what she wants, when she wants. And Thursday’s roundtable on AI is the latest indication that she wants to position herself as a leading figure in the future of technology. Like the rest of her family, the first lady has enthusiastically embraced NFTs and cryptocurrency – and their amazing ability to rapidly generate the Trumps an immenseamount of wealth. She’s alsoboastedabout using an AI version of her voice to narrate the audiobook version of Melania.And last monthshe launched an AI contest for kids in grades K-12.The first lady isn’t just positioning herself as a leading voice in technology; she’s trying to brand herself as the face of responsibleinnovation. While announcing her AI contest for kids, for example, she boasted that she’d “championed online safety through theTake It Down Act” (TDA). It’s true that Melania advocated for the TDA, which passed Congress with bipartisan support earlier this year and criminalizes the nonconsensual distribution of intimate imagery (NDII, once known as “revenge porn”.) Nevertheless, the legislation is rather more complicated than she’d have it seem.Image-base sexual abuse (both authentic imagery and AI-generated content) is a serious problem that scholars and activists have been trying to address via legislation for along time. While it’s commendable that Trump wanted to get involved with the TDA, some people believe she swooped in at the last minute and put her name to a dangerously bastardized version of a model statute that experts developed. Numerous civil rights activists havewarnedthat the TDA has been broadened so much that it will be weaponized against free speech.“I am gratified that the [TDA] incorporates much of the language of the model federal statute against NDII I first drafted in 2013,” wrote Dr Mary Anne Franks, president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, in astatementearlier this year. “But the Take It Down Act also includes a poison pill: an extremely broad takedown provision that will likely end up hurting victims more than it help.”TheElectronic Frontier Foundationhas similarly warned that the TDA is so broad that it gives the “powerful a dangerous new route to manipulate platforms into removing lawful speech that they simply don’t like”. Indeed, the president has said as much himself. “I’m going to use that bill for myself too if you don’t mind, because nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody,”he tolda joint session of Congress.All of which to say: Melania Trump may not be the best person to help manage AI’s growth responsibly and shield children from potential harm from the technology. But if she is keen on doing this work then I suggest she stop convening taskforces on how to integrate AI into childhood education, and simply ask her husband to stopgutting public educationinstead. The Trump administration is, for example, attempting todefund Head Start, a federally funded early childhood program for low-income families, andcancelleda grant program that has historically funded educational children’s programs like Sesame Street. The Trump administration is also trying tocurtail educationabout slavery and Republicans are waging war on Wikipedia totry to remove criticismof Israel. More broadly,book bansandcensorshipare flourishing under Trump.Melania Trump is right that the robots are here, and they’re here to stay. But I’m not convinced that the Trump administration is going to responsibly integrate AI into our schools in a way that increases equity and the sum of human knowledge. Rather I think it’s more likely that all these AI taskforces will succeed in doing is diverting large sums of taxpayer money towards the tech CEOs who have been busy bowing to Trump.AI “will make a few people much richer and most people poorer”, Christopher Hinton, the so-called godfather of AI, told the Financial Timeson Friday. Which, I suspect, is precisely why Melania Trump and the coterie of billionaires and tech executives gathered around her at the White House are so excited about it.Accused rapist Conor McGregor wants to be the next president of IrelandMcGregorrecently lost an appealover a civil court ruling last year awarding damages to a woman who accused him of rape.

Bi then had a healthy baby via another surrogate – who had an emergency hysterectomy in the process. It feels like for-profit surrogacy has been normalized by celebrities; this piece is an essential reminder of the ethical issues involved with the womb-for-hire industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rapists count on this being untrue – and Trump is proving them rightSat 6 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 6 Sep 2025 06.04 EDTShareRape is a crime against democracy in the most immediate sense of equality between individuals and the premise that we’re all endowed with certain inalienable rights. Most rapists operate on the premise that they can not only overpower the victim physically, but can do so socially and legally. They count on a system that discounts the voices of victims and only too often cooperates in silencing them, through shame, intimidation, threats, discrediting, the obscene legal instrument known as a nondisclosure agreement and a system too often run by men for men at the expense of women and children. That is to say, rapists count on getting away with it because of a system that hands them power and steals it from their victims. They count on a silencing system. On profound inequality.Which is what makes rape such a peculiar crime: it is the ritual enactment of the perpetrator’s power and the victim’s powerlessness, buttressed by the circumstances that puts and keeps each of them in those roles. It’s driven by the desire to use sexuality to cause physical and psychic injury, to dominate, to celebrate the rapist’s power and the victim’s powerlessness, to treat another human being as a person without rights, including the right to set boundaries, to say no and to speak up afterward. A society that perpetuates and protects this desire and arrangement is rape culture, and it’s been our culture throughout most of its existence.I dated Jeffrey Epstein. The files must be released | Stacey WilliamsRead moreDemocracy, in this context, means a society and system in which everyone’s rights matter, everyone’s voice is heard and everyone is equal under the law. Rapists count on this not being true, but is has become more true over the past half century, thanks to feminism, and changed a lot more over the past dozen years, thanks to more feminism. There has been a shift toward equality of of voice, rights and support from the legal system, from arresting officers to investigations, judges and juries (who, thanks to feminism, are no longer exclusively male). It hasn’t changed enough, but it’s changed a lot, which is how a hundred survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s rape club were able to gather with the support of Thomas Massie, a Republican congressperson from Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative from California, on Wednesday morning to speak to the world about their experiences and demand justice.They became victims, and some were abused for years, because of the power differential between Epstein and the girls and young women. His power consisted not only of his immense and still-unexplained wealth, but of aid from a host of others. Some actively cooperated in manipulating and abusing them, as groomer and pimp-in-chiefGhislaine Maxwelldid, along with the fellow rapists to whom Epstein offered these children and young women. Others knew and chose to protect him and his fellow abusers, and some still do, all the way to the very top.Mike Johnson, the House speaker, adjourned Congress earlier this summer to prevent votes on measures relating to Epstein and thereby protect Donald Trump. As the New Republicreportedon Tuesday, “House Speaker Mike Johnson is offering Republicans a cowardly out to avoid voting on a bipartisan discharge petition to release the Epstein files in full.” Johnson’s main concern in this (and pretty much everything else he does) is to protect Trump. He is not alone. Jamie Raskinsaidin July: “They’d conscripted a thousand FBI agents to be working around the clock 24 hours going through a hundred thousand Epstein documents and told them to flag any mentions of Donald Trump ... This might be one of the most massive cover-ups in the history of the United States unfolding before our eyes.”The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, ordered this frantic censorship scheme to protect Trump, which should have begotten a thousand front-page news stories demanding to know what exactly it took a thousand agents to hide from us and who exactly Trump is that he requires this kind of anti-democratic protection. Like Johnson, and like Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, who conducted a long, deeply wrong exculpatory softball interview with Maxwell, she’s serving one man rather than the 342 million people of this country. Trump himself, who over the summer seemed terrified and eager to distract from whatever there is to be found out about his role in all this, once again attempted to silence victims by calling the whole thing “a Democrat hoax” immediately after the news conference. Survivor Haley Robson called out Trump and declared: “I cordially invite you to the Capitol to meet me in person so you can understand this is not a hoax.”The women who spoke at Wednesday morning’s press conference made it clear they still fear they face threats, that the machinery of silencing is still at work. Katie Tarrant of the Washington Postwrites, “Lisa Phillips, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, and her lawyer Brad Edwards, said victims were scared to speak publicly about other abusers for fear of legal action. Her response came in response to a question about a client list some victims said they are compiling.” Another Post journalist reports, “Anouska De Georgiou, who said she was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, said she and her daughter were threatened when she volunteered to be a witness in a lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell.”And this attempt to suppress the truth about crimes and silence victims is only too consistent with the Republican party and theTrump administration. The attacks on immigrants, refugees, Black and brown people, women, trans people, the positioning of the administration as above the law with the cooperation of the rogue conservatives of the supreme court: all this is an attempt to roll back not only the democratic gains of the past several decades, but the democratic principles of universal rights and equality under the law embedded in the constitution and the Bill of Rights.Rendering women second-class or maybe 11th-class citizens again is at the heart of the current rightwing agenda, with its pursuit of criminalization of pregnancy, denial of reproductive rights including access to birth control, the right to choose whether to bear children, and life-saving care for women who have miscarriages or otherwise need a pregnancy terminated. But this is only part of the attack on women. The administration has disproportionately fired Black women from government jobs. 300,000 Black womenhave left– or been pushed out of – the workforce in the last three months.Pete Hegseth, who himself settledrape allegationsout of court, has fired women in high positions in the military, claims women are less qualified than men and hasbeen repostingvideos from Christian fanatics asserting women should not have the right to vote. Trump’s is quite literally a pro-crime administration, as major branches of federal government are pulled away from pursuing criminals to persecuting immigrants, often violating the law to do so. The administration has sought tocutfunding for and dismantle programs addressing domestic violence. And of course the Trump administration is headed by Donald J Trump – a judge found in a civil claim that it was “substantially true” that Trump raped journalist E Jean Carroll. It’s rapists all the way down, and enablers all the way up.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Prime minister Narendra Modi’s performative courting of King Donald, both in and out of office, suggested a special chemistry between these two titans of the hard right.As Trump set about remaking global trade and geopolitics by weaponising tariffs,Indiagot into trade negotiations with the US early. New Delhi accepted that negotiations would be difficult, given its red lines on agricultural and dairy products. Yet it was optimistic about getting a deal commensurate with India’s economic heft – and strategic value to the US as a counterweight to China.Instead, Trump first slapped India, in April, with a 25% tariff that in itself exceeded the rate levied on most US allies. This has nowdoubled to 50%, as punishment for India for buying, refining and exporting Russian oil during that country’s war on Ukraine. This tariff rate will make all nonexempt Indian exports to the US uncompetitive.Modi’s much-toutedspecial relationship with Trumpnow looks risible. Andit wasn’t just the tariffs. India’s short war with Pakistan after the Pahalgam terrorist atrocity in April saw Trump, and his vice-president JD Vance, treat India and Pakistan as squabbling south Asian neighbours that had to be brought to order by US intervention. Trump’s insistence that his telephoned threats had forced India and Pakistanto stop fightingseemed to bracket India and Pakistan as unruly nuisances, a humiliating equivalence thatIndia felt duty-bound to repudiate. It has sincebeen suggestedthat the real trigger for the 50% tariff was India denying Trump, desperate for a Nobel peace prize, credit for peacemaking.Trump made it clear that this was a punishment beating. He dismissed India as a “dead economy” while his chief trade adviser, Peter Navarro, accused India of war profiteering by buying discounted Russian oil. He even described the Ukrainian conflict as “Modi’s war”.This mortifying breakdown of relations has discredited Modi’s decade-long effort to play the well-connected world statesman. The energetic hugging and over-the-top bonhomie that characterised his photo ops with world leaders seem gauche in retrospect. But it would be a mistake to think of this turn in Indo-US relations purely in terms of a powerful individuals.Large countries such as India have geopolitical moorings that aren’t easily loosened. Non-alignment – India’s cold-war-era positioning as neither capitalist nor communist – isn’t a fashionable term in Modi’s India because of its Nehruvian antecedents, but his foreign policy has tried to maintain India’s freedom of action in a multipolar world. Non-alignment might now fly under the flag of “strategic autonomy” but its aim is not dissimilar. India’s ability to buy Russian oil, refine it and re-export it to Europe with the tacit blessing of the Biden administration was, until recently, seen as an example of this bloc-straddling suppleness.What changed was that over the past quarter of a century, India’s political class began to see the US as the country’s natural partner. It was the main destination of India’s exports and also the aspirational destination for the children of its ruling elite. Since the time of Modi’s predecessor, Manmohan Singh, who signed the Indo-US nuclear deal, India has tilted towards Washington. The Quad, a grouping of four countries – Japan, Australia, the US and India – designed to foil China’s designs in the Indo-Pacific, was widely read as a sign of this westward tilt.This tilt has led to a curious unbalancing of India’s foreign policy. Its feet firmly planted in strategic autonomy, India has leaned towards the US to get close and personal, via alliances that aren’t quite alliances, and vibes that aren’t matched by substance. India’s policymakers under Modi assumed that India’s aggregate economic heft and its growth rate had elevated it to the world’s top table.The fact is, India isn’t rich enough or white enough or English-speaking enough to be a charter member of either the west or the anglophone world. Modi’s mandarins forgot that – outside the charmed circle of the west – the US doesn’t have allies, it has clients. Trump’s decision to further raise tariffs on India out of resentmentwas a reminder that US presidents have often seen India as either a supplicant or a nuisance or both.Pundits argue that Trump is a maverick, that the Indo-US relationship is too important both economically and geopolitically for this froideur to last. It’s much more likely that Trump is ahead of the curve, that he is saying out loud what other western leaders are still too constrained by liberal convention to utter.Western benevolence has always been predicated on western hegemony. Once the climate crisis and China’s rise made it clear that the west’s supremacy wasn’t future-proofed; once the promise of steady economic growth, the modern measure of secular progress, became unredeemable, western centrists began to secede from the world order they had created in their pomp. Gaza is the sum of this secession. The WTO, overseas aid, due process for asylum seekers, international humanitarian law, the UN system – the whole postwar order built by the west and led by the US – is being cast aside as rich countries circle their wagons against a needy, unruly world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump-like and Trump-lite demagogues have become inevitable. Nigel Farage, Jordan Bardella, Alice Weidel, Viktor Orbán are living proof that Trump’s mix of nativism and protectionism is the reality that India and non-western countries more generally will have to contend with for the foreseeable future. (One of the revelations of Trump’s second term has been the willingness of European leaders to abase themselves to propitiate the US.)For all the liberal hand-wringing about Trump’s crudities, where he leads, the European political class will follow. Trump’s tariffs aren’t whims, they are portents. They are bricks in the wall that the west is building to fortify its compound.Modi, like Indian prime ministers before him, is learning that geography can’t be transcended, that non-alignment isn’t a choice – it is a necessity. India’s place in the world will often present it with grim, constrained choices. It can’t square up to the US, as China does, as an equal. Nor can it kowtow to Trump as the EU has, like a client looking for protection. India will continue to walk a tightrope, teetering this way then that, as it negotiates a hostile world under the watchful eyes of its vulnerable people.Mukul Kesavan is an Indian historian, novelist and political and social essayistExplore more on these topicsIndiaOpinionNarendra ModiTrump tariffsSouth and central AsiaAsia PacificDonald TrumpTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

My son will be just seven months old, too young to know why there’s a card on my bedside table or why my partner insists I don’t change nappies for a day. And yet, while I step into this new role, I’m also carrying the absence of my own dad.Beyond everything I miss about him, what hurts most is that he never got to meet his grandson. I would give just about anything to see his enormous, room-filling smile while he plays with my little boy.Father’s Day is meant to be a celebration, but for many, it’s complicated. Grief doesn’t pause for joy, and joy doesn’t erase grief; they coexist. I spoke to a senior lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of the Sunshine Coast,Dr Catherine Houlihan, who said, “Grief doesn’t follow a predictable pattern of emotions; instead feelings come and go in different ways as a person processes their loss.”I’m a grandmother now, but this Mother’s Day I will miss my mum as keenly as any childRead moreMy first Father’s Day marks an important milestone, and while I know that grief doesn’t follow a “predictable pattern”, I can feel the emotions building to this day. So, here are the five ways I decided to honour both my son and my dad this Father’s Day.1. Telling his storiesMy dad loved a good yarn; they were half-true, half-embellished and sometimes exaggerated beyond recognition. He wrote books, he survived Cyclone Tracy, he rode a motorbike solo across the Nullarbor as a 15-year-old boy, at different points in his life he was a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker, and his profession for more than 30 years of his life was a clown. So, there are plenty of stories to tell.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads“Storytelling forms part of narrative therapy, a type of psychotherapy shown to be effective in managing symptoms of grief,” says Houlihan. So, on Father’s Day, I’ll take my son to the place we scattered his ashes and tell one of those stories out loud. My son won’t understand yet, but one day he will. Speaking Dad’s name keeps his presence alive.2. Carrying on his traditionsDad had small rituals that made him who he was, like putting absolutely anything he could find in the fridge on his pizza when it was his turn to cook dinner. Or the unusual tradition that he created of not eating the bottoms of ice-cream cones, as he said that would be considered “bad luck” (I haven’t eaten a single one since).This Father’s Day, I’ll eat an ice-cream in his honour, and of course I’ll throw away the bottom. And I’ll be sure to tell my son one day thatthis was your poppy’s thing.3. Creating new ritualsWhile I honour my father’s legacy, I also want to create new and everlasting memories with my son. This year it might be something simple, like going to our first footy game, or perhaps cooking breakfast together.These may grow over the years, whether it is in year one, year two or when more kids start running around in our halls. Creating new rituals is a critical part of building our family unit and making lasting memories. Grief reminds me not to wait: traditions can begin now, even before he remembers them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Making space for sadnessCelebrations don’t erase pain. If I need to let some emotion go on the day then I will, because this was the day we celebrated with him every year for my entire life. And then it meant something different when he passed. And now it means so much more again. It’s complex. It’s sadness. It’s happiness.“Accepting when negative feelings arise rather than trying to push them away can help process them,” Houlihan says.Dadhood and me: how becoming a father made me reflect on my own childhoodRead moreAllowing grief to sit alongside joy is the most honest way to move through this day. But instead of pretending it’s all balloons and breakfast in bed, I’ll acknowledge the reality check, pay my tribute to him with a Sprite and a jam cream doughnut, and celebrate such an incredible life and a great dad.5. Looking forward with fondness and gratitudeDespite the ache, I feel grateful to be a dad and to have had one who taught me countless lessons worth passing on. He wore his heart on his sleeve, for better or worse, and he shaped who I am today. There’s no shortage of things to be grateful for.Houlihan reiterates this: “Research shows gratitude can improve mental health, reduce negative emotions such as anxiety and depression, and boost positive mood.”Grief and celebration can live on the same day. This year I’ll shed a tear, laugh with my son and remember my dad. Because being a father isn’t just about who we are now – it’s about the fathers who shaped us and the stories we carry forward.Samuel Bernard is a literary agent, book critic and freelance writerExplore more on these topicsFather's DayOpinionFamilyParents and parentingDeath and dyingcommentShareReuse this content"

I was in a rehearsal room in London surrounded by the shellshocked and outraged. The media I read on the tube home reiterated what I’d heard all day: these leave voters were ignorant and racist. My townvoted just over 70% for leave. Three years later the constituencyvoted Conservativefor the first time in its history. In a recent council election itvoted Reform. There comes a time when the unthinkable becomes inevitable.My town is in the East Midlands. Where it was once coal mining and manufacturing that provided work for many people, it is nowa huge distribution warehouse for Sports Direct. Many eastern European people have made Shirebrooktheir home and work at the warehouse. I have been thinking about towns such as mine – and there are many of them – with the recent outpouring of anger and xenophobia towards asylum seekers and migrants.One of the things I treasure most about writing plays is the opportunity to suspend judgment – my characters speak and I listen; my characters do and I watch. I find it freeing and am astonished how much they have surprised me: characters are as vast as we allow them to be – and people in real life are no different. Yet we are often at pains to shrink people, simplify them: I can do it in my own life as well. It allows us to tell that joke or “win” that argument.View image in fullscreenShirebrook, Derbyshire in 2019.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianI have no argument to win in my play, Till the Stars Come Down–and the jokes are never at the characters’ expense.The play takes place on the day of a wedding between a local woman and a Polish immigrant. It is the story of a multigenerational working-class family grappling with a changing community and world, as well as their own swelling desires and losses. It is passionate and hilarious and deeply political, but you won’t hear characters arguing about Brexit or Reform. They are living politics, not commenting on them.I’m inspired by Chekhov, whose plays are not immediately thought of as political. He doesn’t tell us what his own political opinions are and his characters very rarely do. And yet the plays are about families living through significant cultural and economic changes in societies that are on the brink of revolution. When Chekhov is writing, the first Russian Revolution of 1905 is still some time away, but listen carefully and you will hear the bomb ticking underneath the floorboards of the families’ homes.I think there is a ticking to be heard now, not under dusty floorboards, but in the bellies of the people I am writing about. They want more, and often demand it. They are unfiltered and flammable. There are moments in the play where they sense their own place in the cosmos, when their lives have a sudden grandeur and mystery, and also moments when they feel small and frustrated, and they lash out.It’s not often I see that range of experience in our cultural landscape. When I do see representations of white working-class lives in the Midlands or the north of England, they are often set in the past. As if there’s a great uncertainty about who these people are now: better to revert back to when we did know. But we have to get to know them because they aren’t only in the past; it’s quite possible that they are going to define the future.I can be suspicious of pronouncements about the arts changing society. But I do believe the theatre can be a place where, among other things, we sit and listen to people we wouldn’t otherwise encounter and experience their life with them as it unfolds in front of us. We can’t change channels, block them online, cross the road; wecanstill shrink them with our prejudices, refuse their vastness, but many of us won’t. Instead we will sit in the dark, laughing and crying, falling in love with them one moment, only to be infuriated the next. A lot like spending time with your own family.View image in fullscreenA scene from Beth Steel’s Till the Stars Come Down at the National Theatre.Photograph: Manuel HarlanI never imagined this play would be performed around the world, from Tokyo to Athens to Montreal. That failure of imagination stemmed from not believing that a story about a particular working-class family in a particular Midlands town could be seen as universal. How could I not know that we are all profoundly different and exactly the same? The larger human family we are a part of cuts across cultures and classes when it lays bare our emotional lives: what it is to feel joy, shame, love, grief, desire, to fear the future rushing towards us – and not be ready for it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is made out of the present; it is in fact today. Often in Greek tragedy, human beings attain knowledge of their situation all too late. In my play, set in another fearsome summer, characters often remark on the heat, on fire, as if they already know their world is about to go up in flames – and yet they do not change course. We have been trying to put out fires too, local and global, and carrying on much the same. I think by now it’s clear where that leads.If the end is the beginning, I will leave you with the first line of my play: “I can smell burning.”Beth Steel is a playwright.Till the Stars Come Downis at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London until 27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreOpinionBeth SteelcommentShareReuse this content"

But the real problem is a system that pits tenants against each otherSat 6 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 6 Sep 2025 12.32 EDTShareLast week, I came across a flurry of ads on the house-share site SpareRoom sounding less like they were for cosy, inviting living arrangements than for boarding schools. “Please note – no surprise guests, no music and no use of the living room because it doubles as a bedroom,” wrote one “current flatmate”. Reading it, I wondered if there would be a curfew too.The tendency of some landlords to police their tenants’ behaviour has been well documented, imposing rules that range from the reluctantly accepted, such as no pets allowed, to the absurd: not using the kitchen at night; ideally being away at weekends; and, in one case,effectively restricting use of the toiletdue to a noise ban after 8.30pm extending to the sound of walking.But ads from flatmates stipulating rules for house-sharing are becoming more common. One person requests that her new flatmate isn’t a big kitchen user. “I’m in and out of the kitchen within 10 minutes,” she clarifies. “Ideally looking for someone similar.” What I personally can cook in just 10 minutes, I’m not sure – but perhaps that’s the point.Of the new rules being set, limitations on working from home have emerged as the most restrictive. Out of the 30 ads for house-shares I trawl through a day, more than half say that a suitable flatmate is someone who “ideally works full-time out of the house”. Hopefully, you’re kind, friendly and considerate, butideally,you’re not actually there. Welcome to a rental market where you have the privilege of paying for a room you’re ideally not using for anything but sleep.On the one hand, the “no WFH” camp argues these rules are just about maintaining the home as a space for rest, recreation and domestic order, rather than office chatter: no one wants to be tiptoeing around someone’s Teams conversations in the living room, or being privy to a six-hour call on synergies. But for the vast majority of people who work from their bedrooms rather than in communal areas in the house, it’s hard to see why working from home has become such a deal breaker.Much of this dispute of course comes down to money. Rent continues to chip away at income, with tenants in England spending an average of36% of their earningson housing, climbing to 42% if you live in London. Renting is expensive enough, and so the argument goes that if you’re spending more time at home then you’re probably using more utilities, and disproportionately adding to bills. Take one scenario from the Guardian’s You Be the Judge series earlier this year. One flatmate, lamenting the “constant boiling of the kettle”, started countinghow many cups of teatheir flatmate drinks in a day (eight, if you’re curious) when they work from home.But if we are breaking down everything into bite-size, invoiceable proportions, where do we draw the line? What happens when someone’s partner comes over for a few nights? What happens to the person who loves batch-cooking weeks in advance? I don’t think it’s simply about people being hostile or inconsiderate to their flatmates: it’s that it’s difficult to shake off the nagging sense of being one light-switch flick away from an eye-watering bill when the cost of everything is always soaring.The explosion of rules on SpareRoom hasn’t emerged from nowhere. It’s a symptom of a wider malaise – a broader sense of dissatisfaction and powerlessness against a backdrop of unaffordable housing, financial uncertainty and life milestones that are perpetually delayed. No one, it seems, has quite become comfortable with the joys of house-sharing either: a recent survey of 2,000 renters aged 20 to 40 by the co-living brand Ark found that74% had issueswith it, with flatmates monopolising the shower or raising energy bills being sources of resentment.Perhaps, then, it makes sense that people are clinging to the things they can control about their housing conditions – so they’ll vet prospective flatmates to eliminate anyone who works “flexibly” or insists on preheating the oven. You can’t argue with the property market or fix the damp in a flat without being subjected to a degrading six-month-long email chain with an uncaring landlord. But you can set out rules that’ll give you some sense of agency.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But those of us who do will more than likely want to celebrate them in life or memory. And the official days (as commercially driven as they are) offer a collective opportunity to do that.Yet on these days it’s unfair and naive to assume that everyone’s memories of their parents are filled with puppy dogs, magical birthday parties, beautiful holidays and (most importantly of all) emotional nurture.After Dad died I dressed like an extra from The Matrix. Now I’m blooming again like the flowers on my psychedelic new vest | Nick BuckleyRead morePeople who have experienced childhoods with absent, abusive and otherwise negligent parents (regardless of class and culture) will tell you that having no present parents would have been preferable.I’ll give those adults a thought on Sunday, Father’s Day, amid all of the online posting of happy snaps of people lucky enough to have lovely or pleasant or just present dads. I’m not judging. I post an old pic of me with Dad on my personal account for family and close friends most years. Our Dad, a sweet and gentle and popular man, died 17 years ago and we still miss him of course.But this year I had other, imperfect, dads in my head.Maybe it’s because floating around my bowerbird consciousness of late has been a magnificent short novel (The Spinning Heartby the Irish author Donal Ryan) that I’d read in preparation for an event at a writers’ festival that self-detonatedwhen it unsuccessfully sought tosilence Palestinian Australian novelist and activistRanda Abdel-Fattah.The Spinning Heart is about life in an Irish village and many things besides. Not least fathers and sons.It opens with two of the most compelling, harrowing sentences I can recall in a novel: “My father still lives back the road past the weir in the cottage I was reared in. I go there every day to see is he dead and every day he lets me down.”This Father’s Day a thought track led me back to conversations I’ve shared with men who aren’t dads and women who are not mums (for multiple reasons), and how such special days of parental celebration can be tinged with a sense of melancholy or loss.My kids might say, “Happy Father’s Day” if they are around. I might be given a punch in the shoulder or a beer (which I’ve bought!) from the fridge while I’m watching the footy. And that’s sweet. But on Father’s Day I also tend to recall the many other men and women who have been part of our kids’ lives – mentors who have helped guide them along their paths. Aunties and uncles the adult kids affectionately call them, although they are biologically unrelated, all of them part of the human web that has been woven into the safety net of their lives.Becoming an aunty unlocked a deranged kind of love. It’s a pleasure to cop the moods and mess | Emily MulliganRead moreThere’s something special about all of those aunts and uncles: a unique lens that perhaps, due to close biological proximity of mums and dads to progeny, brings a sharper emotional perspective and capacity for sage advice and ... just more love.As an adult I’ve beendrawn to many older people(men and women) for wisdom and guidance, personal and professional. This began long before my parents died, and when they did, the continued warm embrace of such mentorship and guidance took on another world of importance.Some of these people remain hugely important to me as I age.My children will, I know, be similarly fortunate.So, ahead of another Father’s Day, here’s to all of the men and women of emotional influence, caregivers, uncles and aunties, all of the mentors who may not be biological parents but who immutably shape and better our lives.For they, too, are appreciated in a very special way.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsFather's DayOpinionAustralian lifestyleParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

In a “blue shirt, white tee” (fans will get the reference), he is softly spoken with a hint of a Geordie accent. Herron is often described as the heir to John le Carré and“the best spy novelist of his generation”, according to the New Yorker. Unlike le Carré, he’s not, and never has been, a spy. Mysteriously, though, Wikipedia has given him “an entirely fictitious” birthday. “I got cards. I got a cake,” he says.For the uninitiated, the novels andaward-winning TV seriesfollow a bunch of misfit spooks exiled to Slough House from MI5 for various mishaps and misdemeanours, so far away from the shiny HQ in Regent’s Park that it may as well be in Slough. The joke is that these hapless underdogs (nicknamed “slow horses”), under the grubby reins of Lamb, always triumph over the slicker agents and “the Dogs” at the Park.“In its bare headlines, it’s not that promising is it?” Herron says modestly. “A bunch of people who aren’t very good at their jobs and don’t like each other, forced to work in an office. I mean, why would you want to read it?” It’s great fun, for starters. In a genre dominated by sinister psychological dramas and slick spin-offs, Herron’s mix of high jeopardy, low comedy and political satire might be described as a breath of fresh air, if the air in Slough House was not fetid with farts and frustration.Will Smith, co-writer of The Thick of It and Veep, was the ideal person to bring Herron’s world to the screen: Lamb is MI5’s Malcom Tucker, only dirtier. A cold war wreck, held together by booze, fags and loyalty to his “joes”, Lamb is one of the great characters of contemporary fiction.Like a modern-day Falstaff or Fagin, he is now part of the public imagination, thanks to an affectionate portrayal byGary Oldmanalongside a regally icy Kristin Scott Thomas as MI5 chief Diana Taverner in the TV show.This autumn, Oldman and co return with season five, based on the fifth Slough House novel,London Rules. On the back of its success, Apple TV+ will also launch an adaptation of Herron’s lesser-known 2003 debutDown Cemetery Road, with Emma Thompson as Oxford private detective Zoë Boehm. And this week, the author publishes the ninth in the Slough House series, Clown Town.The new novel is inspired by the true story of an IRA informant and murderer, codenamedStakeknife, real name Freddie Scappaticci. “An appalling human being”, Herron says, who was given protection by the British intelligence services in the 70s and 80s, in one of “the most morally dubious operations that the intelligence services had been involved in”, as one senior civil servant told him. Perfect Herron material. Players in the Slough House novels tread the murky line between protecting the nation and the interests of GCHQ.Stakeknife died“peacefully in his bed” in 2023 after Herron was well under way with Clown Town. The author didn’t stick too closely to historical events. “It hampers the imagination,” he says. “Also, I’m quite lazy when it comes to research.”You don’t have to know anything about politics to be a victim of political terror, to have bombs go off around youClown Town opens with a leftwing government finding its feet, a PM with a penchant for designer specs and “who happens to be a lawyer”, says Herron. There might be a new broom at No 10, but the dark corners of the British establishment are as grimy as ever. “I’m writing about how power corrupts,” he says. “It’s hardly an original observation, but it doesn’t matter who’s in power. Things are going to go wrong, either wilfully or by cock-up. I’m more prone towards the cock-up view of history than I am conspiracy, but that doesn’t alter the effect.”Herron may not have any experience of working for the intelligence service, but he has done his time in an office. “In many ways, I’m writing more about office life than about spies,” he says. “The intelligence service is essentially a big office. They’ll have a kitchen with fridges. The same things are going to happen as in any other office. I imagine,” he adds. James Bond it is not.Getting Herron to admit his books have been a runaway hit is like trying to persuade Lamb to take a shower. “Failure is always more interesting to me than success,” he maintains. “It would be stupid to deny that I am now successful, but I was that far away from being a failure,” he says, holding his thumb and forefinger together. “It could all have gone very differently. I was very lucky.”His is one of the great success stories of recent publishing history: an inspiration to slow horses everywhere. On his walk to the office of the legal journal where he worked as a subeditor for many years, he would pass an unhappy-looking building on Aldersgate Street. “I didn’t know I was going to write a book, let alone a series of books about it,” he says, of what would become Slough House. “I’ve been ‘living’ there ever since.” It is the very building on the TV show. “They went the extra mile there. They could have shown any building; they didn’t.” On the train back to Oxford each evening he would mull over his ideas so that by the time he got home, he knew exactly where he was going. “I had an hour of work in me,” he says, which averaged 360 words a day.After trying his hand at poetry and literary fiction, he turned to crime with his Zoë Boehm series. On 7 July 2005 he was waiting on the platform at Paddington when the bomb exploded at Edgware Road, one tube stop away. “You don’t have to know anything about politics to be a victim of political terror, to have bombs go off around you,” he says. “That made me realise I could write about events like that without necessarily understanding how they would come about.” So he changed tack and started writing espionage novels.View image in fullscreenHerron with Gary Oldman on the Slow Horses set.Photograph: Jack English/AppleSlow Horses was published in 2010. But he couldn’t find a UK publisher for its sequel, Dead Lions, a couple of years later. “What even is this?” one publisher asked, unable to work out if it was a thriller or a comedy. “The books didn’t sell at first,” Herron says mildly now. “It didn’t surprise me. I wasn’t wailing and gnashing my teeth or anything. I was just getting on with my life.”An editor at John Murray happened to pick up Slow Horses at Liverpool Street station and decided to back it. The first two novels were republished in 2015. The following year, Herron took a four-month sabbatical to try writing fiction full time. By 11am of the first morning he knew he could do it and on his return to the office he handed in his notice.But it was in 2016 that things really took off. “It was Brexit,” the author says definitively. “The country’s misfortune was my good luck.” His post-referendum novelLondon Ruleswas published in 2018. Suddenly, his populist floppy-haired, bicycle-riding MP, Peter Judd, seemed all too familiar. The echoes between PJ and BJ were impossible to ignore. Herron was at Balliol College, Oxford at the same time as Boris Johnson, not part of the Bullingdon set. “PJ was just my sort of rightwing bogeyman figure,” he says now. “Public-school educated, a sense of entitlement, self-obsession, complete disregard for ethics or morality or integrity.” He looks over the rooftops and their old college. “I mean, Boris Johnson fits that,” he says. “But so do many other politicians.”Just as le Carré’s novels resonated with the disillusionment and failure of the 70s, Herron captured the anger and frustration felt by many across the country. By the time the TV series launched in 2022, he was in full control of his material. “I’m more popular now, but I don’t feel that I’ve disconnected from the characters because of that,” he says. “When I sit down to write, I still feel like exactly the same person I’ve always been.”Growing up in Newcastle upon Tyne, the fourth child in a Catholic family of six, Herron describes his childhood as a happy one. His father was an optician, his mother a nursery school teacher who taught him to read before he started school. He read obsessively, preferring a fictional world to reality. “There was nothing wrong with the real world,” he says, “but I’d certainly rather have read a story than been at school.”View image in fullscreenThe cast of Slow Horses.Photograph: Jack English/PRIn 1979 he sat down with his parents to watch the TV serialisation of le Carré’sTinker Tailor Soldier Spy. He was hooked. The next day he borrowed a copy from his local library. He watched the BBC’s 1982 adaptation of Smiley’s People on a tiny portable black-and-white TV in a student house in Oxford. It is almost too neat a twist that Oldman playedSmileyin the 2011 film.“He was exactly the right novelist to be writing his books at that time,” Herron says of le Carré. “He saw the Berlin Wall going up. That was a gift to all of us. Brexit doesn’t compare,” he says, brushing off any parallels with his own historical moment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Rereading Smiley’s People,Herron was delightedto spot a foul-mouthed taxi driver called J Lamb, lurking in his subconscious all those years.Lamb was born, Herron says, out of “an unfiltered love of language”. He is the only character into whose mind the author doesn’t venture. To know if he means the outrageous things he says would be to “render the character useless”, Herron says. “Either he’s an absolutely despicable human being or he’s just pretending.” Some readers assumed he was a mouthpiece for Herron’s own views and sent him vile letters in support. Jumping between the different characters’ perspectives – Lamb’s faithful secretary Catherine Standish and tech geek Roddy Ho are his favourites – makes the reader work harder and is against all the rules of creative writing, the author points out. “And I love doing things that are against the rules.”One of which is killing off your core characters, even one of the good guys such as Min Harper. He wants the reader to have a sense that “nobody’s safe”. But it isn’t just for shocks. “It was about grief,” he says. His father died a few years before he started writing the series, but the decision was mainly a literary one. “I thought: I’ve got these people now. If I kill one of them, how are the others going to feel?”I like writing genre stuff. I like the structure, and knowing a book will have an actual ending, rather than just stopDuring lockdown Herron moved in with his partner Jo Howard (a publishing headhunter) and now writes in his old flat. His commute is a 10-minute walk and he aims for between 500 and 600 words a day. LikeZadie SmithandJonathan Franzen, he doesn’t have a smartphone and there’s no wifi. “We hang out and fax each other,” he shoots back. More unusually, he reads throughout the day. “I can go straight from the laptop to the sofa,” he says. “I’m a reader before I’m a writer. Reading words keeps my brain alert.”He doesn’t have to worry about money like he used to, and he gets to meet other writers, “which is great fun”. But for the most part, he leads a quiet life with Howard and their two cats (if hewerea spy the cats would be his soft spots). Howard is his first reader, but he never discusses a book until it’s finished. She is a keen walker, and can tell when he hits a tricky point in a novel by his pace. “I’m a plodder,” he says of his writing.At the moment he is working on a non-Slow Horses novel. “It’s about spies,” he reveals, helpfully. “I like writing genre stuff,” he says. “I like having that structure. I like knowing that a book is going to have an actual ending rather than just stop.”He was surprised to discover how much he enjoyed being part of the writers’ room for the TV series.“I never felt particularly collaborative even when I was in an office.” He will miss showrunner Smith, whorecently announcedthat season five would be his last.Herron even had a couple of cameo appearances. You would be forgiven for not spotting him and Howard in the first episode, coming out of Lamb’s favourite Chinese restaurant. In season four, they are leaving a hotel. He got to hail a taxi, he says, repeating the action now. They each had their own trailers. Could he ever have imagined such a scenario? “There was never a moment in my previous life where I thought this was possible,” he says.Seasons five and six are in the can (the latter based on two novels, Joe Country and Slough House). Filming of season seven, adapting Bad Actors, is due to begin this month, which leaves only Clown Town to be adapted. Does he have an endgame in sight?“There’s an awareness that there should be an endgame.” But there’s no danger he’s putting his horses out to grass for a while yet. He was tempted to blow up Slough House at the end of the first novel, to close with Lamb and Standish, the only survivors, running away on a ferry. “That didn’t happen,” he deadpans. “It would have been a good ending, actually. But my life would be very different.”Clown Town is published by Baskerville on Thursday. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.

This sexy oedipal thriller may be too shocking for vanilla viewersRobin Wright has a steamy relationship with her son as he embarks on a new romance with Olivia Cooke. This drama is the perfect show – and I say this with love – for pervertsRhik SamadderSat 6 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareThe thriller genre is amazingly malleable. You can start with an escaped monkey, a mystery corpse in frozen tundra, or just two women who can’t bear to be in a room together. You can make your own rules, as long as you do it with style, and take us somewhere surprising. Like using a tricycle to break into the Met Gala.The Girlfriend (Prime Video, from Wednesday 10 September), is a great example. It takes a relatable premise – what if your mother and your partner don’t get on? – and pushes it to extremity. When privileged surgeon Daniel takes new girlfriend Cherry, played byOlivia Cooke, to meet his family, things are tense from the outset. Daniel’s mother, Laura, is extremely protective, and senses Cherry is hiding something. The women strain to remain outwardly polite while their real relationship grows into one of covert threats, secrets and lies, outmanoeuvring and betrayal. There are chills. But it’s also hot.The show will appeal, and I say this lovingly, to perverts. Much of its steam comes from teasing the relationship between Daniel (Laurie Davidson) and his possessive mother, played by an imperious Robin Wright. Even Daniel’s father – with whom Laura has an open arrangement – remarks that it’s weird. We first see mother and son together when he surprises her in her private pool, practising her stroke. They wrestle underwater, and later relax in the sauna, her foot resting on his thigh. Cherry sees them kiss on the lips. There are many scenes where Laura and Cherry lock eyes while one or the other is having an intimate moment with Daniel.The show winks at us, enjoying its mischief. Cherry goes on a Spanish holiday with Daniel’s extended family, including Laura’s best friend and her daughter Brigitte. Cherry is mortified to learn that Daniel lost his virginity to Brigitte. He reassures her “she’s the closest thing I have to a sister”. If incest-tickling isn’t your bag, you may wish to find a more vanilla twisty thriller. Perhaps it’s crass to even name it, but if you’re in the market for a loaf of white bread, it can be a shock to open up a sack of oedipal snakes. I’ll be watching the entire series, purely for work reasons, you understand.View image in fullscreenLaurie Davidson and Olivia Cooke in The Girlfriend.Photograph: Prime VideoThe Girlfriend is not courting the clammy-handed, though. Its theme is how dangerous any of us might become – or be perceived to be – in protecting what we love. It’s a slippery, clever game of consequences and when violence arrives, it ups the stakes. It uses the Rashomon effect to scale its story. Within each episode, we shift between Laura and Cherry’s perspective – each announced with a bold red title card, like a Sergio Leone film or Lana Del Rey album cover. Going over the same events from opposing points of view makes us question reality. Is Cherry a gold-digging psychopath? Is Laura a smothering narcissist with a vendetta? Both could be true, or neither.‘We had to up the ante’: Robin Wright on her tense TV tale of incest and violence among London’s billionairesRead moreAmbiguities can keep us up all night, baby. Did we catch a knowing smirk on a colleague’s face? A double meaning to an offhand remark? Was the kiss on the lips? The show’s structure raises another question with an existential sting: who is the protagonist and who the antagonist here? We see ourselves as main characters, our actions perfectly understandable. But everyone thinks this: every dipshit playing crap music off a phone on the bus, every romantic prospect who ghosts, every unreasonable ex, antisocial neighbour or Stasi-like boss. They’re all main characters, and we’re in their way. Brrr.The Girlfriend has a twisting plot, unreliable narrators, hair-raising revelations. It probes status and influence. Cherry is young, beautiful and working class – implicitly a threat to old money gatekeepers. It also suggests how grief within families can cast a long, dark shadow. Any show that pits one woman against another, with a man as the prize, is a risk. But this show is agile. Based on the Michelle Francesnovel, it has been adapted byGabbie Asherand rising star Naomi Sheldon, a performer-writer who co-hostsThe Pleasure Podcast. Robin Wright directs half of the series. It is, in every sense, a sophisticated power play.You may want to skip it on family viewing night, unless you like awkward conversations. But who’s to say they can’t be thrilling too?Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherRobin WrightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But then came the shocking diagnosis. Now fully recovered, she’s re‑evaluating everythingSat 6 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTShareIt all starts with the coil. Of course it does. This is Davina, and Davina McCall doesn’t do personal by halves. “I loved the coil, but people always used to go, ‘I’m not getting the coil,ugh.’I always wondered why it wasn’t more popular.” So, it was June 2023 and McCall was getting her preferred method of contraception replaced –on TV, naturally, for a documentary. “I asked my children’s permission. ‘Can Mummy get her coil refitted on television?’ They all rolled their eyes, like: ‘God! Here she goes again.’”Post-fitting, her friend Dame Lesley Regan, a gynaecologist, suggested that McCall have a health screening at the state-of-the-art women’s health clinic where she worked, in exchange for a talk she would give on menopause. To be honest, McCall says, she thought the idea ridiculous. “I was like: ‘Honestly, I don’t need that. I’m the healthiest woman you’ve ever met. I don’t go to the doctor, I have a good immune system, I eat well.’”It’s 10 months now since McCall had her brain tumour removed. Although benign, the colloid cyst was huge. If left untreated, it could have eventually killed her. The TV presenter says she’s still trying to process everything: how fluky it was that it was spotted; what could have happened if it hadn’t been, or if she had refused the op (she almost did); and how her brain has been changed.We meet at a studio in London where she’s having her photo taken. She arrives wearing a candy floss-coloured shirt, black skort and Ibiza tan. She looks ludicrously fit, like she could knock off a triathlon before breakfast. Today, at 57, McCall’s addiction is health and fitness. It used to be booze and heroin.View image in fullscreen‘I looked at my life and thought: have I done everything I want to do? And I thought: yeah, I have.’ Dress: Claire Mischevani. Earrings: Giovanni RaspiniI’ve never met McCall before, but within seconds I feel I’ve known her for life. And in a way I have. McCall is one of the few celebrities whose public persona is pretty much the same as their private one. She grabs my hand, and leads me to the sofa where we’re going to talk. I feel like a contestant onBig Brother, which she presented for 10 years and 16 series (including the celebrity version). I half expect her to tell me that we’re live on Channel 4, so please don’t swear. In fact, this is probably the biggest difference between TV and real versions. The real McCall swears like a drunken nun.She stares at my bag disbelievingly, as I pull out a second recorder. “Fucking hell, you taping me in stereo?” McCall is a great talker. You can turn your two recorders on and pop out for a couple of hours and she’s sure to have filled them with spellbinding if scatological stories. Her tales (of which there are many) invariably have tangents. And the tangents usually have their own tangents. So, somehow, she segues from the coil to The Lowdown (“It’s thisamazing website, like a TripAdvisor for your vagina”), to the respect she has for her children’s privacy (“I’ve never posted any pictures of my son. He didn’t choose to be famous; I did”), her desire to shock as a teenage girl, Donny Osmond, her years at MTV, before getting back to the coil (around an hour later) to explain how it led to her diagnosis.McCall was working as a judge on the TV series The Masked Singer when she got her diagnosis. She was told only about three people in a million get a colloid cyst, a non-cancerous fluid-filled sac that typically develops in the brain’s third ventricle. She was shocked, but the word she heard loudest was “benign”. In that case, she told herself, she didn’t have to do anything about it. She agreed to speak to a couple of brain surgeons, but her starting point was that they wouldn’t be operating on her. “I spoke to an amazing surgeon in America and said I need an honest opinion on whether I should have this operation. She said, ‘Are you sure you’re not symptomatic?’, and I said yes. And she said: ‘Well, I’m really surprised because looking at your scans it looks like you should be.’” Because it was so big? “Yeah! D’you want me to show you?” Before I’ve got time to answer, she’s got her smartphone out and I’m staring at a white, jelly-like blob on her brain. “A big colloid cyst is 10mm or more, and mine was 14mm,” she says proudly. “This is Jeffrey.”“Eh?” I say.View image in fullscreenMcCall after her surgery in November 2024.Photograph: Courtesy of Davina McCall/Eroteme“Jeffrey is what I call it.” Why? “Because I don’t know anyone called Jeffrey, so I could say ‘Fuck Jeffrey’ without hurting anyone’s feelings.”How did she react when she was told she should have surgery? “I burst into tears.” She had left the studio to take the call and was pacing around the courtyard. “I was relieved and frightened. So the fear of it being a dead cert that I’m going to get it taken out, and then the relief of ‘Thank fuck, I’m going to get it taken out’ came at the same time. Nobody at The Masked Singer knew. I pull myself together, walk back in to go towards my dressing room and see this guy called Joe from ITV. And he goes: ‘Hey, hi, how are you doing?’ And I burst into tears, and he gives me a hug and asks what’s going on. I said: ‘I’ve just found out I’ve got a brain tumour and I need to get it operated on and I feel good and terrible all at the same time.’”This was last October. A month later, she had the operation. McCall didn’t tell anybody on the show itself what was happening. “I pretended to everybody on the judging panel I was sick. And then I actually put on a costume and performed.” (She sang Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas and This Christmas on The Masked Singer Christmas Special.) Why? “It was quite weird. I wasn’t thinking this in a dramatic way, but I did think: if I don’t make it, this will be amazing for my kids to watch. I know that sounds a bit dark …” She comes to a stop.Just as her emotions are about to get the better of her, she cheers herself up by telling meexactlywhat the operating team did to her brain. “They cut like a hairband into my head, peeled the front of my head down, then went through the two halves of my brain, so it looked like that.” She shows me a photo of the hairband scar. Is the scar still there? “My partner, Michael, very sweetly said, ‘You’ve just got a little white patch’, so we sprayed some root spray, but this is all new hair growing back.” Her hair is a magnificent auburn. Is it her natural colour? She laughs. “No, I’m grey. I coloured my hair two nights ago. I’m not ready to go grey yet.”Michael and I were really good friends because we were hairdresser and client. I told him all of my secretsMcCall feels she has emerged from her experience transformed. “The best thing to come out of it is not being frightened of death any more.” How scared was she? “I wasn’t terrified of dying, but I didn’t want to die. I love life, love living, and definitely wanted to be around for my kids while they were young. I think if I’d got ill when my kids were little it would have been very different, but I looked at my three kids and, although I didn’t want to leave them, I did think: you’d all be OK if I did. That’s a nice feeling. Then I looked at my life and thought: have I done everything I want to do? And I thought: yeah, I have. I’ve lived a really good life. I’ve really enjoyed my life. I’ve loved, and I’ve been loved.”After the diagnosis, she started a podcast called Begin Again. “The whole idea behind it is helping people get to a point in their lives where they feel they can die happy. It’s about doing everything in your life you want to do, and how do you begin again to do that, so that you can die happy; so you can go, I’ve lived a life I’m proud of, or that I wanted to live.”What was she totting up when she did the inventory of her life? “My kids. Would they be OK without me? I always thought my job is to teach them to fly away and never look back, even though you want them to look back sometimes. I don’t want to have kids who are too afraid to leave me. I guess the fact that one lives in Manchester, one lives in Australia, and the other one didn’t come on holiday with us because he was in Split means I’ve done a good job. They’re independent, happy kids.”View image in fullscreen‘I don’t look at other people. I like being monogamous.’ Dress: Lanvin. Earrings and chunky bangle: Dinosaur Designs. Other bangle: Davina’s ownThey had a very different childhood from your own? “Definitely. They had a solid childhood. I was with their dad for 18 years. We were together, they were under one roof, they had food on the table.” McCall split up from her second husband and the father of her children, Matthew Robertson, in 2017. She got together with the hairdresser Michael Douglas two years later. Douglas has done McCall’s hair for more than 20 years, and the two families were friends. Often he would bring his two children around to her house when he was doing her hair.She was as surprised as anybody when they got together. I assumed it evolved into a relationship, but she says not. “It was more of a coup de foudre. A lightning bolt. I probably don’t want to talk about this because I have to think about Matthew. Michael and I were really good friends because we were hairdresser and client. I told him all of my secrets, about how I was feeling, and he was a brilliant sounding board. He would share his experiences; I would share my experiences. We would help each other navigate things. And he was in love with his wife and I was in love with my husband, so it was us trying to help each other through our lives. That’s what’s so mad about it. And then coup de foudre.Mad. Like I’d put on a different pair of glasses.”She says she had to make sure she was over Robertson before thinking about a new relationship. “If I’m with somebody I’m with them. I don’t look at other people. I like being monogamous.”McCall’s childhood was famously unsolid – at least on her maternal side. Her French mother, Florence, was a chaotic alcoholic who also dabbled in drugs, a glamorous socialite who never quite grew up and who died in 2008. When McCall was 13, Florence took her clubbing in Île de Ré along with her 19-year-old sister. “I remember my mum left me and my sis to go and get some weed or something, and being a bit frightened then. I was like: ‘Oh I’m socoool.’ Then when my mum left, I’m: ‘Oh my God, I’m so young, what am I doing in this place?’”I left my boyfriend because I thought it was his fault I was taking drugs. Maybe it was my fault he was taking themHer parents split up when she was three. Florence returned to France, and young Davina went to live with her paternal grandparents in Surrey. At 13 she moved in with her father, Andrew, a marketing and advertising executive who died in 2022, and her stepmother, Gaby, in London. She adored them (and is still exceptionally close to Gaby) but it was the absent Florence who was the defining influence of her childhood. “I was very loved. My dad and my granny and my stepmum loved me a lot. But it was my mother’s love that I spent my childhood seeking. I had it all there, and the thing I wanted was the thing I couldn’t have. I was just trying to fill this hole.”By her mid-teens, she had become a rock chick – cool, loud, impossible to ignore. She was having a great time of it. “When I got to 18 or 19 I was an extreme extrovert. Outrageous outfits, always with people, dancing, chat, loved it.” She was running her own club nights, frequently on the lash, and developed a serious drug problem. “I was going down a muddy route of heroin and cocaine, and I was a mess.” How muddy a mess was she? “I don’t want to underplay me taking heroin. The fact I wasn’t injecting doesn’t mean it’s safe to take heroin. It really fucked up my life. My life was falling apart. I left my boyfriend because I thought it was his fault I was taking drugs. It wasn’t. I got worse when I left him. Maybe it was my fault he was taking them.”She says she was such a contradictory shambles – conscientious and wasted, ecstatic and miserable, life of the party and lonely as hell, permissive and puritanical. “I was half nun, half wild child. I was half really good girl: so compliant, swotty, good morals and manners, and full of love. And then half maniac.” She didn’t have a clue what she wanted to do with her life. Then, when she was 19, MTV got in touch with a bunch of notable clubbers, including her, to see if they could help with the launch of MTV Europe. Their job was to entertain celebrities attending the launch on the journey from London to Amsterdam, where the party was held, and throughout the night. “At the end of that night I was like: ‘Oh my God. I’ve found my calling. I have to work for MTV!’”View image in fullscreenWith her partner Michael Douglas and daughter Holly Robertson, after being made an MBE in January 2024.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesShe’s screaming with enthusiasm, Davina-style. What was so good about it? “It was just so mad. Everyone who worked at MTV was under 25. All the biggest bands of the era were on this plane – Duran Duran, Sigue Sigue Sputnik. I think Donny Osmond was on the plane, too. I love Donny.” I tell her how much I liked him when I met him. “Oh my God, isn’t he the loveliest man?! I sat next to him on The Masked Singer, and he was my poster boy.” She points to her legs. Eh? I say. “I’ve got goose bumps.” And the goose bumps really are visible.She comes to a stop. And she’s gone from hyper to a brief unexpected low. “Nobody really understood what it meant to me sitting next to Donny. All the people in my life who would have really got what that meant to me had died – my sister, my dad, my granny.” Seconds later, she has refuelled. The energy’s back. “And when I came back from that MTV trip I thought: I want to work there.”Was access to celebrity part of what attracted her to MTV? “No, it was the vibe, the energy. It felt like if you had an idea and you went to somebody at MTV, they’d go: let’s do it. I remember turning up there and Robbie [Williams] had just left Take That and they said they were going to do a two-hour special in an hour! It was so exciting to be around.”But there were two problems. MTV wanted to hire presenters from the continent, and McCall was too much of a wreck to hold down a proper job. At 25, she got clean. She says she had to give up alcohol before she could contemplate giving up drugs. What had been the attraction of heroin? “You take heroin because you’re deeply insecure and part of your extrovertism is to cover up your deep insecurity. Heroin is like a hug and it tells you that you don’t need anyone or anything, and everything’s all right.”Sobriety soon paid off. “Amazingly, six months clean, I get a call off MTV, who I had been trying to get a screen test off. If I’d have got a screen test off them when I was still using I would have messed it up.” She has never drunk alcohol or taken drugs since then. Nor has she been without work.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She had something different. She was fun without being OTT, sincere without being cloying, funny without dominating and, most importantly, she seemed to love what she was doing and care about the people on the shows. You felt she would have just as happily been a contestant as the presenter.View image in fullscreen‘I’m an amplifier. I take good news and spread it everywhere.’ Coat: Richard Quinn. Ring: Laura VannThere has been a consistency to all the work she has done over the past 30 years. Today, she’s promoting Stranded on Honeymoon Island, a new dating show that’s a melange of other dating shows – contestants have to marry (though it’s not legally binding) then spend time together on a desert island. The first show she presented, Streetmate, was one of the earliest of the genre. It involved McCall rolling up to strangers in different places, asking them if they were single and were up for her finding them a date (which involved the contestant telling McCall who they fancied on the street and her then playing matchmaker). It was simple, audacious and had infinitely more energy than most of today’s shows (including the first episode of Stranded).I tell her I watched an episode of Streetmate earlier today. “Ohmygodwhichonewhichone?” she replies in turbo-drive Davina. I tell her it was a show in which the woman calls the man a laddish loser, says he has no chance, and they end up together. “Oh my God! So good.” She’s panting with excitement. And laughing. Pant-laughing. “Oh my God, you know I nearly did Streetmate again when it came back [in 2017], then they changed their minds and went for Scarlett [Moffatt]. Ilovedthat show. It was amazing.”But it was on Big Brother, the groundbreaking C4 show in which a bunch of strangers were locked inside a house together under constant observation, that McCall really made her mark, and for which she remains best known. The first few series were compelling. As was McCall, particularly when collecting newly evicted contestants from the house, with the catchphrase: “Big Brother house, this is Davina. You are live on Channel 4; please do not swear. Youhave been evicted. I’m coming to get you.”The first series of Big Brother was mega. A serious TV show the broadsheets were unpicking, a psychological experimentMcCall adored Big Brother. And still does. “The first series was mega. I remember thinking: oh my God, the broadsheets are talking about us. I’d never been on a show where the broadsheets talked about it, and here was a serious TV show that people were unpicking. It was a psychological experiment. It wassogood.”She talks about some of her favourite contestants – Anna Nolan, the Irish woman who had trained as a nun and with whom she’s still friendly (“We share the same birthday!”); Pete Bennett, who has Tourette syndrome; Helen “I like blinking, I do” Adams, who fell in love with Paul Clarke on the show; Nikki Grahame (“She was fucking great – so brilliant and funny and full of life”) and Jade Goody, who both died tragically young; Chantelle Houghton, who had to pretend she was famous in the Celebrity Big Brother house. She’d still be going, if I hadn’t stopped her.I tell herthat when I interviewed Petewe were both in bed (no, I can’t remember why) and show herthe photo. She howls with delight. “Awwww, that’s so fucking great. Oh my God! That is so iconic. Oh. My. God.Sweeeet!”Big Brother had controversies by the bucket-load – rowdiness, fights, a racist row after Goody referred to the Indian contestant Shilpa Shetty as “Shilpa Poppadom” and two other contestants used racist language. In Big Brother series five, fake evictions led to a huge scrap involving most of the contestants. “Fight Night was quite frightening when we had to get security to go in,” she says. “Nobody thought it would kick off like that. We learned more as they went on. Now they don’t allow alcohol like they used to. You used to be able to get booze whenever you wanted.” Was it booze that led to the problems? “That’s what they learned in the end. That’s why they locked the alcohol away.”How did she deal with the racist incident? “I owed it to them to give them an opportunity to know we knew what had happened, to not trip them up. So, off-camera, we said we saw the racist slurs, and this is an opportunity for you to make it OK. That was us trying to safeguard them.” She admits safeguarding was primitive back then. “They were greeted by boos on their way out. It was scary for them. Most of the time, when people came out and were booed it was panto. But that night it felt different. We’d asked those girls to go on that show. I felt the weight of that.”I tell her that my younger daughter, Maya, who was a huge fan of reality shows such as Big Brother, feels they are unreality shows these days – full of artifice and set pieces, and contested by indistinguishable, surgically enhanced influencers. We decide to ring Maya so she can say her piece.“I agreecompletely,” McCallshouts into the phone. “Completely.I think reality TV’s been going so long it’s no longer reality. People know what’s coming and they are so used to the format that they know how to prepare themselves, and it no longer feels real. I think it’s also because of safeguarding. The OG versions were where we’d get really real, with people from all walks of life who weren’t used to being on television. They wanted to be on Big Brother for an experience. But things happened that made the producers so nervous for people’s safety that they ended up going for people who maybe would be a bit more used to being on television.” Maya and McCall swap notes on favourite contestants. “Lovely to meet you!Byeeeeeeeee!”McCall insists it’s still impossible to fake it on Big Brother because the camera will eventually find you out. “To do eight weeks in a house with no contact with the outside world is really fucking difficult. After a week, even celebrities forget they’re on camera.”McCall mentions My Mum, Your Dad, the dating TV series she presented for older people looking for new love. She says that’s an example of a show where there’s still a high degree of reality. Yes, I say, but all the contestants were ridiculously gorgeous. “They had normal bodies, though. They weren’t people with loads of plastic surgery, and they had baggage. But we stopped after two series because nobody watched it.” Why? “I don’t know. I don’t know if they’re not young enough, if there wasn’t enough sex.”Did it upset her that nobody watched it? “What was nice was that those people who did watch it became obsessed with it and it was critically acclaimed. I’ve been in this game for so long that you know sometimes you do things you love and people don’t come to it.”In recent years, McCall has become something of an educator, starting with books on fitness and diet. In 2022, she published the bestselling Menopausing. “I hit menopause when I was 43 and then started talking about it when I was 45, 46. And I was so surprised that it was something all women were going to go through and yet none of us seemed to know anything about it.” Menopausing was named Book of the Year at the British Book awards in 2023.She says she no longer sees herself primarily as a presenter. So what would she call herself? “Now I’d say I’m an amplifier.” Wow, what’s one of them, I ask. “I take good news and spread it everywhere. Or I’m an information highway.” How long has she been an information highway? “Since menopause.”‘I was too good’: Sharon Stone on stardom, family secrets, sexual abuse – and her comeback after a strokeRead moreThe book she had wanted to write for two decades was about childbirth. But publishers didn’t see McCall and pregnancy as marketable bedfellows. Ironically, in her late 50s, they gave her the go-ahead. “I wanted to do this book 18 years ago when my son was born, but they thought this was a weird, left-field thing. But after I’d done the menopause book, people were like: ‘What would you like to do next?’. And I was like: ‘Yes!Now I can’t give birth any more, but I can write about it!’”I’m staring at a squiggle on her wrist as she talks. What is it? “Oh, this is a tattoo for my sister who died, Caroline. And this one is for my other sister, Milly.” Has she got any other notable tattoos? She lifts her skort to reveal an alien on her bottom. “I went to America for MTV and they wanted to film me getting a tattoo, so I was like: OK, I’m going to get HR Giger’s Alien.” Was that her first tattoo? “No.” She shows me her left wrist. “It’s supposed to be a rose, but I think it looks like a vagina with a pair of bollocks. So that’s why I got that stalk put on to make it look like a flower.”We’ve been chatting for over two hours. As I prepare to leave, I tell her that I had encephalitis as a child and I felt I came out of it a totally different person.“Yes!”She nods vigorously. “I think I’m just learning who I am without Jeffrey.” What’s changed? “When I came out of the operation, I didn’t know what country I was in, or that I’d had the operation done. I didn’t know anything. But I do remember waking up and going, ‘Oh my God, the noise. The noise in my brain,’ and I realised later they were thoughts.”What does she mean? She says she used to be so full of questions about how and why things worked. Often they were daft or inconsequential (What are the ideal-sized heels for women to wear comfortably? What is the perfect way to describe the colour of her shirt?), but they were still thoughts. “I said to Michael twice in the year-and-a-half of me leading up to finding out about the tumour: ‘Do you always think?’ And he said: ‘Yeah, I’m always thinking.’ And I remember saying to myself: ‘I used to be like that.’”About five years ago, she says, she stopped asking herself questions. “I’d stopped thinking, and I’m sure that was a symptom of the tumour.” Now, McCall couldn’t be more aware of the noise in her head, of those thoughts banging around, and she couldn’t be happier with them. “I feel I’ve got myself back,” she says.Stranded on Honeymoon Island is on BBC One and iPlayer.

I can’t wait for what will be a fantastic next series.”Galetti said: “To have Matt join us is really exciting. Seeing what skills our contestants showcase and tasting their culinary creations is always a delight – Marcus and I look forward to welcoming Matt to the MasterChef studios and discovering our next champion.”The most recent series of MasterChef: The Professionals, which featured Wallace, continued to air last year amid the allegations against him, but two MasterChef celebrity Christmas specials were pulled from the BBC’s schedule in December.David Ambler, the MasterChef executive editor, said: “It’s a great pleasure to welcome Matt on board for the next series of MasterChef: The Professionals.“His career as a chef, restaurateur and food broadcaster makes him an ideal choice to join this year’s judging lineup and we can’t wait to discover the crop of exciting new talent.”The series will be aired onBBC Oneand iPlayer, with a transmission date yet to be confirmed.Explore more on these topicsMasterChefBBC OneBBCGregg WallaceMarcus WareingFood TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

But I’m not the gay Jeremy Clarkson – I’m only a tiny cog in a large wheel here.”View image in fullscreenEverett said local people realised they needed the pub for community cohesion.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianUnlike most actors, Everett has not been working behind the bar because he has fallen on hard times. Instead, it is as part of a grand community effort to save the Swan, which faced closure until villagers stepped in and began to maintain a building that has been at the heart of the village for more than 350 years.He also joinedthe Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), which fights for the future of pubs such as the Swan, andan image of him working at the pub went viral.Everett told the Guardian he had lived in the area the Swan serves since he was a boy.“I’ve known the pub through various incarnations,” he said. “It’s closed a couple of times and the people in our village suddenly realised we needed it for some kind of community cohesion.View image in fullscreenThe building has been at the heart of the village for more than 350 years.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“It’s a difficult time in the countryside. The farmers around us have all had a terrible harvest. Morale is slightly down. Your village pub suddenly seems like an important asset that we all feel we need to defend.”The Swan is seeking a new professional publican after the previous one left in June. “But in the meantime, everybody in the village felt incredibly galvanised to keep the pub and the garden looking good,” Everett said. “It’s a difficult business. Beer only lasts a week – if you order too much, you’re fucked.”Everett’s preferred drink is a beer called Pigswill,an amber-coloured tipple from Stonehenge Ales. “I’m incredibly fat so I try not to drink too much of it because once you get started, you never stop. But I’m committed to drinking non-stop to get a new publican,” he added.The actorquoted figures from the British Beer and Pub Association, claiming that for every £3 spent in a pub, £1 goes to tax. “They take a healthy chunk of every pub’s earnings. The government could ease off on its own take. That would help.”View image in fullscreenOne local man said the pub was a vital lifeline for him.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianWhen the Guardian visited on Thursday, Everett was off-duty.He is busy promoting his well-received collection of stories, The American No. But the place was bustling with young and old.Clive Bullen, one of the lead organisers of the Swan’s rescue, said the response from the community had been phenomenal. “The garden had become overgrown and inside needed a re-deck,” he said. “Up to 30 people a day were helping, working on the garden, painting inside and so on.View image in fullscreenClive Bullen is one of the major forces behind the pub’s rescue.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“We put a note out saying we needed volunteers for shift work and Rupert said he’d like to help. I took him through the training. It’s a bit of a surprise when he’s doing a shift late on a Saturday afternoon and a random person walks in.”David Holmes, a Swan regular for more than half a century and known in the village as “Sheriff”, described how the pub was a vital lifeline for him. “I wouldn’t see anyone from week to week if I didn’t come here.”Iris Daunt-Withers, a relative newcomer, said the pub was one of the draws of moving to Enford. “We met everyone there and came to realise this is such a wonderful place with a great sense of community,” she said.View image in fullscreenIris Daunt-Withers said the pub was one of the main draws of moving to the village.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianCamra said so far in 2025, 230 pubs in the UK had been demolished or converted and lost to communities for ever. The campaign group is calling for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to do her bit at the budget by scrapping the increase in employer national insurance contributions, and reducing business rates bills and VAT and duty on beer and cider served in pubs.Everett said the community effort had created a celebratory feel at the pub. “In this world where we’re all increasingly detached in our own individual mad bubbles, it’s really refreshing. We’ve felt our village coming together to try to keep this pub going. It’s built energy in all of us.”Explore more on these topicsRupert EverettPubsHospitality industryWiltshireTaxCommunitiesTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

Her social media described her as a yoga teacher and practitioner of biodecoding, an obscure alternative therapy that claims to cure illness by resolving past traumas.Her husband, Juan Carlos Cortegoso, 61, built and raced go-karts. Like many in this neighbourhood, the couple were comfortably off, and discreet. “Patri was an excellent person”, one neighbour said. “Nice, well educated,” said another.Then, last month, they put their house up for sale. A photographer from a local estate agent, Robles Casas y Campos, came round to shoot the spacious, elegantly furnished interiors. The pictures went up. And their quiet existence came crashing down.The fifth photograph on the agency’s listing showed a general view of the villa’s living room. Hanging on the wall, above a buttoned sofa in plush green velvet and next to a polished antique commode, was a highly distinctive oil painting of a woman.View image in fullscreenThe painting by Italian artist Ghislandi in the living room in Mar del Plata.Photograph: Robles Casas & CamposMore than 11,000km away, the Dutch news outlet AD had, for several years, been quietly investigating the fate of old master paintings looted by the Nazis and stilllisted by the Dutch culture ministry as “unreturned”after the second world war.Journalists had made several attempts to speak to Patricia Kadgien, the owner of the property, and to her elder sister, Alicia, the daughters of a high-ranking Nazi official Friedrich Kadgien, who was known to have settled in Argentina after the war.Their calls and messages had consistently gone unanswered, or been rebuffed. But then a Dutch reporter based in Buenos Aires, Peter Schouten, went knocking on the door of the villa – and spotted a “for sale” sign.Old master painting looted by Nazis spotted in Argentinian property listingRead moreWhat followed, after Schouten and his colleagues in Rotterdam clicked on the link to the property and instantly recognised the work,made headlines around the worldas the story unfolded of the unlikely recovery of an 18th-century portrait missing for 80 years.“It’s very surreal – a little absurd, too,” Schouten said after a packed court hearing during which Kadgien and Cortegoso were charged with aggravated concealment for allegedly hiding Portrait of a Lady, by the late-baroque portraitist Giuseppe Ghislandi.The federal prosecutor, Carlos Martínez, told the court that the concealment charge “must be understood as linked to the crime of genocide … This is theft in the context of genocide. It is connected to the most serious crimes known to humanity.”A judge imposed a 180-day travel ban on the couple and barred them from leaving their home for more than 24 hours without approval as Martínez said the plundering of cultural assets “was part of a systematic plan … to enrich the Nazi regime and its members”.View image in fullscreenPatricia Kadgien attends a hearing on charges of concealment and obstruction of justicePhotograph: Jose Scalzo/ReutersAfter the media reports of the work’s likely location, and before a police search, the couple had tried to obstruct the investigation, the prosecutor argued, by taking down the online property listing and for sale sign andreplacing the portrait with a tapestry.Despite knowing they were under investigation, it was alleged that the defendants had also attempted a civil action claiming the painting was rightfully theirs, turning it over only after they wereplaced under house arrestand facing further police raids.Through their lawyer, Kadgien and Cortegoso have denied concealment, saying they had always been willing to hand over the painting, and obstruction, arguing that their civil action was aimed at establishing ownership and not at hiding the artwork.During a series of raids this week on properties owned by members of the Kadgien family, police seized engravings, prints, drawings and two 19th-century paintings, officials have said, with further charges likely if those works, too, prove to have been looted.Portrait of a Lady belonged to Jacques Goudstikker, a Jewish-Dutch art dealer who fled Amsterdam in mid-May 1940 to escape the Nazis, but died after falling through an open hatch into the hold of the SS Bodegraven, the ship carrying him to the UK.Goudstikker carried with him a notebook detailing his collection of more than 1,100 artworks, including pieces by Rubens, Giotto, Titian, Rembrandt and Van Gogh, all of which were snapped up for a fraction of their value by Nazi officials.Some were later recovered and displayed as part of the Dutch national collection in the Rijkmuseum, before 202 works were restored to the dealer’s sole heir, his daughter-in-law, Marei von Saher, in 2006. Portrait of a Lady was not among them.Chief among the buyers in a forced sale typical of second world war art thefts was Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, one of whose senior aides, in the early years of the war, was a 33-year-old official called Friedrich Gustav Kadgien.Born in 1907, Kadgien joined the Nazi party in 1932 and the SS in 1935. By 1938, he was a special representative working for Göring on the four-year economic plan drawn up by Adolf Hitler to rearm Germany and prepare it for self-sufficiency by 1940.A key player in the Third Reich’s foreign currency dealings, Kadgien was also, according to a 1996 Swiss report, “heavily involved in criminal methods for the acquisition of cash, securities and diamonds stolen from Jewish victims”.Kadgien “confiscated a large amount of property from Jewish merchants, including jewellery and diamonds in Amsterdam, and oversaw the sale of expropriated shares and securities through banks and front companies in Switzerland”, Martínez said.He fled to Zurich early in 1945, then to nearby Baden, where in 1948 he set up a successful finance and trading firm, Imhauka. With pressure growing after questioning by Swiss and US investigators, Kadgien left for South America in 1949.Thousands of Nazis fled to the continent after the war, settling in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay. With a few notable high-profile exceptions, most lived out their lives undisturbed, sometimes without even changing names.Kadgien resurfaced in Rio de Janeiro in 1951, settling in the Santa Teresa district and establishing a Brazilian branch of Imhauka with Ludwig Haupt, a former colleague from the four-year-plan, and Anna Imfeld, the wife of his Swiss associate.By whatever means it was acquired, his wealth was sufficient for him to invest in an 85,000-hectare ranch with 20,000 cattle. A Buenos Aires branch of Imhauka followed in 1951, and Kadgien – now Federico Gustavo – won Argentinian citizenship soon after.Imhauka secured valuable contracts with Juan Perón’s government, including acting as an intermediary for major German engineering firms such as Siemens, while a second company, Dryamin, launched in 1973, specialised in food and drugs.In the Argentinian capital, Kadgien married Hildegard Strauss, with whom he had Patricia and Alicia. He died, without being held accountable for his wartime and subsequent actions, in 1978 or 1979, and is reportedly buried in the German cemetery.Alicia became a model and is locally well known, unlike Patricia, whose unwanted fame is more recent. “If you hadn’t told me I would never have known,” a neighbour said. Another said she was being “held responsible for her father’s mistakes”.Even those sympathetic to her, however, admit it was strange that she did not hand over the painting immediately.The fate of Portrait of a Lady, which will be registered with Argentina’s supreme court, is now uncertain.Prosecutors have requested it be held, but not displayed, at the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires while its ultimate ownership is determined. This week von Saher, Goudstikker’s heir, lodged a legal claim to the work with the FBI in New York.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaAmericasNazismSecond world warArt theftArtnewsShareReuse this content"

And this is our mega year where everything’s come up completely brilliantly, and we’re now experimenting.”She has been very concerned about the health impacts of using harsh, synthetic chemical dyes, which require users to be swaddled in protective clothing, which natural dyes made of flowers do not.“There used to be a thing called dyer’s nose, which is basically when the aniline dyes came in,” Honeybone said, “They used to destroy your nasal membrane. So artificial dyes have long history of being pretty bad for you, and I’m still quite haunted by the fact that I knew this fantastic woman who was a top dyer when I was just this little bug, and she dyed for years, and when she retired she just died instantly. You’re left with these things, and you do worry – however ‘health and safety’ you are, there’s these chemicals around.”The theatre is planning to use natural dyes from the garden in every production at the South Bank going forwards, starting with Playboy of the Western World, which is on this autumn and winter.Claire Wardroper, costume production supervisor at the theatre, said it was “a beautiful early 19th century piece, with lots of nice woolly jumpers, because it’s set in rural Ireland, and we can certainly get some nice colours into them. The designer for that is fully onboard with producing some things that are naturally dyed as well.”The pair say they are trying to bring a gentler, more environmentally friendly way of dying into the mainstream. “We are saying that if you want to use this horrible synthetic dye, you can do that, but you can achieve this beautiful look by using a natural dye, and we can do it a little bit slower and a bit more sort of organically,” said Honeybone.Wardroper added: “It’s unfortunate to say, but the theatre and film and anything creative in one-shot opportunity entertainment has a history of being incredibly wasteful.”The garden has provided a bounty of flowers to be boiled up and turned into dye. Their indigo plants, which provide a beautiful deep blue, have done particularly well.View image in fullscreenThe garden has provided a bounty of flowers to be boiled up and turned into dye.Photograph: Dan Neidle/Rory MurphyHoneybone said: “It’s been such a good harvest.

They loved it, it wasn’t hard to get and all the tapestries that were up on the wall were a riot of colour. What we’re seeing now is the sad, faded leftovers,” she said.Honeybone says she has become “obsessed” with natural dying. “My daughter gave me a bunch of flowers on Mother’s Day, and I noticed there was some golden rod in it, so whisked that out and dyed with it just to see what it yielded. And it was the most glorious, strong yellow.”The garden is not only used for dyes but also as a refuge from the hustle and bustle of the theatre. The pair said actors were frequently seen pacing among the flowers, or sitting down on benches to learn their lines.The space is also a haven for wildlife. The grey concrete of the South Bank does not have a huge amount to offer pollinators, and they have been swarming to the garden to sample the nectar from the varied dye plants.View image in fullscreenThe natural dye and wellbeing garden. Actors are frequently seen pacing among the flowers, or sitting down on benches, to learn their linesPhotograph: Dan Neidle/Rory MurphyWardroper said: “We’re seeing so much more wildlife, like hummingbird moths, and we’ve got bees on the NationalTheatreroof which produce honey for the National Theatre. And they’re loving the variety of plants that we’ve planted as well. These are a new stock of plants that they just haven’t had access to. So the bee person that comes in and caters to the bees is very happy.”The pair hope that most if not all of the costumes at the theatre can eventually be produced using natural methods. But for now, Honeybone is enjoying the opportunity to start using these dyes.She said: “This is such an all round sensory experience, totally engulfed in the smells and the feeling. And you’re touching petals and you’re crushing leaves, and you know it’s so fully sensory, the smell, the look – it is just wonderful.”Explore more on these topicsNational TheatreTheatreTextile artGardensWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Euphoria grad, who gave a resonant performance inReality, scored a sleeper hit with glossed-up romcomAnyone But Youbut audiences were more impressed than critics, including myself (I found her performance strangely stilted). There was little interest from either side in her nun horrorImmaculate, and earlier this summer her incredulously plotted Apple movieEcho Valleywent the way of many Apple movies (no one knows it exists).Saipan review – football scandal makes for thrilling big-screen dramaRead morePost-thinkpieces, two of her festival duds (Eden and Americana) disappeared at the box office and she now arrives at Toronto in need of a win. And what better way to achieve that by going for an old-fashioned awards play, taking on the role of alternately inspiring and tragic boxer Christy Martin. It’s a role that’s already been buzzed about for months (Sweeney has been busy laying the standard “gruelling physical routine” groundwork) and at a time when movies about female sport stars still remain thin on the ground despite a swell of interest in them off screen, it’s a needed push in the right direction. But, as perfectly timed as this narrative might be, Christy just isn’t nearly good enough, a by-the-numbers slog that fails to prove Sweeney’s status as a one to watch.She’s a convincing force to be reckoned with inside of the ring, her training clearly having paid off as she confidently glides from fight to fight, but she can’t get us to believe in all that much outside of it, an actor still trying too visibly hard to make it all seem effortless (a few scenes with a more-at-ease Katy O’Brian, as another boxer, hint that she might have been the better choice). It’s a hefty ask, Sweeney playing the boxer over 20 years as she faced various struggles, and ultimately an impossible one too, her unsureness preventing us from getting beyond the film’s surface. Not that there’s much more here, though, despite the wealth of detail at play, Australian director David Michôd mostly sticking to the dog-eared playbook, at times that often make the film feel like Walk Hard but with boxing. There’s an excess of loudly soundtracked montages in the first act, yet with such little development outside of them we’re never quite sure what we should be feeling throughout, other than what we know from other boxing movies (it pales in comparison to last Toronto’s far smarter female boxer biopicThe Fire Inside).It’s a disappointingly rote way to tell the extraordinary life of Christy, who came from a mining family in West Virginia and found herself in the ring at a time when women weren’t seen there, a rise that sadly involved Jim Martin (Ben Foster), an older manager who takes her on as client and then wife, controlling her career and entire sense of self. Even as she became a groundbreaking name in boxing, as Don King’s first female star, her husband was there to bring her crashing back down to Earth. Over a fatiguing 135 minutes, we watch the rise and inevitable fall.Michôd broke out with the blazing crime drama Animal Kingdom, but there’s none of that fire still burning here. The only real connection would be a continued interest in showing us the very worst of human behaviour, as we bear witness to Jim’s vile treatment of his wife. It has an obvious visceral impact, but in how he chooses to linger on his final act of unspeakably awful violence, it can feel needlessly explicit. We know the beats of a boxing movie and a domestic violence drama all too well and neither side of the story is told in a way that doesn’t feel overly reliant on cliche. Foster sticks to an overfamiliar odious mode (he might as well have been introduced with red flags) and while the excellent Merritt Wever is saddled with a one-note bad mum role, she does more with it than the film deserves from her.Christy herself isn’t written with any more depth than a Wikipedia summary (Don King tells her in one scene that she has “some real personality” but where that is, I couldn’t tell you) and it betrays what could have been in smarter hands. The more uniquely interesting details of who she was – the wrestle between masculinity and femininity, how this played into struggles over her queerness and marital gender roles, how being crafted by a man turned her into a distrustful anti-feminist unwilling to recognise her groundbreaking impact and influence – are told to us in brief moments, but they never inform an otherwise ripped-from-a-TV-movie character. No wonder Sweeney struggles.Christy Martin’s life was filled with devastating blows but in her biopic, we barely feel the impact.Christy is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released later this yearExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewSydney SweeneyBen FosterBoxingToronto film festivalFestivalsDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Max Porter has adapted his own2023 novella Shyfor the screen and Murphy himself gives one of his most uninhibited and demonstrative performances.Murphy is Steve, a stressed, troubled but passionately committed headteacher with a secret alcohol and substance abuse problem, in charge of a residential reform school for delinquent teenage boys some time in the mid-90s. With his staff – deputy (Tracey Ullman), therapist-counsellor (Emily Watson) and a new teacher (Little Simz) – he has to somehow keep order in the permanent bedlam of fights and maybe even teach them something.The boys themselves are an intimidating mix of energy and brutally aggressive wit, engaged in a permanent rap battle, but without the rap and with actual violence. The quietest and smartest is Shy (Jay Lycurgo), and the change of title from book to film is an interesting shift in emphasis, or conceivably a more pointed way of bringing teacher and pupil into closer parallel.On one terrible day, a local TV news crew arrives to film a social-interest segment about the school, coinciding with a visit from the pompous local MP (Roger Allam); they set up the cameras just after Steve receives news from the hospital trust that the school buildings are to be sold and the school itself abolished without any consultation with staff. In parallel with this calamity, Shy gets a call from his mother and stepfather, saying that they wish to have nothing more to do with him.The pain of rejection goes from top to bottom. And the film shows the awful pathos of Steve’s position. Over a long career of having to be patient with truculent boys, having to be tolerant, having to joke around, not coming down too hard, walking the line between friendship and authority, he has effectively joined them; Steve has become the most difficult resident of all. The staff themselves, however affectionate and genuinely respectful of all that he has achieved, are wary and concerned about him as they would be with one of the boys. His drink and substance abuse problems are an open secret. And when the trust chair tells him that the school is finished, Steve erupts with rage and threatens to strangle him – a macabre imitation of just the kind of outburst that they are trying to get the boys to move away from.The news crew have, meanwhile, set up on-camera interviews with everyone at the school and Steve’s contribution, which begins the film, is so traumatised, and so clearly an interview with someone deeply upset, that you might think at first that this is a psychoanalyst or police procedural interview, or maybe a true-crime documentary. As for the boys themselves, they seem cheerfully energised by any hint of celebrity. On being asked what advice he would give his six-years younger self, one says: “Always carry a blade.”Shy finally gives us a sequence of hope and even redemption, a moment where the amp is turned down from 11, with an emotional voiceover from Steve himself about the boys; it is a really sympathetic moment, although it perhaps softens the blow and dilutes the ferocity a bit. Murphy and Lycurgo lead an outstanding cast.Steve screened at theToronto film festival. It is in cinemas from 19 September, and on Netflix from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalCillian MurphyDrama filmsFilm adaptationsFestivalsEmily WatsonreviewsShareReuse this content"

But I had come to Trieste to experience, if not a cuisine, then a culinary tradition which, to me at least, does seem unmistakable: theosmizascene of the surrounding countryside.Anosmiza(orosmizein the plural) is a Slovene term for a smallholding that produces wine in the Karst Plateau, a steep rocky ridge scattered with pine and a patchwork of vineyards that overlooks the Adriatic Sea. Visitingosmizeis a centuries-old tradition in which these homesteads open their doors to the public for a fleeting period each year. Guests order their food and wine at a till inside – where a simply tiled bar, often set into local stone, might boast family photos, halogen lights and a chalkboard menu – before heading outside to feast at long Oktoberfest-style tables and benches.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian Graphics“On the Italian side of the border, we just serve cold food,” Jacob Zidarich tells us, as he places down plates of pickled courgette, house-curedsalumi, local cow’s milk cheese and a homemade sausage with mustard and grated horseradish. “But in Slovenia, you find cooked food.”I am sitting with my partner on the hot terrace at Zidarich’s family home, looking out over a glittering Adriatic. To accompany our food, Zidarich pours two glasses of liquid goldvitovska, a white wine indigenous to this corner of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, the north-eastern Italian region that borders Slovenia, and which is home to the port city of Trieste.To understand the tradition of visitingosmizeis to grasp something of Trieste’s complex history and multifaceted cultural identity. The word derives from the Slovenianosem, meaning “eight”, a reference to a decree by 18th-century Holy Roman empress Maria Theresa that farmers in the Karst could sell their wares for eight consecutive days each year.You’ll pay little more than €2-3 for a quarter-litre carafe of wine and €12-15 for an abundant platter of cold cutsThe result is an enduring tradition in which farmers only open for a short time each season, although almost all of them are now open for more than eight days a year. For this reason, no twoosmiza-based itineraries are the same. Turn up at virtually any time of year and there will beosmizeopen – especially over the warmer months – all offering an affordable flavour of the Friulian countryside.You’ll pay little more than €2-3 for a quarter-litre carafe of wine and €12-15 for an abundant platter of cold cuts, pickles and pillowy white bread. The tradition is particular to this tiny nook of Friuli, although as Zidarich indicated, it also exists – with differences – over the Slovenian border. Our focus is the Italian side where you can check whichosmizeare open (on the day of writing, there are 13) and at what time on the websiteosmize.com.View image in fullscreenAnosmizaspread for one at Verginella Dean, including home-cured salumi and hams, local cow’s milk cheese, pickles, olives and sun-dried tomatoes.Photograph: Mina HollandI base myself at the charmingHotel Albero Nascostoin the centre of Trieste for three nights and, with the intention of visiting as many of theosmizeas possible, hire a car. I make it to fourosmize, and realise quickly thatZidarichis something of an exception. Although his family had been making simple white and red wines for generations, it was his father, Benjamin, who transformed the farm into one of the most respected wine producers in the region. At otherosmizewe mostly drink wine from kegs. Some might describe these places as rustic, but even the table wines here have a clear style and moreish complexity to them.Next up isVerginella Dean, anosmizabustling with both locals and visitors and known for its peerless view of the Gulf of Trieste. From here the city’s Piazza Unità d’Italia is just visible, as is the brutalist Temple of Monte Grisa (which we visit afterwards). From an outdoor bar with two wine taps, I order a quarter ofmalvasiafor two of us and a mixed platter of pork cuts, triangles of salty cheese and sun-dried tomatoes “for one” (it could feed four).Osmizearen’t so much a cuisine as a gastronomic tradition, but I might have put to Jan Morris that theyareemblematic of a place that, although bureaucratically Italian, has strong Slovenian influences. Zidarich’s vineyards straddle the border with most of the land being in Italy, but Slovenian is the language spoken at home, as with all the farmers I met.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The daughter of Trieste Slovenians, she tells me she grew up without any Italian traditions – “no lasagne, no ravioli” – and that when she met her Milanese husband she gave him a copy of Morris’s book “to explain what I was”.Trieste, then, is at a crossroads between three great European cultures: Roman, Slavic and Austrian. But it doesn’t stop there – it’s a multi-faith, “inter-racial jumble”, as Morris had it, home to one of the largest synagogues in Europe alongside Greek and Serbian Orthodox churches. Its significant immigrant communities rub shoulders.Rather magically, we are the only ones here, and sip our drinks to a soundtrack of cattle lowing and stamping their hoovesBesidesosmize, there are plenty of reasons for hungry travellers to visit Trieste, from its quirky coffee culture complete with its own vocabulary (here an espresso is anero, which could refer to a glass of red wine elsewhere in the region) to fresh fish and seafood at restaurants such asTrattoria NerodiseppiaandLe Barettine, which are both within spitting distance of the hotel.View image in fullscreenMimì e Cocotte, which specialises in regional natural wines.Photograph: Lavinia Colonna PretiWe also lovedMimì e Cocotte, a centrally located seasonal restaurant that combines the humility of home-cooked food with a sense of occasion, and specialises in regional natural wines. With these we wash down courgette frittata and two plates of pasta –cacio e pepe, andcavatelliwith tomatoes andstracciatella. Just outside Trieste, in the seaside village of Duino,AllaDama Bianca has the fading charm of a 1970s hotspot. Here we eat razor clams and watch swans glide across the water as the sun sets.Back in Trieste, on Via Giusto Muratti, we discover Pagna, an artisanal bakery and natural wine bar run by the Serbian pastry chef Pedja Kostic, who was drawn to Trieste from Belgrade via the US, by the wine scene. At Pagna I eat the almond croissant of my life: a perfect crisp pastry with a pillowy interior hugging not-too-much frangipane.View image in fullscreenDrinks and nibbles at Pagna, which specialises in natural winesBut it was forosmizethat I came, where each one reflects the people behind it. At Šuc Erika, anosmizain the middle of a farmyard, whose walls are adorned with a picture depicting ricotta production and felt-tip drawings by previous child guests, we order from a woman in a Metallica T-shirt. Afterwards, we sit under a pergola of ripening grapes. Rather magically, we are the only ones here, and sip our drinks (which, unusually, include a delicious cloudy beer brewed in-house) to a soundtrack of cattle lowing and stamping their hooves.Unable to resist just one more before we leave, we head toOsmiza Borisin Medeazza, where Boris’s wife, Patricia, is behind the bar. She tells us about thesalumi, wine vinegars, olive oil and honey they make on-site, while two teenage sons pad in and out of a courtyard in flip-flops. Boris was recommended to us by a waiter at La Dama Bianca as one of his favourites to visit before work, which gives you some indication of how widely enjoyedosmizeare here – democratic and available to everybody, when they happen to be open.The trip was provided byPromo Turismo FVG, the tourist board of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia.

There is not much else to Littlemore now than a farmhouse and a sign.These sleepy and forgotten places in the Boyne Valley of centralQueenslandwere once linked by hundreds of kilometres of train lines that swept an inland arc between the ports of Maryborough and Gladstone. Now, sections of those tracks are being gradually retrofitted for slower forms of transport: the foot, the horse and the bicycle.Restoring the entire proposed 271km Boyne Burnett Inland Rail Trail from Taragoola to Gayndah will be a long journey – if completed, it would be the longest such track in the southern hemisphere.Rail trail mapBut for retired farmer Mick Colyer, it is an undertaking that could save the Boyne Valley through which he first mustered cattle as a young bloke.“When those railroads closed, so many people got displaced, there was no work,” the rail trail committee member says. “The little country towns basically died.“So to try to get people out into those little country areas, to try to put some money into the businesses at those townships that used to be thriving little communities … right from the start, that’s been our vision.”View image in fullscreenRetired farmer and Boyne Burnett Inland Rail Trail committee member Mick Colyer.Photograph: Joe Hinchliffe/The GuardianIt is a vision that would require a dramatic U-turn of prevailing trends.The 2006 census counted 646 people in the Boyne Valley. In 2011, that count fell to 379. By 2013, the Australian Bureau of Statistics no longer considered the four surviving settlements of the Boyne Valley as “urban centres and localities” – or towns – due to their dwindling populations.Then, in 2020, the valley’s only pub turned off its taps.But there are already signs that the promise of the rail trail may have begun to gather steam.After years of community meetings, the first section of redeveloped track officially opened on late 2021. Running about 26km from an abandoned railway siding in the Kalpowar forest called Barrimoon, it descends the Dawes Range through six tunnels and passes Many Peaks to the village of Builyan.View image in fullscreenThe rail trail is one of the biggest drawcards in the Boyne Valley.Photograph: Joe Hinchliffe/The GuardianA year later, a second section of trail opened, south of the Boyne Valley along the banks of the Burnett River. This runs about 30km from Mundubbera to Mt Debateable, an abandoned rail siding near Gayndah. Both towns dispute the title “citrus capital of Queensland” – to which Gayndah stakes its claim in the form of a Big Orange and Mundubbera with a Big Mandarin. Between these two landmarks, a rail trail now winds through citrus groves, past broad sweeps of the Burnett and the abandoned timber rail bridges that cross its tributaries.Sweet dreams are made of this: Queensland’s Big Pineapple is back. Is it still a big deal?Read moreThe first triumph of those sections of the new trail came last December, when the Grand Hotel Many Peaks threw open its doors again under new management.After eight years on the Gladstone regional council and having played a pivotal role in setting up the community group that runs the rail trail, Desley O’Grady and her husband, Craig, moved to Many Peaks, bought the historic pub that backs on to its old train line and issued a call out for volunteers to help clean it up.O’Grady says the turnout of more than 40 folk was testament to how sorely valley locals missed their meeting place. But she knows she will need more than their support to keep its doors open.“There’s only 25 people who actually live in Many Peaks itself,” O’Grady says. “So we know we’re a tourism destination hotel.”And one of the biggest drawcards in the Boyne Valley, she says, is the rail trail.“The reason why we bought the hotel is that over the last 12 years we’ve been going to different rail trails, seeing what happened in different states and different towns,” the publican says. “Cycling tourism is the next big thing, I think.”That conviction appears to be paying off. Last Sunday, O’Grady says, the Grand hotel served 180 meals. Many were bike riders.View image in fullscreenDesley O’Grady, the publican of the newly reopened Grand Hotel Many Peaks – a ‘tourism destination hotel’.Photograph: Joe Hinchliffe/The GuardianBut significant challenges lie ahead for the Boyne Burnett initiative. There is the sheer distances involved, the amount of work required to make the bumpy and sandy section rideable, its gullies crossable. There is the fact that all this work is driven by volunteers scattered across sparsely populated areas.And not all the Boyne Valley’s business community is sold on the rail trail.Hugh Harvey runs what he argues is the only other operating business in that valley’s hospitality and retail sector – a general store in the town of Ubobo, which has a population of about 20. Along with fuel, groceries and hardware, Harvey sells stubby coolers with the slogan: “I’m a hobo from Ubobo.”Though yet to be officially opened, the trail past Ubobo has been graded and Harvey has noticed a few bike riders pedal past his store of late.But he has “no interest at all” in the trail that passes within metres of his business of nearly two decades.View image in fullscreenThe rail trail runs within metres of the Ubobo general store.Photograph: Joe Hinchliffe/The Guardian“Over the years we’ve had a lot of different groups out here – and you can categorise your groups into money spenders and tight-arses,” Harvey says. “The bushwalkers, push-bike riders, birdwatchers, horse riding groups … at the end of the day, they aren’t money spenders.”While some on the ground might be yet to be convinced, Griffith University’s Brent Moyle says other rail trails have proved “a shot in the arm for country towns” around Australia by providing “steady, reliable tourism”.Further south, the Brisbane Valley Rail Trail was completed in 2018 and is credited with a boom in accommodation, the revitalisation of country pubs and the creation of jobs.A professor in tourism with a focus on regenerating remote communities, Moyle acknowledges that the Boyne Burnett is “unlikely to draw Brisbane Valley-level crowds overnight”. But, he says, it could “carve out a loyal niche of cyclists, hikers and caravanners chasing authentic rural experiences”.“We’ve only scratched the surface of rail trails in Australia,” Moyle says.View image in fullscreenMountain views on the Boyne Burnett Inland Valley Rail Trail.Photograph: Joe Hinchliffe/The GuardianAnd for Colyer, the rail trail is not all about economics. Yes, the old cattleman volunteers his time and energy to a cause he hopes will bring money back into the Boyne Valley. But he also does it on principle.“This is an asset owned by the public,” Colyer says of the trail. “And that’s what we’ve all been about all along too: just to have an asset, owned by the people, that people can use.”How a NSW bike trail attracted controversy – and ‘deliberately placed’ nailsRead moreAnd though Colyer is not sure the vision of Australia’s longest rail trail will be realised in his lifetime, there is already a new set of pioneering cyclists making the most of that asset.To mark the opening of the Barrimoon tunnels section of the trail in 2021, Andrew Demack of peak advocacy group Bicycle Queensland rode more than 680km over nine days, linking the Boyne Burnett with two other rail trails, via a string of back roads and a few main ones, from Ipswich to Gladstone.View image in fullscreenThe Barrimoon to Builyan section runs through six tunnels carved through the Dawes Range.Photograph: Joe Hinchliffe/The GuardianThe trip required planning and experience, he says – but it proved that bike trails could one day cover such sprawling journeys.“Well, it is ambitious, but it’s certainly a dream that Bicycle Queensland subscribes to,” he says.In the meantime, though, Demack says there is already a growing network of “great recreational trails”. And the Barrimoon to Builyan section of the Boyne Burnett, with its views of rainforest-clad peaks and valleys of grass trees, gums and rolling paddocks, he says, is “particularly superb”.“It’s one of the most spectacular little bits of rail trail that we’ve got in Queensland.”Explore more on these topicsQueenslandTransportQueensland holidaysAustralia holidaysCycling holidaysCyclingRural AustraliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I tried 10 favourites to find outTom HuntSat 6 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Butter has a powerful place in the culinary imagination – it’s nostalgic, indulgent and rich in flavour. I love the way it holds texture, then melts into a slice of warm toast. But is that really too much to ask from a spread, let alone a plant-based one? The truth is, I haven’t eaten margarine since the 1980s – at home, it’s always butter or extra-virgin olive oil – but spreads are hugely popular. Is it mainly the convenience? Culture? Something else?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The main benefit of a spread is that it’s firm but spreadable straight from the fridge. It ought to taste good, too, but that seems to be an afterthought for many brands, which taste of seed oils and emulsifiers. It should also have a perfect melt time, so it pools slowly and satisfyingly on your toast.Once the bland, ultra-processed alternative to dairy butter, modern plant-based spreads are less processed, creamier, more flavourful and often motivated by ethics or the environment.Conventional dairy butter production carries a big environmental cost, mainly through land use andmethane emissions. By comparison, many plant-based spreads have a significantly lower carbon footprint. That said, they are not all created equal: some are ultra-processed, rely heavily onpalm oil, or come with sustainability claims that don’t quite add up.I tasted all the spreads solo, to gauge texture and flavour, and then on toast to test their melting properties. Some had that familiar, synthetic margarine smell, while others really surprised me. Butter obviously wins for its richness and depth of flavour, but some plant-based options are unexpectedly good. I gave bonus points for less processing, healthier oils, responsible sourcing and being palm oil-free, because we all deserve a spread that’s tasty, and better for the planet and our health.The best plant-based spreadsBestoverall:Naturli’ organic vegan spreadView image in fullscreen£3.90 for 450g at Sainsbury’s (87p/100g)£4.10 for 450g at Waitrose (91p/100g)★★★★☆Barley-white in colour, this isverysoft and slightly oily. There’s a refreshing scent of coconut and almond (a welcome change from the more neutral or synthetic-smelling spreads), while the flavour is enjoyable and balanced, with a light, buttery mouth-feel and good meltability that works well on warm toast. Organic-certified and palm oil-free, it also has low processing and saturated-fat levels compared with some other spreads. Fully recyclable packaging and minimal additives give this strong sustainability and health credentials, but its soft texture may not suit those seeking a firmer butter alternative.Best bargain:Flora original spreadView image in fullscreen£1.75 for 450g at Iceland (39p/100g)£2.65 for 450g at Morrisons (59p/100g)★★★☆☆Its rich, buttermilk-yellow colour and firm texture give this a butter-like feel; it melts beautifully on toast, too. Pleasantly salty and more complex than expected (thanks, perhaps, to the inclusion of coconut and fava bean), this melts nicely in the mouth and has a smooth, satisfying finish. The tub is fully recyclable, and this is one of the less processed options in this lineup, with low saturated fat and no palm oil, which is a significant ethical plus.And the rest …Pure dairy-free buttery spreadView image in fullscreen£2.15 for 500g at Ocado (43p/100g)£2.15 for 500g at Sainsbury’s (43p/100g)★★★☆☆A vibrant, candy-banana orange from natural colourings (carotenes) and the firmest texture of the entire test group, yet still perfectly spreadable and with a consistency akin to room-temperature butter. The flavour is classic margarine, with a firmer, slightly claggy mouth-feel, most likely due to the high ratio ofcertified sustainable palm oil. The tub is fully recyclable, and this is among the less processed options.Lurpak plant-based alternative to butterView image in fullscreen£4.50 for 400g at Sainsbury’s (£1.13/100g)£4.75 for 400g at Morrisons (£1.19/100g)★★★☆☆With a clean, ivory hue and a soft, easy-to-spread consistency, Lurpak’s plant-based option also melts beautifully. It’s light and mousse-like, with a pleasantly salty kick, though lacks impact overall. Its nutritional profile is a strong point: low in saturated fat, low in processing and palm oil-free. Packaging includes a non-home-recyclable insert, which is a minor letdown.ProActiv light alternative to spreadable butterView image in fullscreen£4.75 for 450g at Ocado (£1.06/100g)£4.75 for 450g at Tesco (£1.06/100g)★★★☆☆skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Sweet and pleasant, but slightly cloying. Performs solidly on taste and texture, and stands out for being low in salt and saturated fat, and relatively unprocessed. It’s palm oil-free and fully recyclable, which gives it an ethical and nutritional edge, though at a price.Tesco olive spreadView image in fullscreen£1.45 for 500g at Tesco (29p/100g)★★☆☆☆Pale yellow and extremely soft with a whipped, aerated texture. Mild and slightly sweet, with little depth, but pleasant enough. The 10% olive oil content is a bonus at this price, and the pack is fully recyclable, butit contains palm oil. While the formulation is relatively simple, it does contain artificial flavouring too. A reasonable budget choice for everyday use, though lacking in character or richness.Sainsbury’s olive spreadView image in fullscreen£1.45 for 500g at Sainsbury’s (29p/100g)★★☆☆☆Classic butter-yellow with a soft, yielding texture. Unfortunately, the texture is especially cloying, which overwhelms the mouth, but that’s less apparent on toast. Like the Tesco one, this contains 10% olive oil, and it’s a relatively simple formulation for the price, although it also features artificial flavouring – andpalmoil. Fully recyclable packaging earns it some sustainability points, but the flavour lets it down. Still, a decent pocket-friendly option.I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter original spreadView image in fullscreen£1.60 for 500g at Tesco (32p/100g)£1.60 for 500g at Iceland (32p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Corn-silk yellow with a firm, spreadable texture that melts nicely on toast. Falls short in the texture and flavour department, though: greasy, overly sweet and oily. Packaging includes a non-recyclable seal, and the ingredients feature a more processed formulation, including E471 (mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids), andpalmoil, which may be a concern for some. Despite its memorable name, this is not for anyone looking for quality.Vitalite dairy-free spreadView image in fullscreen£2 for 500g at Sainsbury’s (40p/100g)£2 for 500g at Tesco (40p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Blanched almond colour with a medium-soft texture that spreads well. The subtly sweet aroma is pleasant, and the mouth-feel is creamy and aerated. The flavour, however, has a slightly odd note reminiscent of processed soya milk, despite it being soya-free. It’s a fully recyclable tub, but theingredients list revealsa more processed formulation, containing E471 and E202 (potassium sorbate). The company says it uses only “fully segregated certified sustainable palm oil”, which means that 100% of the palm oil in its products is certified sustainable palm.Stockwell & Co soft spreadView image in fullscreen85p for 500g at Tesco (17p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Parmesan-yellow in colour, this budget spread is very soft and emulsified, and vanishes in the mouth; it’s quite greasy and lacks any real flavour definition, too. While the pack is fully recyclable, and the formulation is relatively simple for the price, it does contain artificial flavouring andpalmoil. But, at less than £1, it’s undeniably cheap and pretty good value for money.Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkThe FilterFoodDairy-freefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Well, wethinkshe was 92, but no one recorded her birth date, so we can only estimate. What we do know about her, though, is that she had a very cheeky laugh, and that she loved lager tops, penny slot machines and tucking £10 notes down her bra, ready to hand out to an unsuspecting grandchild as a gift. She never asked if I was happy, only if I’d eaten well, which I assume to her were the same thing. At this time of year, eating well for her meant tucking into sweetcorn, so, in her memory, I’m going to do the same.Kidney bean and sweetcorn curryPrep10 minCook40 minServes43 tbsp rapeseed oil25 fresh curry leaves(ie, from about 2 sprigs)1 tsp cumin seeds1 brown onion, peeled and chopped2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1-2 green finger chillies, or 1 tsp kashmiri chilli powder400g tin finely chopped tomatoes, or passata1½ tsp garam masala2400g tins kidney beans in water, drained and rinsed1¾ tsp fine sea salt150g frozen sweetcorn, defrostedChapatis and greek yoghurt, to serveHeat the oil in a large, deep-sided frying pan and test it’s up to temperature by dipping in a wooden spoon: if bubbles form around the spoon immediately, the oil is ready. Drop in the curry leaves and cumin seeds, leave them to splutter for a minute, then add the onion. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, until the onion is glossy and soft enough to cut with a wooden spoon; don’t skimp on the time here.Add the ginger, garlic and chilli to the softened onions and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes. Tip in the tomatoes and leave to cook for eight or so minutes, until the mix splits and the tomatoes start to release oil back into the pan.Add the garam masala, stir for a minute, then add the kidney beans, salt, 250ml cold water and the sweetcorn, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer and leave to cook for a further 10 minutes.Serve with chapatis and thick Greek yoghurt.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"
