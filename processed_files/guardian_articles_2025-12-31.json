But it is hard not to wonder, when looked at from a certain angle, whether he has taken one for the team.On 1 January, Thomson takes over as the director general of Cern, the multi-Nobel prizewinning nuclear physics laboratory on the outskirts of Geneva. It is here, deep beneath the ground, that theLarge Hadron Collider(LHC), the largest scientific instrument ever built, recreates conditions that existed microseconds after the big bang.The machine won its place in history for discovering the mysteriousHiggs boson, whose accompanying field turns space into a kind of cosmic glue. But one of the first things Thomson will do is turn the machine off for engineering work. It will not restart until his term is nearly over.In an office on the first floor of the Cavendish laboratory, past a model of the DNA double helix discovered in Cambridge by James Watson and Francis Crick more than 70 years ago, Thomson is far from disconsolate about the shutdown. If anything, he is relishing what the next five years hold.“The machine is running brilliantly and we’re recording huge amounts of data,” he says. “There’s going to be plenty to analyse over the period. The physics results will keep on coming.”Thomson’s background is far from academic: he went to comprehensive school in Worthing, West Sussex, and got a taste for physics only after reading a popular book about science atCernin his early teens. “It kind of set my direction,” he says. “I wanted to understand how the universe worked.” He became the first in his family to go to university, reading physics at Oxford.The LHC accelerates protons, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms, to nearly light speed inside a 27km-long (16-mile) ring under the French-Swiss countryside. At four points around the ring, protons zipping in one direction are steered into others rushing towards them. The energy on impact creates a shower of new particles that are recorded by the LHC’s detectors. In line with Einstein’s seminal equation E=mc2, more energy yields more massive particles.View image in fullscreenThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) nuclear particle accelerator at Cern, pictured in 2018.Photograph: EThamPhoto/Getty ImagesStarting in June, the shutdown will make way for thehigh-luminosity LHC, a major upgrade that involves installing powerful new superconducting magnets to squeeze the collider’s proton beams and make them brighter. This will raise the number of collisions in the machine tenfold. The detectors are being strengthened too, making them better able to capture the subtle signs of new physics collisions can reveal. “It’s an incredibly exciting project,” Thomson says. “It’s more interesting than just sitting here with the machine hammering away.”If the upgrade works, the LHC will make more precise measurements of particles and their interactions, which could find cracks in today’s theories that become the foundations for tomorrow’s. One remaining mystery surrounds the Higgs boson. Elementary particles gain their masses from the Higgs, but why the masses vary as they do is anyone’s guess. It is not even clear how Higgs bosons interact with one another. “We could see something completely unexpected,” Thomson says.Getting the high-luminosity LHC up and running will dominate Thomson’s five-year tenure. But a much larger, and more controversial, project requires his attention, too. The LHC reaches the end of its life around 2041 and Cern’s member states must decide what comes next. The frontrunner is a colossal machine called theFuture Circular Collideror FCC.mapAccording to Cern’sfeasibility report, the FCC would be more than three times the size of the LHC, calling for a new 91km circular tunnel to be bored up to 400 metres underground. The machine would be built in two stages. The first, starting in the late 2040s, would collide electrons into positrons, their anti-matter partners. At some point in the 2070s, that machine would be ripped out to make way for a new collider that smashes protons at seven times the energy of the LHC. The first phase will cost an estimated 15bn Swiss francs or £14bn.The engineering alone is ambitious, but the FCC faces wider challenges. Cern’s member states, who will vote on the project in 2028, cannot foot the whole bill, so other contributors are needed. Meanwhile, a debate is rumbling on over whether it is the best machine for making new discoveries. It is not guaranteed to answer any big questions in physics: what is the dark matter that clumps around galaxies; what is the dark energy that pushes the universe apart; why is gravity so weak; and why did matter win out over antimatter when the universe formed? With no clear prize to aim for, Thomson’s job will be harder.But there has always been more to Cern than science. Because of the lab,Europeis the world leader in particle physics, attracting tens of thousands of researchers and pushing forward a need for new technologies. But other countries, notably the US and China, have their own plans for advanced colliders. Whether Cern retains its pre-eminence depends on the LHC’s successor.“We’ve not got to the point where we have stopped making discoveries and the FCC is the natural progression. Our goal is to understand the universe at its most fundamental level,” says Thomson. “And this is absolutely not the time to give up.”Explore more on these topicsCernParticle physicsPhysicsLarge Hadron ColliderHiggs bosonScience funding crisisSwitzerlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Amid it all, I felt ashen and cold. As I walked out, I felt my first surge of quiet liberationLaura BartonWed 31 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareWe drove out along the coast one afternoon, to a fireworks shop a couple of towns along. It was late in the year, and the light was low and dismal, rain scudding the windscreen. In a couple of days’ time it would be New Year’s Eve, and then our small town would scatter itself to parties held in bars and houses and nightclubs, and out along the harbour. At midnight, there would be an amateur firework display on the roof of the old lido.In the shop that afternoon, some of the fireworks sat behind a glass-fronted cabinet. They had names like Stinging Bees, Vendetta and Sky Breaker, and beneath each item was a small laminated caption: “One hundred shot roman candle firing high whistling bees,” read one. “Twenty-five secs of time rain salutes. Noisy,” read another.Afterwards, we headed down to the vast, pebbled beach, watched the last flare of daylight on the horizon. I took a picture of my boyfriend, pale-faced in the drizzle. Then we sat in a chip shop, where in a small tank two fish swam despondently between a lighthouse and a submarine and a burst of plastic foliage.I do not remember this period of my life in colour. When I look back at photographs from that time I am surprised to see the bright blue plastic chairs of the takeaway, and the soft lemon of the beach light. I recall those days only as ashen and cold and unspoken.All the way back home we were quiet. It was my car, but my boyfriend drove. And it was his choice of songs we played on the stereo. I sat in the passenger seat and tried to remember how to make conversation. Outside, the night was filled with headlights and darkness and rain. I thought about all of the places I might rather be spending these last days of the year: northern dancefloors and California porches, sitting alone at a bar in Tennessee, perhaps. Somewhere, anywhere, warmer and kinder than here.I had already stayed far too long in the relationship. It was an old habit. Sticking it out, soldiering on, shaping and reshaping myself a thousand times to make myself into some approximation of what my partner wanted me to be. I would be smaller, I would be quieter, I would shear the edges of my needs to make him happier. I surely did not have to drive my own car or play the songs I wanted; I could spend New Year’s Eve in his town, with his friends, sleep in his cold house beneath his thin sheets. I could bury my feelings 20,000 leagues deep. I could mistake these contortions for love.New Year started in the early evening – at somebody’s house or in a restaurant or some pub or other. The night felt enormous then; huge and unfathomable and quite terrifying in its possibility. I was tired before it even began. Plans looped and crisscrossed, and folded back on themselves; if we missed one friend, we found another; caught others still as we rolled from venue to venue. And all the while the wind whipped in off the sea, foul-tempered and wild.The singer Aimee Mann has a line that has always summed up my feelings about fireworks: “When they light up our town I just think / What a waste of gunpowder and sky.” That night I stood on the pavement and watched as they lit up the shore: high-whistling and noisy, trailing their gold and glitter through the wet sky. As the New Year began, I turned my face to the mean wind, just to feel something.And then the night pressed on, with dancing and drinking and hard, determined revelry. It was the early morning when we reached a party in someone or other’s half-renovated house, and later still when I found myself drinking bad red wine in a spare bedroom, stuck in an endless loop of conversation with someone I barely knew and a coked-up TV producer down from London.After a while, a thought occurred to me:What if I just left?The TV producer was mid-sentence when I stood up and walked out of the room. And then down the stairs. And past the living room where people were dancing, and the kitchen, where my boyfriend stood laughing with his friends. And then out of the front door, into the cool, sweet morning.That New Year’s morning, as I walked slowly home through the grey and empty streets, I felt my first surge of quiet liberation; the light of a new thought dawning: you can leave the party, the town, the relationship. You can quit the big night out if it makes you feel small. We do not always have to stay.Explore more on these topicsNew yearMy big night outRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It memorably ends on the stroke of midnight as heartsick Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) abandons a drunken new year’s party to be with hapless, jobless CC Baxter (Jack Lemmon) instead. Is The Apartment suggesting that Kubelik and Baxter then live happily ever after? Probably not, because I’ve never been convinced that these two lovers are going to stay the course. They’re too mismatched and desperate; their wounds are still too fresh. What the ending gives us is the next best thing: a sudden sense of hope and freedom, with everything packed in boxes except for a bottle, two glasses and a deck of cards. Nothing to lose and nowhere to go. “Shut up and deal.” A clean break, a fresh start.Xan BrooksDead Poets SocietyView image in fullscreenAbsolutely magnetic … Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society.Photograph: Touchstone/Sportsphoto/AllstarI can’t think of a better way to end the year than watching one of Robin Williams’s greatest performances. The late actor was absolutely magnetic as John Keating, the kind-hearted new English teacher at an all-boys boarding school in Vermont, who shakes things up with his unconventional teaching methods. His most important lesson is telling his students to embrace the idea of carpe diem – to “seize the day”.As a warning against the stultifying dangers of mindless conformity, Dead Poets Society is an inspiring, heartwarming and profoundly moving coming-of-age film. One of my favourite scenes is when Keating asks Ethan Hawke’s shy student Todd to sound a “barbaric yawp”, as poet Walt Whitman once put it, in front of the class. His first attempt is as meek as a sleepy kitten but soon, with the help of Keating’s supportive cajoling, he’s howling like a wolf, lines of poetry flowing out of him like a stream after a heavy deluge of rain.As we head into the new year, we could all take a leaf out of Dead Poets Society’s infinitely wise book; to leave behind the fears holding us back and make our voices heard even if we have to rage and roar to express ourselves.Ann LeeStrange DaysView image in fullscreenKick-ass … Angela Bassett in Strange Days.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarA flop on release – at a time audiences were facing an abundance of multiplex options – Kathryn Bigelow’s pre-millennial tech-noir has seen its reputation swell substantially over the decades. James Cameron and Jay Cocks’s screenplay straddles the 20th and 21st centuries: kick-ass chauffeur Angela Bassett strives to shake lovelorn VR addict Ralph Fiennes from his funk so as to unravel a conspiracy involving the LAPD. What follows is a cautionary tale about real-world structural flaws and the bedazzlements of the virtual realm; the source of Fatboy Slim’s “right here, right now” sample; and, most crucially, a propulsive, jolting, finally exhilarating thriller. Increasingly, when the clock strikes midnight on 1 January, it’s Bassett’s wearied “we made it” that sounds like a bell in my head.Mike McCahillThe Irony of FateView image in fullscreenScrewball swerves … Andrey Myagkov and Barbara Brylska in The Irony of Fate.Photograph: Mosfilm StudiosAlready most will struggle to recall the 2022 romcom About Fate. But not the 1976 New Year’s Eve classic on which it was based: The Irony of Fate, which is known by every Russian. The holiday misrule premise, beloved of many NYE flicks, works even more fruitfully in the far more rigid Soviet context: soon-to-be-married Moscow doctor Zhenya (Andrey Myagkov) mistakenly gets on a flight to Leningrad after his stag party. Thanks to identikit Soviet architecture, he drunkenly falls asleep in an apartment with the same address, where willowy Nadya (Barbara Brylska) is welcoming her cranky fiance, Ippolit (Yury Yakovlev, the Soviet John Cleese). The course of true love takes many screwball swerves, with the lead pair fanning the Slavic melancholy by often breaking out a guitar for one of Mikael Tariverdiev’s stunning songs. Epic but intimate, a kind of Kieślowskian import sets in as the night gets long; have these circling soulmates also left it too late in life?Phil HoadThe Lord of the RingsView image in fullscreenGalloping into another year … The Lord of the Rings.Photograph: New Line Cinema/Allstar“The world is changed.” So begins Peter Jackson’s epic three-part adaptation of JRR Tolkien’s epic. I have a tradition where I get together with friends (some more enthusiastic than others, it must be said), and watch the full extended cut of the whole trilogy, every New Year’s Eve. The worldhaschanged, you see: it’s a chance to reflect and look back over the year while enjoying a glorious trio of films whose comforting familiarity never breeds contempt. Instead, like a good marriage, the flaws are part of what you adore. Twelve hours well spent, we think you’ll agree.Catherine BraySunset BoulevardView image in fullscreenClosing up the year … Gloria Swanson and William Holden in Sunset Boulevard.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/AllstarYou want a bona fide, satisfaction-guaranteed classic, but also something that makes you glad you’re not going out – and Sunset Boulevard ticks both boxes handsomely. Especially since it contains what must be the bleakest New Year’s Eve party ever. To recap, William Holden’s husk of a screenwriter rocks up at faded starlet Gloria Swanson’s mansion in white tie, to discover he’s the only other guest. Eventually he storms out in search of genuine revelry, only to be reeled back in before midnight after Swanson melodramatically slashes her wrists. The new year is not going to be happy for either of them. Piercingly grim but also gloriously camp, Billy Wilder’s diamond-cut Hollywood hate letter merits endless rewatching, and you can have fun playing “spot the modern-day resonances”. From silents-to-talkies, substitute cinemas-to-streaming, lament how the pictures really have got small, and pledge to get out more next year.Steve RoseThe ShiningView image in fullscreenHappy holidays … Jack Nicholson in The Shining.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarMovie pairings for the holidays are best kept simple, nothing fussy or fancy. In that spirit of not overthinking it,The Shiningis perfect movie for New Year’s Eve. It’s a horror staple that never wears thin. Most people have seen it at least three times already, so you won’t need to hit pause to get the sausage rolls out of the oven (or if someone starts banging on about Kubrick faking the moon landing). The Shining is also a classic winter movie, ending with a snowstorm at the Overlook hotel where aspiring novelist and alcoholic Jack Torrance has been growing ever more homicidal over the winter. I first watched it aged nine or 10, plucking a VHS at random from the stack next to the telly, monitored with negligent parental guidance, and have watched it at least a dozen times since. I have my own nine-year-old now, but may give her another year before letting her join the party.Cath ClarkeThe Poseidon AdventureView image in fullscreenSwell party … The Poseidon Adventure.Photograph: Cinetext/Allstar Collection/Sportsphoto/AllstarHowever damp a squib your New Year’s Eve, it’s always worth remembering that worse things happen at sea. And rarely do they get worse than the big wet hell in which the passengers of the SS Poseidon flounder in this most glorious and absorbing of disaster movies. No sooner have the corks popped to mark the start of 1972 than the warnings of captain Leslie Nielsen against going full speed ahead (an economising measure by the avaricious shipowners) are realised and the boat is bottom up in the middle of the Atlantic, with thousands meeting grisly and often quite creative ends.A handful of survivors – including Red Buttons, Ernest Borgnine and Shelley Winters – then slowly clamber up to the hull with only the wateriest hope of salvation. The tension is ratcheted slowly, the set pieces expert, the sentimentality diluted by real grit and upset. The star of the show, of course, is preacher Gene Hackman, sweatily brave to the end, when he sacrifices himself in a polo neck. In a year that began withthe horrific news of his death, it’s salutary to see Hackman in his prime: tough and smart and sardonic,raging at God and rousing the rest of us to keep fighting.Catherine ShoardRadio DaysView image in fullscreenTuned to the occasion … Radio Days.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyIf there’s one cry of “happy new year” that echoes down the decades, it’s from Woody Allen’s still-wonderful memoir of his boyhood years in 1940s New York. (Allen actually grew up in Brooklyn, on the other side of Jamaica Bay from Rockaway where this is set, but the windswept boardwalk he presumably visited as a kid was just too picturesque to pass up.) There are so many jewels contained within – “You think the Atlantic is a greater ocean than the Pacific?”, a communist Larry David, the burglars who win a radio phone-in competition, the Carmen Miranda singalong – that are worth it for themselves alone, but at its heart there’s an out-with-the-old in-with-the-new wistfulness to the whole thing. Filtered through one of Allen’s favoured tropes – the hazy, movie-fuelled nostalgia for the supposed sophistication of New York nightlife of the era – the film ends with a superbly maudlin final scene that via the medium of a live broadcast as 1943 turns into 1944, brings together Little Joe and his family with the radio superstars on the nightclub rooftop. It’s such a brilliant sequence, offering joy, hope and misery all rolled into a few minutes – watching it ought to be as compulsory as Jools Holland’s Hootenanny. (Radio Days supernerds might want to know: start the film at 10.07pm – and eight seconds – to line up the movie New Year countdown with the real one.)Andrew PulverHolidayView image in fullscreenBreak from routine … (from left) Doris Nolan, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Lew Ayres in Holiday.Photograph: Granger/Historical Picture Archive/AlamyMany of the best Christmas-themed romantic comedies come from the 1940s, but their spiritual sibling Holiday got an earlier jump on a slightly later holiday; released in 1938, it’s maybe the best New Year’s Eve-set romcom. Much of it unfolds at a party, during which Johnny (Cary Grant), who has resolved to take some time off to recharge and rediscover himself after years of labour, is drawn toward Linda (Katharine Hepburn), the free-spirited sister of his fiancee. Released the same year as Hepburn and Grant’s better-known pairing in Bringing Up Baby, Holiday is the more reflective and romantic of the two, with lovely direction from George Cukor. The lead characters’ willingness to rebuke expectations of capitalistic productivity, and instead make meaningful promises about how to better live their lives, makes it a particularly inspired and heartening new year’s watch.Jesse HassengerLa bonne annéeView image in fullscreenJoyeux … Lino Ventura and Françoise Fabian in La bonne année.Photograph: Rizzoli FilmFor a happy new year with a French accent, try La bonne année (1973) directed by Claude Lelouch, a director whose films are too glossy and romantic to appeal to high-minded critics. In this non-linear narrative he channels his inner Jean-Pierre Melville by casting Lino Ventura, one of Melville’s favourite actors, as a convict out on Christmas parole and remembering a heist that went wrong. The robbery flashbacks alternate with his wooing of Françoise Fabian as the proprietor of an antiques shop next door to the targeted jewellery store, allowing granite-faced Ventura to show his goofy side. Seasonal delights include a drag queen miming to Mireille Mathieu singing Francis Lai’s title song – with Mathieu herself in the audience! If you can’t handle subtitles, Hollywood remade it as Happy New Year (1987), the highlight of which is Peter Falk disguising himself as an old lady.Anne BillsonPhantom ThreadView image in fullscreenAfter the omelette … Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps in Phantom Thread.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyPhantom Thread is pretty much the perfect movie for most occasions – Christmas, breakfast, date night, mid-food poisoning fever spiral – but one of its most effectively date-specific sequences takes place during New Year’s, a relatably tumultuous night for us all. She wants to go dancing, he wants to do nothing and in one of the movie’s most ravishingly orchestrated moments, he goes after her, forced to play prince and save her from the extravagant party chaos. It’s too little too late but in the hopeful, post dodgy omelette flash forward at the end, they’re dancing instead of arguing their way into a new year, a dream replacing a nightmare. Paul Thomas Anderson knows it’s usually a rotten night for most of us but he also knows that we still naively hope that next year might somehow be better.Benjamin LeeWhen Harry Met Sally …View image in fullscreenRob Reiner and Meg Ryan on the set of When Harry Met Sally …Photograph: Columbia Pictures/AllstarAppropriate for any New Year’s Eve, but even more so after this bummer of a month,When Harry Met Sallyis a classic. Made 36 years ago, it still seems remarkably fresh. The uncertainties, the awkwardness, the miscommunications, these things are just as universal as they were in 1989. Nora Ephron’s script still sparkles. Rob Reiner’s direction is still note-perfect. Watching it will make you miss them both, but that’s the point. Press play at 10.30pm, and 2026 will ring in right as Billy Crystal declares his love for Meg Ryan on New Year’s Eve. What a hopeful way to see out a crappy year.Stuart HeritageExplore more on these topicsFilmTelevisionTV streamingBilly WilderRob ReinerWhen Harry Met SallyThe ApartmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in 2025, the Americanentrepreneur Ben Lammsold much of the world on the idea that death did not, after all, need to be for ever.This was the year the billionaire’s genetics startup, Colossal Biosciences, claimed it had resurrected the dire wolf, an animal that disappeared at the end of the last ice age, by tweaking the DNA of grey wolves. According to the company, it had also edged closer to bringing the woolly mammoth back from the dead, with the creation of genetically engineered “woolly mice”.In a flurry of high-profile announcements and press releases, it launched projects to revive the Tasmanian tiger (also known as the thylacine), the dodo and the moa, a 3-metre tall bird that has been extinct for 600 years.“We’ve made a lot of big promises to the world,” Lamm tells the Guardian. “I think that we started to deliver.”Lamm, a 44-year-old veteran of gaming and AI startups, has brought a brash Silicon Valley showmanship and entrepreneurial drive to the genetic conservation sector – and his approach so far has been extremely lucrative.View image in fullscreenA genetically edited mouse with thick hair at a lab in Texas. Colossal created the woolly mouse as part of its plan to recreate mammoths by making an elephant cold-tolerant.Photograph: APHe quickly realised that de-extinction announcements were a recipe for excitement and publicity. When the company announced its “woolly mouse”, he recalls, “people were losing their minds”.Watching the response, Lamm says: “I thought: oh my gosh, they’re going to go crazy about the dire wolf stuff.”He was right. When Colossal unveiled its interpretation of the dire wolf in April, the news made international headlines. Enthusiasticprofiles in Time magazineandthe New Yorkerdeclared “the dire wolf is back”.Colossal invited the public to listen to “thefirst dire wolf howlsin over 10,000 years” on YouTube. “Obviously the dire wolves were a massive hit and fan favourite,” Lamm says.Money poured into Colossal from Hollywood and venture capital firms. The Texas-based start up, co-founded by Lamm and a Harvard geneticist, George Church, was valued at more than $10bn (£7.5bn) at its most recent fundraising round. American socialite and media figure Paris Hilton, filmmaker Peter Jackson, and former American footballer Tom Brady are among the investors, and the company now funds more than 100 scientists working to bring back extinct species from the dead.Extinction is still for ever. Charles Darwin nicely summed it up: ‘When a group has once wholly disappeared, it does not reappear’Nic Rawlence, University of OtagoColossal’s approach has also caught the attention of the powerful: the Trump administration cited the “resurrection” of the dire wolf as it made efforts to cut the endangered species list in the US.“It’s time to fundamentally change how we think about species conservation,”said the US interior secretary, Doug Burgum. “We need to continue improving recovery efforts to make that a reality, and the marvel of ‘de-extinction’ technology can help forge a future where populations are never at risk.”In the future, he said, “‘de-extinction’ can serve as a bedrock for modern species conservation.”But the announcements have been met by far less excitement among scientists. Shortly after the dire wolf announcement, and to much less fanfare, a group of the world’sleading experts on canids concludedthat the company had not really resurrected the species.Rather, they had made 20 edits to the DNA ofgrey wolves, and the resulting animals did not substantially differ from those that now roamed North America, the group said.View image in fullscreenColossal’s ‘dire wolf’ cubs. The species died out 12,000 years ago.Photograph: Colossal/AFP/GettyAmid the scientific reaction, Colossal’s chief scientist, Beth Shapiro, a leading expert on ancient DNA,acknowledged to New Scientistthat: “It’s not possible to bring something back that is identical to a species that used to be alive. Our animals are grey wolves with 20 edits that are cloned.”Many researchers in the sector who are not employed by Colossal have been far stronger in their criticism of the company’s claims. Nic Rawlence, director of the palaeogenetics laboratory at the University of Otago in New Zealand, is an expert on the moa, which the company is trying to resurrect. Bringing it back from the dead is not possible, Rawlence says.“Extinction is still for ever. Charles Darwin nicely summed it up when he said, ‘when a group has once wholly disappeared, it does not reappear; for the link of generation has been broken.’“Rather than true de-extinction, Colossal’s attempts are genetically engineered poor copies at best, passed off as the real deal,” he says. “Colossal are preying on people’s desire to undo the sins of the past. However, to achieve this, Colossal is spreading misinformation and undermining trust in science by attacking critics.”In a number of academic journals and scientists’ commentaries, the company’s announcements were met with deep scepticism. The geneticist Adam Rutherford called themammoth announcements “elephantine fantasies”that would only be possible with the invention of time travel.Others argue thatoverhyped claimsof bringing back lost species weaken trust in science and scientists. “I don’t think they de-extincted anything,” Jeanne Loring, a stem-cell biologist, told Nature.Those concerns have not slowed the company’s push forward. In the next few years, Colossal’s team of scientists will unveil its interpretation of the woolly mammoth. It will be a genetically modified Asian elephant adapted to live at -40C (-40F), with long hair, small ears and other mammoth characteristics interpreted from frozen DNA, says Lamm, who bristles at the suggestion this creature may not constitute a mammoth.View image in fullscreenOne of Colossal’s ‘dire wolves’ at the age of one. Critics say the firm merely tweaked grey wolf genes but did not resurrectAenocyon dirus.Photograph: AP/Colossal“We believe in free speech so if people want to call our mammoth a mammoth, or a genetically modified, cold-tolerant Asian elephant with lost mammoth alleles [variants of genes] inserted through genetic engineering, we’re cool with that. Whatever,” he says.“If a child cares more about biodiversity loss and the climate because they saw a Colossal mammoth, who gives a shit?” Lamm adds. “That’s our view.”Modern conservation doesn’t work at the speed at which we are eradicating species and changing the planetBen LammFor a number of scientists, making public criticisms of the company has come at a cost. In July,New Scientist revealed that several scientistswho had been critical of Colossal had been the subject of seemingly AI-generated articles in a mystery smear campaign, attacking their credentialsand academic records.Lamm says the company has nothing to do with the stories.“We have a lot of support from different communities publicly, ranging from scientists all the way to crypto; it’s a big spectrum. People argue about things all the time. So, if you are going to be a critic, you should be comfortable that you may also be criticised,” he says.The criticism has irritated Lamm. He points to Colossal’s efforts to conserve elephants and in trying to save the northern white rhino as evidence that his company can change the way the sector works. The company’s website frames its work as part of efforts to counteract the collapse of biodiversity, which some scientists have called thesixth mass extinction of life on Earth.View image in fullscreenAn impression of a South Island giant moa, one of two species of the tallest birds that ever existed, with a human drawn to scale. Colossal says it is trying to revive the extinct New Zealand birds.​Photograph: Colossal“The worst part of conservation is conservationists ,” he says. “A lot of models out there are not working and we need new models. The reality is, modern conservation – while it works – doesn’t work at the speed at which we are eradicating species and changing the planet.“We’ve got to get more of these incredible scientists off the couch and in the field saving animals. They must communicate it in a way that isn’t behind some paywalled scientific paper but in a way that gets a kid, like, ‘Oh, I want to go to Africa and save elephants. Oh my gosh, I have to save the dugong. What do you mean drug cartels are killing thevaquita? How can I help that?’”Scientists aiming to bring back woolly mammoth create woolly miceRead moreEven Colossal’s harshest critics recognise the potential of gene editing to save species caught in genetic bottlenecks. Many wildlife populations have become dangerously inbred as their numbers dwindle, and Colossal is working to reintroduce genetic diversity back into populations, such as the critically endangered red wolf in North America, by reintroducing lost genes from museum specimens.Despite the excitement and money around Colossal, however, conservationists say its work can never be a substitute for traditional efforts to save species from extinction: the time-consuming work of controlling predators, protecting ecosystems and restoring habitats.“De-extinction technology could be a useful conservation tool for living species,” says Rawlence, “but it won’t replace unsexy grunt work.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsExtinct wildlifeThe age of extinctionGene editingEndangered speciesAnimalsConservationGeneticsBiologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cameo’s Candy, one of the all-time great funk records, comes on and everyone lines up to do the dance. Maybe you throw yourself into it, maybe you are a white friend who looks around in confusion, or maybe, like me, you just sigh in resignation.The dance is a US import, beginning life as the electric slide in the mid-70s, and eventually becoming the Candy in Britain, thanks to its appearance at the end of the 1999 movieThe Best Man. Since then, be it birthdays, christenings, Christmas, NYE – even funerals – you’re certain to see the dancefloor immediately fill and get into formation once the initial few chords are played.Like many a mere mortal who failed to graduate from the James Brown & MC Hammer School of Rhythm, I despise the Candy. Not only because I’m not a great dancer – a Black counterstereotype that forces me to overcompensate in other areas – but also because I have witnessed the corrosive effect of the dance far too often. That the Candy is a cultural disaster is a hill I am more than willing to die on.First off, the Candy is not the fire-cracking party starter many have deluded themselves into thinking. A true connoisseur of the late-night boogie down knows that is a party destroyer. Yes, it’s delightful to witness everyone hop in formation and attempt a six-minute vigorously demanding dance formation, but what happens afterwards? In simple terms: everyone is too tired, too sweaty and too dizzy to continue. So they politely find their coats, car keys and excuses and make their way for the door.Another issue with the Candy is that it undermines the DJ and brings out the demon in the partygoer. Not long ago, I was hosting a memorial party for a great Black British writer. I was doing what people who can’t dance and don’t drink do: telling mean-spirited jokes and scornfully gossiping about book sales. Suddenly, I was dragged to the DJ booth. “Tell him to play Candy! Tell him to play Candy right now or I will never book him again!” said a usually reasonable friend, her eyes glowing with fury. “TELL HIM!”View image in fullscreenLarry Blackmon and Cameo perform at the Stone Soul Picnic in Hayward, California on 31 May 2004.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty ImagesThe DJ, a highly respected bluechip artist and record executive who has been in the business since I was a child, offered a bewildered shrug. Out of politeness, he played it, a mere half an hour into a four-hour shindig. The formation was formed. The dance was performed. Soon afterwards my friend was the first to reach for her bag and coat. The party was over before it started and at the end of the night we were forced to settle a hefty minimum spending bill. The DJ politely explained: “I’ve been doing this for nearly 40 years. I know exactly what to play and when. Candy should either end the party or it just destroys the party.”Perhaps the biggest sin of the Candy is that it is not inclusive. It is a one-size-fits-all dance with no variation or room for error, divergence or diversity. You’re either with the programme or have your back on the wall. On the bright side, the lack of inclusivity probably makes it the most quintessentially British national dance ever. It is a true reflection of our social order.Nels Abbey is an author, broadcaster and the founder ofUppity: the Intellectual PlaygroundExplore more on these topicsMusicThe hill I will die onBlack British cultureDanceWeddingscommentShareReuse this content"

By staying the course, we will defeat the decline and division offered by others.”Conditions may feel rife for a coup within Labour – but a change of leader alone isn’t going to fix things | Polly ToynbeeRead moreIn an indication that he believes 2026 could be the year when the fortunes of the country and his party begin to change, he added: “When Britain turns the corner with our future now in our control, the real Britain will shine through more strongly.”Starmer goes into 2026 as theleast popular prime minister ever, according to some polls, with his party heading for bruising results in May’s elections and some of his MPs agitating for his removal.Many Labour MPs have spent the Christmas break in their constituencies, where they have had to confront voter anger at early policy decisions.“I’ve spent a bit more time in the constituency in the last couple of weeks and it’s far worse than I thought,” said one. “There are real levels of hostility.”The prime minister’s advisers acknowledge the scale of the problem, but believe they can begin to change voters’ minds this year as the impact of decisions made over the first 18 months begins to be felt.Speaking to fellow advisers before Christmas, McSweeney said this would not be a “year of promises” but a “year of proof”, when public services would begin to improve and bills start to fall.Starmer and his ministers will highlight their action on the cost of living in the first few weeks of the new year, including in a speech by the prime minister that will emphasise recent interest rate cuts that have brought mortgage costs to their lowest since 2022.He will also talk about abolishing the two-child benefit cap, a policy the government is planning to focus on when it introduces a standalone bill to parliament next week to enact it.Meanwhile, Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, is putting the finishing touches to the£13bn warm homes planthat will detail how the government will spend its energy efficiency and low-carbon funding.Officials say the plan will focus on green technology such as solar panels and batteries, rather than home insulation, which was the focus of the recently scrapped energy companies obligation (Eco).The plan will scrap regulations that prevent people from plugging solar panels into domestic plug sockets, a technology widely used in Germany and other European countries.Scrapping the Eco scheme and reducing renewables levies will save energy users an estimated £138 on average, according to acalculationby the consultancy Cornwall Insight.From Send to single-sex spaces: key tests facing Keir Starmer in 2026Read moreMinisters are keen to show how their energy efficiency funding will also help bring bills down in the longer term, with Miliband framing his package as another cost of living measure.One government source said: “There will be a big focus in our warm homes [plan] on the clean tech products that can deliver energy bill reductions in the short and medium terms for households.”Starmer plans to couple this action with a charm offensive designed to win over his own MPs. The prime minister has invited Labour members to receptions at his countryside grace-and-favour home in a series of events across January and February.Officials say he will use the informal gatherings in part to strengthen the message that MPs should spend the run-up to May’s elections talking about the cost of living. Early indications, however, suggest his plans are being met with a mixed reception among parliamentary colleagues, many of whom feel angry about a bruising first 18 months in power.One said: “The parliamentary Labour party has a wealth of skills and experience which are being ignored. It is a bizarre approach that weakens us as a government and breeds resentment.”Another said they would not be taking up the invitation to attend Chequers. “I’ve been invited but the idea of making small talk and pretending everything is fine is just [being sick emoji].”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerUK cost of living crisisBenefitsEnergy billsHousehold billsConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

ButNHSEngland said hospitals remained under “incredible” pressure, with 95% of beds full. The cold weather was likely to escalate the situation, it said.On Wednesday, the UKHealthSecurity Agency (UKHSA) issued amber warnings for every region of England, which will be in place between 8pm on Wednesday until 10am next Tuesday.Previously,only north-east and north-west England were under an amber alert, with all other regions under a yellow alert. Amber cold health alerts are issued when the forecast weather is “likely to cause significant impacts across health and social care services”.Dr Paul Coleman, a health protection consultant at the UKHSA, said it was likely to be “very cold” across England over the next few days. “Low temperatures like these can have serious impacts on the health of some people, particularly older people and those with serious health conditions.“Exposure to cold can lead to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections. It is therefore really important, as the colder weather sets in, to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.”Wednesday’s NHS figures showed an average of 117 patients with flu were in critical care beds in the week ending 21 December, down from 128 the previous week. Separately, an average of 285 hospital beds were filled each day in the week ending 21 December by patients with diarrhoea and vomiting or norovirus-like symptoms, down from 427 the previous week.Prof Meghana Pandit, NHS England’s medical director, said the health service remained “under extraordinary pressure”, adding: “While there are signs of improvement and the NHS is in calmer waters, pressures on hospitals remain incredibly high and we’re not out of danger yet with temperatures set to drop in the coming days.”Wes Streeting, the health secretary, praised NHS staff for their efforts but said hospitals were “not out of the woods yet, with flu continuing to be a challenge”.Rory Deighton, an acute and community care director at the NHS Confederation, added: “Services are still seeing high levels of demand due to seasonal viruses and bed occupancy is around 95%, which is well above safe levels. There are also thousands of patients stuck in hospital beds despite being medically well enough to go home, in part due to a lack of community and social care.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthUK weatherEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It also followed a rare rebuke from the US supreme court, which blocked the White House’s efforts to deploy national guards inIllinois.Trump attempted to paint the decision as temporary in a post on his Truth Social platform, vowing to redeploy at a later date and insisting the initiative had been a success.ICE plans $100m yearlong ‘wartime recruitment’ media blitz to attract new agentsRead more“We are removing the National Guard from Chicago,Los Angeles, and Portland, despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities, and ONLY by that fact,” he wrote.“Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago were GONE if it weren’t for the Federal Government stepping in. We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again – Only a question of time!”Yet there seemed little doubt that the latest move amounted to a retreat. Earlier on Wednesday, Newsom had hailed the justice department’s decision, announced in a filing with the ninth circuit court of appeals, backing away from its argument that Trump had a right to put state national guard troops under his authority indefinitely.“This admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end,”wroteNewsom, who vocally and vigorously opposed the deployments on the streets of Los Angeles.In a statement on Wednesday evening, Newsom said he had directedCalifornianational guard leaders to “return state service members home to be with their families as soon as possible”.Trump initially ordered national guard members into the city last June in response to protests against raids conduced by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The deployment has been subject to a succession of legal challenges, with Newsom arguing that the situation did not justify the presence of federal forces and that Trump was exceeding his powers.A lower court ruled earlier this month that Trump had seized control of the national guard members illegally and ordered them returned to state authority. The administration had originally contested that ruling.Its change of tack amounted to the second setback in a week to Trump’s quest to federalize national guard units to quell displays of dissent against his highly contentious immigration policies, which he and other administration figures have depicted as violent riots.Last week, theUS supreme court delivered a rare rebukeby refusing to allow the administration to deploy national guards in Chicago – a move opposed by the city’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, who are both Democrats.Trump’s announcement casts doubts on the future of national guard deployments in other Democratic-run cities, including Washington DC andNew Orleans, where 350 troops were expected to arrive by New Year’s Eve.Troops have been deployed in Washington DC since last August, purportedly to counteract a supposed “crime wave”. One national guard was killed and another seriously wounded after beingshot by a gunman outside a metro stationin the city on 26 November.The incident led to an increase in the number guard members deployed in Washington, as well as an intensification of Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric after it emerged that the suspected assailant was an Afghan national who had been granted political asylum in the US. More than 2,000 troops have been deployed in Washington DC since August, with many being drafted in from at least 11 Republican-led states.A federal appeals court ruled this month that the troops can remain while a panel of judges establish whether their deployment is legal. A lower court had earlier ordered that they be removed.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryDonald TrumpChicagoLos AngelesPortlandCaliforniaIllinoisnewsShareReuse this content"

She was “married off” to an IS fighter with whom she had three children, all of whom died in infancy.In 2019, the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, revoked her citizenship on grounds of national security, in a decisionupheld in the court of appeal last yearand backed by the current government.Campaigners and Begum’s lawyers argue she was the victim of child trafficking. Begum, now 26, remains stateless in a Syrian refugee camp.A document published by the European court this month confirms that Begum is challenging Javid’s decision under article 4 of the European convention on human rights – a prohibition of slavery and forced labour.The case was lodged in December 2024, after she was denied the chance to challenge the removal of her British citizenship at the UK’s supreme court.Among four questions posed by judges in Strasbourg to theHome Office, they asked: “Did the secretary of state have a positive obligation, by virtue of article 4 of the convention, to consider whether the applicant had been a victim of trafficking and whether any duties or obligations to her flowed from that fact, before deciding to deprive her of her citizenship?”Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, which is representing Begum, said the court’s communication “presents an unprecedented opportunity” for the UK and Begum to “grapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous UK administrations”.One of the lawyers, Gareth Peirce, said: “It is impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child was in 2014-15 lured, encouraged and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to [IS-controlled] territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an [IS] fighter to propagate children for theIslamic State.”She added: “It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.“It has already been long conceded that the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, who took the precipitous decision in 2019 very publicly to deprive Ms Begum of citizenship, had failed entirely to consider the issues of grooming and trafficking of a school child in London and of the state’s consequent duties.”Pierce said the challenge came as the current government had made protections for victims of grooming and trafficking a national priority.A Home Office spokesperson said any decision made to protect national security would be robustly defended. They added: “The government will always protect the UK and its citizens. That is whyShamima Begum– who posed a national security threat – had her British citizenship revoked and is unable to return to the UK.”The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said Begum had “no place” in the UK because of her support for violent extremists. In a post on X, he wrote: “It is deeply concerning the European Court of Human Rights is now looking at using the ECHR to make the UK take her back.”Also on X, Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader, wrote: “ECHR can jog on….none of their business …just another reason why we must leave this foreign court.”Explore more on these topicsShamima BegumEuropean court of human rightsHuman rightsIslamic StateHome OfficeUK security and counter-terrorismCounter-terrorism policynewsShareReuse this content"

He closed his shop and took to the streets, joining merchants acrossIranwho shuttered their stores and students who took over their campuses to protest against declining economic conditions.The sudden loss of purchasing power pushed Alborz andtens of thousands of other Iranians into the streets, where protests are now entering their fourth day. Students have paralysed university campuses, traders have shut down their stores and demonstrators have blocked off streets in defiance of police. Protests have spread from the capital, Tehran, to cities across Iran.Despite the risk of being jailed for his political activism, the father of four had run out of options. On Sunday, the national currency plunged to a historic low, putting further pressure on Alborz, who was already struggling to provide for his family.“What will my children eat? Do we have to bring suitcases of cash to simply buy bread? Do you find that normal?” Alborz told the Guardian over the phone, speaking under a pseudonym for fear of security reprisals.The unprecedented depreciation of the national currency on Sunday – when the Iranian rial dropped to 1.42m to the US dollar, a more than 56% decrease in value in six months – was a breaking point for an already struggling economy and population. The plunging currency has caused soaring inflation, with food prices up by 72% on average compared with the same time last year.Iranian inflation graphicIran is also under some of the world’s most intense sanctions, which have spurred inflation as the country struggles to access frozen funds abroad and foreign exchange, something exacerbated by its growing reliance on imports.View image in fullscreenA currency exchange office in Tehran.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyThe protests are the largest in Iran since 2022, when Iranians erupted in anger at the death of 22-year-oldMahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested for not wearing her hijab properly. Those protests were violently quashed and ultimately simmered out.Social media in Iran has been filled with videos of protesters chanting anti-government slogans and throwing stones at security forces. In one video from Tehran, a lone man sits blocking the way of security services on motorbikes as crowds of protesters flee from teargas.VideoThough the protests started as demonstrations against deteriorating living conditions, they have widened to express grievances at the way Iran is being governed. Women’s rights activists, shopkeepers and students have begun chanting “death to the dictator” and “woman, life, freedom” – slogans that could put people in prison.Alborz said: “For years now, we have slowly but surely made significant changes to our lifestyles because of this corrupt government. This was the last nail in the coffin. We wanted this regime gone and now there’s no way this regime will continue.”The government, still shaken from a brutal 12-day war with Israel in June which rocked the foundations of the Iranian regime, has called for dialogue with protest leaders. Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said the government should listen to the “legitimate demands” of protesters.But they are wary of the offer, believing it to be an attempt to co-opt their demands and kill the momentum of the rare protest movement.“You must be naive to think Iranians trust this government or the regime,” said Farhad, a 19-year-old university student active in the protest movement who spoke under a pseudonym.He and other students described how security services had confiscated student IDs and beaten and arrested some protesters. A protester in Tehran sent the Guardian a picture of a metal pellet, which they said was shot at them by security forces. The Guardian could not independently verify the claim of the protester.Iranian GDP growth graphic“If the administration wanted to talk, they wouldn’t fire teargas, shoot at protesters and if dialogue is what they wanted, they would not have executed protesters in 2023. There is no willingness from any of us to talk to them, we want the mullahs gone and we want democracy,” Farhad added.As the Iranian government dealt with protests at home, it was also facing threats from abroad.On Monday, the US president,Donald Trump, flirted with the idea of striking Iran again, suggesting there could be renewed nuclear activity in Iran – telling reporters if there was, “we’ll knock them down”. Iran has rejected claims it is enriching uranium and has said its nuclear programme is peaceful.On Monday, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said in a statement it would confront any “sedition, unrest” or security threats.The IRGC said: “Enemies are seeking to sow the seeds of sedition within Iranian society through cognitive warfare, psychological operations, falsified narratives, fear-mongering and encouragement of capitulation to them.”Despite intimidation from authorities, protesters said they were not cowed. They expected trade unions to soon join the merchants in striking.“Yesterday, we blocked roads and stopped the security forces from advancing. People sat on the roads and chanted that they could kill us, but we wouldn’t let them pass. We are not going to open shops until the regime weakens further,” said Alborz.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaProtestDonald TrumpIran nuclear dealIran's nuclear programmefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Houses with blue-painted roofs and window frames line a dirt track, many shuttered or abandoned.Residents can see the cranes and silos of Izmail, a Ukrainian port city separated from Plauru by the 300 metre-width of the Danube River. By day the scene is deceptively calm. But sometimes, after dark, that calm dissolves.The hum of drones cuts through the night, followed by explosions that rattle windows and shake people out of their beds.For the 500 or so people in Ceatalchioi commune, which includes Plauru and three other villages, the war in Ukraine is not something they watch from a distance, but a daily reality.MapAs Russia targets Ukrainian port infrastructure along the Danube, Romanian villages squeezed against the border have found themselves on the frontline of a conflict in which they are not fighting.Drone debris has repeatedly landed on Romanian territory, raising uncomfortable questions for Nato’s easternmost communities about security, escalation and how long civilians can be expected to live under constant threat.Ceatalchioi and its villages are connected to the outside world by a single dirt road that winds to Tulcea, the nearest city. Beyond that, people must take a ferry to cross the Danube. The road is deeply rutted and pocked with potholes, barely passable in places.View image in fullscreenTulcea, the largest Romanian city closest to the Ukrainian border and through which the Danube passes.Photograph: Andrei Popoviciu/The Guardian“For more than three years we have lived with war over our heads. Some areas in Ukraine do not have the level of stress that we have here,” said Tudor Cernega, the mayor of Ceatalchioi commune. “We are on the hotline. Practically, we are part of the war too.”For Cernega, the lack of a paved road is not just an inconvenience but a safety risk, slowing evacuations and deepening the commune’s isolation.That risk became urgent in November, when a Russian drone struck a Ukrainian ship carrying liquefied gas in Izmail, setting it on fire. Fearing an explosion, Romanian authorities evacuated people from Plauru and Ceatalchioi, transporting them to Tulcea. Some left reluctantly, insisting on feeding their animals first.“It was to be expected that this moment would come,” Cernega said. “We have been subjected to this terror for more than three years now. God forbid a drone falls on a house.”View image in fullscreenA photograph taken from the Romanian side of the border on the Danube shows a cargo ship loaded with LPG on fire after Russian strikes on Izmail, Ukraine.Photograph: APVillagers say fragments of drones have repeatedly fallen in nearby fields and wetlands since the invasion began. While no one has been killed, the incidents have unsettled communities that already feel cut off and neglected.Adriana Giuvanovici, 71, lives alone in Plauru. Her husband died two years ago of heart problems, and her children live in Tulcea. She was in the city’s hospital when the evacuation happened but has no plans to leave the only home she has known.“We hear loud noises and bombs every now and again,” she said, standing in her yard. “We got used to it, but of course we are afraid.”Across the commune, fear, but also habit, have become routine. Georghe Boftea and his neighbour Mititelu Petrea were evacuated last month.View image in fullscreenGheorghe Boftea (left) and Mititelu Petrea say they got used to the sounds of bombs from over the Danube and do not want to ever leave their village of Plauru.Photograph: Andrei Popoviciu/The Guardian“You live in fear because you don’t know where the next drone will fall,” Boftea said. “We are just a few hundred metres from Ukraine. The sirens, the bombs, you hear everything.”Boftea relies on subsistence farming, raising cows, pigs and chickens. For him, leaving is not only an emotional issue but a practical one. Animals still need feeding, even when the village has to be evacuated.Marius Morozov, who works at Ceatalchioi town hall, said that when the war started in 2022 there were far fewer explosions. “There were maybe five to seven per evening,” he said. “Now sometimes it can be more than 50 in a night, they come more often.”He tries to joke about it with friends, betting on how many drones will fall the following night, but the exhaustion shows. “Sometimes you don’t sleep all night because of the bomb noises, and then you still have to come to work the next day.”View image in fullscreenMarius Morozov, an employee at Ceatalchioi city hall, says he has grown used to the alarms and drones, but they sometimes keep him awake at night.Photograph: Andrei Popoviciu/The GuardianThe psychological toll is there, especially on children. In Ceatalchioi, Ecaterina Statache said her 11-year-old daughter had panic attacks prompted by the explosions. During the November evacuation, the girl was at school.“She cried the whole time during the evacuation,” Statache said. “Life is not normal here. But what can we do? We go on and hope that no one will die.”Her 19-year-old son wants to stay, even as many of his friends have left to work abroad or moved to Tulcea. Older residents say they have little real choice.“At our age, where would we go?” said Alexandru Nedelcu, a 70-year-old man living in Plauru with his wife. “We are not used to the city, but we can get used to the drones and bombs.”Following repeated incidents along its 400-mile border with Ukraine, Romania changed its legislation in 2025 to allow the military to shoot down unauthorised drones that enter its airspace. The army has so far refrained from doing so, wary of escalating tensions and being drawn directly into the war.View image in fullscreenAlexandru Nedelcu, who lives in Plauru, says people from the village are not used to the city so are reluctant to evacuate.Photograph: Andrei Popoviciu/The GuardianIn a recent television interview, Romania’s president, Nicuşor Dan, said that reluctance to shoot down the drones was driven not by fear but by operational constraints.“If a drone is 500 metres from the Ukrainian border, depending on its trajectory, you can risk engaging it over Ukrainian territory,” he said. “But if it is flying above a town, you cannot fire without risking civilians. If we can neutralise a drone without endangering residents or causing additional damage, you will see drones being shot down in Romania.”For local officials, the problems are not only military ones. Cernega points to the lack of basic infrastructure in Plauru, including access to clean water, proper docking pontoons for boats and a road capable of supporting evacuations.That neglect has created resentment, including some anti-Ukrainian sentiment, as local people contrast the support offered to refugees with their own sense of abandonment.“We help the Ukrainians but we have been abandoned,” said Cernega. “It would not cost much to fix the road, considering its strategic position on the border. The port across the river has fertiliser, fuel, everything that could make this a similar situation to what happened in Beirut,” he said, referencing theexplosionthat shook the Lebanese capital in 2020.As night falls over the delta, the Danube mirrors the lights of Izmail port. In Plauru, people close their shutters and wait. The war grinds on across the river, and for those living here, a single decision could make them the first Nato citizens drawn directly into it.Explore more on these topicsRomaniaRussiaUkraineEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is also a decade since another key moment in climate justice, when astate was orderedfor the first time to cut its carbon emissions faster to protect its citizens from climate change. The Urgenda case, which wasupheld by the Netherlands’ supreme court in 2019, was one of the first rumblings of a wave of climate litigation around the world thatcampaigners sayhas resulted in a new legal architecture for climate protection.Over the past 12 months, there have been many more important rulings and tangible changes on climate driven by legal action.Rosebank and Jackdaw approval ruled illegalThe year started with a bang when UK government approval of the Rosebank and Jackdaw oil and gas fields in the North Sea was ruled illegal bythe Scottish court of session, because it did not account for greenhouse gas emissions caused by burning the extracted fossil fuels.The judgment relied heavily on a2024 supreme court rulingin a climatecase brought by campaigner Sarah Finch. That ruling also led the high court to throw outplanning permissionfor a new coalmine in Whitehaven, Cumbria, after which thecompany withdrew its plans.The governmentpublished new guidancein June on how these assessments should be undertaken, although the rulingdoes not automatically prevent regulatorsfrom approving fossil fuel projects once they have fully analysed their impacts.Equinor published arevised environmental assessmentof Rosebank in October and a decision on approval is imminent. The government has hinted that it may give consent again, and Greenpeace has vowed further legal action if that happens.Plans to build Brazil’s largest coal plant scrappedCivil society organisations have been campaigning for years against a coalmine and power plant in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul planned by the coal company Copelmi. If it had gone ahead, it would have been the largest coal plant in Brazil.The groups argued that the Nova Seival plant and Guaíba mine breached Brazil’s climate obligations, and that the licensing process had not been undertaken properly. In 2022, a courtsuspended the licencesand set out requirements for how the process should be revised. But in February this year, Copelmiformally withdrew its plans, saying the project had become unfeasible.German court opens door for climate damages claimsOn the face of it, it sounds like a failure that a German courtrejected a climate casebrought by a Peruvian farmer and mountain guide against German energy company RWE.Saúl Luciano Lliuya had sought0.47% of the overall cost of building flood defences to protect his home from a melting glacier, a proportion equivalent to RWE’s contribution to global emissions.But thedecade-old casehad always been a stretch, and in reality it set a potentially important precedent on polluters’ liability for their carbon emissions.So it was not a surprise when later in the year a group of Pakistani farmers whose livelihoods were devastated by floods three years agofired the starting shot in a new legal claimagainst two of Germany’s most polluting companies.EnergyAustralia settles greenwashing lawsuit with parentsIn May, EnergyAustraliasettled a greenwashing lawsuitbrought by a group of Australian parents.Climate action group Parents for Climate claimed EnergyAustralia breached Australian Consumer Law when promoting electricity and gas products because the carbon offsets used to secure certification were not backed by meaningful reductions in emissions.As part of the settlement, the utility company acknowledged that carbon offsets do not prevent or undo damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions and apologised to 400,000 customers who were part of the scheme.It was thefirst case in the countryto be brought against a company for marketing itself as carbon neutral.International courts issue landmark climate opinionsTwo international courts issued landmark advisory opinions on climate change in July.First was theinter-American court of human rights, which found that there is a human right to a healthy climate and states have a duty to protect it. This was closely followed by theinternational court of justice, which said countries must prevent harm to the climate system and that failing to do so could result in their having to pay compensation and make other forms of restitution.The two documents are already beingreferenced in climate lawsuits around the world. Andattempts were made to use them as leverageduring climate talks in Brazil last month, although this provedmore difficult than anticipated.New South Wales coalmine expansion annulledApproval for the largest coalmine expansion in New South Wales wasannulledin Julybecause the state’s independent planning commission did not take into account the project’s full greenhouse gas emissions.Denman Aberdeen Muswellbrook Scone Healthy Environment Group, working with the Environmental Defenders Office, filed the case in 2023, arguing MACH Energy’sMount Pleasant Optimisationcoal mining project near Muswellbrook would worsen climate change and threaten a unique species of legless lizard.The court of appeal said the commission failed to account for “scope 3” emissions when the coal is exported and burned overseas.Apple scales back carbon neutrality claimsIn August, a Frankfurt court ruled that Apple was not allowed to call its Apple Watch “carbon neutral”.It agreed with German NGO Deutsche Umwelthilfe that the company could not demonstrate long-term carbon neutrality because the claim was based on funding eucalyptus groves in Paraguay, leases for which expire soon.Apple is trying to get asimilar greenwashing caseagainst it in the US dismissed.A few months later,tech news websites noticedthat Apple had stopped marketing its newly launched watches as carbon neutral in other countries too.Hawaii to cut transport emissionsafter lawsuitLast year, Hawaiiagreed to settle a lawsuitby 13 young people, represented by Our Children’s Trust, who said it was breaching their rights with infrastructure that contributes to climate change.The settlement acknowledgedthe constitutional rights of Hawaii youth to a life-sustaining climate, and the state promised to develop a roadmap to achieve zero emissions for its ground, sea and inner island air transportation systems by 2045.In October, it delivered. Theenergy security and waste reduction planincludes new electric vehicle chargers, investments in public and active transport, and efforts to sequester carbon through native reforestation. It will be updated annually.Campaigners called the plana “critical milestone”.Campaigners put end to coal power plant in KenyaEnvironmental campaigners won a key climate case challenging approval of a coal power plant in Lamu, on Kenya’s southern coast, in October.Litigation against Amu Power (a joint venture between Centum and Gulf Energy) and the Kenyan National Environment Management Authority began a decade ago andconstruction was ordered to stop in 2019.The environment and land court finally upheld a revocation of the plant’s licence because of flaws in the environmental assessment, particularly a lack of proper public participation. Climate change impacts had also not been properly assessed.TotalEnergies ordered to stop greenwashing in FranceLater in the month, TotalEnergieswas found to have made false claims about its climate goalsin a French court for false claims about its climate goals.Les Amis de la Terre France, Greenpeace France and Notre Affaire à Tous, with the support of ClientEarth, claimed TotalEnergies’s “reinvention” marketing campaign broke European consumer law by suggesting it could reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 while continuing to produce fossil fuels.The Paris judicial court ruled that some claims on the company’s French website were likely to mislead consumers because there was not enough information about what they meant.Meat companies settle greenwashing claimsIn early November, New Yorkagreed a $1.1m settlementwith Brazilian meat company JBS’s US arm to end a lawsuit claiming the company misled customers about its efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.The money will be used to support climate-smart agriculture programmes that help New York farmers adopt best practices to reduce emissions, increase resiliency and enhance productivity. JBS USA also agreed to reform its environmental marketing practices and report annually to the New York office of the attorney general for three years.Soon after, Tyson Foods alsoagreed to stop sayingit will reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and marketing beef as climate friendly to settle a greenwashing lawsuit brought by agriculture industry watchdog Environmental Working Group.UK government publishes tougher climate planThe UK government published a revisedcarbon budget and growth delivery planin October after its previous plan was ruled unlawful by the high court.Thenew document reaffirmsthe UK’s commitment to decarbonise its electricity supply by 2030 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically by 2037, with specific measures for energy, transport, agriculture, homes and industry.It follows a successful lawsuit by the Good Law Project, Friends of the Earth and ClientEarth. After thestriking down of the originalnet zero strategy in court in 2022, the trio argued that the “threadbare” revised version was still not good enough.However, campaigners areplanning another round of legal actionchallenging national climate strategy, this time at the European court of human rights.Three Norwegian oilfields ruled illegalLicences for three oilfields in the North Sea were declared illegal in November by a Norwegian court because they were approved without the full impacts of climate change being considered.The Borgarting court of appealupheld a claimby Greenpeace Nordic and Natur og Ungdom challenging permission for the Equinor-operated Breidablikk and Aker BP’s Yggdrasil and Tyrving fields.The decision closely followed the European court of human rights’sdismissal of a lawsuit by the same claimants against Norway, which nonetheless set important standards for how states should undertake environmental impact assessments of fossil fuel projects.However, the Borgarting court stopped short of ordering the fields to stop producing oil, giving the Norwegian government six months to sort out the licences.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisFossil fuelsEnergyGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It makes it a no-go area for people.”Frank McDonald, who writes about urban planning for the Irish Times, recalled how he moved into the area in 1995, full of optimism, but fled in 2022 amid hordes of pub-crawlers and thumping nightclub music. “I feared that our home would become uninhabitable,” hewrote in July.View image in fullscreenGardaí enforcing coronavirus restrictions in Temple Bar in 2021.Photograph: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockSince then, there have been more grim headlines, including the alleged mugging of a visiting NFL quarterback and an assault on an English tourist who later died. Astudy of online reviewsrated Temple Bar the world’s third biggest tourist trap, reinforcing the perception of a raucous, brawling district best left to stag parties.It adds up to a crushing indictment of the original vision: instead of art and culture, crime and overpriced Guinness.MapThere is, however, an alternative view that Temple Bar is a victim of outdated stereotyping and that a renaissance is under way, making the area a vibrant and a worthy home for organisations such as the Irish Film Institute, Project Arts Centre, Smock Alley Theatre and Graphic Studio Gallery.“It is Dublin’s cultural quarter,” said Martin Harte, the chief executive officer of theTemple Bar Company, a business association. “The era of massive drinking – it’s not that now. Temple Bar is an entirely different place. It’s the front room of Dublin city.”View image in fullscreenMartin Harte, CEO of the Temple Bar Company, says the era of ‘massive drinking’ is over and the area is ‘the front room of Dublin city’.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianViolent incidents garnered publicity but set against an annualised footfall of 24m visits they were very rare, said Harte. “To say Temple Bar is unsafe is not accurate. Walk around, it has everything from small art galleries to coffee shops, tattoo parlours, vintage clothes shops, hotels. It’s where people come, it gives it that electricity.”Tom Roo, 39, and Heather Mitchell, 28, a couple from Leeds, agreed. “I was expecting young lads and drinking everywhere but it’s really nice to walk around, it’s relaxed,” said Roo. Mitchell found the pubs picturesque – more so even than their images on Instagram.View image in fullscreenTom Roo and Heather Mitchell, visitors from Leeds.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianIn the 1980s, much of this web of lanes and streets was derelict and due to become a bus terminus. Instead, in 1991 the government decided to channel Dublin’s year as European city of culture into a showcase project driven by a state agency and tax incentives. Renovated historic buildings and new contemporary structures and art installations created a landmark in urban renewal.The decade also brought cheap flights, laddish culture and superpubs that turned Temple Bar into a boozing destination. “That’s where it got its initial stripes, its brand,” said Harte. “You had to queue behind 30, 40 people to get in anywhere to have a drink.”The supposed culture hub was nicknamed the Temple of Bars and likened to Ibiza. Bacchanalia continued through the 2008 economic crash and prompted another judge – ruling in a 2017 assault case – to brand Temple Bar a vomit-splattered“disgrace to Ireland”.The Covid pandemic brought more challenges.Gangs maraudedthrough under-policed streets, stealing and vandalising. “All the zombies came out,” said Ángel Luis González, director of PhotoIreland, which runs exhibitions and a bookshop called The Library Project.View image in fullscreenÁngel Luis González in The Library Project.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianHowever, improved policing has restored safety, confidence and an eclectic vibe, said González, echoing a widespread view among stakeholders. People who come to take selfies outside famous pubs end up visiting galleries and discovering artists.John Cullen, who runs a jewellery shop and stall in a refurbished square, said the outdoor market drew in families with children. “It civilises the place.”View image in fullscreenJohn Cullen at his jewellery and accessories stall in Temple Bar.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianPubs such as the Palace, Gogarty’s and the Norseman still drew big crowds but the number of late night licences – which allow venues to serve alcohol until 3am – had plunged from 25 to seven and fine dining was making inroads, said Harte. “Every single pub now serves food. People are still drinking but nowhere near at the old levels.”Will Wollen, who moved to Temple Bar two years ago to run the Gaiety School of Acting, said the area’s reputation for excess was unfair. “There is an energy but it’s not a hen party hellscape. It’s a pub culture with warmth and friendliness.”Stephen Kennedy, who runs the Copper and Straw cafe and chairs the Aston Quay and Temple Bar Business and Residents’ Alliance, said there were plans for more street art, seating, lighting and perhaps an outdoor cinema. “I would tell any tourist coming to Dublin that Temple Bar is a must.”Other Dubliners, in contrast, urge visitors to steer clear unless they like crowds, price gouging and ersatz Irishness. Critics also accuse platforms such as Airbnb of driving up rents and driving out people.View image in fullscreenLondoners Tom Salter, left, and Ben Early at a pub in Temple Bar.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianPerry Share, a sociologist and co-editor ofa book on Irish pubs, said Temple Bar was a “pub theme park” that offered a degree of authenticity. “Tourists come to replicate an Irish pub experience they have perhaps seen online. The music and drink is essential to that.”A vox pop of early evening drinkers last week yielded toasts to Temple Bar. “TikTok said it was too touristy but the buzz is great,” said Tom Salter, 22, from London. Dave Howard, from Derbyshire, had a caveat. “It can be quite fun watching a stag party. But not for the locals, obviously.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There has been wine, but it wasn’t central to the evening – a small block of clay and some inks were.It’s a different kind of night out from going for dinner and, possibly, having one too many, which is the formula plenty of us fall back on. At best that can be funandnurturing, but at worst you find yourself on the bus home feeling hollowed out and en route to a hangover. So how else can we let our hair down?First, it needs saying, the variations between what looks fun and fulfilling vary wildly from one person to the next. Not everyone is going to come away from lino printing feeling, as I did, as if their night has been well spent: it helped that, after some early ill-disguised scepticism, there was celebration of how well I’d captured Totoro’s expression.We’re often wrong about what will make us happy, so we go after the wrong things – it’s called ‘miswanting’We need, instead of specifics, to think about general issues. The behavioural scientist Jon Levy has a guiding principle: “What’s your ultimate objective?” Sally Dibden, a holistic health coach and founder of the Wellbeing Consultants, thinks a good place to start is by settling on the feeling you hope to achieve. Then ask yourself “how you would align an evening out from the feeling you want to generate”.You could aim for a feeling that will add some balance to your day, or the rest of your week. Are you working from home all day? Perhaps it’s in-person connection you need. “Flipping it completely on its head,” says Dibden, “for some people who are so on the hamster wheel of going out, it might be that they need solitude.” She has questions you could ask yourself: “Do I want to feel more energised? Do I want to feel more connected? Do I want to feel calmer? And then you can choose …”View image in fullscreen‘Try something you enjoyed as a child.’Photograph: Posed by models; Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty ImagesAccording to Dr Michael Plant, a research fellow at the University of Oxford’s Wellbeing Research Centre, “One of the most interesting lessons from happiness research is that we’re often wrong about what will make us happy, so we go after the wrong things – it’s called ‘miswanting’.” It’s why, he says, we’ve all had the experience of trying something new and being pleasantly surprised.If you’re struggling to figure out what’s right for you, Gillian Sandstrom, a professor in the psychology of kindness at the University of Sussex, suggests thinking back to what you enjoyed as a child. Partly because that’s when we often did things we weren’t always great at, but still enjoyed. For adults, she says, “There’s something freeing about allowing yourself to not be good at it and do it anyway – uncoupling the achievement from enjoyment.”There’s a temptation, especially if you’re tired at the end of the day, to go for something easy and fun that you can simply consume, such as a comedy night or a film. Levy points to the words of a friend, Elan Lee, the co-creator of the game Exploding Kittens. “He said: ‘When we looked at all the games we created, and compared the ones that succeeded versus those that failed, the ones that failed were fun games; the ones that succeeded were the ones that made the players fun.’” Levy says: “When we pick an activity, let’s not focus on just what will be fun, because most of the stuff that’s fun is very passive.”In fact, on a good night out, it may be that more effort, not less, is preferable. “To have an exciting or interesting or exceptional experience, you have to feel like you’ve grown from it.”Levy points to the Ikea effect: “It says that we care more about our Ikea furniture because we have to assemble it. So anything we invest effort into, we care more about.” He also gives the example of karaoke. “When we are in a vulnerable state, like when singing karaoke, it leads to a higher level of trust and connection.” Attempting to hit the high notes in a Chappell Roan song can be part of a growth experience. “You’re doing something that makes you a little uncomfortable and that’s healthy”; perhaps the perfect close to an otherwise mundane week.View image in fullscreenKaraoke can push you out of your comfort zone – but it’s not everyone’s idea of fun.Photograph: Posed by models; Maskot/Getty ImagesBut stepping out of your comfort zone doesn’t have to be as extrovert as publicly clawing for top C. Try a different location, suggests Levy, who in 2016 published a book called The 2am Principle: Discover the Science of Adventure, looking at whether you could socially engineer a great night out. “There’s this tendency that if you go to the places you already know well, you fall into your patterns,” he says. Although even in familiar places, we can construct things differently. Levy suggests setting yourself a challenge, such as performing three acts of kindness.Unless it’s solitude you need, the perfect night out will involve talking to others, whether that’s chatting to friends or strangers. According to Sandstrom, “There’s research showing that not only the quality and quantity of social interactions we have, but the diversity of our conversation partners, is also related to how happy we are.”Sandstrom has found mental health benefits to “weak tie” social connections, which are even brief conversations with strangers, or people outside our close circle. I remember with glee not a conversation but a sung chorus of the Totoro theme song that a stranger struck up without warning on seeing my evening’s work.Of course, you can’t plan for these encounters. “I think that’s part of the joy of it,” says Sandstrom. But you can build a mindset that will grease the wheels. It’s about “being open to it”, she says, giving the example of striking up a conversation with a stranger on the train home from an evening out. “If I had sat down and just pulled out my phone, it would never have happened.” It “ends the night with that perfect cherry on top”, she says. It won’t be easy for everyone, but from her research, practice helps.Looking at connection from a different angle, Dr Dan Weijers, co-editor of theInternational Journal of Wellbeing, suggests factoring nature into your plans. “There is a lot of evidence supporting connecting with nature as an important way to boost wellbeing. Combine this with what we already know about the benefits of exercise and socialising, and we get a compelling case for doing things with others outdoors.” This might be easier said than done, especially in winter.View image in fullscreenTake a moment to notice nature.Photograph: Posed by models; Jeremy Rice/Getty Images/Image SourceHolli-Anne Passmore is an associate professor at Concordia University of Edmonton, Canada, whose work looks at “simple, everyday ways that people can enhance their wellbeing and meaning in life”. She is clear that factoring in nature doesn’t necessarily mean spending the whole evening in the park (although, as a Canadian, she is fairly robust about being outdoors, even in the cold).It can, she says, be a case of spotting nature as you walk around your neighbourhood, maybe even on your way out for the evening. It sounds, she says, “like a really basic thing”, but when people are doing this consistently, her tests show that it works wonders, boosting “transcendent connectedness”, something she explains as “essentially feeling connected to everything and everybody”. It also boosts “elevation”, which she describes as “a composite emotion that includes feeling morally elevated, spiritually uplifted, profoundly touched, deeply grateful”. Hearteningly for those of us living on grey city streets, she sees these emotions registering as much with people looking at a tree at the bus stop as with people gazing at the Grand Canyon.Our mindset on a night out is also key. Dibden advises seeing it as trial and error, “pulling the things out that worked and the things that didn’t work … deconstructing it”. In fact, sometimes doing something that goes wrong is, according to Meik Wiking, the chief executive of the Happiness Research Institute, “far more likely to be fun and memorable”. He points to a night that has gone down among his group of friends as the Great Sausage Disaster of 2015 because they spent an evening making a mountain of revolting sausages. “We still don’t know what went wrong – but it was a memorable evening.”So don’t let perfection get in the way of progress. “I think there’s a problem in the title,” says Dibden. “‘Perfect’ doesn’t exist.” For Plant, “expecting that something should be perfect is a recipe for disappointment”. He recommends framing it, instead, as an experiment. “That way, you either have a good time or you’ll learn you don’t really like whatever it was. You can then cross it off the list, and do something else next time.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleHow to have a better dayFriendshipHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You’re free to not worry about what day of the week it is, or think too heavily on anything beyond your current state. But as we reach the new year, it is equally fun to think about the things we hope will bring some much-needed collective joy in the year ahead.This week, our colleagues from across the diaspora have shared the Black cultural events that they are looking forward to in 2026, from books and TV shows to Ghana beating England at theWorld Cup.View image in fullscreenImprobable achievement … Curaçao became the smallest country ever to qualify for the World Cup in November.Photograph: Ricardo Makyn/AFP/Getty ImagesThe World CupThe world’s biggest sporting (and arguably cultural) event is back and literally bigger than ever with an expanded format of 48 teams, up from 32. Englandhave been drawnin the same group asGhana, an early one-to-watch for the diaspora. England coach Thomas Tuchel has called Ghana a “difficult and strong” opponent. He is right to take the matchup seriously: Ghana’s Black Stars have never lost to England.Morocco, Senegal, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Cape Verde and SouthAfricamake up the remainder of the African contingent at the tournament. Keep an eye onSenegal, who many have picked to equal or better Morocco’s achievement of becoming the first African team in history to reach a World Cup semi-final.Save a cheer for theCaribbeanisland ofCuraçao,with a population of about 160,000, they have become the smallest country ever to qualify for the World Cup.Six South American teams have guaranteed their spots (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay and Paraguay) with a possible seventh if Bolivia or Suriname advance through the play-offs.FestivalsView image in fullscreenJoyous expression … Carnival in St. John’s, Antigua.Photograph: Robert Nickelsberg/Getty ImagesTheAntigua Carnivalis a cultural event thatcommemorates the emancipation of enslavedpeople in the Caribbean. In Antigua, it is a vibrant expression of national pride and cultural identity, characterised by joyous celebration, live music, and parades. The main event features masqueraders in intricately designed, elaborate costumes parading through St. John’s, accompanied by infectious soca and calypso music. The celebration also features J’ouvert Morning, a spirited event that starts in the early hours, where revellers take to the streets, often covered in paint, mud, or powder, dancing to live bands and DJs.Somaliland’sHargeisa International Book Fairwill be held in July or early August 2026. It prides itself as “thebiggest literary festivalin the Horn of Africa” and has been running since 2008.This year’sCalabash Literaryfestivalin Jamaica will be special. The three-day programme, with authortalks during the day, and DJ setsinto the early hours, is held on Treasure Beach, St Elizabeth’s Parish. The region, like much of the island, suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Melissa in October, and so there’s hope that the area and its residents will be ready to welcome visitors again.The region will also host theBocas Lit FestinTrinidad and Tobago, and theCaribbean festival of ArtsinBarbados.The Obama Presidential LibraryView image in fullscreenVital work … the Obama Presidential library will act as a community-centred endeavour, according to the Obamas.Photograph: Obama Presidential LibraryAfter some delays, Barack Obama will finally unveil his presidential library in June, right in the heart of Chicago’s South Side. Its location has led to concerns that it will gentrify the area. Still, the Obamas claim that, unlike other presidential libraries that are essentially mausoleums to the past, the centre will act as a vibrant community hub.BooksView image in fullscreenImmersive worlds … there is much to look forward to across fiction and nonfiction.Illustration: Guardian PicturesWilderness of Mirrors, the debut novel by Caine prize-winning Sierra Leonean writerOlufemi Terry, was published in September 2025 and will be released in the UK in April 2026 by Les Fugitives. In summary, it is a book that explores themes of identity, race, privilege, dislocation, and political unrest in a post-apartheid society. You could also call it the sexual and intellectual coming-of-age story of a young surgeon in post-apartheid South Africa.The World of Black FilmbyAshley Clarkis out in February (the cover alone is drool worthy). The book is a journey through 100 influential Black films from around the world.May will bring the very Long Wave codedAfricology and the African DiasporabyMolefi KeteAsante. The work seeks to highlight persistent links in practice and definition between members of the Black diaspora.Also in May,Eden McKenzie-Goddardwill publish his debut novelSmallie, about a woman caught in the Windrush scandal and her search for a lost love that could be the key to saving her.The highly anticipatedThe Freedom of Birdsis a queer novel set in Kenya by the Graywolf prize-winning authorKiprop Kimutai.About to Fall Apart,Ashley Hickson-Lovence’s latest novel, is set for a UK release in April 2026 by Faber and Faber. Lovence’s poetic rhythm and expert exploration of familiar themes such as parenthood, race, identity, and loneliness mean it is a sure bet to make an impact.Film and TVView image in fullscreenFormidable … Michaela Coel is set to star in and produce compelling film and TV in the coming year.Photograph: BBC2026 sees the return ofMichaelaCoel,who will star alongsideAnne Hathawayin the filmMother Mary.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Aquick admission: I absolutely love an elliptical or cross trainer. They don’t always get the plaudits they deserve, but these low-impact cardio machines not only putless strain on your jointsthan a treadmill but also help you get an impressive, full-body workout. Whether you hop on one to warm up before an intense strength-training session or use it to gently burn calories while listening to your favourite podcast, the elliptical or cross trainer can strengthen muscle, reduce fat and improve cardiovascular fitness.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, there is a catch in that these machines vary wildly in their design – and therefore the emphasis they place on different muscles. Traditional elliptical machines eschew moving handles, instead opting for static poles, while cross trainers usually have dynamic handles that recruit the muscles in your back, shoulders and arms. On top of this, stride length, the shape of the handles and the positioning of the footplates can make a big difference to the type of workout you’ll have.They can vary considerably in their weight and size, but are usually bulkier and more cumbersome than, say, a compacttreadmill. Home gym aficionados beware: you’ll likely need a fair amount of room for one of these. If you have enough space, though, an elliptical or cross trainer can be a valuable addition to your home training setup.At a glanceBest cross trainer overall:BowFlex Max Trainer M6£1,149.99 at JohnsonBest value elliptical trainer:Horizon EX-59£699.99 at JohnsonBest premium elliptical trainer:Technogym elliptical£3,940 at TechnogymBest compact cross trainer:JTX Strider-X8£399 at JTX FitnessBest full-body trainer:Schwinn 590 Elliptical£1,499 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’m a keen fitness fan who does gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes, as well as outdoor trail runs, cold-water surfing, and more. As a result, I’ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for magazines, newspapers and websites. I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I’m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells.I’m also a strong believer that you have to use new tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the correct environment. With exercise ellipticals and cross trainers, that meant getting hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.How I testedView image in fullscreenMost of the testing was performed in purpose-built boutiques or customer experience centres.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianAs with any modern piece of fitness equipment, the only way to ascertain whether it’s any good is to don your gym kit and get stuck in. So, after researching the newest and most popular models on the market, I set about trialling all eight of them.Most of my testing was carried out in purpose-built boutiques or customer experience centres because accommodating so many examples of such gym equipment in my home is not easy. I did manage to squeeze a couple into my garage via short-term loans, though.During workouts, I used a smartphone-based decibel reader to get a sense of how loud they were in use, and I also tested any connected or online features, which often meant downloading relevant apps and trialling their workout content.Where trainers had displays, I used these to log in to apps, such as Spotify and YouTube, and I also used any built-in Bluetooth speakers (if this function was offered). For each model, I made notes on ease of use, build quality and any features, as well as the overall size of the machine. If it had transport wheels, I used these to move the trainer around, simulating how easy it would be to manoeuvre in a domestic environment.The best cross trainers and elliptical machines to buy in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Will have your glutes and quads burning in rapid time’: the BowFlex Max Trainer M6.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianBest cross trainer overall:BowFlex Max Trainer M6BowFlexMax Trainer M6from£1,149.99£1,149.99 at Johnson£1,499 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat lower-body workout and fairly compactWhat we don’t loveCould be better for upper body; can’t adjust stride lengthPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£1,149.99 at Johnson£1,499 at AmazonBeing a petrolhead, I have to confess I was initially drawn to the BowFlex Max Trainer M6 because its LCD console reminds me of the dials found in a Mk3 Golf GTI. However, that’s not all that’s special about this cross trainer.Blending the motion of a stair-stepper with that of an elliptical machine, it has relatively compact dimensions and provides 16 resistance levels, enabling it to offer punishing, connected workouts.Those looking for powerful upper-body workouts or large, adjustable stride lengths may want to look elsewhere, but if you’re searching for a cross trainer that’ll have your glutes and quads burning in rapid time, look no further.Why we love itMost elliptical machines offer a gentle, calorie-burning workout, but the Max Trainer M6 is among the few that have left me fully gassed, with slightly weak legs at the end of a workout.This is because of its combination of elliptical and stepping motion, favouring shorter strides and an emphasis on downward pressure instead of the large strides of traditional machines. The handles are also intriguing as they offer a plethora of grip options, opening up the possibility of training multiple sections of the upper body (back, biceps, triceps and so on). But they’re fairly short, not offering a great range of motion to really work the upper body.The machine instantly connects with theBowFlex Jrny app, which is the company’s answer to Peloton, offering video-based workouts to make the experience more interactive. You’ll need an internet-connected smartphone or tablet, but the sessions are good, if limited, providing guided workouts that span all manner of fitness goals.Small(ish), quiet and relatively easy to move around, this is one of the few ellipticals that can be put away in the corner of a garage or living room without too much impact on living space.It’s a shame that… it doesn’t offer an adjustable stride length, and it will feel too much like a stepper for true elliptical fans.Dimensions:66 x 117 x 163cm (WLH)Weight:61.7kgDrivetrain:front-drive with magnetic resistance (16 levels)Stride length:38cmConnectivity:Bluetooth (for Jrny app access and HR tracking); USB charging port; media shelf for device placementFolding?NoNoise level:about 45dBMaximum user weight:136kgBuilt-in entertainment:no; burn rate dial and basic LCD, supports third-party workouts including Jrny via smartphone, tablet or laptopBowFlexMax Trainer M6from£1,149.99£1,149.99 at Johnson£1,499 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat lower-body workout and fairly compactWhat we don’t loveCould be better for upper body; can’t adjust stride lengthBest value elliptical trainer:Horizon EX-59HorizonEX-59 Ellipticalfrom£699.99£699.99 at Johnson£999.99 at DecathlonWhat we loveGreat build quality; good valueWhat we don’t loveResistance slow to adjust; display and speakers poorPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£699.99 at Johnson£999.99 at DecathlonAlthough it’s not the cheapest elliptical trainer on this list, the Horizon EX-59 is still my top value pick thanks to its array of features, robust build quality and a relatively low price.Why we love itA smooth, front-mounted flywheel provides 10 levels of quiet resistance, and oversize pedals accommodate a variety of different-sized users. With a stride length of 46cm, it’s not dissimilar to the larger elliptical machines you might find at a gym – meaning it feels more natural and less intense than a stepper or cross trainer.The EX-59 connects to third-party apps via Bluetooth, but it won’t automatically adjust the resistance like some rivals do. As with most Horizon fitness equipment, this model works with the brand’s@Zone app, which provides several high-quality on-demand workouts and training plans for free. There’s not a huge amount of content geared towards elliptical training, but most treadmill and exercise bike high-intensity interval training sessions work just as well.To me, it’s not the prettiest fitness machine, though it certainly does the job, offering drinks holders, a place to stash your smartphone or tablet, and a built-in heart-rate monitor on the static handles.The build quality is great, especially considering the price, although that doesn’t extend to the LCD display and console, which are basic. During testing, I found the changes to resistance inputs slow to react: not great if you’re indulging in a Hiit session and you need to spike the heart rate quickly. Similarly, the built-in Bluetooth speakers aren’t really worth the hassle of tethering a device – you’d get better sound quality out of a tin can. Instead, bring a pair of headphones, fire up the @Zone workout app and make the most of those free on-demand classes.It’s a shame that… the Bluetooth speakers are tinny, and ECB magnetic brake resistance is slow to react to inputs.Dimensions:61 x 186 x 167cm (WLH)Weight:74.5kgDrivetrain:front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (10 levels)Stride length:46cmConnectivity:Bluetooth speakers, device rack, USB rapid-charge port; compatible with popular fitness apps via Bluetooth FTMSFolding?NoNoise level:about 42dBMaximumuser weight:136kgBuilt-in entertainment:no touchscreen; has Bluetooth-enabled speakers and a tablet holder for external contentHorizonEX-59 Ellipticalfrom£699.99£699.99 at Johnson£999.99 at DecathlonWhat we loveGreat build quality; good valueWhat we don’t loveResistance slow to adjust; display and speakers poorBest foldable elliptical trainer:Technogym EllipticalTechnogymElliptical£3,940£3,940 at TechnogymWhat we loveClassy, quiet and compactWhat we don’t loveYou need a separate device for classesPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£3,940 at TechnogymIf money’s no object, it’s worth a visit to Technogym’s London Mayfair store, which is packed with drool-inducing fitness equipment that will make any home workout space feel like a five-star hotel.This elliptical trainer is part of the brand’s focus on the home and, as such, it folds upright to minimise its footprint in your living room, home gym or – in my case at least – cobweb-strewn garage.As a result, it shuns the traditional front- or rear-mounted flywheel for a suspended set of footplates and a resistance system that’s in its upright body. This helps save space but still offers a comparable, almost anti-gravity upper- and lower-body workout to other premium elliptical machines.With 25 difficulty levels and up to 600W of electrically adjustable resistance (up to 160 strides a minute: good luck with that), the elliptical packs a mean punch – and it works perfectly with the brand’s digital workout portfolio. Having said that, although there’s a basic screen to show all the usual important data, you’ll need to bring your own device if you want any sort of guided workout.Why we love itTechnogym’s “sessions” are up there with some of Peloton’s interactive classes, although you’ll need to provide your own tablet, smartphone or laptop. Unlike other fitness apps, there are plenty of elliptical-based classes to enjoy, which makes the experience feel much more enjoyable.Indeed, where some elliptical trainers can send me to sleep, the instructor in Technogym’s interactive classes will have you hanging off the unit, torching your glutes and pummelling your quads. It will keep you coming back for more.The movement itself takes a bit of getting used to: the stride isn’t quite as obvious as the larger units found in commercial gyms. I had to adapt my approach to get the most out of it, and I found it lacked the multiple grip positions and range of motion for effective upper-body focus training.Regardless, this trainer has Technogym quality baked into its core. It offers a huge spread of resistance levels, is virtually silent, and is all wrapped up in one of the most compact, storable and classy units on test.It’s a shame that… you have to bring a device to enjoy a workout, and Technogym’s monthly subscription fees are, predictably, expensive.Dimensions:65 x 162 x 160cm (WLH)Weight:100kgDrivetrain:front-drive electronically adjustable magnetic resistanceStride length:not specifiedConnectivity:tablet-compatible console for use with Technogym’s appsFolding?Yes (folds to 75cm length for compact storage)Noise level:about 36dBMaximum user weight:130kgBuilt-in entertainment:no built-in screen; designed for tablet use via consoleTechnogymElliptical£3,940£3,940 at TechnogymWhat we loveClassy, quiet and compactWhat we don’t loveYou need a separate device for classesBest compact cross trainer:JTX Strider-X8JTXStrider-X8from£399£399 at JTX Fitness£499 at AmazonWhat we loveSuper compact and affordableWhat we don’t loveSmall footplates won’t suit larger feet£399 at JTX Fitness£499 at AmazonThe JTX Strider-X8 was one of the most compact true ellipticals I got my hands on: it’s just 130cm long. The BowFlex Max Trainer M6 will fit better into tight spaces, but it doesn’t offer the same kind of traditional elliptical stride.Why we love itThe Strider-X8 provides 41cm of glorious gliding, corralled by a 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel at the rear. It’s quiet, although perhaps not as whisper-quiet as some rivals, and offers 16 levels of easily adjustable resistance.However, there are a few compromises. The compact proportions restrict the maximum user height to 5ft 9in, which means even a vertically challenged individual like myself is butting up against the limits. The build quality isn’t a strong point: the console, complete with basic display, looks and feels a bit like an oversized school calculator. However, this trainer is very much at the budget end of the budget spectrum. JTX offers a two-year at-home warranty, which should give some peace of mind for those worried it may not go the distance.Weighing 51kg, the Strider-X8 isn’t something you will want to pick up and heft around, but it’s easy to tip it on to its transport wheels and stash it somewhere convenient. Without going for a foldable, there are few cross trainers that can compete with it in terms of space-saving – and I managed to cram it into the corner of my busy garage with little stress.The workout experience is largely fine, although the smaller footplates will be a problem for users with larger feet. It connects seamlessly with third-party apps and can even be used with virtual training software, such as Zwift.The digital console is basic, but it all works, with a simple dial adjusting the levels of resistance. There are even 18 built-in programs for those who simply want to hop on and work out.It’s a shame that… parts of the machine feel cheap, and the built-in heart-rate monitoring is useless.Dimensions:70 x 130 x 169cm (WLH)Weight:51kgDrivetrain:7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel and electromagnetic resistanceStride length:41cmConnectivity:Bluetooth to fitness apps (such as Kinomap, iConsole+), built-in Polar heart-rate receiver (chest strap), hand pulse sensorsFolding?No; includes transport wheelsNoise level:about 38dBMaximumuser weight:120kgBuilt-in entertainment:no; LCD console with 18 workoutsJTXStrider-X8from£399£399 at JTX Fitness£499 at AmazonWhat we loveSuper compact and affordableWhat we don’t loveSmall footplates won’t suit larger feetBest full-body trainer:Schwinn 590 EllipticalSchwinn590 Ellipticalfrom£1,499£1,499 at Fitness Superstore£1,499 at AmazonWhat we loveOne of the best full-body workouts on testWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive, and speakers are mediocrePhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£1,499 at Fitness Superstore£1,499 at AmazonSchwinn packs a lot into its relatively compact 590 Elliptical, including the ability to electronically adjust the platforms to simulate gradients of -5% to 15%. Along with the multitude of upper-body handles, this sees it bundled into the cross-trainer category (despite its name). I found it offered one of the best full-body workouts on test.There are built-in speakers that are of mediocre quality (they’re better than those found on the Horizon EX-59 but still not brilliant) and a 7in digital display that allows for rapid leaps in resistance.Why we love itThere are handle-mounted controls for both the incline/decline and resistance settings, which is a welcome premium touch, and the unit is compatible with a multitude of virtual training software, includingZwiftand Schwinn’s recommendedJrny app.The 25 levels of resistance, the ability to adjust the incline and decline, and the multiple grip locations ensure the Schwinn provides one of the best and all-encompassing full-body workouts on test. With a pronated grip on the horizontal handles, I found it possible to work the big muscles of the back and the lats, while a supinated grip on the inner-most handles would place more emphasis on the shoulders and rear deltoid muscles.It’s a similar case for the lower body, as adjusting the decline and incline places a focus on muscles in the legs that I rarely use. Start playing around with body positioning, and it offers all of the benefits of a static hold with dynamic movement.Of course, you can adjust the intensity as you want, but I found the unit to be one of the best for working up a sweat. It all comes in one of the most compact and easy-to-store packages on this list, too.It’s a shame that… the built-in speakers aren’t really worth the effort, and it’s an expensive machine.Dimensions:86 x 148 x 173cm (WLH)Weight:96kgDrivetrain:front-drive with magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (25 levels)Stride length:51cmConnectivity:Bluetooth (heart-rate enabled and built-in speakers), USB charging port, tablet/media holder, Jrny and app compatibilityFolding?No; includes transport wheelsNoise level:about 32dBMaximum user weight:147kgBuilt-in entertainment:no; a 7in full-colour LCD with workout programs and connectivitySchwinn590 Ellipticalfrom£1,499£1,499 at Fitness Superstore£1,499 at AmazonWhat we loveOne of the best full-body workouts on testWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive, and speakers are mediocreThe best of the restSole E35 elliptical cross trainerSoleE35 elliptical cross trainer£1,799£1,799 at Fitness SuperstoreWhat we loveGreat for taller usersWhat we don’t loveTakes up a lot of spacePhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£1,799 at Fitness SuperstoreBest for:taller usersWith a generous 50.8cm stride length and oversized footplates, the Sole E35 is designed for taller and larger users, offering multiple handles and grip positions for a full-body workout.To me, it’s also one of the better-looking elliptical machines on this list, with modern styling and a sleek 10.1in touchscreen to use for a number of built-in workout sessions and longer-term fitness plans, as well as popular streaming apps, such as YouTube, Disney+ and more.There’s a built-in fan for keeping users cool, although it’s not hugely effective, as well as a set of speakers for streaming music. These are perfectly adequate, but don’t expect room-filling sounds.The 9kg flywheel provides plenty of resistance though, and with the FTMS protocol, it syncs up with Zwift and the brand’s ownSole+ app, offering a huge array of virtual workouts.It didn’t make the final cut because… it’s a large and heavy machine that requires plenty of storage space.Dimensions:60 x 177 x 177cm (WLH);weight:110.8kg;drivetrain:front-drive with computer-controlled magnetic ECB resistance (20 levels);stride length:50.8cm;connectivity:Bluetooth audio speakers, USB charging port, wifi, Sole+ and Kinomap app compatibility, tablet holder, wireless charging pad;folding?No; includes front transport wheels;noise level:about 35db;maximum user weight:158kg;built-in entertainment:10.1in touchscreen with built-in apps (YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ and so on), wifi and screen mirroringSoleE35 elliptical cross trainer£1,799£1,799 at Fitness SuperstoreWhat we loveGreat for taller usersWhat we don’t loveTakes up a lot of spaceMatrix Fitness E30Matrix FitnessE30from£2,249£2,879 at Fitness Superstore£2,249 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent qualityWhat we don’t loveThe quality comes at a high pricePhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£2,879 at Fitness Superstore£2,249 at AmazonBest for:gym quality at homeIt’s a little tricky to get your head around how the Matrix E30 works. On paper, it’s one of the more compact elliptical trainers I tested, yet it still manages to offer a 51cm stride length. This is all down to the clever, and quite complex, suspension system that houses the oversized footplates and traditional elliptical handles.Matrix kit is often found in commercial gyms and that’s pretty obvious here, as the build quality is excellent. It also sports a 10.5kg flywheel, which is one of the heaviest on test. It allows for 20 levels of resistance and is capable of a pretty hardcore workout.An updated XER console has a crisp 10in touchscreen that takes care of most of the functionality, as well as allowing access to a handful of streaming apps and virtual training programs.If you don’t want to pay for yet another monthly membership (Matrix suggestsiFIT), it can also play nicely with whatever third-party apps you like to use and features 11 built-in workout programs.It didn’t make the final cut because… it’s expensive, and the screen isn’t overly impressive.Dimensions:73x 166 x 148cm (WLH);weight:126kg;drivetrain:suspension elliptical front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels);stride length:51cm;connectivity:wifi, Bluetooth, USB port and entertainment apps (YouTube, Netflix and so on);folding?No;noise level:about 38dB;maximum user weight:147kg;built-in entertainment:10in touchscreen with apps, media streaming, web browser (XER console)Matrix FitnessE30from£2,249£2,879 at Fitness Superstore£2,249 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent qualityWhat we don’t loveThe quality comes at a high priceLife Fitness E1Life FitnessE1from£2,145£2,145 at Fitness Superstore£2,345 at Best Gym EquipmentWhat we loveFuss-free and simple to useWhat we don’t loveFeels basic compared with competitors£2,145 at Fitness Superstore£2,345 at Best Gym EquipmentBest for:build quality on a budgetLife Fitness is another brand often selected by commercial gyms for its reliability, and this also filters down into its domestic range.Considering how basic the E1 feels compared with some rivals, the price seems high, but this is a fuss-free elliptical with a massive fixed stride length, oversized footplates and an impressive spread of smooth and natural-feeling resistance. It’s also quiet.The basic digital Go Console lacks the flashiness of a massive interactive touchscreen, but it has 13 workout programs that are easily accessed via large and obvious buttons, great for those not fussed about binging Netflix during a workout. During testing, I found the lack of a touchscreen quite refreshing: it was easy to hop on and work out without the faff of connecting Bluetooth-enabled devices.Heart-rate monitoring is fairly reliable via its handles and sports the FTMS protocol for third-party app integration, but it also works perfectly well without it, and its built-in programs span hill training and fat-burning sessions.It didn’t make the final cut because… it feels expensive for what it is and looks dated.Dimensions:77 x 209 x 150cm (WLH);weight:96kg;drivetrain:front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels);stride length:51cm;connectivity:Go Console with LCD, Bluetooth telemetry heart-rate monitoring, 13 pre-loaded workouts;folding?No;noise level:about 32dB;maximum user weight:182kg;built-in entertainment:no built-in media apps; simple display for workout metrics and an integrated accessory tray for external device placementLife FitnessE1from£2,145£2,145 at Fitness Superstore£2,345 at Best Gym EquipmentWhat we loveFuss-free and simple to useWhat we don’t loveFeels basic compared with competitorsWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenGetting the right stride length for your height is key.Photograph: richiesd/Getty ImagesWhat is the difference between an elliptical and a cross trainer?The two terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences. A standard elliptical machine focuses on the forward and backward pedalling motion with fixed handles, providing a low-impact cardio workout that mimics running without the joint stress. A cross trainer typically includes moving handlebars that allow you to work your upper body as well, giving a more complete, full-body workout. In most modern home fitness equipment, “elliptical” and “cross trainer” usually describe the same type of machine.How much should I spend?Entry-level elliptical trainers start at about £400 and offer basic stride motion and limited resistance levels. Spending more than £1,000 typically gets you a sturdier build, smoother motion, more resistance levels and better consoles with Bluetooth or app integration. At the top end (£2,000+), you’ll find commercial-grade machines with advanced consoles, streaming services, more compact footprints, greater levels of resistance and suspension technology that greatly reduces noise and wear.How much room do I need at home?Ellipticals tend to be large machines, with footprints ranging from about 150cm in length and 70cm in width, all the way up to 200cm in length and 80cm in width, or more. You’ll also need to consider ceiling height – especially with front-drive machines, as pedals can lift you an additional 30-40cm off the ground.What features should I look out for?Stride length is a key factor: shorter strides (about 40-45cm) are suitable for smaller users, while taller users will benefit from 50cm or more. Look for adjustable resistance levels and incline options if you want to vary the intensity and muscle groups worked. Consoles with Bluetooth and app support can help track progress and keep workouts engaging, and some higher-end models include large touchscreens with streaming apps, fans, speakers and wireless charging pads. If space is a concern, compact or folding designs are worth exploring.Are there any maintenance concerns?Ellipticals are generally low-maintenance compared with treadmills. Most use magnetic resistance systems that don’t require ongoing adjustment as a treadmill’s belt does. Look out for manufacturer warranties that cover any wear and tear. Suspension ellipticals – which remove the traditional track and wheel system – tend to be even quieter and need virtually no lubrication.For more ways to get fit at home:The best treadmills, tested by our expert runnerPersonal trainers on the best home exercise kitLeon Poultneyis a lifelong fitness enthusiastwho can often be found trying not to kill himself on a mountain bike/surfboard/other extreme thing, often at the request of an editor.

The Electric Ballroom is heaving, despite this being their second show here in a month. There’s no shortage of twentysomethings with shag hairstyles to explain why the duo live up to their slogan. “They’re fun, which we need right now – life is bleak,” says Dulcie. “And they’re socially aware,” adds her friend Lotte. “Even though theyare quite silly, they’re grounded.”Across the bar, Dylan, 22, says that he finds Getdown Services and their genre-agnostic beats empowering: “They’re a laptop garage band that are having fun doing what they love, and seeing that makes me want to do what I love as well.” His pal James, 29, has returned for a repeat performance. “I came to the other Getdown Services show and I felt more jubilant than I did at Oasis,” he says.Move over Gallaghers: Ben Sadler and Josh Law come on stage to Status Quo’s Whatever You Want and immediately begin the high-octane crowd interaction. Everyone on the balcony who got guestlist for tonight is pointed to en masse and told to “fuck off”; the pair stomp wide-legged like sumo wrestlers, egging on the roars and occasionally shredding a guitar. It’s part chaotic aerobics video, part Butlin’s gameshow – and though it’s blokey, it’s also a satire of blokey-ness. “This is what my fat body looks like!” yells Sadler, pulling off his T-shirt to delighted cheers. “This is not LadBible!” Law shouts.Back in Bristol where they’re based, Getdown Services are home-town heroes. No sooner have they stepped into a pub, they’re asked for a photo. They’ve had a mammoth 2025: 130 gigs, two sold-out UK tours, festival stage shut-downs, well over half a million monthly listeners on Spotify and, amazingly for a band with song titles like Vomit, Piss and Shit,a red carpet shout-outfrom Hollywood A-lister Walton Goggins. “He’s doing PR for us!” quips Sadler, though it’s clear they’re still getting to grips with the attention. “I guess we are bigger than we thought we were,” says Law.The band’s origin was an “accident”. As childhood friends who met at school in Minehead, Law and Sadler, both now 31, had messed about in various musical projects over the years. But when they started swapping ideas in lockdown while living in different towns, their unselfconscious approach to sound and subject matter clicked: pop culture word association, louche electro-house grooves, and lyrics about snacks and skidmarks. “It feels genuinely liberating to talk about that stuff,” says Law of their more scatological lyrics.First came debut album Crisps in 2023 – its ace title track is a loafing anti-rockstar anthem that begins “I’ve got choccy in my pocket” – then a succession of EPs, including last year’s Primordial Slot Machine and Crumbs 2. “Low hanging fruit” such as the pop troubadour James Bay and Jamie Oliver’s 15 Minute Meals get a ribbing – “being annoying is worse than being evil,” says Law – but these observations are usually a front for social commentary, expressing small-town frustrations and embracing anti-toxic masculinity in all its belly-jiggling messiness: “Wake up, first thought, hope I don’t piss myself today” goes Drifting Away.View image in fullscreenNo joke … Law, left, and Sadler.Photograph: Siôn Marshall-WatersTheir music shares the same stream-of-consciousness DNA as many of the post-punk shouters who’ve come through in recent years – Fat Dog, Yard Act, Big Special – but their songs are more of a supermarket sweep through a 00s indie disco, especially the chonky electro of Daft Punk and Justice. “I really love that compressed sound; they’re distilling an idea down to something really pure,” says Sadler. “I think that’s in our music a lot. We get compared to the Streets and Sleaford Mods, and I do like that stuff, but the stuff we’re really ripping off seems to go under the radar.”A lot of people see two white blokes with their tops off, shouting and swearing, and think we align with [macho behaviour] and it’s nice to remind people we’re not on that sideIf there’s a shared vision, it’s that “there’s a real desire to crack each other up”, says Law. Their influences include the TV shows Bottom, Alan Partridge and Phoenix Nights; indeed, it’s easy to imagine Peter Kay delivering lines like those on Caesar: “I don’t care if you’re working class / You’re a fucking twat / You don’t care about music / You just like trousers”. But Getdown Services stress they’re not a musical double act like Tenacious D; they’re a band that happens to be funny. “As soon as someone says ‘it’s comedy’, the joke’s gone,” says Sadler.And besides, there’s lots to be serious about. In August, they slammed Victorious festival for censoring another band’s pro-Palestine protest (Getdown donated their fee for playing the same festival to charity) and they call out transphobia on social media. “A lot of people see two white blokes with their tops off, shouting and swearing, and probably think we align with that [macho behaviour],” says Sadler, “and it’s nice to remind people that we’re not on that side.”As for 2026, there’s a second album in the works and while big labels have been knocking on their door, they’re happy on the independent Bristol labelBreakfast Records. And what about that tagline? It started as a joke, they say, but now they’re owning it. In the beginning, “we were barely even a band,” says Law, “and now I think maybe weareBritain’s best band.”Explore more on these topicsMusic2026 culture previewIndiePop and rockBristolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why does the British right want you to believe he is?Naomi KleinI have no interest in defending his social media posts, but calls to strip the newly freed activist of British citizenship pile torment on top of tortureWed 31 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 03.24 ESTShareWhat is the proper punishment for hateful social media posts? Should you lose your account? Your job? Your citizenship? Go to jail? Die? For the people who have launched a campaign against the British-Egyptian writer and activistAlaa Abd el-Fattah, no punishment is too great.I have no interest in defending the awful tweets in question, which Abd el-Fattah posted in the early 2010s. Many are indefensible and he has apologised “unequivocally” for them. He has alsowritten movinglyabout how his perspective has changed in the intervening years. Years that have included more than a decade in jail, most of it in Egypt’s notorious Tora prisonwhere he faced torture; missing his son’s entire childhood – and very nearly dying during a months-long hunger strike.None of this suffering seems to be enough for Abd el-Fattah’s accusers. They want this man and this family to suffer yet more punishment. They are calling for him to be stripped of his British citizenship, to which he is entitled because his mother was born in the UK, and for him to be deported back toEgypt, the country that already robbed him of 12 years of his freedom. It’s a fate that could be a death sentence.I do not believe that piling torment on top of torture is what decent British people consider justice, let alone proportionate punishment.Alaa Abd el-Fattah came to global attention because he wasa leading figurein the 2011 pro-democracy revolution that turned Cairo’s Tahrir Square into a surging sea of young people. The demonstrators chanted “Down with corruption”, “Down with autocracy” and “Down with dictators.” When the uprising succeeded in toppling Egypt’s dictator Hosni Mubarak, the world rejoiced, including Europe and North America. Abd el-Fattah was all over the media, a voice for the part of the movement that was committed to building an accountable, participatory democracy from the ground up.But the Tahrir Square victory was short lived. The militaryseized powerand violently turned on the young protesters. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed and tens of thousands were thrown in jail. Alaa Abd el-Fattah was among them, and it soon became clear that keeping him behind bars was a top priority for the generals who ultimately replaced Mubarak. #FreeAlaa became a global rallying cry and remained so for well over a decade – until this past September, when Alaa finally walked free.View image in fullscreenAustralian journalist Peter Greste, arrested and imprisoned in Egypt in 2013 while reporting for Al Jazeera, stands with Laila Soueif, mother of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, as he joined her on hunger strike outside Downing Street in London, Britain, 20 January 2025.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersA travel ban imposed by Egypt still prevented Abd el-Fattah from leaving the country and reuniting with his son in the UK. Then, on Boxing Day, he landed at Heathrow, soon to celebrate his son’s birthday for the first time in 12 years. But that joy wouldn’t last long either: the calls for his deportation were unleashed less than 24 hours after he landed.Abd el-Fattah’s tweets surfaced online on 27 December, and were quickly picked up by British far-right activistTommy Robinsonand Reform UK leaderNigel Farage. The next day, the Sunday Telegraph led the campaign with afront pagereading “Starmer welcomes ‘extremist’ to Britain”. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, had spoken to the Telegraph for this story, saying: “This awful extremist should never have set foot in the UK again.” By Monday, the Tories were reported as calling for thedeportation of “scumbag” Abd el-Fattahand revocation of his citizenship, with Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch saying that citizenship decisions “must take account of social media activity, public statements, and patterns of belief”. (Which sounds very much like Donald Trump’s United States.)Reform UK had also set up a websitewith a petitioncalling for Abd el-Fattah’s removal from the UK.Many people tuning into the manufactured storm know little of Abd el-Fattah, and less about his role in a historic revolution for democracy and human rights. They see only the ugly screengrabs, designed to paint a picture of a religious sectarian who must hate Jews and white people, and who celebrates terrorism that targets civilians. Many of the attacks on Abd el-Fattah invoke the hideous antisemitic crimes atBondi beachon the first night of Hanukkah and at asynagogue in Manchesteron Yom Kippur, implying, outrageously, that this pro-democracy, anti-sectarian, human rights activist is somehow a similar danger. And it works: many dofeel vulnerable and frightened, because these are frightening times. That fear is what this campaign is all about: trying to make people afraid of Abd el-Fattah, and by extension, Muslims and migrants. Like so much in this political moment, in the UK and elsewhere, they are tightening the circle around what is considered a “real” citizen.The people who curated the posts to achieve maximum fear and shock don’t want us to know about other tweets Abd el-Fattah posted in this same period. Such as the times he confronted people who blamed Jews for the actions of the Israeli state,writing: “We stand against zionism never against a religion, and there are many brave anti zionist jews.” Or when helifted upthe voices of young Jewish descendants of the Arab and Islamic world living in Israel who, he wrote, were “demanding a just solution to the Palestinian cause that includes them”.They also skipped over the many times that Abd el-Fattah spoke out against terrorism that targets civilians, including attacks committed in the name of Islam. In one post hewrote: “To me the context never justifies killing civilians”; inanother, “I’m saying killing civilians is never justified”; and onemore: “It doesn’t matter at all who started it; there’s no reason in the world that justifies raising an automatic weapon against civilians in front of their homes.” He alsowrote, in 2013: “Islamic terrorism is really ramping up its efforts these days, and … all the victims are unarmed civilians.”Do these posts cancel out the ones that say the exact opposite? No. But they do make it harder to turn Abd el-Fattah into the unrecognisable menacing “anti-white Islamist” figure currently flooding the internet. Further complicating that caricature are the staunchly anti-sectarian, egalitarian actions he took as a human rights advocate, in the real, non-online world.For instance, in October 2011, the Egyptian military violently attacked a peaceful protest of the Coptic Christian minority, killing 28 people and injuring hundreds more. To cover up those crimes, state media tried to foment a religious war, and “turned neighbours against each other, Muslims against Christians and transformed the hospital into a sectarian site under siege,” as the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policyreported.Abd el-Fattah, who is Muslim, stood with his Christian comrades, spending the night rushing from morgue to hospital, desperately trying to make sure that evidence of the military’s crimes was not buried with the bodies of the fallen. He comforted families, and argued with clerics. “I smell of morgues, dead bodies and coffins, I smell of dust, sweat and tears,” hewrotethe next day. “I don’t know if I can wash it all away.” For these acts of solidarity, he was thrown in jail, not for the first time, or the last.When hasty electionsbriefly broughtthe Muslim Brotherhood to power, and a new wave of repression began, Alaa Abd el-Fattah again raised his voice against the thwarting of the revolution’s dream of real democracy. Again, he was arrested. But the real nightmare began when the military, led by Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood in a military coup in 2013.The top priority of the al-Sisi regime, still in power to this day, has been to crush the liberatory dream of the Arab spring. This meant keeping Abd el-Fattah behind bars almost continuously, mostly under maximum security. Even when the worlddescended on Sharm el-Sheikh in 2022for a UN climate summit, and#FreeAlaa becamethe conference’s rallying cry, even when film stars and Nobel laureatescalled for his release, the regime would not relent.The rationales changed, the charges shifted. In 2013, he was imprisoned for allegedly organising a peaceful demonstration (earning him a five-year sentence), then for sharing a Facebook post about the torture of another prisoner (another six years for “fake news”). Everyone knew that Abd el-Fattah’s real crime was always the same: being the most prominent reminder of the dream of a non-sectarian, decolonial, democratic Egypt. As he once tweeted: “I’m the ghost of spring past.”Keir Starmer appears surprised by the attack, and embarrassed that he and his staff failed to go through every single one of Abd el-Fattah’s social media posts before advocating for his release from unjust imprisonment and welcoming him to the UK. The prime minister said the government was “taking steps to review the information failures in this case”.That will prove to be a very big task. Back in the day, Alaa Abd el-Fattah was what is known as extremely online. He posted 280,000 times on Twitter alone. When his colleagues set out to compile theanthology of his writing, they calculated that his social media posts could have filled one hundred books, each of them 300 pages long.Or maybe the government could skip the retroactive surveillance and judge Alaa Abd el-Fattah neither by his best tweets nor his worst ones. Rather, he can be judged by the dignity and steadfastness with which he has fought for freedom – both the Egyptian people’s and his own. Maybe they could even trust that they did the right thing in the first place.Alaa is not a saint. He is, however, a hero of a stolen revolution, and a potent symbol of hope for millions still living under brutal dictatorship. His freedom is a hard-won victory for justice, at a time when those are few and far between. He deserves to enjoy it in peace.Naomi Klein is a Guardian US columnist and contributing writer.

As is my duty, I have to add to the pile. But does it all have to be quite so sad? Do we have to dutifully trawl through the muck to find some elusive meaning to what we’ve been forced to endure? Unfortunately, yes. It was a tough year (again) and we met it all with a shrug. As we’ve all been made punishingly aware,Dictionary.com’s word of 2025 is “6-7,”a viral meme slogan which is technically two words. Pretty cheeky of the Dictionary to cheat on their own assignment.How tragically emblematic of the year we just witnessed. We’re all too apathetic to even complain about getting swindled by a gaggle of word snobs. “Apathy” would have been a better choice for word of the year, considering how we’ve collectively shrugged at every dispiriting development of the last 12 months. Nicki Minaj popped up at the Turning Point USA conference to kiki with Erika Kirk and the most I could muster was “I guess she’ll do a concert at the Trump-Kennedy Center soon.”The year started with the back-to-back monstrosities of the Los Angeles wildfires and the second presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. I’d say it was all downhill from there, but we’ve already rolled down, hit every tree on the way, and ended up getting mauled by a pack of hungry grizzly bears.The year in patriarchy: Taylor Swift, Trump 2.0 and the Epstein files | Arwa MahdawiRead moreProtests against ICE grew, and there was another massive No Kings event in October, but most of the year was met with groaning resignation. We act as though we just have to wait out the clock on this accursed era, like the world’s worst NBA team hopelessly tossing up three-pointers while down by 50.Eventually, getting dunked on by LeBron James becomes tiresome. But what if, at the bottom of the restaurant dumpster that is life on Earth, there’s an unopened tin of caviar? Plus, a box of blinis, some creme fraiche, a bottle of ice cold champagne and also a lovely silver spoon. And a copy of Architectural Digest.The most luxurious indulgence imaginable is being able to fixate on people and events that actually don’t matter. Back in the old days, a series of stupid things would happen during the year and we’d all have a laugh about it. Remember the Macarena? That wasgreat. 2025 didn’t launch a dance craze on par with yuppies swiveling their hips like a broken car radio antenna in a windstorm, but we were blessed with just enough inanity to get us through a cursed year.Let’s start with Labubus. Doesn’t that sound nice? Little furry gremlin dolls that people who are bad with money decided to hoard like toilet paper during a mass quarantine. These dolls were everywhere, dangling from women’s purses and grinning up at us as though they pilfered the entire contents of the cash register at a Cinnabon. Labubus seemed to be the only ones smiling through 2025. Maybe they know 2026 is going to be worse.Sydney Sweeney sparked a good old-fashioned internet outrage cycle over anad for American Eagle jeansthat was only offensive if you were hoping to be offended. A pun about “genes” and “jeans” only seems like a nod to eugenics if you specifically cast an attractive blonde lady for the ad. If I had been the spokesperson, people would have had a hearty laugh over it. “Good genes? He can barely fit into his pants!” Honestly, I chuckled at the ad anyway. Mostly because someone actually thought it was a good idea.Speaking of internet outrage, Andy Byron, a tech CEO, and his head of human resources, Kristin Cabot, were caught on the kiss cam at a Coldplay concert. Cabot has subsequentlygone on a press tourto convince maniacs to stop threatening her life. She claims her and Byron had not been engaged in an affair prior to the explosion of #coldplaygate. I, for one, believe her. I’m constantly finding myself being held tenderly by my colleagues while Chris Martin warbles “Adventure of a Lifetime.”Everyone was eating Dubai chocolate, an expensive candy bar filled with pistachio cream so brightly green that it looks like it was injected with actual money. I didn’t buy one because I’m still saving my money for a Labubu.You know who can afford all the expensive chocolate and nightmare dolls they want? The thieves who robbed the Louvre of$102m worth of jewels. It took them less than seven minutes to swipe the treasures, which is the fastest anyone has made that amount of money outside of acrypto casino.But the most “important” story of 2025 was the engagement ofTaylor Swiftand football hunk Travis Kelce, an event stage managed to both drive listeners to Kelce’s podcast and hard launch Swift’s latest album cycle. The obviousness of the scheme was hard to ignore, though I don’t begrudge them the opportunity to leverage their romance for personal gain. I think we all would, if given the chance. I’d let American Eagle sponsor my wedding if they asked. “Dave Schilling does not have good genes, but he does have a delightful buffet for his guests to enjoy.”May we all be blessed with the honor of being walking sponsored content in 2026.

These medications, taken weekly as an injection into the abdomen, result in significant weight loss and, despite being developed to manage type 2 diabetes in those with metabolic disorders, have become mainstream in many countries as a treatment for obesity.Clinicians rave about the health outcomesin patients taking the medication, with study after study emerging on the health benefits of the associated weight loss in those who are obese. Celebrity endorsements, online sales and off-label use have seen them widely used by people of all ages and sizes who want to drop weight.For the public health community, it’s an odd moment. For years, we’ve advocated forgovernment action on obesity– not through new drugs, but by taking nutrition and food systems seriously. We’ve highlighted the need for government action on making nutritious food affordable, regulatingultra-processed foods,bringing in sugar taxes and banning advertising of unhealthy products to young people, alongside encouraging an increase in physical activity. The solutions are simple: get people to eat more nutritious food and move. The challenge has been implementation, especially in deprived areas.So when GLP-1 drugs such as semaglutide started to be used as a widespread weight-loss solution, resulting in massive profits for pharmaceutical companies, the first reaction in public health circles was something between horror and exasperation. Not because the drugs didn’t work, but because they symbolised a kind of surrender. After decades of fighting to change the food and physical activity culture, here came a pharmaceutical company offering a weekly jab as the answer to a problem created by the transnational food industry.The irony isn’t lost on me. One set of companies profits by making populations obese; another now profits by promising to reverse it, at least for as long as people can keep paying and injecting. We still don’t know thelong-term side effectsof these drugs, especially in those within a healthy weight range and with normal metabolic function.But in the past year, more and more countries have been moving towards rolling out GLP-1 drugs as the main treatment for obesity. In fact, theWorld Health Organization(WHO) recently recommended GLP-1 drugs as treatment for obesity in all countries. For decades, the WHO had resisted pharmaceutical solutions for obesity, insisting the crisis was environmental, structural and political. The agency is now saying something different: people are dying of obesity-related diseases across the world, and we have a tool that works.For some, this is capitulation. Has 2025 been the year that global health finally gave up on fixing the social and commercial causes of obesity and talking about nutrition? Obesity rates are tightly linked tosocioeconomic status.In fact, it’s been said that child obesity is a reflection of child poverty. GLP-1s were created to medically treat those with a metabolic disorder. Are we saying that the poorest 20% of people (who have higher obesity rates) have a metabolic disorder that the richest 20% don’t have? Surely not.We know diet is linked to income, time, education and resources. If obesity is “treatable” with a jab, why take on the food industry? Why invest in affordable fruit and vegetables or healthy school lunches? GLP-1s have become a way for many politicians to appear to be doing something while avoiding dealing with thesystematic food production and consumption issuesthat are making us sick.But I can understand the WHO’s pivot, because obesity is not a theoretical problem that we have time to solve. It’s killing people and disabling them in daily life. Just ask any clinician about the impact of these drugs on people with heart disease, diabetes, fatty liver disease, joint failure … the list goes on. It’s all well and good talking about redesigning food systems, but right now, we have a drug that reliably reduces weight, improves metabolic markers and reduces cardiovascular risk. In that context, you can understand doctors seeing the health benefits in their patients and the WHO advocating for these drugs to be made affordable and accessible all across the world, including in low-income countries.We still need to be careful about the reality of these drugs for individuals. They require a weekly injection, potentially creating lifelong dependency, given that studies have shown thatweight rebounds when they’re stopped. They have side effects and can cause serious complications, especially for people who aren’t prescribed them by a doctor. They also don’t negate the need to eat a nutritious diet. Just like you can be overweight and malnourished, you can also be thin and malnourished.Plus, losing weight alone doesn’t bring the health benefits of physical activity. Exercise strengthens the heart, builds muscle, protects the brain from depression, anxiety and dementia, and helps reduce chronic pain. Perhaps 2026 will bring an exercise pill, but so far, we don’t have any drug that can mimic its benefits. For all the promise of GLP-1s, the body still needs what it has always needed: affordable and accessible nutritious food and daily movement. Perhaps it’s a pipe dream, but I hope the coming year will bring societal changes to make that possible for all of us, without needing a weekly jab.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghFit Forever: Wellness for midlife and beyondOn Wednesday 28 January 2026, join Annie Kelly, Devi Sridhar, Joel Snape and Mariella Frostrup, as they discuss how to enjoy longer and healthier lives, with expert advice and practical tips.

To stop them, we must break the culture of silenceMukund KrishnaThe rape and murder of Sarah Everard by an off-duty officer should have led to cultural change. Without it, neither communities nor officers are safeMukund Krishna is chief executive of the Police Federation of England & WalesWed 31 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 14.38 ESTShareLast year, part one of Elish Angiolini’sgovernment-commissioned inquiryinto the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by Wayne Couzens, an off-duty police officer, considered how that outrage happened. The recently releasedpart twoof the Angiolini inquiry is just as devastating: a reminder of what happens when policing fails to face the harm in its own ranks. It confirms what the public already suspects, and many officers know: the predatory behaviour of Couzens and others like him doesn’t just slip through the cracks – it survives in the gaps created by weak supervision, flawed vetting and a culture in which silence feels safer than speaking up.Policing’s greatest challenge is not crime, but a corrosive mindset shaped by relentless demand, inadequate leadership and structural weaknesses across a broken system. Unless we confront that truth with honesty and humility, we will fail both the public and those who serve them.When I came to the UK from India 20 years ago, I was struck by the quiet authority of British policing – professional, restrained and rooted in consent. That early impression shaped my belief in what policing can and should be. Since then, I have seen policing at its best, but also the strain behind the uniform, and a culture that punishes reflection instead of learning from it. The findings of the Angiolini inquiry show what that culture costs.The problems revealed are not isolated scandals; they are symptoms of deeper failures in supervision, accountability and courage. In her report into police culture and standards of behaviour,Louise Casey warnedof a service at risk of losing its moral compass. BBC Panorama, with its undercoverinvestigation into officer wrongdoingat Charing Cross police station in central London, and other similar inquiries, have exposed behaviour that has no place in any public institution, least of all one with coercive powers.Yet the fractures in trust do not just affect the relationship between the police and the public; they are starkly evident within policing too. Over a fifth of officers have been involved in a misconduct case in which the perpetrator was another officer, and witnesses outnumber victims three to one. Nearly half of our officers do not trust their forces to handle internal misconduct properly.Women are almost three times more likely than men to be victims in these cases, and ethnic minority officers report higher dissatisfaction and greater fear of reporting. Among officers with fewer than five years’ service, 44% say fear stops them from reporting the misconduct they see. Silence becomes a survival strategy – the very dynamic that allowed the offenders described in the Angiolini inquiry to thrive.Let’s be clear: a service that cannot protect its own people cannot expect to earn the trust of the public. Some will argue the federation’s job is simply to defend officers. But protection without accountability is not protection at all. The public can’t feel safe, and neither can officers.That is why early in the new year, for the first time, we are launching the victim and witness support programme, offering confidential advice and welfare support for officers who are victims or witnesses of misconduct. It includes strict ethical walls, confidentiality protections and an option to seek support from a central, impartial team – foundations of a system people can trust.But support mechanisms alone, however welcome, will not change culture. For that to happen, leaders at every level must decide that silence is no longer acceptable. For too long, policing has met scrutiny with defensiveness and treated challenge as disloyalty. Renewal demands that we reward honesty and protect those who speak it.We must also face the pressures shaping policing today. A third of our members say low pay has pushed them or their families into debt this year; some have used food banks. Exhaustion and financial strain weaken judgment, morale and the ability to uphold the standards the public rightly expect.There is a phrase I often use: we cannot fix what we will not face. A harsh mirror has been held up to policing and whether we like what we see is beside the point; what matters now is whether we have the courage to act on it.I still believe in the founding idea of British policing: service by consent. But consent relies on trust, inside policing as well as outside it. Rebuilding that trust demands humility, not slogans, and for the police, it must begin with confronting the harm in our own house.Mukund Krishna is chief executive of thePolice Federationof England & WalesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The London market has sometimes been derided as lacking dynamism – the hedge fund manager Paul Marshallcalled it the “Jurassic Park” of exchangesa few years ago – but its main index enjoyed its best 12 months since 2009. The Footsie didn’t quite make it to the round number of 10,000 but still improved by 21.5%, slightly outperforming the S&P 500 index in the US.How did that happen amid weakening UK growth,pre-budget chaosand general gloom? The short answer is that a stock market index reflects only its constituent parts. It is not a symbol of national economic virility. That is especially true of the internationally flavoured Footsie, whose members make about three-quarters of their combined revenues overseas.The grass is not always greener on US stock marketsRead moreThe tale of 2025 was one of helpful breezes blowing through many of the most important sectors. Defence stocks enjoyedcommitments by Nato’s western European membersto spend more heavily on equipment. That assisted companies such as Rolls-Royce, whose remarkable run has taken the shares from sub-100p in 2022 to £11-plus today. Banks have had near-perfect conditions of low defaults and falling interest rates. The bill (for some) fromthe car finance scandalwas brushed off easily.Global mining companies, which are still a significant slice of the Footsie, enjoyed the gold-inspired rally in everything related to precious metals plus the demand for copper that comes with energy transition and electrification. The best-performing share in the index was Fresnillo, a Mexico-based silver miner, up almost fivefold. Over in pharmaceuticals, Donald Trump’s bark on tariffs and prices proved worse than his bite. AstraZeneca, the most valuable component of a value-weighted index, rose almost 30%.Meanwhile, National Grid and SSE, two heavyweights in UK energy infrastructure, benefited from regulatory funding forthe upgrade of the transmission network. Virtually the only “problem” stock at the top end of the index was Diageo, the Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff drinks maker, which was mired in the related issues ofa weak global spirits market and boardroom upheaval.FTSE 100 graphicSue Noffke, the head of UK equities at the fund manager Schroders, makes the point that the Footsie’s rise should not be viewed purely as a one-year phenomenon. Go back three years and the average investment return including dividends has been 14% a year for a cumulative return of 48%.A cheap starting point is obviously one factor. Even as late as spring 2024, the Footsie was priced at just under 10 times its predicted earnings for the next year, extremely low by historical standards.Noffke also highlights corporate self-improvement – “companies doing it for themselves” – and the role of share buybacks. There is a long list of companies that can be seen as getting stricter in their capital allocation in pursuit of better returns, and being prodded by shareholders to do so.Unileverdemerged its ice-cream division as Magnum in 2025, echoing GSK’sseparation of its consumer products division as Haleon in 2022. The industrial heavyweight Smiths Group is breaking itself up. BP, after years of flip-flopping,is “pivoting” away from its low-return renewables investments. Anglo American has engaged in a multiyear restructuring that ended in a well-received$50bn (£37bn) merger with the Canadian rival Teck Resources. AB Foods is contemplatingsplitting the discount retail chain Primarkfrom its food and ingredients businesses.The buyback angle represents a shift in thinking in London. In the old days, dividends were a priority, which was why a core part of Marshall’s dinosaur thesis was that London’s fund managers are obsessed with income rather than growth. Now buybacks, which offer more bang for the same buck when – critically – the shares are cheap, are a greater part of the mix. In any case, the idea that UK investors set the tone is probably out of date: US funds own more of the Footsie than the locals these days.Noffke calculates that 55% of larger UK companies have bought back at least 1% of their shares in the past 12 months, compared with 40% in the US. Shell hasbought back more than 20% of its equitysince 2020, for example. “The UK stock market has moved on from being the dividend yield capital of the world,” she argues. “It’s still attractive on dividend income, but it’s not so standout. It has now moved to become the share buyback capital of the world.”Therein – maybe – lies a path for an image overhaul for the London stock market. The old complaints about the dearth of new arrivals and the lack of whizzy US-style tech and AI stocks are still heard. But investors ultimately care about valuations and returns.Noffke puts the appeal of the UK market like this: “We have a different sectoral mix that is not dependent, or wholly dependent, on an AI thematic. We are cheap. We are cash rich. We’re buying a lot of shares back, and are quite shareholder friendly. And we’re seeing a lot of companies that, through a combination of top-down from management and bottom-up from the investor base, are showing more grip and more ambition.”The Footsie still has to keep going in the same fashion. The concentration in its makeup at the top end could work against it if a few important sectors go into reverse; and the relative lack of tech stocks may eventually become a bigger problem. But 2025 continued a good run. The dinosaur isn’t extinct yet.Explore more on these topicsFTSENils Pratley on financeStock marketsEnergy industryMiningPharmaceuticals industryBankingArms tradecommentShareReuse this content"

The forces behind the rollback of abortion rights in Donald Trump’s US are attempting todo the same in the UK. In Afghanistan, the Taliban has doubled down on its attacks onwomenandgirls. Sexual violence is commonplace inHaitiand theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. In Mexico, even the president is not safe fromsexual assault. A perverse rewilding appears to be taking place.You’d be forgiven for thinking that around the world, women’s rights are being concreted over. But in researching our book, Planet Patriarchy, Beatrix Campbell and I found women’s resistance erupting like green shoots through the cracks. In El Salvador, women can receive sentences of30-50 yearsfor miscarriages construed to be abortions. Yet feminists have managed to free all 72 women who had been imprisoned for this, using innovative penal and legal strategies. In Russia, feminists have taken to wearing blue and yellow ribbons, the colours of the Ukrainian flag, to signal their anti-war solidarity.The story that has emerged from Iceland is more hopeful still, as it overturned our assumptions about the conditions in which feminism thrives. The country’s much-vaunted place at the top of theWorld Economic Forum’sleague for gender equalitywas achieved under mainly conservative governments in the past 50 years, while social democratic governments held power for only five years. The presence of women in unions has been partly responsible for these achievements –more than 90%of the workforce is unionised, approximatelyhalfof the members are women and there is a growing number of womenin leadership roles.The1975 Icelandic women’s strike, in which 90% of its women participated, shut the country down for a whole day, inspiring women around the world to follow suit, demonstrating the indispensability of women’s paid and unpaid labour. The following year, Iceland passed a law guaranteeing sex equality. This year, an estimated50,000 peopletook part inthe 50th anniversarycommemorations of the strike because Iceland, too, has felt the global waters of misogyny lapping at its shores.There is much to learn and implement from Iceland’s policies on parental leave and equal pay. Employers are required to prove that they operate anequal pay for work of equal valuepolicy. While much has been achieved, much remains to be done: the hourly rates of pay are close to equal, butincomes over a lifetime reveal wage inequality caused bythe penalty of motherhoodand the unequal division of labour, time and power. Therates of sexual violence against womenalso remain high.The most inspirational advance in women’s rights – a women’s revolution, in fact – has been taking place in the unlikeliest of places. Buffeted by war with authoritarian Islamist forces since 2012, the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (popularly known as Rojava) now occupiesnearly a thirdof Syria. So many of my preconceptions were punctured when I visited Rojava: war is the classic moment in which all rights get suspended or eroded. Who thinks about the importance of gender equality, or racial inclusiv­ity, or direct democracy during war? Hadn’t the Arab spring been a failure? But were it not for the Arab spring, there would not have been a power vacuum in the north-east, which allowed the Kurds to engineer a bloodless revolution against President Bashar al-Assad, who was preoccupied with crushing the rebellion in southern Syria. The blood would come later in 2014 when Islamic State attacked, partly as a land grab and partly to shore up its own experiment with a medieval form of patriarchy that was a black-mirror reflection of the freedoms of women in Rojava.Rojava is an experiment in direct grassroots democracy. Neighbourhood communes of up to 300 people elect a man and a woman under the co-presidentship rule to represent them at the town council, which in turn elects members to the city level, and so on until they are represented at the overarching quasi-national people’s council. The commune elects members of specialist committees such as health, education, services or con­flict resolution, with equal membership of men and women led by co-presidents. Parallel to this structure, I found a women-only structure with its own committees, and the power of veto against any policies impacting women’s rights.The women of Rojava have pinned their colours to secularism in recognition of the pernicious impact of religion on women’s freedoms. They have disbanded sharia councils (unlike the UK), banned child marriage, polygamy and dowry, criminalised “honour” killings, introduced civil marriages and given women equal rights to inheritance and custody of their children, whatever their marital status.That other world that we hanker for is here. But it is being bombed by Turkey – to which the UK sells arms – which is threatened by a truly democratic society on its doorstep. Rojava is also at risk from the centralising impulse of the new leader ofSyria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose sharia-based government will mark the death knell for equality. Rojava’s survival, even as an idea, depends on women around the world setting up women’s assemblies in whatever civic space is available to them, to build their democratic muscle and become a force for change. We need to do all we can to steady this flickering flame, which could light up the path to our future.Rahila Gupta is an anti-racist feminist activist and the co-author, with Beatrix Campbell, ofPlanet PatriarchyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The artisan master standing by his side calmly nodded and said something that I still think about. He told him: “You put too much pressure on it, you kept it unbalanced and you forgot that it, too, has a heart.”The year we are leaving behind has been plagued from the start by a series of social, economic, environmental, technological and institutional challenges, all happening with such speed and intensity that we are yet to fully comprehend their impact on our lives, let alone on future generations. As the overwhelming strain of domestic and geopolitical changes continues to build up, I cannot help but remember the man’s words. Too much pressure. Unstable, uncertain and replete with deep inequalities. This could well be the year we forgot that the Earth, too, has a heart. It definitely feels like the year when the world was broken.In 2024, to be fair, many of the current problems were already present and growing. But there was also a strong wave of positive expectations and public excitement as more than 1.6 billion peoplewent to the polls. It was a time of unparalleled concentrated democratic activity full of promises, incautious confidence, passionate speeches and fiery oratory. Many voters were keen to express their anger and discontent, and express it they did. The mammoth year of elections revealed the importance of not only the ballot box, but also of the surrounding democratic institutions and norms. Language matters. How we talk to each other matters. Democratic decline always starts with words. When political opponents are treated as “enemies”, or even worse “enemies of the people”, the whole system suffers.Compared with that, the past 12 months have been marked by an emotional and intellectual fatigue for many people across different borders. What we are used to calling “the liberal international order” no longer carries weight. Deeply fractured and unable to hide its cracks, it is coming apart. Thehousing crisis, the lack of affordable rents and equal opportunities, andsocial and economic injustices have all eroded trust. Meanwhile, climate breakdown, AI threats and risks to pluralism, the possibility of another pandemic, and increasing militarism and jingoism alongside shifting alliances have contributed to the sense that the system that emerged from the ruins of the second world war has come to an end. As we close the first quarter of the century under the shadow of anew nuclear age, uncertainty is everywhere.In 2025, divisions have sadly deepened. At a time when humanity is faced with immense global challenges, we have been pushed further into boxes of “us v them”.View image in fullscreenAn Afghan girl carries drinking water in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August 2025. Experts have warned that the city could become the first in the world to completely run out of water.Photograph: Samiullah Popal/EPAAn existential anxiety affects and drains many of us – east, west, north and south. Young and old. Perhaps some people are better at hiding their emotions than others, but when we look underneath polished social media facades of happy and fulfilled lives, we can see that anxiety is actually widespread. Fear. Frustration. Enervation. A new word has been coined to define the zeitgeist: “polycrisis”. The worst thing we can do, individually and collectively, is to allow ourselves to descend into numbness. To become desensitised to the pain and suffering of others:in Gaza, in Sudan, in Ukraine. This is why good and honest journalism matters all the more today. Many pieces published in theGuardian this year not only showed a remarkable depth and breadth, but also helped us to remain engaged and connected. In that sense, they are an antidote to numbness.There were sentimental moments this year, too. In the UK,we cried again over the Sycamore Gaptree and the senseless, meaningless hatred displayed by two men, convicted this year, who decided it would be fun to cut down something that had brought joy to so many for so long.It is interesting that the human sentimentality that we were allowed to display in response to the death of a beloved tree was denied to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, when she was caught on camera crying in the Commons. The media and social media coverage was rather sexist.Amelia Gentleman wrote a coruscating pieceasking why women’s workplace tears are regarded as a source of shame. Delving into another emotionally difficult subject, Polly Toynbeewrote courageouslyon the assisted dying debate, underlining how a decent life can end in a decent death.One of the most poignant and important pieces published this year was co-written by Malak A Tantesh and Emma Graham-Harrison about the despair of parents and grandparents in Gaza watching their children and grandchildren with skeletal bodies, so malnourished that they have become vulnerable to all kinds of horrible diseases: “We have faced hunger before, but never like this.” Dan Sabbagh composed an article about Ukraine that highlighted the devastating consequences of the occupation and war for ordinary families, with one person stating: “We never thought the war would come to our village.” Amplifying human stories can help to dismantle the cold and elitist rhetoric that treats people as sheer numbers.View image in fullscreenOasis perform during their reunion tour in Melbourne in October 2025.Photograph: Joel Carrett/EPAA recent report revealed thatKabul could soon become the first modern cityto completely run out of water, with all the aquifers drying up as early as 2030. More than 6 million people live in Afghanistan’s capital. In the UK, there is a growing public resentment and anger against water companies that keep pumping sewage into our rivers. Meanwhile, rivers are dying elsewhere, with the Middle East and north Africa being home to seven out of the 10 mostwater-stressed nations. The climate crisis is the story of water and the ones who disproportionately bear the brunt are always women, children and tpoor people.There were some moments of light. Even small miracles, such asthe reunion of Oasis. We have seen a heartwarming rise in book clubs and reading parties. Unexpectedly, in this time of hyperinformation and fast consumption, manyyoung people are taking up traditional hobbies. It feels as if the faster our world spins, the more urgent and universal our need to slow down, to connect, to think, to care.In Argentina recently, an 18th-century painting called Portrait of a Lady that was stolen from a Jewish art collector by the Nazis was recovered after beingspotted on an estate agent’s listing. She looks at us calmly, the woman in the portrait, in her flower-embroidered dress; she who has seen too many atrocities but is still resilient and full of life. As always, art, culture and literature offer us a sanctuary, a home, a sense of togetherness. Glassblowers remind us that even the worst shattered glass can be melted, resculpted and revived. It all begins with an honest recognition of what remains broken and a willingness to mend.Elif Shafak is a novelist and political scientistThis is an edited version of Elif Shafak’s introduction toThe Bedside Guardian 2025Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Today, the challenges facing the voluntary sector as it attempts to cope with an ongoing funding crisisWed 31 Dec 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 14.38 ESTShareSpeaking in a parliamentarydebateon the voluntary sector, not long after Labour’s huge election victory, the party’s former MP Jeff Rooker evoked the many ways charities hold Britain’s social fabric together. Every week in his local area, he told fellow peers, agroupnamed Hands Together Ludlow gives food and support to dozens of desperate people, enables others to access benefit entitlements, runs a “shed” workspace that doubles as a place to meet and talk, and rescues individuals overlooked by agencies delivering social services. Volunteers such as these, Lord Rooker observed, “keep society going”.Few would disagree. TheGuardian’s Christmas charity appealshowcases similarly vital work being undertaken up and down the country. Yet heading into 2026, this vast network of voluntary organisations faces formidable headwinds and an ominous financialcrunch. The prolonged impact of austerity, the pandemic and an ongoing cost of living crisis mean that demand for their services continues to rise. But state funding – both from central government and hollowed-out local authorities – has become more and more inadequate, and charitable giving hasdeclinedto the lowest level since tracking began. Fewer people are volunteering, and costs are dramatically up – not least as a result of the rise in employers’ national insurance contributions, which kicked in last April.For some of the country’s household name charities, this perfect storm ensured that 2025 was an annus horribilis. The mental health charity Samaritansannouncedin July that it would close half of its 200 branches. Macmillan Cancer Support has shed aquarter of its staffand scaled back hardship grants. Other jobs have been – or are at risk of being – lost at Oxfam and the counselling charity Relate. Institutions such as the National Trust have beentargetedby “anti-woke” campaigners more interested in stoking culture wars than safeguarding the viability of a crucial component of the public realm.Civic reckoningAt the other end of the scale, thousands of smaller grassroots organisations are simply struggling to stay afloat, digging into reserves and cutting services. A survey by Voluntary Norfolk in the summerfoundthat half of the county’s charities feared they would be forced to let staff go. Burnout in overstretched and insecure workplaces is a growing concern.A Labour government aspiring to place such organisations at the heart of civic renewal should treat this state of affairs as a scandal and a challenge. In July, Sir Keir Starmerlaunchedthe civil society covenant – continuing with the post-2010 framing of the non-state, non-market sphere as one shaped not only by formal charities and non-profits, but by community and faith groups too. But much-needed collaboration will not flourish on the basis of warm words alone.A reset, not for the first time, is needed. The modernhistoryof voluntarism has been one of cultural reinvention, and shifting boundaries of responsibility in relation to Whitehall. In the 1960s and 1970s, a new wave of campaigning charities professionalised the sector and shone a light on the deficiencies and outdated approaches of the postwar welfare state. Organisations such as theChild Poverty Action Group, Shelter and Friends of the Earth acted as critical friends to Labour governments, for which they constituted a radical hinterland and crucial source of ideas.Counter-revolution followed, as Conservative administrations shrank the state and appealed to virtuous citizens to fill the void. Margaret Thatcher’s putativerevivalof “Victorian values” in the 1980s, and David Cameron’s“big society”in the 2010s, promoted the moral superiority of individual and communal self-reliance over debilitating “welfare dependency”. That, at least, was the self‑serving political narrative. The disastrous social consequences of recession and austerity were meanwhile dumped at the doors of churches and charities that were ill-equipped to cope.By contrast, Sir Keir’s notion of a covenantal relationship carries promising echoes of New Labour’s earlier idea of a “compact”. As chancellor in the 2000s, Gordon Brown presided over a boom in contract funding to voluntary welfare providers and a new focus on social enterprises – both viewed as vehicles through which to expand choice and deepen civic engagement. Taking inspiration from the celebrated US sociologist Robert Putnam, whose work spoke to an early communitarian strand in New Labour thinking, Mr Brown hailed “a quiet revolution in how voluntary action and charitable work serve the community”.Underfunded but indispensableThat was then, though, before the 2008 crash inaugurated two lost decades of flatlining growth and pared-back Whitehall budgets. Politically polarised, preoccupied with issues of social cohesion, and dealing with the costs of an ageing population, Britain is now in dire need of a new golden age of voluntarism. But the current financial squeeze on charities, which the government has done too little to address, is pointing in the opposite direction. For the majority of charities regularly surveyed by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, grants and contracts have not covered costs since 2020. Worryingly for the future, donations havedippedmost steeply among the young, with “affordability” cited as the principal factor behind the decline.For its idea of a “covenant” to mean anything, Labour must begin to find ways to ensure the voluntary sector can access both the financial resources and the human resources it needs. As countless studies have attested, the country’s 160,000‑plus charities contribute to the economy not only directly, but throughpreventiveaction that saves the state money it would otherwise spend when problems turn into crises. Properly valuing that latter contribution would, in itself, justify a transformative injection of funds into their coffers.A sector which is a proven social and economic asset deserves better than a constant, failing battle to do more with less.Charitiesare trusted by users in a way that the state and local councils are not, and their priorities are not distorted by the profit-seeking motives of market‑based providers. At a grassroots level, this unique position can allow them to be pathfinders and pioneers, forging deep and creative connections with the communities in which they are embedded. The government rightly talks up the prospect of an alliance that will empower the voluntary sector to fulfil its proper vocation. In 2026, it will be time to walk the walk.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Even senior planners involved in the postwar new towns programme have warned that the current proposals lack ambition on social housing and may not reach those in greatest need (Key figures in creation of Milton Keynes criticise UK’s new towns plan, 25 December). Other analyses suggest that new towns have historically contributed only a small proportion of the homes required and are unlikely to deliver at the scale ministers claim.Instead of pouring resources into speculative new settlements, we should focus on the towns and cities we already have – places with infrastructure, identity and communities that are being steadily hollowed out. Across the UK, redundant land, vacant upper floors, derelict retail units and brownfield sites offer enormous potential for affordable, well‑located homes. This approach would deliver housing faster and more sustainably, and in ways that strengthen existing communities rather than displacing them.At the same time, our high streets are being drained by the gravitational pull of out‑of‑town shopping malls. Every time a retailer relocates, it accelerates decline, reduces footfall and undermines the economic and social fabric of our town centres. If we are serious about revitalising local economies, we must stop incentivising retail flight and instead reinvest in the places where people already live, work and shop.New towns may suit developers, but they will not solve the housing crisis for those who need help most. Strengthening and repurposing our existing urban areas while protecting and revitalising our high streets would deliver more homes, more quickly, and with far greater social value.Richard EltringhamLeicesterThe former planners of Milton Keynes are right to criticise the government’s new towns plan for failing to meet the priority need for social housing at council rents. They are also right to stress how well the earlier new towns met this need.It nearly didn’t happen atMilton Keynes, though. The Labour government’s policy was already swinging towards owner-occupation when the city was designated in 1967, and among its board members was Stanley Morton, chairman of the Abbey National building society and previously of the Building Societies Association. The board was undecided on the relative weight to be attached to homes for sale and homes for the corporation to rent. As the economist in the consultant team, I was charged with analysing the implications of the choices, and I prepared a report for a meeting of the board, which Mr Morton hosted at Abbey National’s headquarters in Baker Street, London.I generated forecasts of household income distribution under various assumptions and concluded that Milton Keynes would have to build at least half its housing for social rent. Otherwise it would fail to achieve the board’s objectives of social and industrial mix. I was regarded as a bit insubordinate, but my argument carried the day. It was a close shave.Michael EdwardsHonorary professor, Bartlett School of Planning,University College LondonIn 1981, I moved toPeterborough– “cathedral city, new town – with my partner and our two-year-old son. I had a new job, part-funded by Peterborough Development Corporation (PDC), to establish a social welfare organisation for the city. Most critically, having a job meant we were eligible for housing, and so we swapped cramped, overpriced privately rented accommodation in Brighton for a three-bedroom house and garden.Thousands of houses were being built for sale and rent, but this was only part of the picture. PDC’s master plan addressed all aspects of making the city home for a population that was set to double. Employment, leisure opportunities, a network of safe cycle routes, and a number of discrete self-supporting neighbourhoods with schools, libraries, shops and play facilities as well as teams of community workers assisting people to settle, made the city a vibrant place for incomers and locals alike.The process of attracting public and private money to work together also acted as a catalyst for the county and city councils and the health authority to “dream big” – and deliver. Maybe the experts now expressing concern about government plans should turn their attention to protesters such as those in the village of Adlington, Cheshire, who just see more houses and cars, not people and progress, in the plans to build 20,000 new homes on their doorstep in a new standalone development.Les BrightExeter, DevonI spent almost all my career as an architect/planner in the UK’s new towns programme. I started out as a year-out architecture student in Skelmersdale, then, having graduated from Liverpool School of Architecture, I spent the early part of my career working there.After a brief spell in private practice, I moved to East Kilbride in Scotland to work on the early planning of the ultimately abandoned new town at Stonehouse in Lanarkshire, originally proposed by Ted Heath as a gesture to economic growth in Scotland. After another six years as head of planning at East Kilbride, I was appointed chief architect and planning officer at Livingston in West Lothian, before retiring when the Conservative government eventually managed to wind up the entire programme in 1996.I have always regarded the British new towns programme as one of the most significant and successful planning initiatives of any British government. Their success was attributable in no small part, particularly in Scotland in the 80s and 90s, to continued support from government of whatever colour. This was in some respects pragmatic, and counter to generally espoused policy, but the delivery of new jobs in the newly emerging industries of microelectronics and healthcare research delivered significant numbers of new jobs that were an important component of government credibility and re-electability.A job and a good-quality house provided by the development corporation were sufficiently powerful incentives to retain ambitious families in Scotland who might otherwise have emigrated to the US or the Commonwealth.New towns were – and if we are to build more, should be in the future – not just massive housing developments built for developer profit (it should be noted that Lord Reith, the father of the new towns programme, resisted the blandishments of Wimpey and co, who tried to persuade him that the private sector could deliver his new towns).What is needed now is dynamic developments providing new jobs in emerging industries, supported by good-quality public housing and community facilities to engender community development, efficient public transport and all that goes with the requirements to provide sustainable communities.But above all, it requires sustained central government support, politically and financially, and the establishment of a new tranche of development corporations with the power to acquire land at existing use value, and planning powers equivalent to those of their predecessors.Gordon DaviesDornoch, SutherlandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

PlusAbhishek Kalyankaron India’s colonial experienceWed 31 Dec 2025 12.15 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 14.38 ESTShareKenneth Mohammed’s article rightly highlights the growing moral case for reparations, but like many pieces on this subject, it fails to address the practical “how” (In the Caribbean and Africa a reparations movement is growing: so why is Britain pretending otherwise?, 25 December). While the refrain that “no one alive today owned slaves” is indeed tired, the question of who finances reparations remains a massive hurdle that advocates consistently underanalyse.Take my family: I am of English heritage and my husband is of north African colonial descent. While his family faced appalling historical injustices, my ancestors were Lancashire miners and cotton mill workers. Though their industry was built on the back of slave labour, they lived in poverty. Today, as a nurse and a social worker in London, we struggle with the cost of housing, living and a sluggish economy.The primary beneficiaries of colonial wealth were the landowning classes and those with inherited wealth now tucked away in offshore accounts. Asking the modern working class to fund reparations through taxed income when they are already struggling is the real barrier to gaining public support.If the movement is to succeed, it must move beyond generalities and target the specific institutions and squirrelled-away wealth that truly profited. Until then, the debate remains one of moral theory rather than economic justice.Graham Hadibi-WilliamsLondonAs an Indian expat living and working in England, I read your article on reparations with a heavy heart. While the focus onCaribbeanand African legacies is essential, I was shocked to find no mention of the Indian subcontinent – the “jewel in the crown” of the empire.The call for restorative justice is incomplete without acknowledging the systematic extraction of wealth fromIndia, the millions of lives lost to manmade famines in Bengal and the displacement of our cultural heritage – symbolised by the Koh-i-Noor diamond and countless temple statues held in British institutions.Furthermore, while the article rightly highlights the visa hurdles faced by citizens of other former colonies, it ignores the huge bureaucracy and costs faced by Indian professionals. If we are to discuss the unresolved shadow of empire, we must include the 1.4 billion people whose history was fundamentally reshaped by it. We cannot truly address colonial injustice by picking and choosing which victims to acknowledge.Abhishek KalyankarLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Ask any fan who attended their excellent roadshow in Battersea Park during the mid-1980s. Devised as a harvest festival event under canvas, a number of the Ambridge soap’s stars were involved, notably a singing Eddie Grundy, and Sid Perks, one-time landlord of the Bull, who hosted a quiz. It was especially memorable for me and my late wife because we won a fresh cabbage.Quentin FalkLittle Marlow, BuckinghamshireThis is not the first time the cast ofThe Archershave gone on tour. In the 1980s, they were at a country theatre (possibly the Mill at Sonning in Berkshire), after which they transferred the show to Battersea Park in London. Also, in the 1950s, a professional production toured the UK, although not with the radio cast. I saw it at the Harrow Coliseum in about 1953. It was a little more explicit than the radio show, with the occasional swearword. The plot was about a holiday camp opening near Ambridge, about which the Dan Archer character protested by saying “bloody campers!”Michael DarvellHemel Hempstead, HertfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But that also makes any more expensive incomings unlikely in January, especially after the timely return of the influential Gabriel Magalhães this week. A loan signing or two could be on the cards, however, with Arsenal not having filled either slot so far after bringing in Neto from Bournemouth and Raheem Sterling from Chelsea last season. Mikel Arteta could do with more cover at right-back and must also decide whether to allow Ethan Nwaneri to go on loan with the 18-year-old having made only three starts in all competitions.Ed AaronsAston VillaThere remains little wiggle room for Unai Emery to strengthen his squad owing to financial regulations but the Villa manager is keen to bolster his frontline with Ollie Watkins still the team’s only bona fide No 9. A €12m (£10.5m) deal for Grêmio’s teenage winger Alysson is advanced and another young forward could be sought to complement Villa’s attack. Loanee Harvey Elliott has not featured for almost three months and with Emery reluctant to trigger a £35m permanent move fromLiverpool, all parties are seeking to find a sensible solution; Villa would have to pay to terminate the deal prematurely. They are not expected to be aggressive in the market but will pursue moves deemed good opportunities.Ben FisherView image in fullscreenHarvey Elliott’s future remains unclear.Photograph: Sportimage Ltd/AlamyBournemouthThere is an acceptance that an elite Premier League club – Manchester City are at the front of the queue – will trigger the £65m release clause inserted into the contract extension Antoine Semenyo signed last summer.The noise surroundingthe forward has been unrelenting but Bournemouth have been preparing for this scenario and while Andoni Iraola recognises it is “impossible” to replace Semenyo with a like-for-like signing, they have proved savvy when it comes to succession planning. Bristol City are due 20% of the profit Bournemouth generate for a player signed for £10m in 2023. As well as a winger, they are keen to add an imposing centre-back with Marcos Senesi’s contract up at the end of the season. The club may also target another central midfielder with the USA captain, Tyler Adams, sidelined for up to three months and a goalkeeper to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic, their No 1, who signed last summer.BFBrentfordAfter banking £50m of summer transfer profit, Brentford have spending power to match their European ambitions. Igor Thiago and Kevin Schade will attract attention, but there is no need – or desire – to sell in January. Instead, Tottenham’s Brennan Johnson is a possibility to join Keith Andrews’ forward line, thoughCrystal Palaceare the likelier destination. Lille’s Matias Fernandez-Pardo is another option. Midfielder Vitaly Janelt can sign a pre-contract with another club on 1 January and Eintracht Frankfurt lead the queue for his signature. Feyenoord’s Quinten Timber, brother of Arsenal’s Jurriën, is a possible replacement. Dimitris Kaloskamis of AEK Athens, 20, has also been floated, fitting the Brentford template of unheralded, promising talent others overlook and might end up coveting.John BrewinView image in fullscreenWill Quinten Timber join brother, Jurriën, in the Premier League?Photograph: Wart Brinkerhof/MTB/AlamyBrightonThe jury is still out on several of Brighton’s summer signings and they could expect to bring in more players in January, with a right-back, a central midfielder and a new forward believed to be top of Fabian Hürzeler’s wishlist. Carlos Baleba is not expected to depart in January despite strong interest in the Cameroon midfielder from Manchester United, although that hasn’t stopped the club’s scouting department from accelerating plans to bring in a replacement before then. A number of experienced players, includingtop scorer Danny Welbeck– who has been dogged by a back injury this season – Joël Veltman, Adam Webster and 39-year-old James Milner are all out of contract in the summer.EABurnleyBurnley are desperate not to return to the Championship at the first time of asking, so will be active.Goals are their biggest problemand finding a way to rectify that is the key ambition in January. Whether that comes in the form of a new striker or someone more creative, if not both, will be an intriguing aspect of the recruitment strategy. One further potential issue is the injury the captain, Josh Cullen, picked up against Everton. If it is as serious as first feared, finding cover in midfield could lengthen the wishlist. They will also be very open to allowing those lacking action to depart to cut back on wages.Will UnwinChelseaThe world champions are unlikely to conduct big business.Chelseaare planning to improve their attack next summer and also want to find cover for Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo in midfield. But mostly there is a focus on the future, with the recruitment team monitoring youngsters such as the Rennes centre-back Jérémy Jacquet and Saint-Étienne forward Djylian N’Guessan. Enzo Maresca would have liked to sign a centre-back after losing Levi Colwill to injury last summer. But there may be a bigger focus on outgoings. Buyers need to be found for Axel Disasi and Raheem Sterling. Tyrique George almost joined Fulham last summer.Jacob SteinbergCrystal PalaceOliver Glasner has repeatedly called out Crystal Palace’s lack of preparation for their first European campaign and it looks like being a busy month in south London as they scramble for new additions to a squad that has already played 30 games this season. Injuries to key players Chris Richards, Daniel Muñoz and Daichi Kamada have exposed Palace’s weaknesses and they are likely to pursue a new right-back as a priority, with Bayern Munich’s Sacha Boey having been linked with a move. There is alsointerest in Tottenham’s Brennan Johnsonwhile Palace will be braced for any January approaches for Marc Guéhi or the likes of Adam Wharton and Jean-Philippe Mateta.EAView image in fullscreenOliver Glasner will want to keep hold of Adam Wharton.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersEvertonDavid Moyes is confident The Friedkin Group, Everton’s owners, will support efforts to sustain the undoubted progress that has been made since he returned in January but availability may prove more of an issue than affordability.Everton’s weakness is glaringand holding the team back. Thierno Barry and Beto have scored twice and once in the Premier League goal this season respectively despite Everton’s forward play improving courtesy of Jack Grealish, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Iliman Ndiaye. Signing a goalscorer more worthy of their talents would be top of the list, but difficult in January. Ideally Everton would also strengthen at full-back and in midfield.Andy HunterFulhamThe west Londoners could do with adding more depth to their squad. They had a quiet summer and it remains to be seen if they can convince their manager, Marco Silva, to sign a new contract. He will want to see ambition. Fulham could do with a new forward given thatRaúl Jiménez, 34, is out of contractnext summer, Jonah Kusi-Asare is only on loan from Bayern Munich and Rodrigo Muniz is injured. Similarly a right-winger could be useful given that Harry Wilson’s deal expires soon and Adama Traoré is likely to join West Ham. Could a move for Chelsea’s Tyrique George be revisited?JSLeedsWhen the summer transfer window shut, Daniel Farke was disappointed not to have signed two more forwards and appeared particularly stung by a failed move for Fulham’s Harry Wilson. DespiteDominic Calvert-Lewin’s recent goalscoring renaissanceand some impressive performances from the often criticised Brenden Aaronson, Farke still covets at least one more frontline addition. He may also seek cover at wing-back but, given that barely a month ago the German was deemed to be “under severe pressure” at Elland Road, it will be intriguing to see how far the board are willing to back a head coach who has choreographed a dramatic upturn in the team’s fortunes. With profitability and sustainability constraints very real, Leeds will need to sell some fringe squad members before the 30 June accounting deadline and it is not impossible that one of Illan Meslier, Joël Piroe and Jack Harrison could depart in January.Louise TaylorLiverpoolArne Slot insists Liverpool do not have “unlimited money” despite the impression given by their summer spending spreeof almost £450m, yet mistakes from that extravagant window need addressing. The attempt to sign Marc Guéhi on a cut-price deal backfired and, coupled with Giovanni Leoni’s cruciate ligament injury, has left Liverpool light in central defence. Not adding attacking width disrupted the balance of the team with Luis Díaz sold and Mohamed Salah in decline. Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo is a target.Salah’s issues with Slot, and vice versa, have not disappeared and that saga will be reignited should the £65m-rated Semenyo arrive at the expense of one of Liverpool’s greatest players.AHView image in fullscreenWill Antoine Semenyo swap the south coast for the north-west?Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersManchester CityPep Guardiola’s winter window is primarily about signing Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo by triggering a release clause that is slightly less than £65m. If the 25-year-old agrees terms and does give the transfer the green light – his clause has to be activated early in January – Guardiola, who prefers a smaller squad, will hope to offload at least one wide player, so Savinho or Oscar Bobb could depart. The manager has been asked if James Trafford could be loaned out after Gianlugi Donnarumma became the first-choice goalkeeper but – so far, anyway – Guardiola has batted the prospect away.Jamie JacksonManchester UnitedRuben Amorim considered adding Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth if the player signalled interest butManchester Cityare the favourites to sign him. A No 6 midfielder is the prime target, with Al-Hilal’s Rúben Neves, 28, of interest – the fee would be around £20m. Atlético Madrid’s Conor Gallagher is also on the radar – his club value him in the £35m-45m bracket. United would prefer a loan and the deal may depend if the 25-year-old wants the move. Regarding outgoings, Kobbie Mainoo seems the only player who may leave – on loan – though Amorim indicated recently this would be countenanced only if a midfielder is signed.JJView image in fullscreenConor Gallagher in action for Atlético Madrid, who he joined in the summer of 2024, but he could return to the Premier League.Photograph: Bagu Blanco/Pressin/AlamyNewcastleNewcastle have nine games in January and arather jaded squadseems in need of fresh legs and new ideas. Yet if a creative midfielder in the mould of the much-admired 19-year-old AZ and Netherlands Under-21 international Kees Smit looms large on Eddie Howe’s shopping list, the defence could also do with fortifying. The acquisition of cover for Tino Livramento and Lewis Hall at full-back seems imperative and it is not impossible that Matt Targett could be recalled from his successful loan spell at Middlesbrough. Newcastle, though, have frequently watched Dayann Methalie, the versatile 19-year-old Toulouse and France Under-21 defender. There is money available but a board that prioritises signing players under 25 would prefer to invest more heavily in the summer. Even so, Howe would ideally like to welcome an extra striker during a month when he could possibly bid farewell to Joe Willock, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth and Will Osula.LTNottingham ForestSean Dyche has already suggested it is “unlikely” to be a busy window but Forest usually produce a surprise. The main focus at the City Ground will be to reduce the size of the squad. It became bloated over the summer when they invested heavily in strengthening depth but did result in Omari Hutchinson not being registered in the club’s 25-man Europa League squad. Fringe players, such as Willy Boly, will be made available but Forest have no intention of selling the midfielder Elliot Anderson, who has attracted interest from numerous Premier League rivals, includingManchester United.WUSunderlandEvents in Morocco could shape January on Wearside. Régis Le Bris has six players at Afcon and Sunderland’s manager will be hoping that Noah Sadiki, Reinildo, Habib Diarra, Chemsdine Talbi and co avoid injury and return in good shape for the second half of a hithertorather wonderful season. Le Bris has said the club are looking at potentially reinforcing “two or three positions” but bolstering the frontline seems a priority. As well as Sunderland have done, their leading scorer, Wilson Isidor, has only four goals and the arrival of a prolific striker to capitalise on defence-splitting passes from Granit Xhaka and Enzo Le Fée would be welcome. Le Bris, meanwhile, will be hoping Chelsea abandon their interest in another outstanding midfielder, Sadiki, but could be open to moving fringe players on. The midfielder Dan Neil is among those who may depart.LTTottenhamThomas Frank says his club will “definitely be in the market” and the money is available after the owners, the Lewis family trust, oversaw a £100m cash injection in October. There are caveats. January is a complicated month. Spurs will be competing, according to Frank, with “eight clubs for the same players”. The squad is up to its Uefa limits on overseas personnel. There are already two players for every position; more in some. The overriding message is that only fits for the longer term will be considered. Left wing is the most obvious area for an upgrade. Spurs wanted the Manchester City winger, Savinho, last summer; the noise around him has not gone away. Brennan Johnson and Yves Bissouma could be moved on. The club must become better at selling.David HytnerWest HamReinforcements are a must fora side in increasing peril. Fulham’s Adama Traoré is a likely addition on the wing and a replacement in attack for Niclas Füllkrug, who is heading to Milan on loan, is a priority. The Wolves striker Jørgen Strand Larsen is a target, albeit an expensive one. Coventry’s Haji Wright and Ellis Simms and the Viktoria Plzen striker Rafiu Durosinmi have been monitored too. However, Nuno Espírito Santo has problems at both ends. A new defender is needed and West Ham have looked at Toulouse’s Charlie Cresswell. A nagging concern, though, is whether players will want to join West Ham when their plight looks so hopeless.JSView image in fullscreenWill Haji Wright swap a title push with Coventry for a relegation scrap at West Ham?Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAWolvesIt would be foolish for Wolves not to have the Championship in mind when it comes to new signings. They want players who could play key roles in a promotion push next season, with relegation increasingly inevitable. They are seeking improvements across the pitch but are prioritising a goalkeeper, wingers and a right-wing back. Matt Jackson, promoted to technical director, will oversee recruitment, working closely with the head coach Rob Edwards, who had lost his first seven matches in charge before Tuesday’sdraw at Manchester United. André and João Gomes have interest from rivals but, barring huge offers, are unlikely to be sold in January. Jørgen Strand Larsen is of interest to West Ham, while Fer López, among the summer signings who have struggled to impress, could depart on loan. Enticing players might be tricky.BFExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalAston VillaBournemouthBrentfordBrighton & Hove AlbionBurnleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cameroon allowed him to stay at Leverkusen until the eve of the tournament in Morocco with his first caps much anticipated.After squandering several half chances early on, Kofane thrashed home a rocket-like effort from the edge of the area in the 55th minute to win the game.Mozambique led after the Sporting Lisbon striker Geny Catamo fired them ahead in the 23rd minute with a powerful low strike from outside the penalty area. But the surprise advantage lasted only five minutes before a bizarre own goal tied matters at the Grand Stade d’Agadir.It came when the Cameroon striker Frank Magri’s shot was deflected by full-back Nené on to the post. The Mozambican defender had fallen to the ground in the process and as the ball rebounded back at him, he tried to sweep it away from danger but only succeeded in putting it into his own net.Cameroon will now play South Africa on Sunday, while Mozambique face Nigeria on Monday.Burkina Fasobooked second place in Group E with a 2-0 win overSudanin Casablanca, with goals from Lassina Traoré and Arsène Kouassi as their opponents squandered a penalty.View image in fullscreenLassina Traoré’s goal gave Burkina Faso the lead.Photograph: BackpageTraoré put Burkina Faso ahead after 16 minutes, rising to meet a looping cross from Stephane Aziz Ki and steering his header inside the far post.Sudansquandered a golden chance to level when Hervé Koffi, Burkina Faso’s goalkeeper, fouled Al-Jezoli Nouh in the box, only for him to drag the resulting penalty wide.That miss was compounded by further wasted opportunities, and Burkina Faso made sure of the points as Kouassi raced on to a pass from Dango Ouattara and slipped the ball past the goalkeeper from 15 yards.Burkina Faso finished on six points from three matches, three behind the group winners, Algeria, who advance with a perfect record.

Because it’s how you overcome the problems. In this perspective, now every time when I reflect on what happened last season, I’m more proud than ever about what we have done as a club, how we handled the bad, bad situations.”Rodri, who completed 90 minutes in the Premier League twice in 2025, is available after a hamstring injury. The midfielder missed most of the year because of a cruciate ligament injury sustained in September 2024, which sparked a poor run of form for City, and further setbacks.City sit five points behind Arsenal with a game in hand, having been 14 points off the top at this point last year. They invested heavily last January, spending £172m on signings.Premier League points-per-game standings for 2025“Without those players we wouldn’t be in the Champions League this season,” Guardiola said. “I think we would have been playing in the Conference [League] without those signings. Basically we didn’t have players for a long, long time, and the moment with the new players and then with three-quarters of the season gone others came back, we were the best team in the Premier League in the last 10 to 15 games in the season. Sometimes you have to take a decision as you don’t expect something.“When we had all the seasons as a squad, we were competing like we are doing this season and obviously, come on, with Rodri we are a stronger team. There’s no doubt about that.”This winter window is expected to be quieter but a deal for Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo isclose to completion. The winger is keen on a move to City, despite interest from elsewhere. He played in the2-2 draw at Chelseaon Tuesday, creating two goals with long throws, a threat Guardiola has admitted is absent from his squad.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolanewsShareReuse this content"

This year’s 13-person selection panel included Ali Martin, Vic Marks, Tim de Lisle, Adam Collins, Rob Smyth, Jonathan Liew, Tanya Aldred, Taha Hashim, Daniel Gallan, Emma John, Simon Burnton and James Wallace. Everyone taking part picked and submitted their own XI in the days after Australia’s victory in the third Ashes Test at Adelaide (statistics are from 1 January 2025 up to and including this match). When the votes were added up, Earth’s combined side to play Mars looked like this:Travis Head:759 runs at an average of 42.Votes(out of 13):10The E and the D in the end of England’s Ashes chances. The series took an early turn when Head volunteered to open the batting in the fourth innings of the first Test, and turned in the sort of innings England’s batters only spoke about playing. They had 205 runs to defend, which (easy to forget this bit) everyone reckoned ought to be enough on a tricky pitch but ended up looking pitifully inadequate. Ben Stokes flapped, and England’s fragile attack, which had bowled so well in the first innings of that same match, were smashed. The damage was so bad that some of them were still looking for their lines and lengths in Adelaide three weeks later,when Head scored the centurythat killed their last faint chance of winning the Ashes.KL Rahul:813 runs at 45.Votes:nineHis year felt as if he’d listened to Virat Kohli’s advice that “if you want to earn respect, give your heart and soul to Test cricket”. Having spent a decade in different roles, in and out of the team, up and down the XI, Rahul’s slow, steady batting, at the top of the order, so at odds with the way the game is played in this era, added ballast to India’s cricket on tour in England. He batted for more than six hours for his hundred at Headingley, then five and a half for a second at Lord’s, and then five more for his 90 at Old Trafford. Another hundred against West Indies in an innings victory at Ahmedabad made this the most successful year of his Test career.View image in fullscreenKL Rahul hit two Test hundreds on India’s tour of England.Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty ImagesShubman Gill:983 runs at 70.Votes:13The crack of Gill’s batwas the soundtrack to the English summer. At the start of the tour no one was quite sure. He was a new Test captain, leading a team that were missing two senior players, and he had never scored a Test century outside Asia. He strung together innings of 147, 269 and 161 in back-to-back matches at Headingley and Edgbaston, and another 103 at Old Trafford. Overall he batted for almost 28 hours, and scored 754, which is more runs than any captain has ever made during a series in England, and more, too, than any Indian captain has made in a series anywhere. By the end of the summer he had outgrown the nickname Prince and become something more like a king.Joe Root:790 runs at 56.Votes:12He accomplished so much, but the hard truth is none of it was enough. Still, this was the year Root overtook all three of Rahul Dravid, Jacques Kallis, and Ricky Ponting among the game’s all-time run-scorers. English cricket lives in thrall to its history, nobody’s ever quite as good as the best used to be, but even so there’s a very real idea that Root may just be the greatest batter the country has ever had. He reeled off his 11th, 12th, and 13th Test centuries against India in the space of three matches during the summer, and finished the year by removing the one caveat anyone had left, when hescored his first hundred in Australia.Temba Bavuma(c):310 runs at 52.Votes:sevenFive years ago the South African cricket board was deemed to be so incompetent that it was forced to give up the running of the sport. Four years ago an independent report ruled it was riddled with racial prejudice. Two years ago they had to field a third XI on a Test tour of New Zealand because they wanted all their best players for their domestic Twenty20 league. Right now they’re in the middle of a 21-month run in which their administrators haven’t scheduled a single home Test. And despite it all they beat Australiato become world Test championsand just won a seriesin India. None of it makes any sense, but no doubt a lot of it was down to Bavuma’s inspirational leadership.View image in fullscreenTemba Bavuma led South Africa to glory in the World Test Championship final.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersAlex Carey(wk):743 runs at 53,45 dismissals(40catches,five stumpings).Votes:13A good wicketkeeper is supposed to go unnoticed, but Carey has been so spectacular he has demanded everyone’s attention. His skill was one of Australia’s single biggest advantages over England, especially in the second Ashes Test when he stymied England’s batters by coming up to the stumps to keep to both Scott Boland and Michael Neser. Has also grown into a calm, capable batter, bolstering the team’s brittle top order. By the end of the year, even Stuart Broad had admitted that he’d got it horribly wrong when he said Carey would only ever be remembered for running out Jonny Bairstow at Lord’s back in 2023.Ravindra Jadeja:764 runs at 64,25 wickets atan average of38.Votes:sevenThere are a few flecks of grey in Jadeja’s beard these days, which fits, because after the retirements of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin he’s become the senior player in the team. The tour of England was the best he’s ever had as a batter, with 516 runs, four half-centuries and an unbeaten hundred to secure a draw at Old Trafford among them. The flip-side is that his bowling fell away, and that same series was only the second he’s ever played in which he went at more than 3.5 runs an over. He was better back at home, where he picked up 18 wickets in four Tests against West Indies and South Africa.Ben Stokes:478 runs at 34,29 wickets at 25.Votes:sevenSo the knight didn’t slay the dragon, and the princess never did get rescued from the tower. The great project of Stokes’s later years ended with him dogging out long, performative innings while the team he has spent years building collapsed around him. Stokes has always been a more complicated man than he makes himself sound, and after four years of worrying about the job, his captaincy has lost some of the clarity and compassion that made it so effective at the start. He had his best year with the ball in a decade, largely, you guess, because his bowling was what the team needed most from him, and there was one monumental century, at Old Trafford against India.Mitchell Starc:283 runs at 28,51 wickets at 17.Votes:13Starc recorded career-best figures twice in successive Tests this year. In July he took six for nine against West Indies in Kingston, which was such a thorough demolition that the home board was forced to call in Brian Lara, Clive Lloyd and Viv Richards to figure out what the hell had gone wrong with their cricket. Then he turned England inside-out by taking seven for 58 in Perth, single-handedly denuding them of the idea that they had a sniff of controlling the Ashes just because Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood were injured. If that wasn’t enough, he also top-scored with the bat twice, including his unbeaten 58 in the World Test Championship final.View image in fullscreenMitchell Starc ran through England at Perth to give Australia control of the Ashes.Photograph: Darrian Traynor/Getty ImagesSimon Harmer:30 wickets at 14.Votes:10And they say the county game doesn’t turn out Test cricketers. After eight years at Essex, during which he’d taken well over 500 first-class wickets but played only five Tests, Harmer picked up his international career again when he met Bavuma at the pub after the team’s victory in the World Test Championship final and asked him to please let the head coach, Shukri Conrad, know he was available. Three months later he was back in the South Africa squad for the tours of Pakistan and India. Over the next six weeks he picked up 30 wickets at an average of just 14, including eight for 51 in the first and nine for 101 in the second matches of a famous series win against India, when he out-foxed the world’s best spin-bowling team in their own backyard.Jasprit Bumrah:31 wickets at 22 V.otes:eightThe nonpareil. Bumrah is arguably the single most influential cricketer in the game right now, and India seem to be two different teams depending on whether or not he’s playing. He filleted England’s batting twice during the summer, once in Leeds with five for 83, then again at Lord’s where he took five for 74. He worked over West Indies at home and then skittled South Africa too, when he took five for 27 in Kolkata. The odd thing was that in the end, India lost three of those same games despite his efforts, which made it feel like everyone else in the team was depending on him too much.This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions.

The scrum-half has returned to fitness ahead of schedule after hamstring surgery and marked his 150th Bears appearance in the winagainst Newcastle last Saturday.Pat Lam’s side approach the Prem encounter withSaleat Ashton Gate on Friday after five straight victories, sitting fourth in the table, their attractive style having clicked. A fresh assault on the playoffs looks likely.Bullish Bristol believe Rees-Zammit’s NFL spell has improved his rugbyRead moreRandall played a part in England’s winning tour to the Americas last summer – and a return to club action is a chance to restate his case for international selection before the Six Nations.“We’ve had a change of mindset,” says the 28-year-old of Bristol’s hot form. “We feel like we are a really hard team to beat now. Defensively we’ve made improvements from last year. The way we’ve been training and the preparation we’ve been doing has had a massive effect.”Lam, the director of rugby, spoke this week of the hard work necessary from the forwards to create opportunities for Bristol’s sparkling back-line. Randall concurs that the fun stuff would not happen without a high work rate among the pack.“The likes of [the Argentina second-row] Pedro Rubiolo, the amount of hard work he does, and [No 8] Fitz Harding,” Randall says. “There’s a lot of unseen work those boys get through that people don’t necessarily pick out because we do a lot of other stuff that’s easier on the eye. Among ourselves it doesn’t go unnoticed.”Randall has 14 England caps and faces competition for the No 9 jersey from Northampton’s Alex Mitchell and Ben Spencer of Bath, among others. He remains in the thoughts of the head coach, Steve Borthwick, though, who stayed in contact in the autumn.“It was just a case of him reaching out and asking how my operation went, then a conversation on how I’m tracking,” Randall says. “I just got a message off him again when I got back from injury last week, saying: ‘Good to see you back.’ I really appreciate those messages, it’s a lovely touch.”In contrast with certain previous England regimes it seems players are increasingly keen to spend time in camp. Randall confirms his experience under Borthwick has been uniformly positive.“We’re a good group and everyone wants to be involved,” he says. “The performances are starting to show on the field as well: I don’t think that’s a coincidence. It’s a brilliant place to be and the competition in the squad is massive. I’m sure it’ll be a great Six Nations for those selected.”Bristol’s expansive style differs from England’s but Randall recognises the impact of Borthwick’s attack coach, Lee Blackett,after his permanent appointmentin September.View image in fullscreenHarry Randall hopes to be involved in England’s Six Nations campaign.Photograph: Ben Evans/Huw Evans/Shutterstock“I think Lee going in was a statement of intent,” Randall says. “He’s had a great effect already from what we saw through the autumn. They’re playing a great brand of rugby and the fans are enjoying it.”Sale have won on their last three visits to Ashton Gate, including a remarkable 38-0 shutout of Lam’s team just over a year ago, but the Bears seem to have developed into a different animal since then.Lam says they can go “through, around or over teams”, a claim substantiated by the form of Ellis Genge andLouis Rees-Zammit, both damaging ball carriers in different ways.“We’ve got players that can create something out of nothing,” Randall says. “Gengey and Rees-Zammit, you’ve got to get them on the ball as much as you can. They are special players and can do things other people can’t.“As a group we feel confident at the moment, and a confident team is always a dangerous team,” Randall says. “You build good momentum, you get the ball rolling: it’s been a good time for us.”Randall says life is “very much consumed” by 21-month-old twin girls, but that Clifton coffee shops feature highly on his leisure pursuits in the south-west city when time allows. As for any pre-match routines or superstitions before facing Sale, Randall can think of only one.“I tend to have a Nando’s the night before a game,” he says. “On away trips we get one with the team. We either go to the restaurant or get a takeaway to the hotel. It’s the protein in the chicken, and you want to get some carbs in to fuel up, so the nutritionist doesn’t mind us having the chips and garlic bread.” If Bristol’s form keeps up, perhaps their recipe for success has been revealed.Explore more on these topicsBristolSalePrem RugbyRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The question is whether an American can still carry the crownLee EscobedoWed 31 Dec 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 13.48 ESTShareThat theNBAis reckoned in seasons is apt. To measure a legacy this way is as much existential as it is symbolic. Martin Heidegger argued that time is not something we pass through, but the condition of our being – less a pathway than a pressure. Heavy stuff, yes, but the NBA has always operated under similar weight.The millennial superstars who stabilized the league for two decades are now entering their twilight: LeBron James (who turned 41 on Tuesday),Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Chris Paul. In their wake comes something genuinely new. For the first time, the league’s next dominant generation is unmistakably international. The NBA’s gen Z elite now emerge from Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, Canada and France.The ascendant San Antonio Spurs are the gift the NBA neededRead moreAmerica’s domestic pipeline still produces talent, but the excesses of AAU culture, one-and-done college basketball and eroding fundamentals have dulled its once overwhelming edge. In a garden crowded by its own overgrowth, the question is which strain ultimately thrives.Each of the millennial stars now plays under the pressure of finitude. Heidegger described this as livingtowardan ending – an awareness that sharpens responsibility rather than diminishing it. That sense defines the league’s aging icons. For them, responsibility means one more run. Collectively, this group has won 10 championships and appeared in 23 Finals, but the odds of one last triumph are slim. Curry is straining to extend a dynasty time is quietly dismantling. LeBron is both the Lakers’ largest contract and no longer their centerpiece. Westbrook chases relevance on a lottery-bound roster. Harden remains productive but unsettled. Only Durant, newly aligned with a rising Houston team, appears plausibly positioned for one more push.The question of succession is unavoidable. Elder statesmen Nikola Jokić (30) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (31) understand the clock well enough to know urgency has arrived.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander(27) looks capable of anchoring something durable in Oklahoma City, with Luka Dončić (26) and Victor Wembanyama (21) pressing close behind. The American presence has not vanished, but it has dimmed since the 1990s. Jalen Brunson, Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham and Jayson Tatum keep the idea of domestic succession alive, while 19-year-old Cooper Flagg now complicates the hierarchy entirely.The NBA has never struggled to define its image. From its rise into national consciousness, the league’s authority flowed through Black American players who made the game modern and irresistible, even while navigating deep economic contradictions. But dominance erodes. The world has caught up.Generation Z moves differently. Previous generations were asked to embody systems that rarely worked in their favor. These players arrive as brands unto themselves, unburdened by history. American moxie still matters, but it no longer travels alone.For decades, only Hakeem Olajuwon briefly disrupted American supremacy, and even that required Michael Jordan’s retirement. Now the balance has shifted. The millennial generation reshaped the sport – stretching shooting, flattening positions, weaponizing collectives – but even golden eras end, and their fading has left a vacuum no single nation can easily fill.There is an uncomfortable symmetry to the timing. As American authority softens on the global stage, so too does its basketball hegemony. Players from countries once peripheral to the sport now produce its gravitational centers.Can an American reclaim the mantle? Until recently, the answer felt unconvincing. ThenCooper Flaggarrived. As his shooting stabilizes, his path becomes clearer – and it begins where greatness has always been defined: defense.Across generations, the truly defining stars shared not just brilliance, but responsibility on both ends of the floor. Julius Erving, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant andLeBron Jamescould dominate a game while guarding its most dangerous opponent. That same two-way versatility distinguishes Flagg. It is what gives his ceiling historical weight.Thrown immediately into the burden of replacing Dončić-level expectations, Flagg initially wavered. But after Dallas moved on from general manager Nico Harrison, the collective exhale allowed him to find his footing. The Mavericks sit on the fringes of the play-in picture, but Flagg already checks the league’s most important box: trust.What makes him viable as the NBA’s next face is the rare blend of responsibility, versatility and control at an age when most players are still learning how to stay on the floor. He plays the basketball the league prefers to elevate – two-way, connective, portable. His defensive impact resembles that of elite bigs, while his offensive reads mirror those of primary creators. He spots mismatches early, toggles between force and patience, and resists rushing possessions into waste.The NBA crowns players it can trust. As the youngest player in the league, Flagg already plays like an old one.If the NBA is shaped by contingency rather than ceremony, then the passing of the torch is not an event but an obligation. LeBron’s generation carried the league until their bodies gave way. The world has stepped forward to claim it. But as Heidegger reminds us, what matters is not the future we imagine, but how we handle it once it arrives.The league is not waiting for Cooper Flagg to become something else. It is already responding to what he is.Explore more on these topicsNBACooper FlaggBasketballUS sportsStephen CurryShai Gilgeous-AlexanderNikola JokićfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gabriel Magalhães had just opened the scoringagainst Aston Villaafter a first half in which Mikel Arteta’s nervous side were struggling without the influential Declan Rice. Then it happened.Jadon Sancho was waiting to receive a pass from Youri Tielemans inside Villa’s half but, before the forward knew it, Ødegaard had pinched the ball and was haring towards Emiliano Martínez’s goal. A jink back on to his left foot fooled Tielemans and allowed Ødegaard to play the perfect through ball for Martín Zubimendi to score the crucial second. It was the fifth goal or assist that Zubimendi has contributed since he joined in the summer – the joint-best return of his club career – and the Spaniard’s impact was rightly hailed by a delighted Arteta. “Credit to his teammates as well, how easy they make it for him,” said theArsenalmanager in a nod to Ødegaard.Rampant Arsenal make a strong title statement and bury the Emery bogey | John BrewinRead moreThe Norway international, who scored his first Premier League goal of the season inthe win over Brighton on Saturday, also had a hand in Leandro Trossard’s third goal with a devilish cross that Villa failed to clear, and looked back to his best after injuries affected him both last season and for the first half of this one. Ødegaard had more touches and shots than any other Arsenal player, even if he could not cap his performance with a deserved goal.“He needed some consistency as well,” Arteta said. “Obviously he had two times a shoulder injury, thenhe had a big knee injuryand that takes a little bit of time. Now you can see that he is flowing, that his energy level is back to where it is, that he is taking risks, that he is affecting the game in a great way. I think he was playing really well today.”In August the former Arsenal captain Tony Adams suggested Ødegaard should be replaced as captain by Rice given his drastic loss of form. That was never going to happen, such is his standing within the squad. The arrival of Eberechi Eze for £67.5m in the summer was meant to provide the creative spark Arsenal were missing last season, but the England forward has been increasingly marginalised since Ødegaard returned in late November from a knee injury that forced him to miss seven matches.View image in fullscreenMartin Ødegaard salutes the Arsenal fans after the 4-1 win over Aston Villa extended their lead at the top of the Premier League.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesThat is a reflection of Ødegaard’s rejuvenation, although he has admitted his goals return has not been good enough since he scored 15 in the 2022-23 Premier League season when Arsenal finished as runners-up for the first time under Arteta. “I’ve been waiting for that one,” he said of his strike against Brighton.Ødegaard managed only three goals last season in another campaign interrupted by injuries, with the arrival of his first child last December probably not helping him catch up on sleep. He could have made more of a couple of opportunities late on against Villa, but the signs are there that he is ready to contribute much more as Arsenal head into the new year with a spring in their step, five points clear of Manchester City for now although that could become two again on New Year’s Day.PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal1925452Man City1826403Aston Villa197394Liverpool184325Chelsea191130The same cannot be said of Viktor Gyökeres. For the first 45 minutes against Villa, Arsenal supporters must have been wondering whose idea it was to spend £64m on a striker who did not appear to offer much in any department. Of the five touches Gyökeres managed, three were shots or headers that missed the target and another involved a loss of possession to Ezri Konsa in the centre circle that should have led to a goal for Ollie Watkins. With Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus back on the bench after long injury layoffs, it seemed possible Gyökeres would not re-emerge for the second half after Arsenal had been second-best against Unai Emery’s in-form team.Perhaps mainly because of a lack of alternatives until now, Arteta has shown real faith in the striker who plundered 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season. That was rewarded to an extent when Gyökeres was heavily involved in the move that led to the Arsenal corner from which Gabriel opened the scoring on Tuesday, although that was as good as it got for him.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres heads a chance over against Aston Villa on a night when Arsenal’s Swedish striker again failed to convince.Photograph: Matt Impey/ShutterstockAt least Ødegaard proved there was another Scandinavian in the mood to take the game by the scruff of the neck before Gyökeres was replaced by Jesus, who scored with his first touch and must be in the frame to start against Bournemouth on Saturday instead. The only saving grace for Gyökeres was that Watkins – the Arsenal fan spotted after the game asking Patrick Vieira for a selfie and who Arteta tried to sign last January – also endured an off night on his 30th birthday until he scrambled a late consolation goal to make it seven in 12 appearances against the club.Competition and scrutiny are poised to heat up for Gyökeres over the next few weeks with Havertz also back in the frame. Rice looks likely to return against Bournemouth but Arsenal have already got their captain back.Explore more on these topicsArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That would cost it about €53m.Dazn has also been ordered to pay 25% of the Pro League’s arbitration costs and warned that it will be fined €50,000 a day if it does not meet specified requirements.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Dazn had triggered the legal dispute by withholding November’s contractual payment of €6.6m to the Pro League, although it continued to broadcast matches, on the grounds that it had been unable to agree a financially viable distribution deal with Belgium’s TV operators.Despite months of negotiations, Dazn was unable to secure carriage deals with the Belgian TV networks Proximus and Telenet, with the result that Pro League games have been available only via its own app this season, a model the company said was not commercially viable.Twelve months ago Dazn won a five-year contract for Belgian rights to the Pro League until 2030 worth €84.2m a season to the clubs, but claimed that without a wider distribution deal it could not continue under the original terms.An arbitration tribunal on the matter is due to be constituted in the spring and Cepani could then issue interim measures.“It is important to emphasise that these provisional measures, including on interim payments, do not pass any judgment on Dazn’s legal position in the ongoing dispute with the Pro League,” said Massimo D’Amario, chief executive of Dazn Belgium. “Dazn remains convinced that the Cepani arbitration panel that will be constituted in the coming weeks will rule that the original contract ended lawfully.View image in fullscreenLigue 1 matches at clubs such as Lille are now shown on the league’s own streaming service.Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/Reuters“While not being able to comment on the content of the decision by Cepani’s emergency arbitrator, I find it important to emphasise that Dazn will in any event continue to produce and broadcast Pro League matches as it has been doing over the past months. This is a promise that we made even prior to the decision of the Pro League to commence emergency arbitration.”Dazn succeeded this year in breaking its contract to broadcastLigue 1in France, one season into a five-year deal, agreeing to pay €100m to the Ligue de Football Professionnel in compensation after a vote of the clubs. That decision continues to have major ramifications for French football, with Ligue 1 responding to the collapse of its TV deal by becoming the first of Europe’s top five leagues to launch a direct-to-consumer streaming service to broadcast matches.Subscriber numbers have been disappointing, however, with the result that Ligue 1 has forecast paying only €142m to the clubs in media rights fees this season, including €30.1m to the champions. Liverpool received £174.9m from the Premier League after being crowned champions last season.Many French clubs remain unhappy that Dazn was allowed to walk away without a legal challenge, feelings that the result of the Belgian arbitration are likely to magnify.Dazn’s position in the market is curious, given it has defaulted on two major rights deals with European leagues but last year paid $1bn to secure exclusive global rights for the Club World Cup, albeit after receiving an equity injection from Saudi Arabia’s Surj Sports Investments.Dazn, despite its problems in France and Belgium, last month extended its contract with La Liga to broadcast five matches each week in Spain until 2032 in a deal costing it about €500m each season, an increase of 6% on its previous deal.Lorin Parys, the CEO of the Pro League, said: “We are satisfied that Dazn must honour its commitments regarding, among other things, production, distribution, payments and negotiations with telecom operators. The winners of this ruling are our fans, our clubs and Belgian football as a whole.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballSports rightsLigue 1newsShareReuse this content"

Two years earlier, he had been named by the ringleader, Shakil Chowdhury, as an alleged accomplice in Walker-Roberts’s abuse butGreater Manchesterpolice failed to follow up on this and closed the case.Dozens of items recovered from Chowdhury’s home, where Walker-Roberts says she was raped for hours by five men, were destroyed by officers or returned to Chowdhury. She was trafficked around the town to be abused by several groups of men after being kidnapped from a police station where she had tried to report an earlier assault.‘They thought we were problem children’: how grooming victims were failed in OldhamRead moreThe Guardian understands that Offender J is now unlikely to face charges in relation to Walker-Roberts’s ordeal because the surviving forensic evidence does not link him to her abuse. Chowdhury, jailed for six years in 2007, remains the only man to be convicted in the case, but Walker-Roberts was told last month that officers were pursuing two outstanding suspects.Sarwar Ali absconded after being charged with rape and has never been traced.Policeare trying to identify a third man forensically linked to the case. The Guardian understands he appears not to have come to police attention before.Walker-Roberts said: “All my life, I’ve been told I need to move on but how can I, when I don’t have the answers? Most people get closure when they get a sentence but I’ll never be at that stage, so for me the answers are closure.”She added that she “gave up hope a long time ago” that all of the men involved in her abuse would be brought to justice but feared they had attacked other victims. “I’m praying that others will come forward, I want others to get justice in one form or another,” she said.An internal police inquiry concluded in 2014 that Offender J’s wife may have been spared his attack if forensic inquiries had been adequately conducted in Walker-Roberts’s case.A review of the remaining forensic evidence during this investigation linked two other girls to Chowdhury’s property. They were interviewed and said they’d had sex with Chowdhury at his home when they were 16 but appear not to have made criminal complaints.Asafeguarding reviewcommissioned by Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said in 2022 it had been unable to assess the quality of the inquiries made after the original forensic submissions.It added that Offender J’s wife told police in 2011 that he had admitted to her that he had raped a 12-year-old. She said Offender J had kept newspaper clippings relating to Chowdhury’s court case and subsequent conviction.The information was passed to Operation Messenger, a now defunct multi-agency taskforce designed to combat child sexual exploitation in Oldham, but again was not acted on. The safeguarding review said this was a “serious failure”.In 2007, 22 items of evidence from Chowdhury’s home, including bedding and a towel, were returned to him via his solicitor, despite possible relevance to outstanding suspects. The following year, officers destroyed a further 24 items, including material from Chowdhury’s car and the contents of his bin.When challenged by Walker-Roberts eight years later, the force was unable to provide a “forensic strategy” relating to her case. Walker-Roberts said she was asked to pick out Offender J at a police ID parade in 2014 as part of a new investigation, but was unable to identify him.Failings in Oldham have been central to the establishment of a national inquiry into grooming gangs, which will bechaired by the former children’s commissioner Anne Longfieldwhen it begins in March.The government initially resisted calls for a national inquiry – including those from the owner of X, Elon Musk – instead funding a local investigation in Oldham chaired by a former judge, Tom Crowther, who had led a similar inquiry in Telford, Shropshire.However, an audit by the Whitehall troubleshooter Louise Casey suggested a national inquiry was needed. Crowther has now been stood down and the Oldham investigation will be absorbed into the wider inquiry.The national inquiry, which will look at abuse in England and Wales, has been mired in controversy since it was announced in June.In October, four women quit a survivor advisory panel, saying they felt the government was manipulating them to expand the scope of the inquiry beyond street-based grooming gangs.They called for the resignation of the safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips, but five others, including Walker-Roberts, wrote to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, to support her.Longfield was selected to chair the investigation after the two previous frontrunners, a former police officer Jim Gamble, and a former social worker, Annie Hudson, withdrew.A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said that Walker-Roberts had “suffered horrific abuse which was compounded by appalling failures by the authorities that should’ve protected her at that time”, and that she had received an apology in 2022.“The way Samantha was treated by police was far from the standard survivors can expect from the GMP of today. Since one man was convicted of abusing Samantha we have two further suspects we are determined to bring to court to face charges. One remains charged and remains outstanding – efforts to locate him will not stop until he is found. There is a further suspect forensically linked to the investigation whose identity we are trying to establish.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Instead, return it to the store from where it was bought for a full refund,” the FSA said.While the FSA and Waitrose did not give an estimate as to how many of the Deeside waters may be affected, they urged customers to take note of batch codes on the bottles.For still mineral water, they included: NOV2027 28, DEC2027 01, DEC2027 02, DEC2027 10, DEC2027 11, and DEC2027 16.For sparkling mineral water, the potentially contaminated bottles would be marked: DEC2027 01, DEC2027 03, DEC2027 12, DEC2027 15, and DEC2027 25.Waitrose also urged customers to call their customer care line for further information. “We apologise that it has been necessary to recall this product and for the inconvenience caused,” the supermarket said in a statement.Earlier this month, Waitrose was forced torecall a Santa-themed drinks bottle for “safety reasons”,while in October it had to pull a plant-based fake meat product that had undeclared ingredients including wheat gluten and soy.Glass shards also led to the FSA recallingbottles of spirits under the Disaronno Originale brandin early December.Explore more on these topicsWaitroseFood safetyRetail industrySupermarketsFood & drink industryRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers hope to cut prices partly through a large increase in clean power generation, but also by shifting so-called policy costs into general taxation, to help provide an incentive to use cleaner electricity over gas.In November’s budget, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, saidhousehold energy bills in Great Britain would fall by £154on average from April as a result of two changes.The first was ending the energy company obligation scheme, through which suppliers funded household energy-saving measures. The second was a 75% decrease in the amount households contributed to the renewables obligation scheme, which subsidises clean power generation.However, households will also facehigher bills to pay for £28bn in upgradesto the UK’s gas and electricity grids. These are expected to add £108 a year to bills by 2031.Ministers are planning to announce incentives for low carbon technology in homes in the new year as part of the reshaped £13bnwarm homes plan. Officials say the plan will focus on getting clean technology such asplug-in solar panelsinto people’s houses, rather than paying for home insulation schemes.They also hope to do more to bring down the cost of electricity versus gas, in an effort to encourage more people to switch to using heat pumps to keep their homes warm – although ministers are understood to have ruled out a levy on gas boilers.The government has also announced it will introduce a framework for how levies should be applied in the future, with industry sources lobbying heavily for a shift away from piling costs on bills, moving them on to general taxation instead.Jack Richardson, the head of policy at OctopusEnergy, said: “The autumn budget delivered the biggest push in 20 years to cut regressive energy taxes that hold back net zero. These cuts will help the fuel poorest most. But there is still more to do, starting with the new levy control framework committed to in the budget.”Craig Lowrey, Cornwall Insight’s principal consultant, said the budget measures to reduce bills were “a step towards the government’s £300 reduction target by 2030, and will ease some pressure on both families and policymakers”. But, he added, the government still had a politically tricky course ahead.“We need to be clear – costs aren’t vanishing, they’re shifting. Moving the renewables obligation from bills to taxation may feel like a win, but ultimately, it’s still going to be paid by the public,” he said.“The transition to net zero isn’t cheap, but it’s the only route to genuinely lower bills in the long term.”The price cap, which is updated quarterly, is also affected by wholesale gas prices and other policies. Cornwall Insight said that households would benefit from slightly lower prices after US gas producers increased supplies in recent weeks, and gas usage in Europe was lower than expected thanks to a milder winter.The price cap remains well above where it was before 2022, whenRussia’s full-scale of Ukraine prompted a global energy crisis. Optimism thatsome form of peace deal may be approachingmay also have helped to temper wholesale gas prices, Cornwall said.Changes to grid cost forecasts also helped to lower the cap. The price cap does not apply to Northern Ireland.Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsConsumer affairsHousehold billsRachel ReevesOfgemEnergy efficiencyEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Australian billionaire Gina Rinehart saw her net worth nearly triple from $12.6bn to $37.7bn through her rare -earth metals portfolio.A handful of billionaires experienced declines in their net worth, including Philippine billionaire Manuel Villar, who lost $12.6bn.Villar’s net worth dropped to $10bn after shares of his property development firm, Golden MV Holdings Inc, dropped by 80% at the end of a six-month trading suspension for the firm.According toOxFam, a global confederation of non-government organizations, the $2.2tn growth in net worth for the world’s wealthiest 500 individuals would have been enough to lift 3.8 billion people out of poverty.“Inequality is a deliberate policy choice.

He told the Guardian he had “never seen anything comparable on a UK-established domestic broadcaster”.Ofcom officials have spent the last few weeks examining at least three detailed complaints co-signed by tens of thousands of people, but have not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation. The regulator is facing increasing accusations that it is reluctant to intervene over politically difficult issues of impartiality.The complaints point to rules stating broadcasters must not “materially mislead the audience” and rules around due impartiality.Acomplaint from Bob Ward, from the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, focused on Trump’s claims about human-induced climate change. Trump stated: “The whole thing is a hoax … but your country is one of the worst.”Trump also made disputed claims about the red tape and taxes related to drilling in the North Sea, as well as stating that wind power was “the most expensive energy you can get”. This is contradicted byrecent research.GB News urged to cut ties with contributor accused of racismRead moreWard said: “The GB News interview with President Trump was the most blatant example of a British media organisation collaborating with the Trump administration to undermine British democracy with this misinformation.”Complaints have also been made about Trump’s claim that London has areas “where the police don’t even want to go” and that “you have sharia law where they don’t even want to obey the laws of … your country”.There was no challenge from the comments from Turner. When Trump said people are “being stabbed in the ass or worse”, she stated: “It’s true … It’s awful, it is. And it feels much safer [in the US].”A complaint over a lack of impartiality from the 38 Degrees campaign group pointed to Turner “praising and endorsing Trump multiple times”. During the interview, she described a speech by Trump as “one of the greatest moments at the UN” and that she “loved it, it was brilliant”.GB News declined to comment on the complaints.GB News is emerging as aregular platform for Trump administration figuresto raise chosen talking points. Trump’s White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, hasrepeatedly promoted the broadcaster.Banatvala, who was Ofcom’s founding director of standards, said the regulator was under “intense pressure to act”.He said: “This case poses a real challenge for the regulator – not least because of the considerable leeway it has already given GB News and because it involves an interview with a sitting US president.“While this style of interview – with no challenge and a presenter effectively feeding lines – may be the norm for Newsmax and Fox News, I’ve never seen anything comparable on a UK-established domestic broadcaster. There is no doubt this programme warrants investigation for potential breaches of the due impartiality and misleading rules.“If Ofcom chooses not to investigate, it would effectively signal that the regulator has abandoned impartiality and broadcasters no longer need to comply with these rules.”An Ofcom spokesperson said: “We are assessing the complaints against our rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.”Explore more on these topicsGB NewsOfcomRegulatorsDonald TrumpTelevision industryUS televisionTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

He recalled how the snowplows would push enormous piles off the parking lot of his elementary school to create the perfect berms for kids to play on. He can still conjure the satisfying crunch of how it sounded under his boots and the thrill of the chill each year that made warmth feel earned.View image in fullscreenThe sun shines over the Space Needle during a record-breaking heatwave in Seattle in 2021.Photograph: Ted S Warren/APNow he’s a father of four, andhis kids haven’t felt the same magic. Temperatures have been steadily rising across the region, withaverages expected to climb up to 6F annually by midcentury. Scientists have warned that precipitation will increasingly fall as rain rather than snow.“My children have no memories of the winter I grew up with,” Breneman says. “The shift to a true two-season climate the past 20 years has been swift and stark.”He has taken his kids, who now range from their teens to their 20s, places where they can sled, but the enjoyment and life in the moments he associated with winter “is hard to impart”, he says.“There’s a part of the world you can tell them about,” Breneman says. “But it is like the old guy next to the campfire telling us about the lights that used to be in the skies.”The Appalachian trial hiker: ‘There wasn’t any water at all’Maria Martin looked down at the cracked earth with dismay. This was the second dried stream she’d come across on a five-mile stretch of the Appalachian trail, the popular hiking route that stretches across thousands of miles and 14 states that hug the US east coast, where she spent the summer.View image in fullscreenAn overlook near Great Smoky Mountains national park along the Appalachian trail.Photograph: kyletperry/Getty Images/iStockphotoMartin grew up traipsing through the backcountry in the mid-Atlantic, where she says water is typically abundant even in the warmer months. “It is famously very humid and wet,” she says. The concerning conditions stood in sharp contrast to a lifetime of memories of camping in the summers there with her family, filled with sporadic downpours and swimming holes.But on a hot morning last August, “there wasn’t any water at all. It wasn’t even mud – it was just dirt”, she says, recounting how she had to search the woods for a place to fill her empty canisters. “I heard the same thing from hikers heading north or south,” she adds. “There was one section of the trail that had a nearly 30-mile gap between viable natural water sources.”Depleted water sources and spiking temperatures aren’t the only climate extremes that have hindered those attempting the renowned through-hike. Parts of the region arestill in recovery from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, a category 4 storm that struck the south-eastern US in September 2024. Last spring, strong storms pummeled the landscapes and flooded low-laying areas, Martin says, leaving behind the perfect habitat to help mosquitoes thrive. Hordes of the bloodsucking buzzers descended on campers for the rest of the summer, she says, sending them scurrying into tents even before the sun set.But by that August morning, pools of water were exceedingly sparse. In the span of a few months working for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, Martin experienced the extremes flipping from wet to dry.Lashed by the heat and unsure that there would be other options to hydrate, she decided to double back to an area where she’d spotted an outflow from a nearby beaver pond. It wasn’t an ideal source: The water was tinged with orange and smelled like rotting plants. She filtered it twice.These sharp seasonal shifts are adding urgency to questions about overuse and recreation management in increasingly natural areas. They are also creating new safety issues even for those with much outdoor recreation experience. Water scarcity is a challenge that can turn dangerous quickly for hikers and campers in any environment.“I can handle it being hot,” Martin says. “But when you can’t get water, that’s something else completely.”The gardener whose growing season is shrinking: ‘The plants dry up and die’For the second year in a row, Ky Gress wasn’t able to grow a single squash. A lush home garden fills Gress’s front yard in Sacramento,California, the result of more than a decade of dedication. “Nothing tastes better than perfectly fresh food,” Gress says, adding that she doesn’t use pesticides on her plants and that’s made all the difference.But the seasons in her community are shifting. With them, the windows to grow things that once sprung to life in the warm, dry northern California enclave are narrowing.“We can’t plant in the fall like we used to,” Gress says. “The plants dry up and die.” Sometimes it’s the heat that singes her plants past the point of production. Others, an ill-timed hard freeze limits their potential. Lately, she’s noticed that pollinators are visiting less often, even with the scores of plants meant to entice them that line the perimeter of her garden.To produce the bounty she once enjoyed takes a lot more work and delicate adjustments in timing. She attunes her attention more closely to changing conditions, constantly monitoring soil moisture and sharp spikes or drops in temperature. There’s always a learning curve. Two years ago, her plums were lost to a freeze. Her root vegetables had to be pushed back after summer weather lingered longer. The planting season is growing shorter. “I have had to abandon some plants,” she says.View image in fullscreenAvocados are now easier to grow in Sacramento due to the changing climate.Photograph: Panoramic Images/Getty ImagesThe area where Gress lives was already hot and dry; now bouts of extreme heat and longer periods without moisture have put pressure on plants. The relief once offered overnight, when warmth tends to soften, is disappearing – lows aren’t as cool as they once were.To expand her garden in changing conditions, Gress has ventured into new varietals, including seeds that are common in northern Africa – cow peas and broad beans, which are drought-tolerant legumes that love warm climates and have thrived in her yard.“We couldn’t grow avocados in Sacramento – now people have 20ft trees,” she says.As the conditions shift, it’s become more challenging to produce what she once did. But she’s leaned into the change, adapting to make the most of what otherwise might be a worrying sign. Even when it’s harder, it is always worth it.“This is what we need, for kids to know the wonder of the garden,” she says.The wildlife enthusiast mourning the loss of biodiversity: ‘Every year there are less butterflies’Tim Goncharoff has always loved wildlife. “From deer to birds to the smallest creepy-crawlies,” he says.Starting when he was a very little boy, Goncharoff would venture into the world to marvel at the butterflies and the birds, all the growing things and the bugs on the ground. “I thought they were all wondrous miracles and I couldn’t get enough of it,” he says.Over his 70 years, he’s witnessed the brilliant abundance of life in the world around him grow quieter.“I think a lot of this is about the arc of a long life,” he says, “but I have noticed year by year, that there aren’t so many butterflies. There aren’t so many birds. The variety of species has diminished.”Roughly 1 million species are threatened with extinction, according to a 2019 assessment from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform onBiodiversityand Ecosystem Services, including roughly 40% of amphibians and a third of reef-forming corals, marine mammals and sharks.View image in fullscreenA monarch butterfly in Vista, California. The species has seen a massive decline from the millions of monarchs that once clustered in the state.Photograph: Gregory Bull/APInsects – considered the bedrock to biodiversity and the foundation of most ecosystems on earth – are in rapid decline. About 80% of insect species have yet to be identified and some are disappearing before they can be named.The Smith’s blue butterfly, which once flourished along the California coast where Goncharoff spent much of his life, has been listed as endangered.Goncharoff dedicated his years fighting to protect things that were endangered, working as an environmental planner for the city of Santa Cruz, and he says there was always a sense that they were losing ground despite the effort. He hasn’t quit, even though he’s now mostly retired.He loves to spend afternoons near his home on the Suisun marsh, where the fresh rushing waters of the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta that flood into the salty San Francisco Bay provide habitat for scores of creatures that live on shores and sea.“I love to go down and watch the migrating herons and egrets and cranes and ducks and geese – it’s just marvelous,” he says. But even along the largest marsh remaining on the west coast, there have been severe declines. “There are times you’d expect to see them and they just aren’t there.”The animals and plants that he marveled at throughout the years are fading, he says. Goncharoff hasn’t seen a bluebird in years. There are far fewer butterflies.“I do feel a sense of loss and a feeling of mourning,” Goncharoff says. “But I am determined not to get caught up in that.”For Goncharoff, the change he’s seen among the landscapes he loves is a call to action.“There is a lot of damage baked into the system now, but we still have a chance to limit that,” he says. “There’s a lot of good work to be done to keep things from getting worse.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsClimate crisisBiodiversityExtreme heatHurricane HeleneHurricanesExtreme weatherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s what gives me hopeNina LakhaniI’ve spent six years writing about environmental justice. The uncomfortable truth is that we’re not all in it together – but people power is reshaping the fightWed 31 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 09.07 ESTShareIt’s been another year of climate chaos and inadequate political action. And it’s hard not to feel despondent and powerless.I joined the Guardian full time in 2019, as the paper’s first environmental justice correspondent, and have reported from across the US and the region over the past six years. It’s been painful to see so many families – and entire communities – devastated by fires, floods, extreme heat, sea level rise and food shortages. But what’s given me hope during these six years of reporting as both an environmental and climate justice reporter are the people fighting to save our planet from catastrophe – in their communities, on the streets and in courtrooms across the world.I have always tried to use a justice and equity lens in my journalism on the causes, impacts and solutions relating to the climate crisis. For me, that has meant telling the stories of people who are often ignored or sidelined despite their lived experience and expertise – especially Indigenous people, protesters, activists and local communities fighting back. I have also tried to examine how the climate crisis intersects with – and often exacerbates – other forms of inequity, such as economic inequality, racism, misogyny, land struggles and unequal access to housing and healthcare. The uncomfortable truth is that we are notall in this together. We didn’t all contribute to the climate crisis equally, we’re not all feeling its impacts equally and we don’t all have equal access to resources that might help us cope with or even solve it.In my final piece for the Guardian, I salute the grassroots organizers, scientists, health workers,Indigenous peoples, students and youth activists, peasant farmers, human rights experts and journalists taking on governments and corporations. The climate justice movement scored major victories in 2025, and it has shown us that ordinary people power can – and is – dismantling the status quo.People power is reshaping the climate fight“While the majority of states and businesses try to continue doing business as usual, we’re starting to see cracks in that inertia as the power of the people has helped to give light to what is not working – and identify the actual actions that we need,” said Astrid Puentes Riaño, the UN special rapporteur on the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.Despite the UN climate negotiations in Belém failing to agree, yet again, to phase out fossil fuels, Cop30 did establish the first-ever just transition mechanism (JTM), a plan to ensure that the move to a green-energy economy is fair and inclusive and protects the rights of all people, including workers, frontline communities, women and Indigenous people.View image in fullscreenActivists perform the death of fossil fuels at Cop30 in Belém, Brazil, on 15 November.Photograph: Pablo Porciúncula/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile far from perfect, the JTM was agreed only after years of civil society organising, including impossible-to-ignore protests during Cop30. The mechanism represents an important step in putting people at the centre of climate policy after decades of technocratic fixes, according to Puentes.There were also encouraging signs that a growing number of states – from the global south and north – have had enough of the inertia and obstructionism blocking meaningful action, and are prepared to stand with affected communities and go their own way.Colombia and the Netherlands, backed by 22 nations, will independently develop a roadmap to fossil fuel phaseout, beginning witha conference in April 2026in the coal port city of Santa Marta, Colombia. The plan is for states, cities, affected communities and health, science, human rights and other experts to share experiences and best practices, and implement policy ideas outside the snail-paced, consensus-based Cop process.This parallel fossil-fuel roadmap initiative could establish regional solutionsand a trading bloc with the power to sanction nations– and financial institutions – that continue to support fossil fuels.Elisa Morgera, the UN special rapporteur on climate change and human rights, said the new alliance could be the gamechanger. “We now have a sizeable group of states from all regions who want to engage in good faith and make progress on phasing out fossil fuels and cannot wait any longer for the Cop process,” she said.“It is so important for people around the world to see that there is political will and political power to advance this, and to see what it looks like, as there is a big gap in imagination. We’ve been so bombarded by climate disinformation from fossil fuel companies that it is hard to imagine what our life would be like without them, but there are examples of cities, towns and communities doing it.”View image in fullscreenAn Indigenous group blocks an entrance to Cop30, on 14 November in Belém.Photograph: André Penner/APBoth Colombia and the Netherlands were pushed hard by ordinary people to do the right thing.In 2023, Colombia, a major fossil fuel producer with fierce, well-organized climate and social justice movements, signed on to the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty that now includes 18 countries, 140 cities and subnational governments, the World Health Organization, more than 4,000 civil society organisations and more than 3,000 scientists and academics.It was this civil society-led initiative that first created a blueprint to halt new fossil fuel projects and manage an equitable phaseout of coal, oil and gas.“Many political leaders are captured by fossil fuel interests or lack the courage to challenge them, while developing countries are held back by the rich world’s failure to deliver finance and technology anywhere near a fair share,” said Harjeet Singh, a veteran climate activist and strategic adviser to the non-proliferation treaty. “That’s why movements are indispensable watchdogs – naming the polluters, exposing greenwashing and demanding the funds, timelines and protections workers and communities need to transition with rights and dignity.”And change can be contagious. After mounting protests and litigation by Indigenous communities and environmental groups over Brazil’s expansion of oil and gas projects in the Amazon, Cop30 president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced the first step toward a national fossil fuel phaseout roadmap. Still, head-spinning contradictory policies are all too common among states lauded as climate leaders – and Brazil also recently passed the so-called “devastation bill”, which critics warn will accelerate deforestation in the Amazon.Courts are becoming a frontline for climate justiceFailure to transition away from fossil fuels is a violation of international law, according to an international court of justice (ICJ) ruling in July 2025, alongside multiple other international courts and tribunals.The ICJ advisory opinion, which was initiated by Pacific Island law students, confirmed what communities had argued in courts around the world for a decade. Governments have a whole host of legal duties arising as a result of the climate crisis, including phasing out fossil fuels and regulating polluting corporations.The landmark ruling by the highest court in the world can be traced back to a 2015 lawsuit when the Netherlands became the first state ordered to take stronger climate action, in a case brought by 900 Dutch citizens and the Urgenda Foundation, an environmental group.View image in fullscreenSolomon Islands youth climate activist Cynthia Houniuhi speaks during public hearings of the UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) on defining countries’ legal obligations to fight climate change, in the Hague, Netherlands, in 2024.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/Reuters“In just 10 years, climate litigation has evolved from a handful of complaints before domestic courts to a global accountability system recognised by the highest international courts and tribunals,” said Dennis Van Berkel, legal counsel at the Urgenda Foundation,in a recent report by the Climate Litigation Network. “That transformation was built case by case, country by country. Some judgments failed, but each contributed – refining arguments, strengthening alliances, raising public awareness and laying the groundwork for those that followed.”A recent judgment in South Africa halted a major internationally funded offshore gas and oil project opposed by coastal communities and environmental groups. The government has paused all other new oil and gas proposals, pending an appeal.“Access to justice and litigation is the most peaceful way to advance and help states and businesses to correct mistakes, make the right decision and advance climate action. It’s not that litigation solves everything, but it’s a very important piece in order to advance the systemic changes that we need,” Puentes of the UN said.Indigenous knowledge points the way forwardFor thousands of years, Indigenous peoples have lived in respectful harmony with the planet – using, not exploiting, natural resources from our forests, seas, rivers and land. In addition to this vast ancient knowledge, we have 21st-century tools and technologies, and innovative grassroots and regional solutions that together should be the heart of global efforts to tackle the climate crisis.Next year, like every year, it will fall on ordinary people to harness their immense power through the courts, protests, multilateral spaces and the ballot box to ensure climate-impacted communities and human rights become the centre of negotiations and climate action.“If we wait for Cop31 to save us, we have already surrendered,” said Raj Patel, a research professor at the University of Texas and author of Stuffed and Starved: The Hidden Battle for the World Food System.“The test is not whether diplomats can craft better language in Antalya [in Turkey] next year, but whether farmers’ movements, Indigenous movements and climate movements can generate enough political pressure to make governments fear inaction more than they fear confronting corporate power.”Nina Lakhani is a climate justice reporter for the Guardian USExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentClimate crisisProtest (US)ActivismLaw (US)Indigenous peoplesUnited NationscommentShareReuse this content"

In the distance, you can see the outlines of the reactor buildings at theFukushima Daiichinuclear power plant, which is in the slow process of being decommissioned at a cost so far of $35bn (£26bn) almost 15 years since it suffered a triple meltdown after being struck by amagnitude-9.0 earthquake and a 15m (49ft) tsunami. Another nuclear plant further south stands idle.But the 46 turbines that make up the sprawling Abukuma windfarm – the biggest onshore windfarm in Japan – could offer hope for a different future for the region’s energy supply. Built at a cost of ¥67bn (£310m), the facility went into full operation in April this year, weeks after Japan’s government previewed its strategic energy plan as it aims to achievenet zeroby 2050.The planhas been controversialwith campaigners because it ditches attempts to reduce Japan’s reliance on nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster, calling instead for a “maximisation” of nuclear power, which will account for about 20% of total energy output in 2040: about 14 reactors have been restarted and the assumption is that 30 will be in full operation by then.View image in fullscreenThe Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which is in the process of being decommissioned at a cost so far of £26bn almost 15 years since it suffered a triple meltdown.Photograph: Kyodo/ReutersThe post-Fukushima nuclear closures of dozens of reactors forced the country to rely heavily on imported fossil fuels: last year it was the world’s second-largest importer of liquefied fossil gas after China, and the third-largest importer of coal by volume. But the government’s energy plan envisages a share of between 40% and 50% for renewable energy – compared with just under a third in 2023 – and a reduction in coal-fired power from the current 63% to 30-40%.Fukushima plans to become a leader in renewable energy – a shift that would have elicited derision before tsunami waves roared ashore on the afternoon of 11 March 2011, crippling the Daiichi plant’s backup power supply and triggering the world’sworst nuclear accident since Chornobyla quarter of a century earlier. In its Renewable Energy Promotion Vision, the prefecture, home to 1.7 million people, aims to achieve 100% renewables by 2040, with a midterm target of 70% by 2030.“Everyone in the prefecture is determined to reach the target,” said Takayuki Hirano of Fukushima Fukko Furyoku (Fukushima Wind Power Recovery), a joint venture funded by nine companies and led by Sumitomo Corporation. “That’s why there are so many subsidies available for solar, wind and other renewables. I think we’re going to make it happen.“People have negative memories of nuclear power and Fukushima, and they’re still wrestling with that burden.” The wrecked atomic plant generated power for business, industry and homes in Tokyo, 150 miles to the south. Fifteen years on, some of the 160,000 people who were evacuated havereturned homeafter atmospheric radiation levels were declared safe; but levels in other communities are still too high for people to go back permanently.View image in fullscreenWind turbines generate electricity on the Nunobiki highlands at Koriyama city in Fukushima prefecture, northern Japan.Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty ImagesBy contrast, a portion of the power produced by Abukuma’s turbines is consumed locally, including by a mackerel aquaculture project and a town hall, via feed in premiums, under which electricity is sold on the wholesale power market or directly to individual consumers. “It is about local production for local consumption,” Hirano said.As the world’s fifth biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, Japan has had some success in reducing its carbon footprint. Emissions fell by 4% to a record low in the year to the end of March 2024, led by lower energy consumption as well as the increased use of renewable energy and the restart ofnuclear powerplants. It aims to reduce emissions by 46% from 2013 levels by 2030.View image in fullscreenSmoke billows from a plant in Tokyo bay. Japan is the world’s fifth biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.Photograph: Franck Robichon/EPABut the widespread post-Fukushima shutdown of Japan’s nuclear reactors – and thepolitically fraught processof restarting them – have made the country more fossil-fuel friendly than other comparable economies. AtCop30, Japan again received the Fossil of the Day award from the Climate Action Network, a global network of NGOs, for its slow progress in decarbonising. As Japan complained that it had been unfairly singled out while bigger CO2emitters, notably China, had been overlooked, the network said it had selected the country for its promotion of carbon capture and storage, which it claimed were measures “dressed up as solutions”.As the summit neared its end, Japan’s environment minister, Hirotaka Ishihara, drew condemnation from campaigners after he indicated that Tokyo would not sign up to Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s proposed roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels, putting it at odds with about 80 other countries attending the summit in Belem.Ishihara “has sent the wrong signal by refusing to support global efforts to accelerate a just transition from fossil energy to 100% renewables in order to achieve the Paris Agreement’s 1.5C goal”, said Masayoshi Iyoda, a campaigner at 350.org, an environmental group campaigning for a global transition from fossil fuels to renewables.Japan’s new prime minister,Sanae Takaichi, “must realise that energy efficiency and renewable energy represent the fastest path toward 100% energy self-sufficiency”, Iyoda added. “Supporting the fossil fuel phaseout roadmap will not jeopardise, but advance, Japan’s interests by paving the way to a resilient and sustainable economy.”Hirano said the Abukuma venture was “our way of helping Fukushima recover so that one day people around the world will automatically associate it with renewable energy and not nuclear power”.But geothermal energy will play a role too. Further inland, Tomio Sakuma, the renewableenergyarea manager for Genki Up Tsuchiyu, the company that operates the geothermal plant, opens a valve to unleash a fierce spray of steam whose origins lie deep below ground. Here, in the hot spring resort of Tsuchiyu Onsen, local authorities are drawing on Japan’s geological characteristics to rewrite Fukushima’s energy story.It is hard to think of a better location. In most of Japan’s 3,000-plusonsen, or hot spring resorts, businesses must dig individual wells to secure a supply of hot water. Here, however, the town’s economic life force comes from a single source, making it easier for the plant to harness subterranean steam to drive a turbine, before it is combined with cold mountain water to make it suitable for bathing.View image in fullscreenGeothermal energy is expected to play a role in the country’s net zero ambitions.Photograph: Porames Rojanatreekoon/AlamySakuma said: “The good thing about this project is that we don’t recycle water and send it on to the bath houses and inns as an afterthought. It’s a more natural, linear process.” The town hosts a stream of people from other onsen towns hoping to emulate their success, he added.The plant would not be out of place in a steampunk novel – a cluster of pipes, tubes, gauges, and valves that together generate 440kW of electricity; enough to power about 800 homes and provide water for a nearby aquaculture facility. Earnings fromfeed-in tariffsales are then used to fund Tsuchiyu Onsen’s continuing recovery from the 2011 earthquake and build new ryokan inns to accommodate visitors, including a growing number of foreign tourists.Fukushima, meanwhile, is on course to reach its goal. Renewables, led by solar panel facilities that cover areas once occupied by families displaced by the triple meltdown, account for almost 60% of the prefecture’s power generation, compared with just 23% at the time of the 2011 disaster.Takayuki Kato, the chief executive of Genki Up Tsuchiyu, said: “We are an important part of Fukushima’s 100%renewable energytarget.” Tsuchiyu’s own deadline was five years earlier than the prefectural government’s, he added. “If we don’t set and then reach an ambitious target, we can hardly claim to be a symbol of Fukushima’s energy transformation.”This article was amended on 31 December 2025. An earlier version said Japan’s climate plans were rated “critically insufficient” by Climate Action Tracker; this should have said “insufficient”.Explore more on these topicsFukushimaThe big emittersJapanRenewable energyNuclear powerAsia PacificEnergyJapan disasterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So people are recognising it earlier and trying to say: ‘Right, OK, hold on, this is more than just childhood stuff.’”‘My child would use anything as a weapon’: the parents who live in fear of their offspringRead moreGriffiths said an increase in child poverty in the UK and a perceived failure of parents to live up to expectations could be factors behind the increase in recorded violence.She said: “More and more families are struggling to meet expectations, maybe of children and what peers are getting.“People are finding it really hard and struggling. When you struggle externally, you struggle within the systems of your family, relationships start to suffer.”A study by academics at the universities of Oxford and Manchester in 2020 examined the impact of the Covid pandemic on filial abuse.One parent whose testimony was included in the study said her son “beat me so badly that if the police did not come when they did, I would not be alive”.Explanations for an apparent surge in violence varied from the change in structures and routines to the pressures brought about by home schooling and the loss of external help during lockdowns.Helen Bonnick, the author of Child to Parent Violence and Abuse: A Practitioner’s Guide to Working with Families, said she hoped the new figures were a sign that the stigma about reporting such abuse was fading.She said: “Some will argue that changes in society and stresses, eg pandemic, led to an increase, but it is difficult to state categorically because of all the other things that happened to provide context.“Since 2010 the increase in knowledge and understanding has been massive – 15 years ago hardly any one was talking about it publicly and we had no sense of data.”Bonnick said there had been “research across the world but [there had been’] a very big focus in Britain” and that a new “understanding of trauma and neurodiversity, for instance, has altered the way we understand what is happening in families”.She added: “[An] increase in bespoke services available means more people encouraged to reach out for help. Less shame attached perhaps?“Cuts to services such as adolescent mental health and children’s services [also] led to a drop in early help and support which might have helped keep things safer for some families.”Child-to-parent violence is considered by experts in the field to be the most hidden and stigmatised form of family violence, with the recorded numbers likely to only hint at the true scale of the problem.Studies suggest that abuse towards parents can begin from an early age but typically peaks between the ages of 14 and 16.There is a lack of firm research on its prevalence although such filial violence is internationally regarded as a growing problem.A storyline about this issue featured in EastEndersin 2024 as the character Kat Slater struggled with the increasingly violent behaviour of her teenage son Tommy.A report published in 2021 by the domestic abuse commissioner highlighted studies in the US, Canada, UK and Spain that indicated more serious physical violence towards parents was “likely to sit somewhere between 3% and 5% [of families] with multidimensional definitions including patterned physical and psychological aggression sitting around 10%”.Violence cited ranged from punching, kicking, pulling hair, pushing, throwing or pinning, trapping, biting, throwing or hitting with objects to strangling, using weapons such as knives, the use of poison/gas, and burning/scalding.Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleParents and parentingChildrenPoliceCrimeFamilyDomestic violencenewsShareReuse this content"

But until now the coat of arms of the late Queen Elizabeth had remained on the cover.The new version boasts advanced anti-forgery features including holographs and translucent pages making passports easier to verify but harder to forge or alter. TheHome Officesaid on Wednesday that 300 were already in circulation.View image in fullscreenThe new passport is the first to feature the coat of arms of King Charles.Photograph: Home Office/PAMike Tapp, the migration and citizenship minister, said: “I’m proud to see our new British passports in circulation. Featuring His Majesty’s coat of arms and landscapes from all four nations, they celebrate our heritage while delivering enhanced security.“They are also the most secure British passports ever produced, helping us protect our borders and deliver outstanding public service.”The first modern British passport was produced in 1915 and the first security measure of a watermark was not added until 1972. Since then “dozens” of extra security features have been added, including complex patterns hard to copy and some details visible only in UV light.The Home Office said existing passports with the late queen’s coat of arms remained valid until their expiry date.Banknotes featuring Charlesfirst came into circulation in June 2024.The replacement of the late queen’s portrait with that of the king’s was the only change to the existing designs of all four UK banknotes – the £5, £10, £20 and £50. The other design and security features of the notes remain the same. The first set of stamps to featureCharles’s silhouette were issued in March 2023.Explore more on these topicsPassport OfficeHome OfficeKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

And they must be from above smiling down on you and thinking, my goodness me, what a wonderful, wonderful father, husband, sister.”Interviewed by Emma Barnett, Hunt said he and his daughter “have travelled such a long way since 9 July 2024, the day the girls were murdered” and wanted to highlight the issue of domestic abuse and violence against women and girls.Hunt said that, more than one year on, “it remains very difficult on a minute-by-minute basis. You have to try and find the strength in our position to arm yourself with as many tools as possible that can help you get through that next hour, get through that next day. We’ve been blessed with sufficient brain power to work our way through that quagmire and we have found solutions that have got us this far.“I’m staggered that we are as well as we are at this particular moment in time. There’s still a lot more work to do.”With the support of Amy, her fiance and Hannah’s boyfriend, he said, “you gain wisdom and confidence that, all right it’s not the future you wanted, but there is a small fragment of future that exists still for you”.Amy, 32, said what had become obvious was “domestic violence and domestic abuse stretches across classes, ages, locations”. She added: “There’s a huge part of us that’s still in disbelief in shock. Perhaps we will be in that state for the rest of our lives given the magnitude of our loss.”Though they missed them “every single minute of the day” they were sustained by the “care, the joy, the positivity and the humour” her sisters and mothers had given to the world.Misogyny and the radicalisation of young men online was a huge problem, she said, which “largely goes unchecked” with tech companies allowing it “to run rampant” on social media. Her father said having “this very dark world open up to me in the starkest possible fashion has been jarring. It’s something I’ve had to navigate very quickly and I’ve had to educate myself as well.”His wife and daughters were murdered by Clifford after Louise ended her relationship with him. The family had been at pains to be welcoming to Clifford during the 18-month relationship, he said. “When things turn so disastrously against you … and I’m still wrestling with it now … it’s such a demanding thing to try and work out how on earth we ever got here.”The queen praised their courage in speaking out “in these very difficult circumstances”. Talking could be “cathartic”, she said. “The more you can talk about it the more you can try and get rid of these terrible demons and terrible memory of what happened to you.”Of her own work highlighting domestic violence, she said the “majority of people actually don’t want to know. It’s been a taboo subject for so long.”She added: “I thought if I’ve got a tiny soap box to stand on I’d like to stand on it.” Some perpetrators may have suffered abuse themselves, she said. “If you can get them early enough and teach the respect for women, I think that’s so important to get into schools.”Lady May said it was a “sad fact” that a young boy going online, say for health or fitness, “it’s not that many clicks away before you’re taken to some really dark and dangerous material” and that algorithms ensured “you start living in an echo chamber”. She added: “You can legislate as much as you like, but at the end of the day it’s about attitudes and it’s about mindsets.”A fundraising gala was held this month to launch the Hunt Family Fund, set up in memory of Carol, Louise and Hannah to raise money for charities and causes that help and inspire young women.Explore more on these topicsQueen CamillaViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

The review is expected to take until at least 20 January, more than a month beyond the congressionally ordered 19 December release deadline.Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche saidin an Epstein files release update posted on XWednesday that “DOJ lawyers from Main Justice, FBI, SDFL, and SDNY are working around the clock through the holidays, including Christmas and New Years, to review documents in compliance with federal law”.Blanche added: “It truly is an all-hands-on-deck approach and we’re asking as many lawyers as possible to commit their time to review the documents that remain. Required redactions to protect victims take time but they will not stop these materials from being released. The Attorney General’s and this Administration’s goal is simple: transparency and protecting victims.”New York senator Chuck Schumerresponded to the Times’s estimates on X, saying ​they showed that attorney general Pam Bondi, Blanche, and “others at the DOJ have been lying to the American people about the Epstein files since day one. The less than 40,000 pages that have been released represent less than 0.01% of all the total documents. They are hiding something.”Last week, the justice department said it had been told by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the FBI that they had uncovered more than a million more documents, and that processing these for release could take“a few more weeks”.In a post on Xfrom Christmas Eve, the justice department said it had received the documents from the US attorney for the southern district of New York and the FBI in “compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, existing statutes, and judicial orders”.“We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks. The Department will continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump’s direction to release the files,” the post said.The department said it had called on additional justice department lawyers to work over the Christmas break to help a team of 200 departmental analysts from the national security division already assigned to review the documents.The documents released so far have shown that the FBI was alerted to Epstein’s activities involving minors at least a decade earlier than previously known. There have also been some false leads, including a fake letter from Epstein to the convicted sex abuser and former Olympic gymnastics coach Larry Nassar, and a fake video of Epstein killing himself in his jail cell.An image of a desk with an open drawer containing other photos, including at least one of Donald Trump, was removed from the justice department’s disclosures website and later restored, apparently after prosecutors alerted that Epstein victims could be exposed.“There has been lots of sensationalism and even outright lies these past few days about the ‘Epstein Files’,” Blanchesaid in a statement on X. “But let’s separate fact from fiction. Document production is just that. We produce documents, and sometimes this can result in releasing fake or false documents because they simply are in our possession because the law requires this.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationUS crimeUS politicsShareReuse this content"

We do extensive vetting ourselves. It would be disastrous for us to have any armed combatants or people linked to armed groups among our staff,” said Athena Rayburn, executive director of the Association of International Development Agencies, which represents more than 100 NGOs operating inGazaand the occupied West Bank.“We have such strong measures in place already and have proposed alternatives to the Israeli authorities that would meet this requirement, and they have refused.”Israeli officials said that the NGOs hit by the ban only supplied 15% of the desperately needed assistance in Gaza, which is suffering an acute humanitarian crisis after two years of devastating war.Aid officials said this calculation was misleading because most of the NGOs affected by the ban did not deliver their own services but were contracted by the UN to run basic health clinics, malnutrition screening, hygiene and shelter support and much else.One senior UN official said the ban would “cripple” relief operations. Israeli laws banning Unrwa, the main UN agency dealing with Palestinians, from Gaza had already had a significant impact, they added.Rayburn said the ban would bring about a “catastrophic collapse of humanitarian services”, and that Israel authorities had been made “fully aware” of potential consequences.Under the 20-point agreement that allowed a fragile ceasefire to come into effect in October, Israel is obliged to allow “full aid” to be “immediately sent into Gaza”.The ceasefire ended two years of relentless conflict, but further progress towards a lasting peace deal has stalled, with Israel saying it will not withdraw from the 53% of Gaza territory that is still under its control until Hamas disarms and returns the remains of the last hostage it is holding. The Islamist militant organisation has so far refused to commit to full disarmament.Speaking on Monday,Donald Trump said he hoped “reconstruction” could begin soon in the Palestinian territory, reduced to ruins by Israeli offensives in response to Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attacks, but gave no details.Some aid officials said they would be able to find “workarounds” to mitigate the worst effects of the ban but that urgent assistance was needed in Gaza, where recent storms have destroyed tents that were the only shelter for an estimated 500,000 people, food is expensive and clean water, scarce.On Wednesday, Volker Türk, the UN human rights chief, said in a statement that Israel’s move was “outrageous”, warning that “such arbitrary suspensions make an already intolerable situation even worse for the people of Gaza”.The EUwarned on Wednesdaythat the new NGO registration law that had led to the ban “cannot be implemented in its current form”.But Israeli officials insisted the law was necessary. “They [the NGOs] refuse to provide lists of their Palestinian employees because they know, just as we know, that some of them are involved in terrorism or linked to Hamas,” Gilad Zwick, spokesperson for the ministry of diaspora affairs and combating antisemitism, told AFP.Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the main medical aid organisation, is among those facing a ban.Israeli officials claim individuals affiliated with MSF have links to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. MSF rejects the accusations as unsubstantiated, adding it would never knowingly employ anyone engaged in military activity.Shaina Low, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which has extensive operations in Gaza, said it would be impossible to fulfil the new Israeli requirements.“It is a security concern and a legal concern … and it’s all a distraction from actually getting aid to the people who need it,” she said.In May, aid agency Oxfam said the requirement to share staff details raised protection concerns, after attacks on humanitarian workers in Gaza.Several aid officials reported that during the war in Gaza they had been asked by Israeli military officials to supply details of the whereabouts of their international staff there. Suspecting that the information would be used to allow Israeli strikes on offices where there were only Palestinian staff, the NGO refused.After targeting Unrwa last year, Israel and the US backed the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, a private company that distributed aid from a small number of hubs in southern Gaza amid chaotic conditions that led to the death from Israeli fire of more than 1,000 people.Cogat, the Israeli agency charged with administration of Gaza, said 4,200 aid trucks would continue to enter every week via the UN, donor countries, the private sector, and more than 20 international organisations that have been reregistered.The Hamas raid that triggered the war in Gaza killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to the abduction of 250. The ensuing Israeli offensive killed about 70,000, mostly civilians, with hundreds more killed since the ceasefire.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

But you no longer need to be a multimillionaire to own a Picasso – for €100, anyone in the world has the chance to walk away with a painting by one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.The French charity Alzheimer’s Research Foundation announced recently it was raffling Picasso’s 1941 portrait, Tête de femme, which is worth more than €1m, to a single winner. Proceeds from the tickets will help fund Alzheimer’s research, one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.The project, entitled “1 Picasso for 100 Euros”, is the first of its kind in the world, and a natural continuation of Picasso’s legacy, according to his grandson Olivier Picasso.“My grandfather was very generous, but he was also discreet,” Olivier told the Guardian. “He helped his family, especially my grandmother Marie-Thérèse [Walter]. He helped friends. He helped people in need during the civil war in Spain, during the second world war, and even after, in the 50s and 60s.View image in fullscreenOlivier Picasso, grandson of the artist, poses next to Tête de femme.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/Reuters“So for me, this project is an absolutely logical and legitimate part of his legacy. I hope in the future to be able to do this every year if possible.”The raffle is the brainchild of Péri Cochin, a French television producer and owner of the tableware company Waww La Table. Cochin came up with the idea after seeing her mother use them at fundraising events she hosted.“I thought, wouldn’t it be great to do a worldwide raffle, by selling tickets online? I decided it should be a piece of art, and what is the most famous name in art? Obviously, it’s Picasso,” she said.Cochin contacted Olivier Picasso, a childhood friend of hers. When he and the rest of the Picasso administration and the Picasso estate gave their approval, she reserved the 1941 painting from the Opera gallery, which will receive just under €1m after the draw.“We are used to hearing about Picasso and these high-priced auctions, but this was the first time where Picasso was really related to a charity,” she said.Olivier said the family “had an instant connection with the project”, not least because the money raised is going to a good cause. There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, and no treatment that can stop or reverse its progression. “Now that we are living older than before, we or people around us could be affected by this disease. And I know how difficult and painful it is,” he added.The goal is to sell 120,00 tickets, raising €11m for Alzheimer’s research. The draw is scheduled to take place at Christie’s auction house in Paris on 14 April. If not enough tickets are sold to cover the cost of the painting, all participants will be reimbursed.Olivier said Tête de femme was a “very interesting” work that was painted in the same studio in the Left Bank in Paris as Picasso’s 1937 masterpiece Guernica. “The period was important for my grandfather, because he was at the end of a process to divorce his first wife, Olga Khokhlova – a divorce that never happened because Franco abolished the divorce law [in 1939], despite meeting my grandmother and Dora Maar.“The period was also very complicated because of the occupation of Paris by the Nazis. And so the colours are darker than usual, with brown, black, and grey. While it’s a beautiful depiction of a woman, there is still the ambience of Picasso. My grandfather kept the painting as a souvenir of the moment.”Cochin has organised two previous raffles for Picasso paintings, in 2013 and 2020, raising a total of more than €10m. The first winner was 25-year-old Jeffrey Gonano, who became the owner of a Picasso drawing valued at €860,000. “He put the painting in the Museum of Pittsburg for a while, and now it’s in storage at Christie’s in New York, because he didn’t want to keep it at home,” she said.The second winner was Claudia Borgogno, an accountant from Ventimiglia, Italy, whose son had given her a raffle ticket for Christmas. She became the owner of a 1921 Picasso valued at €1m.“She still has the painting, she said it would change her life. It’s a really beautiful story,” Cochin added.This article’s headline was amended on 31 December 2025. An earlier version said that an auction was taking place instead of a raffle.Explore more on these topicsPablo PicassoFranceCharitiesEuropeAlzheimer'sHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It includes Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube.Le MondeandFrance Inforeported on Wednesday that a draft bill was now complete and contained two measures: a ban on social media for under-15s and a ban on mobile phones in high schools, where 15- to 18-year-olds study. Phones have already beenbanned in primary and middle schools.The bill will be submitted to France’s Conseil d’État for legal review in the coming days. Education unions will also look at the proposed high-school ban on phones.The government wants the social media ban to come into force from September 2026.Le Monde reported the text of the draft bill cited “the risks of excessive screen use by teenagers”, including the dangers of being exposed to inappropriate social media content, online bullying, and altered sleep patterns. The bill states the need to “protect future generations” from dangers that threaten their ability to thrive and live together in a society with shared values.Will other countries follow Australia’s social media ban for under-16s?Read moreEarlier this month, Macron confirmed at a public debate in Saint Malo that he wanted a social media ban for young teenagers. He said there was “consensus being shaped” on the issue after Australia introduced its ban. “The more screen time there is, the more school achievement drops … the more screen time there is, the more mental health problems go up,” he said.He used the analogy of a teenager getting into a Formula One racing car before they had learned to drive. “If a child is in a Formula One car and they turn on the engine, I don’t want them to win the race, I just want them to get out of the car. I want them to learn the highway code first, and to ensure the car works, and to teach them to drive in a different car.”Several other countries are considering social media bans for under-15s after Australia’s ban includingDenmark, whose government hopes tointroduce a ban in 2026, andNorway. Malaysia is also planning a social media ban for under-16s from 2026. In the UK, the Labour government has not ruled out a ban, saying “nothing is off the table” but any ban must be “based on robust evidence”.Anne Le Hénanff, the French minister in charge of digital development and artificial intelligence, toldLe Parisienthis month that the social media ban for under-15s was a government priority, and that the bill would be “short and compatible with European law”, namely the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) – regulation intended to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation.The social media ban is part of Macron’s attempt to shape his legacy as he enters his difficult final year as president with a divided parliament.On 23 December, last-minute legislation was passed to keep the government in business into January after parliament failed to agree a full budget for 2026. Attempts to agree a budget will resume next month.AFrench parliamentary inquiryinto TikTok’s psychological effects concluded in September that the platform was like a “slow poison” to children. The co-head of the inquiry, the centrist lawmaker Laure Miller, told France Info that TikTok was an “ocean of harmful content” that was very visible to children through algorithms that kept them in a bubble. TikTok responded that it was being unfairly scapegoated for “industry-wide and societal challenges”.The French parliament report recommended more broadly that children under 15 inFranceshould be banned entirely from using social media, and those between 15 and 18 should face a night-time “digital curfew”, meaning social media would be made unavailable to them between 10pm and 8am.The inquiry was set up after a 2024 French lawsuit against TikTok by seven families who accused it of exposing their children to content that was pushing them towards ending their lives.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeSocial mediaSocial media banSmartphonesInternet safetyChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

In 2025 its sales of these types of wines soared 4,000% as the nascent category gained ground.As the name implies, “mid-strength” drinks occupy the middle ground between no and low-alcohol (nolo) and standard options. There is no firm industry definition yet, but the beers and ciders are about 2-3% alcohol by volume, wines 3-9% and spirits 15-20%.Extracting hangovers from beer: inside Budweiser owner’s ‘nolo’ brewery in south WalesRead moreThe advent of coasting chimes with data showing Britons drinking less alcohol than before. The average UK adultconsumed 10.2 alcoholic drinks a weekin 2024, according to the latest figures from the drinks industry data company IWSR.This is the lowest figure since data collection began in 1990 and down from a high of 14 weekly drinks two decades ago. However, total abstention is not on the rise despite the decline in consumption, which suggests more cautious drinking habits have driven the trend.Along with other big supermarkets, Ocado is tapping into the country’s changing drinking culture by stocking more mid-strength brands, including La Felicite rosé (9%), Nice Session sauvignon blanc (3.4%) and Quarter Proof gin (15%), alongside nolo options.Ocado and Waitrose reported an increase in shoppers searching their websites for nolo brands before the holidays.Popular searches include Botivo – a British non-alcoholic aperitif in the style of Italian classics such as Campari and Aperol – and Mother Root, a fiery ginger non-alcoholic aperitif. There is also a buzz around Bero, the new beer brand co-founded by the Spider-Man actorTom Holland.Sarah Holland, a Waitrose drinks buyer, said people still want “big flavours” from nolo drinks. “They want more than just gin alternatives–options like Mother Root and Botivo are selling really well.” Sales of alcohol-free cocktails and wines in cans are also “booming”, she said. It recently added Jukes 8’s sparkling rosé and Pentire’s booze-free paloma cocktail to its shelves to meet this demand.To make mid-strength drinking “mainstream” a group of specialist drinks brands, including Club Soda, Quarter Proof, Gentle Wines and Small Beer, has formed the “mid-strength collective”.A poll of drinking habits on its behalf found 21% of consumers are still drinking alcohol but having fewer drinks in total on each occasion. Another 13% “coast” through their evenings, while 6% are“zebra striping”(alternating between alcohol, mid-strength and alcohol-free drinks within the same occasion).The “way consumers engage with alcohol is evolving”, said Blake Gladman, a strategy and insight director at the consultancy Kam,in the report.“While some consumers are opting for alcohol-free alternatives, a growing segment is embracing mid-strength alcohol as the perfect middle ground,” said Gladman, suggesting this was “allowing them to extend their social experiences without compromising on taste, quality and experience”.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryAlcoholChristmasRetail industryHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Her recent albumEverybody Screamwas a strong restatement of her theatrical approach – with more light and shade than you might expect – but it’s on stage that she really comes into her own.UK tour begins6Februaryat the SSE Arena, BelfastDeftonesView image in fullscreenDeftones … musically restless.Photograph: Ryan Bakerink/FilmMagicDeftones’ reputational shift from nu-metal upstarts to avant rock heroes – their fandom swelled by a huge gen Z influx – is fully deserved: they were always more expansive and musically restless than their rap-rock contemporaries, their subsequent development underscored by the fact that their one-time DJ Frank Delgado is now a sort of Brian Eno figure, manipulating the sounds of other members instruments and creating electronic textures. They also still rock, in time-honoured angst-ridden style.UK tour begins 12Februaryat the BP Pulse Live, BirminghamJill Scott – To Whom This May ConcernIt’s been a very long time since neo-soul star Scott released an album: the last was the impressively eclectic Woman, in 2015. Scott has spent the intervening years touring – including a 20th-anniversary celebration of her multi-platinum debut Who is Jill Scott?: Words And Sounds Vol 1 – and concentrating on her acting career, cropping up everywhere from US superhero franchise Black Lightning to comedy series The First Wives’ Club, making her belated return to the studio a very welcome event.Released 13FebruaryCharli xcx – Wuthering HeightsCharli xcx has described her soundtrack to Emerald Fennell’s forthcoming film adaptation of Wuthering Heights as “raw, wild, sexual, gothic and British”. Certainly, the first track released from it, the John Cale collaborationHouse, couldn’t have been more different from the sound of her epochal2024 album Brat– a homage to Cale’s old band the Velvet Underground that also bore the influence of industrial music – and that, one suspects, might be part of the point.Released 13FebruaryRayeUnder the winningly blunt title This Tour May Contain New Music – the posters also promise “at least one jazz cover”, “a brass section”, “live strings” and indeed “potential waffling” – Raye debuts material from her long-awaited second album. The singles she has released over the last couple of years have ranged from the avant and episodic Genesis to collaborations with Central Cee to the straight-up pop smash Where Is My Husband?, so who knows what that might sound like?UK tour begins 17Februaryat Manchester Co-op LiveBill Callahan – My Days of 58The title of US indie mainstay Callahan’s eighth solo album seems to reference his age when he recorded it – there’s certainly a note of concern about getting older in the lyrics of the solitary track released from it thus far, The Man I’m Supposed to Be – with the same band that appeared on his superb 2022 album, Reality. Callahan has called it “a living room record … not too loud, not otherworldly”, which sounds both mysterious and intriguing.Released27FebruaryLily AllenView image in fullscreenLily Allen … eye-popping detail.Photograph: Nicky J Sims/Getty Images for Live NationAs comebacks go, Lily Allen’s return – withWest End Girl, an album that detailed the breakdown of her marriage to actor David Harbour in such forensic, eye-popping detail it seemed to shift the bar for confessional songwriting – was pretty spectacular, although it’s worth noting that there was more to the album than gossipy revelation: if the songs hadn’t been good, it wouldn’t have had little more than news value. She’ll perform the album in full in these shows.UK tour begins2 MarchatGlasgow Royal Concert HallDaveIt says something about Dave’s skill as a rapper and the sheer size and devotion of his following that his third album, The Boy Who Played the Harp – sombre, musically understated, light on obvious bangers, lyrically self-examining – wasn’t just a huge critical success, but a massive hit: all 10 of its tracks would have made the Top 20 were it not for chart rules. It will be intriguing to see how it translates on stage, particularly in venues this big.UK tour begins 4 MarchatOVO Hydro, GlasgowThundercatIt’s five years since Thundercat last released an album – It Is What It Is was a stew of psychedelia, funk, soul and jazz shot through with mourning for the loss of his friend, rapper Mac Miller – although a string of intriguing singles have emerged over the last couple of years, including collaborations with Tame Impala and Remi Wolf, and an impressively slinky cover of Diana Ross’s Upside Down. Whatever he is currently up to, he remains a dependably fabulous live performer.UK tour begins 25 Marchat O2 Academy Brixton, LondonMy Bloody ValentineRobert Smith’s curation of this year’s Teenage Cancer Trust shows has led to a strong lineup – including Mogwai, Garbage, Manic Street Preachers, Wolf Alice and Nilüfer Yanya – but the pick might be this show, which brings My Bloody Valentine’s beautiful/deafening approach to live performance to the Royal Albert Hall – a noticeably smaller venue than they have been playing of late – with a special “stripped down” set by Chvrches as support.27 Marchat Royal Albert Hall, LondonNicki Minaj – Pink Friday 3View image in fullscreenNicki Minaj … pivot away from pop.Photograph: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Live NationPink Friday 3 started life as an expanded edition of Minaj’s chart-topping and critically acclaimed 2023 albumPink Friday 2, before the rapper reconsidered, announcing the songs “too good … too iconic” to be consigned to the status of extra tracks on a deluxe set. So a new album it is: you have to hope it continues its predecessor’s pivot away from pop towards fierce, dark hip-hop, something Minaj is exceptionally good at.Released 27MarchYungbludA jaunt around the UK’s arenas that had something of the victory lap about it, given that Dominic Harrison had a very good 2025: two No 1 albums – one the Britpop-influenced Idols, the other a collaboration with Aerosmith – three Grammy nominations, another edition of his own one-day festival Bludfest, and a show-stealing turn at what turned out to be Ozzy Osbourne’s final show, July’s Back to the Beginning gig, which seemed to win him an entirely new audience, considerably older than his usual gen Z fans.UK tour begins11 AprilatSheffield Utilita ArenaOlivia DeanWere it not for the complexities of chart rules, Olivia Dean’s Man I Need would have been No 1 for months (it was certainly the UK’s most-streamed track for weeks on end): evidence of how her second album, The Art of Loving, catapulted her into pop’s Premier League, the sole UK artist to make that leap in recent years. Live, she is an appealingly understated and relatable performer, albeit one blessed with an amazing voice and a succession of great pop-soul tracks.UK tour begins 22Aprilat OVO Hydro, GlasgowRosalíaIn a world in which pop music is supposed to cleave to the middle ground and present cautious listeners with more of the same, there’s something hugely buoying about the success of Rosalia’s album Lux: a global Top 10 hit that sounds nothing like the Spanish star’s previous work, but has managed to provoke a debate about whether or not its contents constitute classical music. Helmed by a striking live performer, its transition to the stage should be a treat.On5and 6 May,London O2 ArenaMetallicaView image in fullscreenIntriguing … James Hetfield, left, and Kirk Hammett of Metallica.Photograph: Jeff Hahne/Getty ImagesMetallica spent 2025 touring North America with their M72 show, an intriguing approach to playing live for the umpteenth time in their career. They play stadiums in the round: those prepared to stump up the requisite dosh can get “snake pit” tickets that allow you to stand in the centre of the vast circular stage. In London, they are playing two shows, and promise completely different sets at each, as well as different support acts.UK tour begins on 25 Juneat Glasgow Hampden ParkAriana GrandeYou couldn’t describe Ariana Grande’s arrival in the UK as a tour, exactly: she’s only playing London, although she is doing a fairly eye-popping run of 10 nights at the O2 Arena, testament to the continued appeal of her music despite a shift in emphasis towards acting in recent years. The dates come two years after the release of her R&B and trap-infused post-divorce opus Eternal Sunshine, the album she is ostensibly promoting, which was among the most-streamed albums globally in 2024.15August until1 September, London O2 ArenaClassical music and operaThe Makropulos AffairSimon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra’s semi-staged Janáček has become one of January’s most eagerly anticipated treats.

I suspect many people only know Lewinsky for one thing, so it’s nice to see how she’s introducing another side of herself to both audiences and the media.Mac, 27, works in public relations, New York CityThrough the Square WindowThis podcast is just a hell of a lot of fun. At first, it seems to be solely about nostalgia, but presenters Graham Kibble-White and Samira Ahmed’s real focus is how we look at the world today through the lens of the past. So they speak about what we loved on TV and talked about around the proverbial water-cooler, but also about why it worked then and why it might still be relevant today. It’s cosy, but its scope is large. The hosts work really well together, and you come away from this delightful listen feeling warmly enlightened.Nick, 60, graphic novelist, UKWisecrackWisecrack had me gripped in a way that I can only compare to the first series of Serial. In many ways it has all the tropes of a run-of-the-mill true crime podcast - a narrator with skin in the game, a sleepy town with sinister secrets, incessant and repetitive adverts. But it completely subverts the genre by constantly questioning how reliable our protagonist (British comedian Edd Hedges) is, and to what extent standup comedy routines can be expected to tell the whole truth.It explores an incident Edd talks about in one of his routines, in which his old school bully commits a terrible crime then knocks on the door of Edd’s family home in the immediate aftermath. When producer Jodi Tovay hears his set in Edinburgh, she contacts Edd, and he eventually agrees to allow her to dig deeper into exactly what happened that night.The production is excellent throughout, with engaging interviews from lots of the key people involved, and there’s plenty of entertaining transatlantic culture-clash banter to boot. I would massively recommend it to anyone who’s getting a bit fed up with the endless celebrities talking to each other format, and looking for something a bit more substantial to accompany long car journeys or dog walks.Hywel Sedgwick, 37, charity worker, West YorkshireMusic Is None of Our BusinessThis is an authentic, unapologetic and entertaining chat between two friends – Dave and Jake, both aged 60 – who share a passion for music. It’s great if you want to explore something new beyond what is promoted in mainstream media.Justyna, DerbyRealms UnknownView image in fullscreen‘Funny faux-high-literature’ … Alice FraserPhotograph: SuppliedAlice Fraser and a weekly comedian guest talk about sci-fi/speculative fiction and fantasy, the many sub-genres (I didn’t realise I was occasionally reading “romantasy”), what’s new, old classics to discover, where the genres get a bit ick and all the inevitable tropes.

Airtight character work, pitch-perfect action and the ideal moment to tell an inherently political story about the hope of truth and resistance against an endless barrage of falsehoods and atrocities.Eoin, LondonThe Rehearsal(Sky/Now) I’ve always been a fan of Nathan Fielder’s work but this show was incredible. The work and detail put into this was amazing. So many layers. So many hoops he had to jump through and then, the most incredible ending I’ve ever seen. I won’t spoil it. It has to be seen to be believed.Keith Miller, 57, SurreyPluribusView image in fullscreenCarries the whole show on her shoulders … Rhea Seehorn in Pluribus.Photograph: Apple TV+(Apple TV) Pluribus is another great show by Vince Gilligan. It completely overturns the theme of alien invasion, leading the viewer to ask philosophical questions about society, the concept of freedom and free will. Rhea Seehorn is phenomenal in carrying the entire series practically on her own shoulders.Fabio, Long EatonBlue LightsView image in fullscreenGenuine sense of dread … Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/Two Cities Television(BBC One/iPlayer) My favourite show of the year is Blue Lights. This series was absolutely fantastic in its storytelling, with a cast of characters you really empathise with, even if they don’t always act in the best way. The tensions of being a police officer in Northern Ireland are portrayed really well, with a genuine sense of tension and dread at times. One of my favourite moments was after a character is stabbed and bleeding out through their femoral artery, a 999 paramedic talks the police officer through the steps to saving the officer’s life, then we get 10 seconds of that unnamed telephone emergency paramedic getting their next call and dealing with yet another life-threatening situation calmly and effectively. The show that makes you wonder why anyone would put themselves through this!Catherine O’Grady, 60, CoventryLeonard and Hungry PaulView image in fullscreenA joy … Jamie-Lee O’Donnell and Alex Lawther in Leonard and Hungry Paul.Photograph: BBC/Subotica(BBC iPlayer) Leonard and Hungry Paul was a joy. I’d read Ronan Hession’s book and loved it dearly, so was fearful of this adaptation. Yet from the form of the storytelling to the characterisations, we saw Leonard and Hungry Paul realise their paths from grief and change, upending their norms. What might love and opportunity do for these friends? These two pass under our radar so how can Leonard hope that someone might love him in return? Will anyone appreciate how much he misses his mother? This series is perfect. The light, hope and dexterity of the storytelling is intact and honoured so carefully and beautifully.Bronnie Mayho, HertfordshireHeated Rivalry(Coming to Sky on 10 January) Heated Rivalry has been the television event of the year, if not the decade. I haven’t ever been so invested and hyper-focused on a show before, and judging by the reactions on social media I am not alone. Watching the evolution of the two main actors – from the first casting announcement in the spring to overnight success – has been phenomenal. Episode four was possibly the best piece of television I have ever seen in my life. I had a visceral reaction to the final scene which left me sobbing, having felt every possible emotion within just a few minutes. Jacob Tierney is a legend and needs to be given an Emmy. Plus, there’s the portrayal of a successful autistic character on the screen, helping people feel seen like never before.Stephanie, UKParadiseView image in fullscreenAwe-inspiringly wonderful … Sterling K Brown in Paradise.Photograph: Brian Roedel/Disney(Disney+) An awe-inspiringly wonderful series that had me gripped from the start. You think you are in for a political thriller based in the White House, but it is so much more. Sadly it is almost impossible to write about without giving away the plot twists that make it so very good. Suffice to say those twists will astound and amaze you. Superb acting, particularly from Sterling K Brown, and sharp scripts make this a total pleasure to watch. Although the whole series is brilliantly done, episode seven – The Day – is possibly the best hour of television I have ever watched. Edge of your seat goes nowhere near describing its tension. I actually had to pause it halfway through to regain my composure and remind myself to breath. A truly outstanding episode in a brilliant series. And we will get season two in February. I can’t wait.Gary Chapman, New ForestThe Death of Bunny MunroView image in fullscreenA welcome relief … The Death of Bunny Munro.Photograph: Sky UK, Clerkenwell Films(Sky/Now) The Death of Bunny Munro kept me gripped with its story about a sex-addicted salesman on the run with his young son. Combining moments of sadness with moments of hilarity, the show was a welcome relief at the end of a somewhat chaotic 2025. Matt Smith did not seem the obvious choice for the character of Bunny but he quickly won me over and proved himself charismatic and fully adept at playing both comedy and tragedy simultaneously. The show was brilliantly directed and the setting of Brighton was well captured. The show left me feeling melancholic but also pleased that in an era of self-censorship and extreme caution, a character like Bunny Munro can still be presented flaws and all.Khalid Peerbaccus, LondonSlow Horses(Apple TV) Great acting and a witty, clever script. Suspenseful and engaging, but still humanistic. I’d like to think that there are actual slow horses out there, fighting the good fight.Lynn Meng, New Jersey, USDept QIt is so lovely to see a book transported from its native land to Scotland, with love and care. The adaptation carries the spirit of the film beautifully. The cast are all superb and such incredible acting. I have watched the entire series twice and am saving it for a third viewing on Christmas Day. The baddies are truly awful and the goodies are deeply flawed.Gail, SurbitonDying for SexView image in fullscreenRemarkable … Jenny Slate as Molly, Sissy Spacek as Gail and Michelle Williams as Molly in Dying for Sex.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FX(Disney+) What I loved so much about this show (and what left me in tears, contemplating my most intimate relationships romantic and otherwise) is that at face value it is a crude, nihilistic adventure of a woman quickly approaching her death on a quest for sexual satisfaction before she leaves the world. But what really struck me about the show was how her non-romantic relationships changed (and didn’t) with the news of her imminent death. Jenny Slate’s performance as the protagonist’s best friend was remarkable and left me wondering what type of friend I would be – or what type of friend I would need – in the case of my young, untimely journey towards the grim reaper.David, 30, Ithaca, New York, USThe Pitt(HBO Max – coming soon in the UK) The Pitt was my favourite, obviously. So realistic and timely. I have to watch it in small increments because it can be heartbreaking and stressful. The viewers are treated to real life situations that happen every day, sometimes too emotional to digest all at once.Jean Moore, 80, USPeacemaker(HBO Max) Peacemaker season two took the character in a new direction and stopped being just a superhero show and more of a character study. We got to look at the effects of mental health, government over reach, systemic privilege and found family in very smart ways.Renee, Delaware, USExplore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To put that in context, Ghost in the Shell – ananime classic released in 1995– madeabout £2m worldwide.In that 30-year period, anime has gone from an underground phenomenon to a saviour during one of theworst autumn box office slumps in recent memory. So how did we get here?Mitchel Berger, an executive vice-president and the head of theatrical at Crunchyroll – the specialist anime streaming service – was pleasantly surprised by the Demon Slayer mania.View image in fullscreenDemon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train (2020) is part of the globally popular franchise.Illustration: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyHe says one of the keys to its success has been the slow building of a worldwide fanbase for franchises such as Demon Slayer, which also has a TV series and had already secured one box office success with 2020’s Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train (that time, the fiends were trying to eat passengers on a train).“We have spent the last eight years building this fandom,” says Berger. “Coming out of the pandemic, that fandom has just continued to grow.”Crunchyroll, which is owned by Sony and co-distributed Demon Slayer with its parent company, passed 17 million subscribers this year, and has 50,000 hours of anime on its service.Animefirst emerged from Japanduring the 1950s but its world breakthrough moment came in 1988 with Akira, the dystopian tale ofa near-future Tokyo ravaged by biker gangs. Its influence can be clearly seen in everything from cyberpunk to Stranger Things, and ushered in a more grown-up, darker brand of animation.View image in fullscreenKatsuhiro Otomo’s Akira became a breakout anime hit in the west in 1988.Illustration: AllstarDemon Slayer sees anime gatecrashing Hollywood and establishing Japanese animation as a potential rich resource in an era whenIP is king. Most, but not all, anime begin life as manga, Japanese comics, which may have years of backstory. Others come from video games.It provides rich pickings for studios who want to spin things out into Marvel-sized franchises. And it is not just the cineplex crowd who are getting in on anime. The director of Nomadland, Chloé Zhao, grew up reading manga in China andhas set up Kodansha Studiosto turn manga into live-action projects.Its new globalised reach means anime can materialise in some unlikely places. Olympic athletes, UFC fighters, Premier League footballers and rugby league stars have all referenced anime shows in their celebrations – while some have described the art form as “a lingua franca for young people all over the planet”.“It’s part of young people’s identity, it’s how they express themselves,” says Patrick Macias, an anime writer who lives in Tokyo. “I think that really is fuelling this rise of anime, not just in the US, but globally.”View image in fullscreenA protester at an anti-Trump ‘No Kings’ march in Tampa, Florida, flies the Straw Hat Pirates’ Jolly Roger flag from the hit series One Piece. Demonstrators around the world have adopted the flag as a protest emblem.Photograph: Daniel Powell/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockMacias also puts the spike in interest around the art form down to “Oshikatsu”, a phenomena which began in Japan but was supercharged by South Korean K-pop where devout fanaticism is the norm. “You’re not just going to the movies,” he says. “You’re buying all the merchandise, you’re taking pictures of all the merchandise you bought, and you’re sharing it with your friends.”The Japanese government is betting big on anime. It is a key part of its“Cool Japan” plan, a soft-power initiative it is hoping can boost its economy by piggy-backing off the hardcore fandom to drive cultural tourism.The country’s leaders, who are in charge ofa lethargic economy, hope the strategy can bring in ¥50tr (£240bn) annually by 2033 – about 8% of Japan’s GDP. It marks a step change in approach from the country which has been protective of its culture traditionally. “The domestic market was big enough here for a long time,” says Macias. “It was an afterthought to spread this culture globally.”South Korea has already been through this process and seen the benefits of opening up to a global audience: BTS, the country’s biggest K-pop band, contributed almost£3bn annually to its economyin 2020. “K-op showed what a modern version of opening the borders to let this culture spread a little more freely looks like,” says Macias.View image in fullscreenIñaki Godoy as Monkey D. Luffy, Emily Rudd as Nami in season one of Netflix’s live-action adaptation of One Piece (2023).Photograph: NetflixThe other platform that looms large in the world of anime is Netflix. Berger will not comment on the possible Warner Bros deal with Netflix, but whatever happens after thebattle between the media CEOs, it is likely that Netflix will remain Crunchyroll’s main competitor. The streamer says the number of subscribers watching anime on its platform has tripled in the last five years, and it currently dubs the latest releases into 33 languages to meet global demand.Demon Slayer’s second and third instalments are also in the works – although they will not be available until 2027 and 2029. Before then, the second season of Netflix’s live-action adaptation of One Piece will be released in March 2026, hot on the heels of the third season of Shinya Umemura’s Record of Ragnarok, which sees humans – including Nikola Tesla – fight gods in a battle for the “survival of humanity”.The stories are epic but so are the economic upsides of anime’s seemingly unstoppable rise.Explore more on these topicsAnimeJapanTV streamingTelevisionAsia PacificAnimation in filmAnimation on TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the first, Cobweb Walking (1986), the child Morgan is able to walk on cobwebs: Sara’s storytelling made the surreal real, bringing a fresh voice to fiction by interweaving fantasy with the absurdities of everyday life.The absence of a father is a theme in several of the novels, her own British army veteran father having died during her teens. In Cobweb Walking, Morgan loses her widowed father to another woman. Fatherless Alice is central in the blackly comic Shining Agnes (1990). In Absolute Hush (1991), the pubescent, unpredictable twins George and Sissy and their beautiful mother live in a grand moated house next to an army camp, their father missing in action, with incest, infidelity and comedy combining in a heady, surprising mix.View image in fullscreenThe Observer found it to be “a bold, fantastical work … an extraordinary marriage of pyrotechnics and grace”. Other reviewers compared her wit to that of Evelyn Waugh and Muriel Spark.Sara’s marriage to Ranjit Banerji in 1957 led to India providing the setting and inspiration for several of her books. In The Wedding of Jayanthi Mandel (1987), Police Deputy Babu relates the memorable – and often violent – events of the wedding day in a tone of astonished bemusement. The Tea-Planter’s Daughter (1988), narrated partly by the servants in a post-colonial household, shows repression and desire in the south Indian hills, and Shining Hero (2002) uses Hindu mythology and epic poetry as a template for a contemporary novel of sibling rivalry. Her final novel, Tikkippala (2015), deploys magical realism to tell the story of a 20th-century rajah’s family.Born in Stoke Poges, in Buckinghamshire, Sara was one of four children of Anita (nee Feilding), a descendant of Henry Fielding who herself wrote novels as Anne Marie Fielding, and Sir Basil Mostyn, a baronet and army officer who had served in the second world war in the North Africa campaign, including the Battle of Alamein.View image in fullscreenBanerji was also a successful amateur jockeyWhile he was away asa lieutenant with the Royal Army Service Corps, Sara, her mother and siblings stayed at Beckley Park, a Tudor house near Oxford owned by her uncle, Basil Feilding. Its moat and topiary-filled garden provided the social setting for several novels.After the war her father took the family to live on a tobacco farm in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where their home consisted of two mud huts with no water or sanitation. The marriage broke down, and the children returned to Britain with their mother; they saw little of their father before his death in 1956.The family settled near Oxford, taking in lodgers to pay the bills. Anita had connections in Europe, and set up the Mostyn Bureau, an agency for au pairs. Sara hitch-hiked round Europe and au paired in Paris and Vienna. On her return she met Ranjit, a recent Oxford graduate, in the coffee bar where she was working. She soon proposed to him, but Ranjit refused, claiming his family expected him to marry a Brahmin girl. Sara, whose family wanted her to marry a well-born Englishman, persisted, the two families relented, and they were married in Munnar, Kerala, where Ranjit had a job in the tea industry.During their 16 years in the country, initially in Munnar, then near Calcutta (now Kolkata), where they had a dairy farm, Sara wrote, painted and taught art, exhibiting her paintings in Madras (now Chennai) and Delhi. She also became a successful amateur jockey – timing the births of their three daughters so that they did not coincide with the Flat racing season.The radical leftwing Naxalite insurgency, prompted by dissatisfaction over poverty and land ownership, caused their dairy farm to fail, and in 1973 they left India with £10, the maximum amount they were allowed to take out.View image in fullscreenSara and Ranjit found work where they could, first in Bedfordshire and then Sussex, where Sara set up Henfield Lady Gardeners. Among her clients was the bestselling horror writer James Herbert, whose success increased Sara’s determination to become a published novelist. I was fortunate to be her editor at Victor Gollancz for her first six books.In 1996, the family moved to Oxford to look after Sara’s ageing mother, and she taught creative writing at a continuing education college until 2014. She also set up a creative writing group, which she ran until early 2025.Sara never stopped creating: she painted, sculpted and wrote to the end, including a memoir of her childhood for the family.Her brother Jeremy died in 1988 and Ranjit in 2022. She is survived by their three daughters, Bijoya, Sabita and Juthika, five grandchildren, Anna, Rory, Maia, Chandi and Sumi, four great-grandchildren and her siblings, Trevor and Joanna.Sara Banerji, novelist, born 6 June 1932; died 2 November 2025Explore more on these topicsFictionobituariesShareReuse this content"

It is the perfect setting for Neil Rollinson’s debut novel, which is its own kind of spectacular mosaic. Built from short, seemingly discrete chapters that take us between Spain in 2003 and the coalfields of Northumberland in the 70s and 80s, The Dead Don’t Bleed coheres into an extraordinarily tense and tender portrait of two brothers trying to escape their father’s gangland past.Until now, Rollinson has been known as a poet; his collection Talking Dead was shortlisted for the2015 Costa poetry prize. Here he brings his talent for compressed evocation to an exploration of fraternal rivalry and the enduring impact of a violent patriarchy. If you took Frank and his brother Gordon apart on the autopsy table, he writes, “you’d find the same bones, the same blood. Almost everything interchangeable. The corkscrews of DNA, the cells, the posture, the downcast glance.” But from a young age, change is afoot within Frank. He knows his father has “high hopes for him” in the family business of petty crime: “Frank Bridge. King of Northumberland”. But Frank wants to be a different kind of king. He carries within himself a “yearning for something more expansive” – the kind of dream that could get him killed in his family’s closed world of criminal secrecy.Rollinson’s novel is heartbreaking, but he is no sentimentalistLike his author, Frank is drawn to poetry – particularly the work of Federico García Lorca. He is also dangerously drawn to his brother’s girlfriend, Carol, often glimpsed with a mop and bucket in hand at the local pub, cleaning up after the men. Frank “loves to watch her move: tough, big boned, elegant but strong. He’s seen her put men flat on their backs for touching her up. A single punch.” In north-east England, “no one messes with Carol” – and even fewer mess with poetry. The twin risks of Frank involving himself in forbidden lust and forbidden literature power the whole plot, giving the novel the through line of a quest narrative. When Gordon and Carol flee to Spain with the proceeds of a robbery that went disastrously wrong, Frank, in the wake of his father’s death, makes the irrevocable decision to track them down.Rollinson is expert at capturing the long shadow cast by a complicated father. Laurence is a local gangster who, through his own perverse code of ethics and innate charisma, has established himself as “a man of stature. Respected. Everyone stopping to chat.” His “loud laugh echoes across the room. A man among men”. Frank is caught between wanting to please his parent and wanting to escape the family’s gaze entirely. His “father’s scrutiny is like a physical manifestation,” Rollinson writes. Frank “always feels it in his throat, as if he’s being throttled”. The novel captures the way close observation can be an expression of love, but also a kind of violence. In the Northumberland boozers where men “get mortal in the afternoon”, pints “glow in the river light, amber gold and black, like beakers in a chemistry lab”. Many of these men will drink themselves to death. What catches your eye can kill you.One of this novel’s many successes is in capturing the terror of illicit attraction – of admitting to yourself that you secretly want something more. Readers of Karl Geary,Douglas StuartorRoss Raisinwill appreciate the way Rollinson blends social realism with a knack for capturing risky intimacies. The “creeping deprivation” of Northumberland in the Thatcher era – the closure of its core industries, “more and more lads on the dole” – is put in beautiful contrast with Frank’s longing for his brother’s girlfriend. In one lovely, expertly judged scene, Frank and Carol sit “on a wall by a waste ground” as the rain beats down around them. A “demolition squad takes down a terrace behind them. A whole street. Houses he’s known, and been in.” A fireplace “hangs, mid-air, levitating, its grate gaping. Improvements, they say. For whom?”That question – “for whom?” – reverberates on every page. How much of our lives should be spent in service of the family that made us, as opposed to the family we hope to make? Spain seems to offer the relief of fresh contrasts: “the shadow and light, the scent of orange blossom, the endless, undulating fields and the high, unblemished sky”. But every landscape in this novel holds its ghosts. Lorca was murdered in Andalucía, and his exact resting place remains a mystery – one echoed in a final moment of violence that is all the more powerful for being played out largely off stage, in the space between sentences, the gap between chapters. Rollinson’s novel is heartbreaking, but he is no sentimentalist. Life and love spring up from the cracks, he seems to say, but damage continues to be done.Jonathan Lee is the author of the novels High Dive and The Great Mistake.The Dead Don’t Bleedby Neil Rollinson is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99).

Very much the kind of man who would send someone a book and tell them not to read it.Despite the doubts Mann expressed to Gide, The Magic Mountain – a very strange, very long novel – was embraced throughout Europe, and three years later in America, too. Its publisher there ignored the strangeness and proclaimed its “use value … for the practical life of modern man”. While that makes it sound likeJordan Peterson-style cod philosophy, in fact it stands alongside In Search of Lost Time, Ulysses, The Man Without Qualities and To the Lighthouse as one of the summits (apologies) of literary modernism.The novel describes its youthful protagonist, Hans Castorp, visiting a tuberculosis sanatorium in Davos where his cousin is a patient. Intending to stay a few days, he doesn’t escape for seven years. The novel’s plot mirrored its composition: it was first conceived as a novella, a lighthearted counterpart to the gloomy Death in Venice.But Mann began writing in 1913 and didn’t finish for more than a decade. Between those two points, the first world war radically changed the book’s size, scope and temper because it radically changed the political and moral outlook of its author.Mann began the war a staunch conservative. Yet by the early 1920s he was making speeches in defence of the maligned Weimar Republic. (In time, and in exile, Mann became the most prominent German opponent of the Third Reich.)This tumult fed into The Magic Mountain,notably in the characters of Lodovico Settembrini (humanist) and Leo Naphta (rightwing radical), who vie for Castorp’s soul. Their arguments are dazzling – far more so than the political toing and froing Mann engaged in while writing the novel. It isn’t Jensen’s intention, but his dogged account of Mann’s shifting political views supports the theory that a novel can know more than its creator.Jensen falters occasionally when attempting to correct the record. He says the “oft-repeated claim” that Mann “was an indifferent or cruel parent seems inaccurate”. Yet all he offers in support is a single quote from the autobiography of Thomas’s son Klaus, who was deeply troubled for much of his relatively short life. There is voluminous evidence to the contrary.Jensen also takes issue with the “callousness” of Ronald Hayman’s assertion, in his 1995 biography, that Mann “liked and admired” his wife but wasn’t in love with her. Hayman supports his claim by quoting from a letter Thomas wrote to his brother on the matter. It’s permissible to takeissue with Hayman’s conclusion, but Jensen’s protest – “How could he possibly know?” – seems disingenuous coming from a writer engaged in the same process of interpretative analysis. Especially in the case of a judgment about Mann (“gay most of the time”, in Colm Tóibín’s description) that is so uncontroversial.Whatever the truth may be, it doesn’t make The Magic Mountainany less captivating an exploration of the human condition, or less of a literary achievement. Jensen doesn’t penetrate deeply into the mysteries of the book, but he doesn’t aim to do so. Rather, he gives a brisk, confident overview of an extremely dense work of art – no small achievement – and contextualises the era in which it was forged. In his foreword to the novel Mann wrote that “only thoroughness can be truly entertaining”, but summary has its pleasures too.The Master of Contradictions: Thomas Mann and the Making of the Magic Mountain by Morten Høi Jensen is published by Yale (£22).Explore more on these topicsThomas MannBiography booksFictionLiterary criticismreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 31 Dec 2025 07.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 07.31 ESTShareWith the best games of the year duly noted (yoursandours), I’d like to highlight some of the work we’ve done covering them. Reviewing the top-performing articles that we published in 2025, I see a portrait of a conflicted year: plenty of great works and games that captured the imagination and the world’s attention, but also growing anxiety about their place in the real world, and the political circumstances they reflect. And a lot of (justified) hand-wringing over Roblox.But first: I wanted to extend heartfelt thanks to everyone who reads this newsletter and the rest of our work at the Guardian. If you’ve enjoyed our coverage, do consider supporting us to do more of it – either through arecurring or one-off contribution. Without your support, none of the great journalism we produce would be possible. Thank you for being with us in 2025, and I hope you stick around to watch me slowly lose my mind working overtime in the buildup to Grand Theft Auto 6’s release in November 2026. (Finally).In no particular order, here are the most read feature articles of the year.My chilling week on Roblox:sexually assaultedand shat on as a child avatar roaming the online worldThe Guardiancovered Roblox a lot in 2025, mostly from the perspective of child safety. As Sarah Martin discovered inthis article, it is extremely easy to get into inappropriate situations and chats in this free-for-all of a game platform, which has more than 150m daily users (most of them children). I am no fan of Roblox and don’t let my own kids play it, but if your little ones get joy out of it and you don’t want to prohibit the game entirely I recommend making sure it’s supervised where possible and those parental controls are locked down.I cannot stop playing this preposterous game about falling down a mountainFor some reason this tale ofmy self-flagellating travails with Baby Stepsseemed to speak to a lot of people. I felt somewhat vindicated for spending more than 12 hours of my life marching a useless person up a hill.Master System at 40: the truth about Sega’s most underrated consoleView image in fullscreenNo one’s favourite … Sega Master System.Photograph: Keith Stuart/The GuardianOur games correspondent Keith Stuart, goes down one of hisfavourite rabbit holeshere, emerging with a wonderfully researched tribute to one of Sega’s lesser-appreciated consoles. Revisionist history often crowns the NES as the winner of the 80s console wars, but that was only true in Japan and the US – in Europe, home computers and the Sega Master System reigned.Elon Musk stands accused of pretending to be good at video games. The irony is deliciousI must admit that this was extremely satisfying to write. After boasting about his gaming prowess on X, Elon Musk was revealed to have beencheatingin some baffling attempt to appropriate gamer credibility. As the year wore on, this proved to be just one of many embarrassing self-owns from the richest man in the world.Why Trump’s White House is using video game memes to recruit for ICEGames have a lot of economic and cultural power. They were the original site of the modern online culture wars, during Gamergate, and now the Trump administration isn’t shy to use gamer imagery to mobilise its base.This reportfrom Alyssa Mercante is a story about how Pokémon and Halo imagery is being used to recruit for ICE, but also a story about where games sit now in the wider political context of our times.Meet the new James Bond: how 007 First Light earned its licence to thrillView image in fullscreenTears of joy … 007 First Light.Photograph: IO InteractiveWho needs Grand Theft Auto: the upcoming game that Guardian readers are most psyched for in 2026 is 007 First Light.

Joshua Riverainterviewsthe people at IO Interactive who persuaded Eon Productions to let them loose on James Bond.Unreal estate: the 12 greatest homes in video game historyList features get a bad rap butthisis such a good, thoughtful example of the form, in my (biased) opinion, from Keith Stuart and Christian Donlan. We remember the places we tread in games as if they were real, and some of these virtual mansions feel like childhood homes. (We should be so lucky as to grow up in Croft Manor.)Gaming in their golden years: why millions of seniors are playing video gamesView image in fullscreenOut of the gaming closet … the older players.Composite: The Guardian/Getty ImagesI know many Pushing Buttons readers are gamers of a certain vintage. Adrienne Matei speaks to some of Twitch’s older video game streamers (much love to TacticalGramma) to find outwhy half of people over 60 play video games, and the potential benefits of doing so.Why do some gamers invert their controls? Scientists now have answers – but they’re not what you thinkThis story has been ongoing in the Guardian games pages for years, ever since Keith wrote what he thought would be a very niche article querying why some people play games upside down. Finally, after that article inspired an actual scientific study,we have the answer.Billion-dollarvideo game: is this the most expensive piece of entertainment ever made?I have been interested in the spaceship game Star Citizen for a long time, mostly because I have wondered where the hundreds of millions of pounds it has raised in funding were actually going. (It’s been “in development” since 2012 and its creators don’t pretend it is anywhere close to finished.) Oliver Holmes talks to players to find outwhy they have invested thousandsin this science-fiction dream. Since this article was published, Star Citizen’s revenue has risen to $924,266,846, and it now has six million players.What to playView image in fullscreenStaying in … Sony’s SingStar on PlayStation 3.Photograph: SonyThis week, I will be playingGuitar HeroandRock Band, as I have small children and can’t go out for Hogmanay.

As a member of Georgie Fame’s Blue Flames, Thornton contributed to the brass section’s bright and forceful fanfares that helpedGetawaytop the British charts in June 1967, a year after his furious trumpet was part of the driving counter-melody on the Beatles’Got to Get You into My Life.Widely admired for his musical adaptability and for his dependable and easygoing personality, Thornton collaborated with some of the era’s greatest talents, including the Animals, Sandie Shaw and Jimi Hendrix (who lodged with him in London for a time). He played on the Rolling Stones’ She’s a Rainbow and on the Small Faces’ eponymous second album, whose bittersweet closing number, Eddie’s Dreaming, was inspired by Thornton’s longing for Jamaica. He subsequently became an important part of the British reggae scene, notably in the horn section that helped Aswad to achieve greater fame.One of five children born to William Thornton, a butcher, and his wife, Maude, Eddie was raised in a devout Catholic household in Spanish Town, one of Jamaica’s largest cities. After his father’s early death, Eddie was admitted to the Alpha boys’ school, a Catholic charitable institution run by the Sisters of Mercy in downtown Kingston, where many of Jamaica’s greatest musicians learned their craft. He joined the school band on tuba, switching to trumpet a few weeks later.View image in fullscreenThornton recording at Hive Studios, London, 1985.Photograph: David Corio/RedfernsAt Alpha, Thornton’s contemporaries included the trombonist Don Drummond, his protege,Rico Rodriguez, and the saxophonist Ruben Alexander. Thornton began his training with the scores of Bach, Beethoven and Mozart, and was later schooled in the big-band swing of Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. Alpha was notoriously disciplinarian, but Thornton found an ally in the jazz-loving nun Sister Ignatius, who made him a school captain; they remained in contact long after he left and Thornton often described Alpha as his salvation.When he graduated at the age of 16, Sister Ignatius helped him land a placement in Roy Coburn’s weekly residency at the beachside Bournemouth Club, and the guitarist Ernest Ranglin later drafted him into the Eric Deans Orchestra, which played at the upmarket Colony Club six nights a week. After an extended engagement with the group in Nassau, Thornton returned to Jamaica with the intention of travelling to the US, but President Harry S Truman’s immigration policies curtailed the plan. Instead, he headed to London in 1954 to join his girlfriend, Dorothy Coleman, who had settled in Brixton and whom he later married.Soon after his arrival, the saxophonist Ossie Scott, who knew Thornton from Alpha, drafted him into the Caribbean Swing Band, which toured extensively in Germany; back in London, a jam session at the Flamingo brought him into the Blue Flames.Thornton was an ensemble player at heart, rather than a flashy soloist, and in the mid-1970s, he broadened his musical palette. After touring with the disco supergroup Boney M, playing on albums by Andy Fairweather-Low and on Peter King’s debut Afrobeat album Miliki Sound (1975), Thornton became a top reggae session player, appearing on Delroy Washington’s albums I Sus (1976) and Rasta (1977), and on Rodriguez’s instrumental LP Man From Wareika.Thornton was part of the 4th Street Orchestra, the house band employed by the inventive producer Dennis Bovell, and after playing on the Sons of Jah’s 1979 album Burning Black and the Cimarons’ Freedom Street in 1980, Thornton joined Aswad in time for their debut album for CBS, New Chapter.View image in fullscreenThornton in Paris with Kitty, Daisy & Lewis, 2015.Photograph: David Wolff-Patrick/Getty ImagesDuring the 1980s Thornton also often played in King Sounds’ backing band, the Israelites. He was part of Pere Ubu’s LP Song of the Bailing Man and General Public’s album All The Rage, but reggae was his main focus and some of the biggest names in the genre benefited from his input, includingDennis Brown, Horace Andy,Mikey Dread, Desmond Dekker, Owen Gray andBenjamin Zephaniah, as well as the producer Mad Professor and the singer-songwriter Floyd Lloyd Seivright.In the early 90s Thornton became a founding member of Jazz Jamaica, the hybrid project initiated by Ranglin’s nephew Gary Crosby, and in the early 2000s he joined Ska Cubano, which mixed Cuban and Jamaican styles. He played on sessions for Super Furry Animals,Amy Winehouseand Lily Allen, and became a part of the touring band for Kitty, Daisy & Lewis.For many years Thornton also fronted a lively weekly session at the Effra pub in Brixton.He is survived by his second wife, May, whom he married in 1973, and their sons, Jason, Peter and Ross; three daughters, Corolyn, Janet and Theresa, from his marriage to Dorothy, which ended in divorce; and a daughter, Angela, from a previous relationship.Eddie ‘Tan Tan’ Thornton, trumpeter, born 19 October 1931; died 11 December 2025Explore more on these topicsReggaeJazzHip-hopobituariesShareReuse this content"

I also knew that by casting me … he was giving me the keys to the castle.”The actor posted some behind-the-scenes footage from the film, adding that he could not remember “a single day without laughter”.“The movie is about love, loyalty and sacrifice. Things that Rob held dear. Which is among the many reasons he was the perfect person to direct it.“And if I could make him laugh in return, I felt like I had won the lottery. His laugh was one of the greatest sounds I’ve ever known – so heartfelt it still rings in my ears.“This was a man who felt deeply,” wrote Elwes. “Whose heart was filled with love and compassion. He wasn’t impressed by how much money you had or if you had a privileged upbringing. He just wanted to know if you were a ‘good guy.’”View image in fullscreen‘Rob was the perfect person to direct it’ … Cary Elwes in The Princess Bride.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/RexThe Reiners’ son, Nick, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder after his parents bodies were discovered on 14 December in their Los Angeles home. He is being held without bail in a correctional facility in the city.Elwes also paid tribute to Reiner’s wife, saying: “To say that they were a great team would be an understatement … my heart still aches every time I think of you, I know the grief of losing you too soon will likely never go away.”He concluded with a quote from The Princess Bride: “Sure, death cannot stop true love but life is pain without you.”In an essay in the New York Times, Martin Scorsese also paid tribute to Reiner, who he first met in the 1970s, saying:“Right away, I loved hanging out with Rob. We had a natural affinity for each other. He was hilarious and sometimes bitingly funny, but he was never the kind of guy who would take over the room. He had a beautiful sense of uninhibited freedom, fully enjoying the life of the moment, and he had a great barrelling laugh.”Reiner had a supporting role in Scorsese’s 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street, in which he played the father of Leonardo DiCaprio’s character, Jordan Belfort.“He could improvise with the best”, wrote Scorsese, “he was a master at comedy, he worked beautifully with Leo and the rest of the guys, and he understood the human predicament of his character: The man loved his son, he was happy with his success, but he knew that he was destined for a fall.”This week, a Los Angeles superior court judge agreed to bar the release of the Reiners’ autopsy reports, at the request of the LAPD.A court order received by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner last week put a security hold on the cases to restrict the public release of “any investigative information, notes, reports or photos” related to the investigation.View image in fullscreen‘He was a master at comedy’ … Rob Reiner in The Wolf of Wall Street.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/AllstarThe medical examiner’s officehad previously confirmedtheir deaths were the result of homicide, with their public database listing the cause as “multiple sharp force injuries”.After the Reiners’ killing, President Donald Trump posted that Rob Reiner’s death was “due to the anger he caused others” from being outspokenly anti-Trump.Trump called Reiner “tortured and struggling” and attributed his death to “his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.”The president’s commentswere widely condemned, with Joe Rogan adding his voice to the critics last week.Speaking to comedian Shane Gillis, the hugely popular podcaster said of Trump: “If you say that privately that’s one thing, which is also crazy, but it’s so disappointing.”Rogan, who supported Trump in 2024 but has recently expressed disquiet over some of his policies, equated the president’s apparent lack of empathy with “people that were celebrating when Charlie Kirk got shot”.“Imagine if Obama tweeted something about someone after they died in this way. That this person was a deranged person that hated Obama”, Rogan continued. “It just shows you how crazy it is, the way Trump thinks and talks.”Rogan concluded by suggesting an adviser should have taken Trump’s “fucking phone” away when he decided to weigh in on Reiner’s death.Explore more on these topicsFilmRob ReinernewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s why we should stop using itRead moreRobbie Love, a sociolinguist based at Aston University, in Birmingham, says that the lexicographers behind the selections are themselves aware that it is not an “entirely objective, scientific process”, otherwise “you [would] find the same words … they all will ensure that they’re different”.Vaclav Brezina, a professor of linguistics at Lancaster University, said: “The considerations for the word of the year is fairly narrow, so it is a word that captures people’s imagination and the lexicographer’s imagination in that particular year.“I don’t think the purpose of the word of the year is really to give scientific analysis of the English language … [it] is more to draw our attention.”Based on data analysis conducted by the Guardian, which measured the frequency of usage for words of the year chosen by Cambridge, Collins and Oxford since 2010, much of that imagination is increasingly being forged online. More than a third of chosen words are either internet slang terms or owe their meanings to technological devices. The figure rises to two-thirds for words of the year from 2021.Lynne Murphy, a professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex, is not surprised. “I think that’s sort of inevitable because that’s the way that words are spreading really easily these days. So, everybody’s much more aware of new words. There’s also just the fact that we’re in a really active time of technological change.”Yet with the fleeting nature of much online content, it is perhaps to be expected that not many previously chosen words have stood the test of time. Oxford’s choice in 2022,“goblin mode”– “a type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent … in a way that rejects social norms or expectations” – may ring a bell but is now rarely used. Cambridge’s 2018 pick, “nomophobia” – the fear of being without your phone – is similarly obscure. NFT or non-fungible token (Collins, 2021) and “youthquake” (Oxford, 2017) have also significantly decreased in use, by 96% and 92% respectively, according to analysis of the News on the Web corpus.Some have fallen out of popularity for good reason. Words such as Brexit, vax and quarantine spoke to a particular time in social history whose urgency may have faded, even as its after-effects remain felt. Others, including austerity and climate emergency, have waxed and waned in tandem with political developments and changing priorities, although it is hard to imagine David Cameron’s “big society” ever making a comeback.On the lack of longevity, Jonathan Dent, a senior editor at the Oxford English Dictionary, said: “Whether a word of the year survives as an active and widely recognised part of the language in the long term is really less important [than] that it has something to say about where we are now, this year.“If a candidate for word of the year maintains the kind of usage that led to its selection, that’s a sign that speakers and writers of English have found it a useful addition to their linguistic toolkit. If it doesn’t, that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a relevant and worthwhile choice in the year it was chosen.”While some linguists such as Murphy can be “a little bit cynical about some of the dictionary words of the years being about attention grabbing” and consider the annual ritual as “a marketing tool”, others view the exercise with less scepticism.Love said: “I would not in any way interpret [word of the year] as being a prediction one way or the other of how that word might be used in the future.“I think it’s just a fun way of getting people to talk about language, and particularly if they’re choosing words fairly consistently that are probably more likely to be used by younger people in online discourse, then that is a great way of engaging younger people with these sorts of conversations about language and words.”In summary: don’t expect a word of the year to outlast it.“It’s marketing”, Green said. “Whether it works, I mean, that’s another side of it … [but] is it really something that the public feel ‘this sums up the year I have just lived’?”Explore more on these topicsLanguageLinguisticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet, in the absence of a better plan, it happens with depressing ease. How we spend the hours between shutting down the laptop and slipping under the duvet affects sleep quality, mood and how restored we feel the next day. So, how can we reclaim those lost evenings?According to Jason Ellis, a professor of psychology at Northumbria University and director of the Northumbria centre for sleep research, establishing a regular end-of-day routine sends a signal to your brain that you are making a shift between work mode, and rest and recreation. “It’s about putting the day to bed before you go to bed,” he says. Gretchen Rubin – an author, podcaster and creator of the Happiness Project – agrees. “Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life,” she says.When Rubin’s working day is finished, she spends a few minutes tidying up and rewriting her to-do list. Then she gets out her watercolours and paints for a while, although she says the activity itself isn’t important. “It could be going for a walk, or playing with your dog; the important thing is that it marks the transition between work and free time.”Unsurprisingly, staring at YouTube on your phone is probably not the ideal transition. Rubin recommends turning your phone off for an hour or so after work, or placing it somewhere inconvenient to reach. “It keeps the brain stimulated and alert, similar to the work mindset.”Much has been made of thedetrimental effect of blue light– emitted by phones, laptops, game consoles and other screens – on sleep. However, Ellis says the notion that blue light is “bad” is “a little too simplistic. Research is now focusing on the combined effect of blue light and what you are actually doing on your blue-light-emitting devices.” This means distinguishing between “active” blue light, associated with checking emails or social media, and “passive”, from reading, watching or listening to something on your device. “The former should be avoided in the two hours before bedtime, but the latter is fine during that time window.”Contrary to what you might assume, a lit room is actually better than a dim one when looking at your phone in the evening. This is because a brightly lit device held close to your face in an otherwise darkened room delivers more light to the retina (because your pupils are dilated), which has a larger potential to suppress melatonin than the same device used in a well-lit room. Try to avoid fluorescent or LED lights, though.TVs emit blue light too, but the distance from your face renders the effect insignificant compared with a phone or tablet. Although Rubin warns that TV can suck up your time in just as unsatisfactory a manner as social media. “Make sure your viewing is an intentional activity, not just mindless channel flicking,” she says.Whatever your chosen evening entertainment, don’t get too comfortable. The average person sits in chairs for nine to 10 hours a day, and while some of this sitting time is unavoidable – desks, meeting rooms, vehicles – at home, you have more flexibility. Katy Bowman, a biomechanist and author of Rethink Your Position, recommends taking the floor. “Sitting on the floor encourages your body to cycle through many different positions, rather than the one or two that a sofa encourages us to sit in,” she says. You can use a cushion or two at first. If floor-sitting isn’t an option, at least try to avoid taking root in your comfy chair. Researchers at the University of Leicester recommend five minutes of movement for every 30 minutes of sitting.View image in fullscreenMark the transition between work and free time by regularly doing an activity such as painting.Photograph: Getty ImagesWhen I read Haruki Murakami’s novel Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki, I was inspired by the protagonist’s habit of taking a shower when he got home from work. I had formerly regarded showers as a morning wake-up activity, but the post-work shower was a revelation – providing a metaphorical washing away of the stresses of the day and a clear transition point from day to evening.Science suggests baths are even better. AJapanese randomised trialin 2018 found that bathing beat showering on measures including mood, fatigue and stress, as well as on ratings of aches and pains. Ellis gives baths the preferential thumbs up when it comes to sleep, too. “Research on sleep onset latency – how quickly we get off to sleep – shows that a shower is OK, a 20-minute bath is better but a longer soak is best.”Two of the main regulators of the sleep-wake cycle are core body temperature and melatonin levels, which are governed by circadian rhythms. In the evening, core body temperature begins to drop as melatonin rises, inducing natural sleepiness. “When you lie in a hot bath, body heat is transferred from the core to the periphery where it is lost, which signals to the brain that it is time to prepare for sleep,” Ellis says. Apparently, adding bubble bath serves a practical purpose too: it insulates the water, enhancing the cooling effect afterwards.I lost the post-work shower habit when I started working from home. Now, my go-to post-work activity is typically CrossFit or a 10km run.Traditional advice has always warned against working up a sweat too close to bedtime, though this hasn’t been well supported by recent evidence. A2019 systematic reviewconcluded that, for most people, evening exercise does not impair sleep and may even improve it – with the exception of high-intensity workouts performed within an hour of bed.A largereal-world study from Monash Universityin Australia earlier this year has shed new light on the issue. “We found that strenuous exercise performed within four hours of bedtime was associated with delayed sleep onset, shorter sleep duration and lower sleep quality,” says the lead author Dr Josh Leota, from the school of psychological sciences.Exercise activates the sympathetic nervous system, associated with alertness. The parasympathetic system is reactivated afterwards, which returns the body to a resting state (and is related to sleep onset). But, Leota explains, very strenuous exercise can slow this reactivation.He recommends doing strenuous workouts earlier. “Our findings suggest that as long as a workout is finished at least four hours before bedtime, it has no effect on sleep, regardless of how long or strenuous it is,” he says. “If you do exercise later in the evening, keep it on the lighter side – such as an easy jog or a brief swim.” Evening exercise can also expose you to bright light and stimulation, he adds, “at a time when your system should be winding down”. That said, these things can be highly individual. “It is worth experimenting with timing, and monitoring your recovery,” says Leota, “rather than assuming what works for one person applies to everyone.”Whether you’ve been soaking in the bath, painting watercolours or running laps, eating is an integral part of the evening routine. The emerging field of chrono-nutrition explores how the timing and composition of dietary intake interacts with circadian rhythms. “When you eat, not just what you eat, is increasingly being shown to play an important role in sleep,” says Dr Samantha Gill, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association.The findings with regard to the evening meal are somewhat inconclusive, however. A large-scale cross-sectional study published in the British Journal of Nutrition in 2021 supported the popular belief that eating too close to bedtime is detrimental to sleep – linking it to more interrupted sleep – though other studies have found no negative impact. “While experimental and observational research indicates that certain nutrients and dietary patterns can influence sleep outcomes, what’s missing are randomised controlled trials that use objective measures of both diet and sleep to provide clear insights into cause and effect,” says Gill.She recommends eating around three hours before going to bed as a sensible aim, but concedes “the ‘best’ time to eat dinner likely varies from person to person. The key message is to not go to bed too full or too hungry.”How to optimise the cognitive benefits of dreams and sleepRead moreIt’s not only the evening meal that can have an effect on sleep. “It’s helpful to consider what you’re consuming throughout the whole day.” Caffeine and alcohol are two of the most obvious – and well-researched – sleep-hampering substances, but one small study reported that a diet low in fibre and high in saturated fat and sugar was associated with lighter, less restorative sleep. Whereas, Gill says, “Higher dietary fibreand protein intakes have been linked to improved sleep quality.”Given the importance of melatonin in the sleep-wake cycle, it is not surprising that foods that contain it have been found to enhance aspects of sleep. Many of the interventional studies (those that add something into the diet to test its effect) have used tart cherry juice or supplementation, which, while effective, is expensive and hard to source. Ellis has a budget-friendly solution: “Eating two kiwi fruits an hour before bedtime has been shown to reduce sleep onset latency and improve sleep duration,” he says.Dietary sources of tryptophan (which include dairy, eggs, fish, chicken and turkey, as well as nuts, seeds and legumes) also appear to improve sleep outcomes, says Gill. Milk’s tryptophan content is one of the reasons a warm milky drink is such a good sleep promoter. However, the cultural aspect (we associate such drinks with bedtime) and habituation also play a role. “If a hot milky drink is part of someone’s usual going-to-bed regime, it signals to the brain to prepare for sleep,” says Ellis, who prefers a mug of decaf tea.Which brings us back to the importance both of routine – the brain’s comfort blanket – and individuality. “It’s great to know what the research says about when we should eat, exercise, work or bathe, but we must also pay attention to our own responses,” says Rubin. “There is no single perfect evening routine, there is only your perfect evening routine.”Explore more on these topicsSleepHow to have a better dayPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The days feel as if they never quite get going here at this time of year, and it’s important, as the long nights of winter drag on, to have a hobby. Here in Lerwick, the capital of the archipelago, the locals have divined a unique way of passing the time, while honouring the deep-rooted Scandinavian influences on Shetland’s culture and history.A rattling and murmuring begins to grow, and round a corner emerges a marching horde of lusty Vikings in homemade costumes, brandishing axes and round shields, beards flowing over leather breastplates. They carry turquoise standards bearing the flag of Haraldr Óláfsson, the 13th-century king of Mann and the Isles, and sing battle songs of raven flags flying in distant lands, of blazing torches and Vikings ruling over oceans vast.View image in fullscreen‘A marching horde of lusty Vikings’ in Lerwick.Photograph: Daniel StablesAs the mob approaches, a shed door creaks open behind me, and a dragon-prowed, glacial blue longship emerges, pulled on ropes by a team dozens strong. This beautiful galley will be paraded through the streets of Lerwick today before being ritualistically set ablaze – the centrepiece ofUp Helly Aa, Shetland’s riotous fire festival. As an act of ritual destruction it evokes the sand mandala, the Tibetan Buddhist practice of creating ornate cosmological artworks only to sweep them away as a metaphor for non-attachment and impermanence. “It’s a symbol of renewal,” says Lyall Gair, who has led the Up Helly Aa procession in years past and retains an impressive, Viking-worthy beard. A man standing next to us in the crowd has an alternative explanation. “There’s fuck all else to do around here all winter,” he says, shivering against the morning breeze.Hogmanay is dying in Shetland – nobody makes an effort for that any more. Up Helly Aa is the biggest thing of the yearAfter Christmas, the hootenannies, paper hats and midnight countdowns of 31 December can feel a little lame. Thankfully, Shetland offers a second bite of the cherry when it comes to seeing in the new year, with Up Helly Aa’s series of fire festivals setting the archipelago alight between January and March – timed to mark the end of the pre-Christian winter festival of Yule (others includeScalloway fire festival, also on Shetland, andUyeasoundon Unst). There are11 festivalsspread across the islands, but by far the largest and best-known is held in late January here in Lerwick, which sits on Mainland, the largest Shetland island (on 27 January in 2026).View image in fullscreenPreparing the longship.Photograph: Daniel StablesThe procession, with the galley in its wake, disappears round another corner. There will now be a lull in proceedings for the watching public, though not for the Vikings in the main procession, known as the Jarl Squad, who spend the day attending to various civic duties – a boozy brunch with local luminaries, some visits to schools and hospitals, then a lush, louche luncheon, before more processions through the streets, chanting and rattling of swords and shields, and general merriment.I take advantage of the break in the schedule to swot up on the history of the event, meeting Jolene Garriock, a tour guide withIsland Vista, atFjarå, a cafe overlooking the ocean. “The Lerwick Up Helly Aa’s been going for over 100 years, and I’ve been going for 30,” says Jolene, who grew up on the west coast of Mainland, and now lives in the Tingwall valley, a short drive from Lerwick.View image in fullscreenThe torch procession.Photograph: Roger Cracknell/Classic/AlamyUp Helly Aa seems to have begun in the 19th century, after Shetland’s young men returned from the Napoleonic wars with frazzled minds, a low boredom threshold and a facility for pyrotechnics. They channelled their energy into tar barrelling, the practice of stuffing wooden barrels with straw and tar, setting them alight and parading them through the town. Rival “squads” of tar barrellers would often brawl in the streets, leading a wide-eyed missionary, visiting in 1824, to describe Lerwick as “in an uproar: from 12 o’clock last night until late this night blowing of horns, beating of drums, tinkling of old tin kettles, firing of guns, shouting, bawling, fiddling, fifeing, drinking, fighting”.Hundreds of men in fancy dress – nuns, Wombles, French maids – are the modern incarnation of the original tar-barrelling squadsThe chaos, Jolene says, proved too much for the authorities, who by the late 19th century had done away with the tar barrelling and replaced it with the building and burning of the galley, reshaping Up Helly Aa into a celebration of Shetland’s Nordic heritage, as well as a festival celebrating the new year and return of the light. “Hogmanay is dying in Shetland – nobody makes an effort for that any more,” she says. “Up Helly Aa is the biggest thing of the year.”By the time I bid Jolene goodbye, it has long since gone dark; Lerwick’s streetlights have been extinguished in advance of the burning of the galley, and the streets are thronging with thousands of people. The Jarl Squad are out again, redder-eyed and sloppier than this morning after the day’s libations, but still in strong voice, and now carrying blazing torches. They’re followed by hundreds of men in fancy dress: nuns, Wombles, French maids. These are the modern incarnation of the original tar-barrelling squads, who have nowadays swapped brawling in the streets for touring venues across Lerwick on Up Helly Aa night, staging comedy skits.The ‘wow’ factor: island hopping and otter spotting on a family break in ShetlandRead moreThe procession files into a play park in the centre of town, where the galley lies waiting, doused in paraffin. The Jarl Squad and their entourage throw their lit torches into the belly of the boat, and before long it is engulfed in flames, warming the watching crowd. As the fire dies down and the spectators file away into the warmth of the town’s afterparty venues, for a night of comedy skits and folk dancing, soup and sandwiches, and much taking of drink, I observe the smouldering wreckage. It’s almost painful to think of the energy and care that went into the galley’s creation, only for it to go up in flames – until I remember Lyall’s words to me that morning, on Up Helly Aa’s power as a vehicle for renewal. “We just build another one next year,” he had said. “We start anew.”Up Helly Aa 2026 will take place on 27 January in Lerwick, Shetland.

But with a huge range of species out there, making the decision toswap the “big five” for more sustainable options could be a good new year resolution to aim for. Here are five species to consider – and if you’re worried these won’t taste as good as cod and chips, we’ve rounded up a selection of top chefs to tell you how to make the best of what could be on your plate in 2026.MusselsWhy are they sustainable?Most mussels are grown on ropes in the sea, limiting damage to the wider oceanic environment. They can purify the water and improve biodiversity.View image in fullscreenA classic bowl of moules marinière.Photograph: Rick Stein RestaurantsHow do I make them taste better?Delicious, versatile, easy to cookand comparatively cheap, mussels are “so underrated, they go with just about everything”, says Jack Stein, chef director at Rick Stein Restaurants. A quick steam or simmer in stock or sauce, about three to four minutes, is enough, and Stein likes a traditional moules marinière with shallots, garlic, parsley and white wine. He also recommendsanother French classic, moules mouclade– a sauce made with onion, garlic, saffron, curry powder, creme fraiche and a sprinkling of parsley to finish. Before cooking, it is crucial to look after them properly. Unpack at home and store in a bowl covered with a damp cloth in the fridge, says CJ Jackson, author of Great British Seafood Revival. Before cooking, rinse in cold water, and only use those that are closed. After cooking, discard any that remain shut.View image in fullscreenCJ Jackson, author of Great British Seafood Revival.Photograph: Steve LeeHakeWhy is it sustainable?Hake populations have benefited from an EU-wide recovery plan, and many hake netting boats use acoustic pingers, reducing the risk of accidentally catching cetaceans, says Matt Slater, marine conservation officer at Cornwall Wildlife Trust. Opt for gill-net caught hake that is Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified and avoid cape hake, which has poorer sustainability ratings, says Kerry Lyne, good fish guide manager at the Marine Conservation Society.View image in fullscreenHake is a meaty white fish, and a great alternative to cod and haddock.Photograph: Rick Stein RestaurantsHow do I make it taste better?Hake is a meaty white fish with less flaky flesh than cod and haddock. It is an excellent alternative, one which fish-and-chip-shop owners are increasingly considering, and can be baked in the oven for about 10 minutes or added in chunks to fish soups and curries.Jackson says hake is “hugely popular in the Mediterranean and much of our own landings are sold to the Spanish, who have a voracious appetite for it. Why not us?” She likes to cook hake with a simple crust using panko breadcrumbs, olive oil and herbs, alongside a tray of roast cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced red onion and fennel. Stein’s favourite method, inspired by the food writer Simon Hopkinson, is to serve poached hake alongside a tarragon mayonnaise with capers and haricot beans. “I also love pairing it with a crunchy winter salad of beetroot, cabbage and cavolo nero with a nice acidic sauce,” says Stein.MonkfishView image in fullscreenRoberta Hall-McCarron, chef-founder of restaurants including the Little Chartoom.Photograph: Christian + Amelia MastersWhy is it sustainable?There are healthy stocks around much of the UK, particularly in Cornwall and the North Sea, with catches limited by quota. According to Lyne, North Sea monkfish caught in nets is the best option.How do I make it taste better?Monkfish was once so cheap and underappreciated it was used for cat food and passed off as scampi. Things have changed – it is now a premium fish, and while its livers may be a delicacy, the tail and cheeks are easiest to prepare at home. Firm and succulent, its meat stands up to almost any method of cooking, from stir-frying to steaming, roasting to barbecuing. It takes on flavours well, from bold Korean-style marinades to punchy curries.View image in fullscreenHall-McCarron says monkfish is versatile ad can be roasted, barbecued, fried or served in soups.Photograph: Gabrielle Roberts/AwAyeMediaFor Roberta Hall-McCarron, chef-founder of three restaurants in Edinburgh, including the Little Chartroom, monkfish is “wonderful. The cheeks are so delicious, you can pan fry them, barbecue and deep-fry them.” She recently served monkfish marinated in yoghurt, garlic and chilli and then barbecued. Its meaty flesh also holds up well in soups – Hall-McCarron suggests using monkfish in a classic bouillabaisse – and its cartilaginous central bone makes excellent stock.The rise of the digital fishmonger: how Covid helped customers buy fresh from the boatRead moreAnchovies and sardinesWhy are they sustainable?Stocks are good in the south of the UK due to “low fishing effort”, says Caroline Bennett of Plymouth-based Sole of Discretion. Mostly caught in large nets, which doesn’t harm the wider environment but can remove too much at once, Bennett recommends searching those caught in smaller nets.View image in fullscreenMitch Tonks’ Venetian-style pickled sardines.Photograph: Kim Lightbody/The GuardianThough not the same, sardines and anchovies are healthy, oily fish and a good alternative to the farmed salmon that has swamped British supermarkets. Sardines and anchovies are at the bottom of the food chain, and “therefore a resilient species that can sustain relatively high levels of fishing pressure”, says Bennett. However, they are often caught on an enormous scale in the global south and used in fish feed.View image in fullscreenMitch Tonks, founder of Rockfish restaurants and fishmongers.Photograph: Ed Ovenden/RockfishHow do I make them taste better?Fresh anchovies are relatively uncommon in British fishmongers and supermarkets, but high-end tins have become de rigueur in trendy restaurants and delis. Hall-McCarron loves them on toast, laid on top of tomatoes and tapenade – make sure each ingredient is at room temperature – or blitzed into a mayonnaise for a fishy hit. Mitch Tonks, founder of Rockfish restaurants and fishmongers, says sardines are a “stunning” fish, and believes simplicity is key: sprinkle the whole fish liberally with salt and grill until the oils run out. Eat on toast with olive oil and lemon and a tomato salad on the side. “You can’t beat it,” says Tonks.ScallopsWhy are they sustainable?Look for hand-dived or Rockfish’s owndisco scallops, which are caught using lighted pots to attract the bivalves without harming the seabed. Most British scallops are dredged, which damages the seabed and should be avoided.View image in fullscreenScallops can be roasted under the grill with butter in just five minutes.Photograph: Ed Ovenden/RockfishHow do I make them taste better?Scallops are sweet and meaty – and incredibly easy to cook. Tonks says roasting them under the grill with some butter for five minutes is all you need. They also pair well with pork, particularly pancetta or black pudding – a scallop, bacon and garlic butter roll makes a superb breakfast. For something a little different, Jackson adds it to a seafood and seaweed ragu, using scallops, mussels, cockles and clams with smoked pancetta, red onion, garlic, tomatoes, white wine and fish stock.Explore more on these topicsSeafoodOn our plateFoodFishfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Food styling: Loic Parisot.Felicity Cloake's masterclassBreadHow to make garlic bread – recipeYou may think you know how to make garlic bread. But have you madethisgarlic bread?Felicity CloakeWed 31 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareOnce upon a time, an ex and I used to throw an annual party – a non-chic affair with a recycling bin full of ice and bottles – where the star, and the thing that everyone really came for, was the garlic bread: 10 or 15 loaves of the stuff, always demolished while still dangerously hot from the oven. I believe the original recipe was Nigel Slater’s; this is my tweaked version.Prep15 minCook25 minMakes1 loaf1 ciabatta loaf, or baguette – a slightly stale one, ideally80g room-temperature butter, salted or unsalted4 garlic cloves1 small bunch parsley, or another herb of your choice (see step 6)40g parmesan, or similar hard cheese, finely grated, plus a little extra for toppingA squeeze of lemon juice, to finishSalt, to taste (if using unsalted butter)1 Make ahead, if need beYou can prepare this ahead of time (and you should, too, if you want to get the smell of garlic off your hands before the festivities begin) – the day before, or even up to a month in advance (in which case, wrap, freeze and bake straight from frozen, though, if you do so, add five to 10 minutes to the cooking time). In both cases, wrap it well in foil before storing.2 A note on the breadWhile day-old bread is easier to butter, it must still be soft enough to absorb large quantities of butter (anything too dense or crisp will repel it) and robust enough to maintain its structural integrity once soaked. Brioche, for example, is usually too soft and focaccia too oily.Nigel’s baguetteis good for big parties, butIna Garten’s softer ciabattais my favourite.3 Slice the breadCut deep, thick slits into the loaf – about 2cm apart is ideal – but do not cut right through it. To this end, I find it helpful to put a chopstick on each side of the loaf while cutting it, so the knife is unable to get all the way down to the board.View image in fullscreen4 Beat the butterPut the butter (salted or unsalted, up to you, but remember to season if using the latter) in a bowl, anchor it to a work surface using a damp tea towel, then beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until softened. Alternatively, use electric beaters or the paddle attachment on a food mixer, but it’s not hard by hand.5 Crush the garlicView image in fullscreenPeel and crush the garlic to a paste using a garlic crusher, a pestle and mortar or the flat of a large knife – if you’re sensitive to raw garlic, you may wish to reduce the quantity, but avoid using the jarred ready-chopped sort, or indeed tubes of garlic paste, because they won’t taste right. For alternative flavourings, see step 9.6 Finely chop the parsleyTrim the dry ends off the parsley stalks (it doesn’t matter if it’s flat-leaf or curly, because it’ll all look green in the end), then wash the rest of the bunch and shake dry. Finely chop the leaves and soft stems. I often use chives instead, or a mixture of finely chopped thyme and rosemary leaves (be a little less generous with the latter, because they have a much stronger flavour).View image in fullscreen7 Flavour the butterStir the garlic and herbs into the softened butter, then mix in the cheese – any strong hard cheese will do here, or use something milder, if you prefer (mozzarella or medium cheddar, for example), as long as it melts. If catering to strict vegetarians, check the label. Add a squeeze of lemon and, if you’re using unsalted butter, a pinch of salt.8 Pack into the loaf and bakeDivide the butter between the slits cut into the bread, being careful not to tear them apart – I use my fingers to spread it in – then wrap the loaf in foil and store in the fridge or freezer, depending on how far ahead you’re working. When you’re ready to cook, bake the wrapped loaf at 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 for about 20 minutes, then unwrap, sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake unwrapped for five minutes more (keep an eye on it at this stage, because dryer bread will colour more quickly).View image in fullscreen9 Alternative flavouringsInstead of fresh garlic, you may prefer the mellower flavour of roast garlic, or the black variety, or to substitute finely chopped fresh chilli, or jarred chipotle chilli, coriander and a spritz of lime. Crunchy crumbled bacon bits work, too, as do finely chopped semi-dried tomatoes and olives, anchovies or even Marmite. Basically, if it goes well with cheese, it should work here.Explore more on these topicsBreadFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodNew yearSnacksCheeseHerbs and spicesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The thought of another roast dinner makes me yawn, so something with spice feels exciting. Biryani, with its layered complexity of flavour and texture, has always been the ultimate celebratory centrepiece for guests to congregate around, and it needs little accompaniment bar a bowl of cooling raita. This meat-free version made with tender paneer koftas is light and fresh, yet still warming and packed with flavour. End on a sweet note with an incredible, Indian inflected tiramisu, which is fragrant with saffron and rich with nuts. Happy 2026!Malai kofta biryani with apple (pictured top)For an even more opulent biryani, tuck a couple of raisins and chopped cashews into the centre of each kofta. The addition of apple to raita is unusual, but I love the fresh, sweet, sharpness that granny smiths bring to it.Prep25 minCook1 hr 15 minServes4For the koftas300gpaneer, grated2 medium potatoes, boiled until tender, then gratedSea salt and pepper1 handful fresh coriander, finely chopped1 green chilli, finely chopped½tsp ground cardamom¼tsp turmeric2tsp cornflour1tbsp plain flour3tbsp gheeFor the curry2tbsp ghee1 cinnamon stick, broken up2 green cardamom pods2 cloves1tbsp cumin seeds1 medium red onion, peeled and very finely chopped2cm piece ginger, peeled and finely grated2 fat garlic cloves,peeled and finely chopped1 green chilli, finely chopped1tbsp tomato puree2 medium tomatoes, skinned and pureed1tsp kashmiri red chilli powder, or mild chilli powder15 cashews, soaked in hot water for 30 minutes, then blended to a paste125g yoghurt, beaten with 50ml waterFor the rice500g basmati rice1 cinnamon stick½tspblack peppercorns4 cardamom pods, bruised1tsp cumin seeds1tsp saltTo garnish1 generous pinchsaffron, soaked in 50ml warm milk2tbsp melted gheeA few mint leaves1 handful toasted cashew nutsCrispy onions, or shallots (optional)Mix all the kofta ingredients bar the ghee, then roll into ping-pong-ball-sized koftas (you should get about 24 in all ), making sure the surface is smooth and there are no cracks. Melt the ghee in a large, heavy-based pan, then fry the koftas in batches until golden brown all over. Drain on kitchen paper.In the same pan, melt the ghee for the curry and fry the whole spices until they sizzle and turn fragrant. Add the onion, saute on a low heat for 15 minutes, until dark and caramelised, then add the ginger, garlic and chilli, and fry for a minute until aromatic.Add the tomato puree, fry for two minutes until it starts to release its oil, then tip in the pureed tomatoes and kashmiri red chilli powder and leave to bubble for five to eight minutes, until thickened. Off the heat, stir in the cashews and yoghurt, then return to a low heat, add the koftas and cook slowly for five minutes, making sure not to boil the curry otherwise it will split. Season to taste, then transfer half the curry to a bowl.Put the rice, spices, salt and two litres of water in a second saucepan, bring to a boil and cook for five to six minutes, until the rice is 80% cooked – it should still have some bite when you break it between your fingers – then drain.Spoon half the rice over the curry in the pan, drizzle half the saffron milk and melted ghee over the top, then spoon on the reserved curry and cover with the remaining rice. Finish with the remaining saffron milk and ghee, cover tightly with foil, pop on the lid and cook on a low heat for 10 minutes.Take off the heat, leave the biryani to stand for 15 minutes, then sprinkle over the torn mint leaves, cashews and crispy onions, if using, and serve with apple and raisin raita below.Apple and raisin raitaView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s apple and raisin raita.The addition of apple to raita is unusual, but I love the fresh, sweet, sharpness that granny smiths bring to it.Prep15 minServes6500g Greek yoghurt100ml whole milk2 granny smith apples,peeled and, grated and dressed with a few drops of lemon juice (to stop browning)40g raisins,soaked in hot water for 20 minutes and drained15g mint,picked and finely chopped1 green chilli,finely chopped (pith and seeds out of youremoved, if you don’t like the heat)1 teaspoontsp cumin,rtoasted and roughly crushedSea salt and pepper to tasteWhisk the yoghurt in a bowl with the milk to loosen and, then add all the otherremaining ingredients and mix well.

It is rich, creamy and delicious, yet also light as a feather. Simply put, it’s tiramisu with an Indian accent.Prep10 minInfuse1 hr+Cook30 minChill4 hr+Serves8For the soaking milk300ml milk4 cardamom pods, lightly crushed30g caster sugar1 pinch saffron threadsFor the zabaione2 egg yolks50g caster sugarFor the tiramisu500g mascarpone250g double cream1tbsp rosewater2 egg whites200g packet savoiardi biscuits, or sponge fingersTo garnish1 handfultoasted flaked almonds1 handfulchopped pistachiosGently warm the milk, cardamom and sugar until the sugar dissolves, then let it come to a simmer (but do not let it boil), take off the heat and stir in the saffron. Leave to infuse for at least an hour, or overnight, then set aside three tablespoons of it.To make the zabaione, whisk the egg yolks, sugar and a tablespoon of water in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a saucepan of simmering water, until pale and thick. In a second bowl, whisk the mascarpone, cream and rosewater, then fold them through the zabaione. In a third bowl, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then fold through the zabaione mixture.Briefly dip half the sponge fingers in the saffron milk, then lay them in the base of a 25cm serving dish. Spoon over half the zabaione mixture and top with half the nuts. Repeat with the remaining sponge fingers dipped in soaking milk, then dollop on the rest of the zabaione mixture and smooth the top.Refrigerate for four to six hours, then serve sprinkled with the remaining nuts and saffron milk.Explore more on these topicsFoodMain courseCheeseIndian food and drinkCurryRiceDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"

How did the car boot get hip again?Sinéad CampbellWed 31 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 13.42 ESTShareIt’s a crisp Sunday morning in south-west London. Tucked within rows of terrace houses, the playground of a primary school has been transformed into an outdoor treasure trove. Tables are filled with stacks of books and board games; clothes hang from metal racks or are piled into boxes which are strewn over a hopscotch. It’s the 10am opening of Balham car boot sale. A modest queue filters through the entrance: families, pensioners, fashion influencers, TikTokers.Three friends – Dominique Gowie, Abbie Mitchell (both 25 years old) and Affy Chowdhury (26) – arrived an hour earlier, to set up. They are selling at a car boot for the first time, enticed by the growing hype circulating on social media.“If you go out and say: ‘Oh I bought this at the car boot,’ I think it’s actually cooler than saying I bought this on Asos,” says Dominique.“If you go into Zara and H&M, it’ll be the same stuff. But here I think you’ll find something really unique, especially on this stall,” says Affy, gesturing towards three bedroom floors’ worth of hardlyworn clothing flung over a picnic table.View image in fullscreenFirst-time sellers at Balham car boot sale: (from left) Affy, Abbie and Dominique.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianLike a pub roast or a needless apology, a car boot sale is a quintessential British pastime; a staple weekend activity for those willing to venture into a field at 6am to flog old DVDs from the boot of their car at 50p a pop. But the Balham organisers, like others across the country, have rebranded the British car boot to represent something slightly moreen vogue.“It’s not like a traditional market in a field filled with tools and stuff,” says owner Steven Lopes, 36, who first founded Balham and its sister car boot in Peckham in 2019 with his partner, Erin Murphy, 34, who also runs a vintage store in east London.“I have been going since I was young, always buying bits to wear and then selling them. There was a bit of a gap in south-east London,” says Murphy. The pair envisioned a car boot that would represent the style of the city while maintaining a family-friendly, nostalgic atmosphere.The fashionably later start (car boots typically kick off at the crack of dawn) feels typical of this new breed of sale. “It’s a chill Sunday,” says Lopes. “Go and meet your mates, have a little mooch around. You can be hungover, there’s no real pressure.”View image in fullscreenA stall selling vintage necklaces at Balham car boot sale.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianMurphy estimates that about 20 people showed up in the first few months of the car boot opening six years ago. Now, she guesses that 1,000 to 2,000 people attend every other weekend.A similar surge has been observed at Rummage in the Range, a car boot sale in Manchester, which sees “a queue down the street with probably 300 people at 10am”, says organiser Andrew Newens, 43. The upmarket rebrand of the “car boot style meets flea market” is something Rummage has also embraced. “Although we consider ourselves a car boot, it’s not got that old-school thing that people might be used to. You can get something for 50p or £50. I think that brings different demographics together,” he says.A card machine is rarely in sight. Part of the joy of a car boot is that it offers a quaint, charming alternative in an increasingly cashless society – something that Lopes believes helps a more considered habit of spending. “It’s a nice feeling when you’ve got cash in your hand: it sets a limit and it’s more fun,” he says, although he admits he puts through the occasional PayPal transaction.“It has an inner-city feel,” says Lopes of his London iterations. “There’s cool stuff.” It’s this element of “coolness” that has attracted the Salomon-wearing crowd who may ordinarily be found at a pop-up for a designer sample sale – seemingly ushering in the gentrification of the British car boot into a revolving door for fashion-focused resellers and influencers.As many shoppers and sellers attest, the growing interest in car boot sales is directly in alignment to the younger generation’s affinity with secondhand shopping in general, for a list of reasons: the cost of living crisis, the higher quality of vintage fabrics, the thrill of “the hunt” and the desire to find something unique.With the popularity of reselling apps such as Depop and Vinted, secondhand shopping has shot up in recent years. Research shows that themarket for secondhand goods has increased to £4.3bnthis year (including “open-box” items, where an item has been returned unused, and refurbished goods). The average person in the UK spends £124.80 a month on secondhand items, compared with £58.40 five years ago.View image in fullscreenVendor Floris Wake making a sale at the Balham car boot sale.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianBut like other social media platforms, reselling apps dictated by algorithmically fed content often promote overconsumption rather than a discipline of mindful, sustainable shopping. Emily Jenkins first opened her shop on Depop 10 years ago when she was a teenager. But now, she has retired the apps and exclusively sells at markets and car boots. “I can get a bit triggerhappy on Vinted – I think it’s quite addictive,” she says. “People want to get clothes that they know they’re actually going to wear. I think people are quite conscious about what they’re buying.”Much of the increased interest is also due to the work of secondhand fashion influencers putting the British car boot on the digital map. Becky Chorlton, 27, a fashion reseller and car boot content creator from Cheshire, trails the country looking for the best bargains, and documents her journey online. “I’ve definitely noticed the popularity grow,” says Chorlton, who has made her hobby a full-time job, amassing more than 30m likes onTikTok.Freddie Stoten, 25, a vintage clothing reseller who has been selling at car boots in and around London for seven years, has witnessed the shifting demographic and increased popularity, much to the benefit of his business pursuits. “There’s definitely been a spike,” he says. But there’s also a downside: “Seven years ago it was easier to buy better stuff. Now it’s a lot more competitive,” he says, while dealing with a haggling customer trying to get a vintage Nike jumper down to a fiver.View image in fullscreen‘We love a car boot’ … Andrea and Dash Bradley.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Guardian“From a selling perspective, it’s 10 times better because people are aware of it,” says Stoten. “There’s more footfall.”Another factor, he says, is that “it’s basically the cheapest rent you’re going to get in comparison with storefronts and other markets”.Drive-in pitches at Balham car boot cost up to £35, with walk-ins £10 – a small price to pay compared with the elite ranks of Portobello Road, where securing a pitch apparently requires insider political power play, as well as the money – up to £50 on a Saturday.Car boot sales: expert tips on how to grab the best bargainsRead moreJenkins, 26, a frequent car boot seller, is shifting her stock of Y2K fur coats and vintage Vivienne Westwood crop tops. “It goes to Portobello first and then if it’s not gone there, it comes down here,” she says. “It starts at a fiver, up to about £25 – it’s nice getting rid of things cheaply. It means everything’s a lot less wasteful.”The communal aspect of meeting up in a car park on a Saturday morning will always be something reselling apps can’t replicate. “It’s a little bit like a community and it’s so much fun,” says Chorlton about her favourite car boot, Skirlington Market in East Yorkshire.In Balham, Andrea, 51, and Dash Bradley, 15, a mother and son who have been going to car boots for years, echo this sentiment. “A lot of people are into getting secondhand clothes and using apps like Vinted, but you don’t get the full story behind what you’re buying and the physical person-to-person interactions,” says Dash.“We love a car boot,” says Andrea. “But we were going to them before they were cool.”Explore more on these topicsFashionTikTokShoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps all of us are capable of more than we might expectEmma BeddingtonWed 31 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 00.25 ESTShareWho among us hasn’t yearned, at least momentarily, to cast off the trappings of our comfortable lives and live wild, unfettered and free? This year someone showed us the way: a charismatic Aussie sausage dog (I believe that’s “snag” in local vernacular). Whether you already carry Valerie the miniature dachshund’s story in your heart or managed, somehow, to miss the pint-sized phenomenon’s incredible journey, join me as we revisit this heart-warming tale.View image in fullscreenThe little black dot in the field believed to be Valerie.Photograph: Courtesy of Georgia GardnerIn November 2023, Valerie was a one-year-old “absolute princess” of a pup – those are the words of her emotional support human, Georgia Gardner, who received the sausage as agraduation gift. A diminutive 15cm high, she needed a ramp to help her get into bed in her New South Wales home and wore a pink sweater in chilly weather, with matching pink collar and lead. But Valerie chose to swap her pampered life of roast chicken and pupuccinos for freedom in the dangerous wilds of Kangaroo Island, South Australia, escaping while Gardner and boyfriend Josh Fishlock were on holiday there.Valerie’s audacious jailbreak happened when the couple took a brief trip to the beach, leaving their beloved chipolata behind in a cosy, seemingly secure and well-equipped playpen. Not so – before they had even set up their fishing rods, a fellow camper came rushing to tell them she had escaped and had hidden under a truck, rebuffing locals’ coaxing approaches, before hot-tailing it to the hills.After five days searching for Valerie with the aid of local volunteers, the pair were forced to return home without her, which should have been the tragic end of the story. Valerie was an unlikely candidate to give Bear Grylls a run for his money. In addition to her teeny stature,“She was not a very outside, rough-and-tough dog,”Gardner said. “To think that she even went one night outside in the rain – oh my gosh.” Kangaroo Island is a vast, unforgiving expanse of bush, stalked by snakes and eagles and notably lacking in fancy dachshund food or bed ramps. The odds of her surviving seemed slim to nonexistent and everyone feared the (sorry) wurst.Video footage of Valerie in the ‘trap’.Video footage of Valerie in the ‘trap’.But, as my friend who was basically raised by sausage dogs explains: “Dachshunds have no fear and are quite, quite mad.” Somehow – and the how remains a matter of hot debate – Valerie survived. In February, 15 months after her disappearance, and following a number of reported sightings by locals (one of whom captured this distant black dot believed to be our girl), the couple received solid intel that the intrepid beast had been sighted alive and well, around 10 miles from where she first broke free.Contacted by Gardner to verify the news, Kangala Wildlife Rescue, a local organisation headed by husband-and-wife team Jarrad and Lisa Karran, set up camera traps baited with roast chicken and sardines to tempt her, and waited. Their hard work was eventually rewarded with footage of the fugitive that swiftly went global.View image in fullscreenOn the lam … one of the Kangala Wildlife Rescue images of Valerie.Photograph: Kangala Wildlife RescueIn one video, Valerie frolics into shot on her stumpy little legs, laser-focused on the care package left for her. She pounces on it with a savagery belying her size. The footage was brief but it was apparent she was not just surviving but thriving – the diminutive princess was glossy and flourishing, her pink collar still intact. Kangaroo Island is six times bigger than Singapore; Valerie is the size of a baguette. Aslocal councillor Sam Mumfordput it, “I can’t believe the damn thing’s still alive.”How on earth had she coped for so long in the unforgiving wilderness? Quizzed by the many media outlets avidly following every twist and turn of her tiny tail, locals gave their theories.Kangaroo Island mayor Michael Pengillyand many others believed someone must be feeding her.Wildlife guide Craig Wickhamthought she was surviving on roadkill, commenting, “I doubt the sausage dog has become an apex predator.” Professor Paul McGreevy, of the University of Sydney’s veterinary school,also weighed in: “Hypothetically, she could eat birds, frogs and mice … unfortunately, the reality is that dogs are opportunists and they will eat faecal material.” Whatever she was doing, it seemed to suit her.View image in fullscreenReunited … Valerie with owners Josh Fishlock and Georgia Gardner.Photograph: Kangala Wildlife Rescue and Georgia GardnerDespite being on the lam and living on her wits for over a year, Valerie seemed entirely happy. She showed no desire to be rescued and fled at the sight of people or vehicles;Kangala described heras “impossible to catch”. Professor McGreevy (my favourite of the stellar cast of supporting characters in this story)provided a pithy theoryas to why she was resisting arrest: back pain. “If I was the shape of a dachshund, with a predisposition to a bad back … they get scooped up a lot and often have awful back pain. No wonder it’s telling everyone to fuck off.”Local resident Louise Custancesuggested that Valerie “decided she didn’t want to go back to the city. She liked the island lifestyle, and she’s probably had some support from farm animals or wildlife to stay alive.” WhileKangala co-director Lisa Karransaid that probably, “possums or cats out there were grooming her”. Wild animals feeding a pampered urban princess and teaching her bushcraft survival skills?! I’m casting this Pixar movie in my head already: Nicole Kidman in the role of her life as Valerie, Guy Pearce as a wily bandicoot, Rebel Wilson as a possum, and Russell Crowe as an alpha male kangaroo with a couple of Hemsworth sidekicks; tell me I’m wrong.Proof of life had been conclusively established, but catching Valerie proved complex for the team at Kangala. Wary and elusive, she would snatch a snack, then disappear for days. In addition, the baited camera traps proved a little too popular with other local wildlife. “The other night we had five possums, two wallabies and a feral cat all in the cage at the same time,”explained Jared Karran(See? Pixar movie).Valerie after her rescue.Valerie after her rescue.After what the Karrans described as a “long, tough, battle”, they hit on asuccessful sausage-trapping strategywith cameras and a tricked-out dog crate: “Her own little room with her toys and bed from home, mum’s clothing, hidden food and challenges to keep her entertained” and, crucially, a remotely operated door. Valerie started to visit the crate and seemed to like it: “We have seen an amazing change in Valerie’s demeanour recently as she begins to remember all those familiar smells, tastes and sounds,” Kangala reported on itsFacebook page. After a few visits, her fate was sealed. “It all worked perfectly,”saidJared Karran. After 529 days in the wilderness and an estimated 1,000 hours of volunteer time, her adventure was over. The moment was captured, on video: she gives the camera an unbothered glance, apparently accepting the fait accompli: “She just curled up and went to sleep,”Jared Karran said.Kangala staff were concerned that Valerie’s battle to survive might have triggered “lost dog syndrome” – a stress response which could make her fearful and uninterested in humans; locals speculated she might have gone feral. But first contact at the trap went better than expected. “She was up at the front, barking and communicating with us,”Lisa Karran said. Back at the refuge she was swiftly fitted with an “anti-escape harness” (pink, of course).View image in fullscreenValerie, living the VIP life.Photograph: Kerry Martin (Puppy Tales Photography)/Puppy TalesA video showed the former fugitive playful, wriggly, glossy-coated, and in rude health. Like many stars, Kangala staff said she seemed smaller than she looked on screen: “She’s got, like, an inch clearance under her belly, tiny little legs,”Jared Karran marvelled. Despite her diminutive size, Valerie hadsomehow managed to gain 1.8kgduring her “ordeal” – almost half her original bodyweight (4kg). How? The “someone was feeding her” theorists felt vindicated, but my sausage-dog authority was unsurprised. “To paraphrase Elizabeth I, they may have the legs of a decorative footstool, but they have the heart and stomach of a beast – and a beast of considerable size too.” Either way, Valerie was no longer a “little princess”, but a mighty queen.After a period of acclimatisation, Valerie was finally reunited with an overjoyed Gardner and Fishlock. She was “making her little happy sounds, and wiggling around with joy”,Gardner said, and could barely fit into her old harness. The couple were thrilled to bring her home, despite the fact that in her absence they had actually acquired another dachsie, Dorothy, “to keep the memories alive”. Valerie’s response to this usurper has not been recorded, but her lookin this picturehas strong “And I’d do it again” energy, if you ask me.View image in fullscreenValerie, back in the lap of luxury.Photograph: Kangala Wildlife RescueWhat next? The happy ever after of our era:brand partnerships. Valerie is now an “official ambassador” for a dog product company, The Paws Room, offering meet and greets, like other contemporary celebrities. There’s a Valerie-themed beer that “celebrates resilience”, an “unauthorised” book in the works, and Australia has even enjoyed a biopic of sorts, dramatising her rescue:Dog Gone: The Hunt for Valerie. She’s living the VIP life, but I wonder if she ever dreams of the wild; running free under starry skies, dodging black tiger snakes and wedge-tailed eagles, being (possibly) fed by possums?Long may she continue to thrive. For Valerie has given us that rare commodity in 2025: optimism. Like Valerie, we might all discover we are capable of extraordinary things.Explore more on these topicsValerie the dachshund2025: what happened next?AnimalsDogsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Turnout stood at 80.95%, according to Djenabou Touré, the head of the general directorate of elections.Doumbouya had placed well ahead in districts of the capital, Conakry, often winning more than 80%, according to official partial results read out by Touréearlier on RTG public television.Opposition anger as Guinea’s junta leader is frontrunner to be elected presidentRead moreHe had a similar lead in several other areas, including Coyah, a town near Conakry, and in other parts of the country, such as Boffa and Fria in the west, Gaoual in the north-west, northern Koundara and Labe, and Nzerekore in the south-east.However, a citizens’ movement calling for the return of civilian rule questioned the figure. “A huge majority of Guineans chose to boycott the electoral charade,” the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution said in a statement on Monday.In September 2021, Doumbouya led a coup to topple Guinea’s first freely elected president, Alpha Condé. He has cracked down on civil liberties and banned protests, while opponents have been arrested, put on trial or driven into exile.The candidate Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé denounced “serious irregularities” in the poll. Another candidate, Faya Millimono, complained of “electoral banditry” linked, he said, to influence exerted on voters.In late September, Guineans approved a new constitution in a referendum that permitted junta members to run for office, paving the way for Doumbouya’s candidacy. It also lengthened presidential terms from five to seven years, renewable once.The opposition leader, the former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo, was one of three opposition leaders barred from standing by the new constitution. Diallo was excluded because he lives in exile and his primary residence is outside of Guinea.Explore more on these topicsGuineaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The drills, called “Justice Mission 2025”, came closer to Taiwan than previous exercises, and involved at least 89 warplanes, the highest tally for more than a year.The drills were expected by analysts before the year’s end but were also connected by Chinese commentators to a recent arms approval by the US government for a record$11bn (£8bn) weapons sales to Taiwan.Speaking in Beijing on Wednesday evening, Xi said China “embraced the world with open arms” and highlighted several multilateral conferences hosted by Beijing this year, including theShanghai Cooperation Summitin August, when world leaders including Russia’s Vladimir Putin, India’s Narendra Modi and Turkey’sRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, gathered in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing.The broadcast of Xi’s speech on Chinese state media was interspersed with several shots of China’slargest ever military parade, which was held in September to mark 80 years since the end of the second world war. During the parade, which was viewed as an unbridled display of military force, Xi, Putin and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, stood side by side in Beijing – a geopolitical alignment that hasbeen called the “axis of upheaval”.Central to Xi’s vision of a new world order is the annexation of Taiwan and the support of other countries in recognising Taiwan as part of “One China” ruled by the Chinese Communist party in Beijing, something that the majority of Taiwanese people reject.In his speech, Xi also highlighted “Taiwan Retrocession Day”, a memorial day created in 2025 to mark the anniversary of the end of Japanese imperial rule in Taiwan in 1945. This year, Taiwan also passed a law to recognise the date, 25 October, as a national holiday. The legacy of the second world war has been a big theme in political rhetoric in China and Taiwan this year. China has emphasised its role in defeating the Japanese in that conflict, something that China feels has been underappreciated in the west. Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, gave apunchy speechthis year comparing Taiwan to European democracies in the 1930s that faced a threat from Nazi Germany.Xi’s speech also praised China’s progress inhi-tech developmentthis year, mentioningkickboxing robotsand Tianwen-2, a comet exploration mission that launched in May. He also flagged the global success of Chinese cultural exports, such as the video gameBlack Myth: Wukongand the animated filmNe Zha 2.Earlier in the day, Xi addressed a meeting of top Chinese Communist party officials and said that China was on track to meet its 5% GDP growth target.Explore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingAsia PacificTaiwannewsShareReuse this content"

The increase in Chinese sales has alarmed EU countries, particularly Germany and France, who fear losing millions of automotive jobs if the industry shrivels.Graph showing increase of sales of Chinese brands in the UK in 2024 and 2025Norway leads the world in EV take-up, helped by generous purchase subsidies, but inSpainand the UK a large number of the Chinese cars on offer are hybrids, which combine a petrol engine with a small battery.Tu Le, the founder of Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy, said: “The Chinese are tackling the EU region by region since there are pockets of support in some areas and pockets of opposition in others.”Neither the UK nor Norway have imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, as the EU has done, leaving them open to battery car sales.According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a lobby group, Chinese manufacturers sold 187,800 cars in the UK out of total sales of 1.87m during the first 11 months of the year – double last year’s sales.Schmidt said theUK was a particularly juicy target for Chinese brandsbecause it is a large market with no British mass-market champions. Rover ceased trading in the early 2000s, Vauxhall is part of the Stellantis conglomerate, while MGs are made in China by state-owned SAIC.“With no genuine domestic volume brands for UK consumers to choose from, UK consumers crucially can no longer participate in what is known as patriotic purchasing,” he said.“In Germany and France, half of each country’s new-car market is effectively in the control of domestic brands. While inChina, we now also see two-thirds of the market is accounted for by domestic brands.”The manufacturers that are losing out on UK sales appeared to be Japanese. Nissan and Toyotahave factories in the UKbut that has not prevented them from losing nearly a percentage point of market share apiece in the past year. Honda and Suzuki sales also dropped, while Mitsubishi has pulled out completely.TheEU imposed tariffs of between 17% and 38%on Chinese electric cars last year, in an effort to level the playing field. However, the tariffs apply to electric cars only, leaving a large back door for Chinese manufacturers to win market share by undercutting European manufacturers on sales of hybrids as well.Schmidt’s analysis showed that less than 40% of all Chinese-brand models entering western Europe during the third quarter of 2025 were pure battery electric. That means that the design of the EU tariffs has allowed Chinese manufacturers to continue to undercut European rivals, while also pushing them to sell more polluting models.The EUwatered down its targets for electric car salesrecently, saying it will allow 10% of sales to continue to have internal combustion engines after 2035 – it had previously planned to ban them entirely. European carmakers had lobbied hard for the changes, arguing they need to continue selling petrol and diesel cars to earn enough profits to invest in battery car factories.However, some car executives and analysts have argued that slowing the transition in Europe willallow Chinese carmakers to race further ahead. Schmidt has forecast that Chinese manufacturers’ share will peak just shy of 10% across Europe between 2028 and 2030, while China’s share of the battery car market will peak at 13%.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsChinaAsia PacificEconomic policyEconomicsManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

This is reflected by there being only one lavatory containing two cubicles for the lower house’s 73 women to use near the Diet’s main plenary session hall in central Tokyo.“Before plenary sessions start, truly so many women lawmakers have to form long queues in front of the restroom,” said Yasuko Komiyama, from the opposition Constitutional Democratic party.She was speaking after submitting the cross-party petition signed by 58 women to Yasukazu Hamada, the chair of the lower house committee on rules and administration, earlier this month.The Diet building was finished in 1936, nearly a decade before women got the vote in December 1945 after Japan’s defeat in the second world war. The entire lower house building has 12 men’s toilets with 67 stalls and nine women’s facilities with a total of 22 cubicles, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.Japan ranked 118 out of 148 this year in the World Economic Forum’s global gender gap report.Womenare also grossly under-represented in business and the media.In elections, women candidates say that they often have to deal with sexist jibes, including being told that they should be at home looking after children.Seventy-two of 465 lower house lawmakers are women, up from 45 in the previous parliament, as are 74 of the 248 upper house members. The government’s stated target is to have women occupy at least 30% of the legislative seats.Takaichi, an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, said before becoming prime minister that she wanted “Nordic” levels of gender balance. But in the endshe appointed just two other women to her 19-strong cabinet.Takaichi, 64, has said she hoped to raise awareness about women’s health struggles and has spoken candidly about her own experience with the menopause. But she is still seen as socially conservative. She opposes revising a 19th-century law requiring married couples to share the same surname, and wants the imperial family to retain male-only succession.The increasing demand for female toilets could be seen as a sign of progress in Japan although it also reflected the country’s failure to achieve gender equality, Komiyama said.“In a way, this symbolises how the number of female lawmakers has increased,” she told reporters, according to her party’s website, adding that she hoped for more equality in other areas of life.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificSanae TakaichiWomen in politicsWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Differences should be managed through dialogue, not the use of force or coercion,” the statement said.“Australia opposes any unilateral action to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. Peace and stability are in all our interests.“Australian officials have raised concerns with Chinese counterparts.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe PLA, the armed wing of China’s ruling Communist party, fired 27 missiles from the Chinese coastline into waters near Taiwan on Tuesday, according to Taiwan’s defence ministry.At least 70 Chinese war planes, 11 navy ships and 14 from China’s militarised coast guard were also detected.The Taiwanese defence ministry said the missiles came closer to Taiwan’s main island than in previous live-fire drills.Some landed in Taiwan’s 24-nautical mile contiguous zone, and at least 13 ships were also detected within those restricted waters, the ministry said.Trump ‘not worried’ as China’s live-fire Taiwan wargame enters second dayRead moreIn the 24 hours from 6am on Monday, the military detected 130 war planes, 28 ships, amphibious assault ships, and one surveillance balloon.It is the sixth major PLA military exercise targeting Taiwan since 2022, when it launched days of live-fire drills in retaliation for the-then US speaker, Nancy Pelosi, visiting the island. In April, it held a two-day operation labelled Strait Thunder-2025A, prompting expectations for a “B” before year’s end.Analysts said it was the first time the PLA had explicitly said it was practising deterring international involvement. Also, unusually, a number of PLA aircraft remained visible on radar platforms.Asked about the drills on Monday, the US president, Donald Trump, said he had a great relationship with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, “and he hasn’t told me anything about it”.“I certainly have seen it … I don’t believe he is going to be doing it,” Trump said, appearing to refer to an actual invasion. “Nothing worries me.”Beijing claims Taiwan is a Chinese province and is preparing to annex it militarily, with the aim of being capable of invasion by 2027, according to US intelligence from several years ago.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyChinaTaiwanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite the restrictions being categorised as “partial”, visas will only be issued in a handful of exceptional circumstances – to US government employees, for example.Despair for would-be US citizens as American dream blocked by TrumpRead moreTonga – population 100,000 – is the only Pacific island country included in the list. The White House said the restrictions were justified by a high rate of Tongans overstaying their visas – more than 14% for some visa categories, the US government said.The US holds the largest number of diaspora Tongans, estimated at about 70,000. Most are in San Francisco, California, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Altogether, there are about 150,000 Tongans outside Tonga.The ban has been met with anger and concern, with many questioning the justification. “Tongans are not a threat to US security,” said Dr Tevita Kaili, a Tongan professor at Brigham Young University, Hawaii.“The Tongan government sent troops to both Iraq and Afghanistan to support US security. In the United Nations, the majority of the Tongan government’s votes align with the US.“The claim that the US is protecting its security by restricting Tongans from travelling to the US is unfounded.”The restrictions do not only affect those wishing to travel to the US, but also Tongans already on work or student visas in the US, who do not wish to travel home as they may not be able to return. Kaili expressed concern that at graduation ceremonies, no parents or relatives would be able to travel to the US to celebrate with their children.“It will be sad to see a decline in the number of Tongan students at my university in January 2026 due to the travel restrictions. Currently, Tongans constitute the second-largest international student population at my university,” Kaili said.Senator Jarrett Keohokalole from Hawaii was also critical. “I strongly denounce the inclusion of Tonga on this list. Singling out Tonga is unjustified and deeply offensive to the people of Hawaii, where Polynesian identity is foundational.”The decision disproportionately harmed Pacific island communities and reflected a broader pattern of immigration policies targeting communities of colour, Keohokalole said.He cited Hawaii’s longstanding genealogical, cultural and family connections with Tonga and the broader Pacific, with many residents maintaining close ties to relatives overseas. Adding Tonga to the federal travel ban unfairly singled out Pacific island communities and sent an alarming message to Polynesians both abroad and in Hawaii, Keohokalole said.Melino Maka, a Tongan community leader in New Zealand, echoed the concerns.“I know that our family members have made the US their home for many generations but right now with what this current administration does not see us worthy, those connections are based on the colour of our skin. For my money I’d rather work on the current relationship with China rather than chasing this road to nowhere.”Explore more on these topicsTongaPacific islandsAsia PacificUS immigrationTrump administrationTrump travel bannewsShareReuse this content"

Chinese beef imports will decline in 2026 as a result of the measures, said Hongzhi Xu, senior analyst at Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultants.“China’s beef-cattle farming is not competitive compared with countries such as Brazil and Argentina,” Xu said. “This cannot be reversed in the short term through technological advancements or institutional reforms.”Australia seeks direct resolution of trade dispute with China before WTO rulingRead moreIn 2024, China imported 1.34 million tons of beef from Brazil, 594,567 tons from Argentina, 243,662 tons from Uruguay, 216,050 tons from Australia, 150,514 tons from New Zealand and 138,112 tons from the U.S.In the first 11 months of this year, Brazil shipped 1.33 million tons of beef to China, according to Chinese customs data, well above the quota levels set under Beijing’s new measures.Also this year, Australian shipments to China have surged, gaining share at the expense of US beef after Beijing in March allowed permits to expire at hundreds of American meat plants and as Donald Trump unleashed a tit-for-tat tariff war.Responding to Beijing’s announcement, Mark Thomas, the chair of the Western Beef Association in Australia, said: “There’s plenty of other countries that will take our product.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsChinaBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

It includes Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube.Le MondeandFrance Inforeported on Wednesday that a draft bill was now complete and contained two measures: a ban on social media for under-15s and a ban on mobile phones in high schools, where 15- to 18-year-olds study. Phones have already beenbanned in primary and middle schools.The bill will be submitted to France’s Conseil d’État for legal review in the coming days. Education unions will also look at the proposed high-school ban on phones.The government wants the social media ban to come into force from September 2026.Le Monde reported the text of the draft bill cited “the risks of excessive screen use by teenagers”, including the dangers of being exposed to inappropriate social media content, online bullying, and altered sleep patterns. The bill states the need to “protect future generations” from dangers that threaten their ability to thrive and live together in a society with shared values.Will other countries follow Australia’s social media ban for under-16s?Read moreEarlier this month, Macron confirmed at a public debate in Saint Malo that he wanted a social media ban for young teenagers. He said there was “consensus being shaped” on the issue after Australia introduced its ban. “The more screen time there is, the more school achievement drops … the more screen time there is, the more mental health problems go up,” he said.He used the analogy of a teenager getting into a Formula One racing car before they had learned to drive. “If a child is in a Formula One car and they turn on the engine, I don’t want them to win the race, I just want them to get out of the car. I want them to learn the highway code first, and to ensure the car works, and to teach them to drive in a different car.”Several other countries are considering social media bans for under-15s after Australia’s ban includingDenmark, whose government hopes tointroduce a ban in 2026, andNorway. Malaysia is also planning a social media ban for under-16s from 2026. In the UK, the Labour government has not ruled out a ban, saying “nothing is off the table” but any ban must be “based on robust evidence”.Anne Le Hénanff, the French minister in charge of digital development and artificial intelligence, toldLe Parisienthis month that the social media ban for under-15s was a government priority, and that the bill would be “short and compatible with European law”, namely the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) – regulation intended to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation.The social media ban is part of Macron’s attempt to shape his legacy as he enters his difficult final year as president with a divided parliament.On 23 December, last-minute legislation was passed to keep the government in business into January after parliament failed to agree a full budget for 2026. Attempts to agree a budget will resume next month.AFrench parliamentary inquiryinto TikTok’s psychological effects concluded in September that the platform was like a “slow poison” to children. The co-head of the inquiry, the centrist lawmaker Laure Miller, told France Info that TikTok was an “ocean of harmful content” that was very visible to children through algorithms that kept them in a bubble. TikTok responded that it was being unfairly scapegoated for “industry-wide and societal challenges”.The French parliament report recommended more broadly that children under 15 inFranceshould be banned entirely from using social media, and those between 15 and 18 should face a night-time “digital curfew”, meaning social media would be made unavailable to them between 10pm and 8am.The inquiry was set up after a 2024 French lawsuit against TikTok by seven families who accused it of exposing their children to content that was pushing them towards ending their lives.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeSocial mediaSocial media banSmartphonesInternet safetyChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Meningitis is inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.Former teammate Darren Lehmann urged Martyn to “keep strong” via X, as the cricket world began to react to the news.Adam Gilchrist confirmed his former Test and Western Australia teammate was in hospital in a statement on behalf of the Martyn family. “He is getting the best of treatment and [Martyn’s partner] Amanda and his family know that a lot of people are sending their prayers and best wishes,” Gilchrist said.Cricket Australia boss, Todd Greenberg, also wished Martyn a quick recovery. “I’m saddened to hear of Damien’s illness,” he said. “The best wishes of everyone at CA and in the wider cricket community are with him at this time.”As recently as Christmas Eve, Martyn had been active on social media expressing his excitement for the fourth Test of the ongoing Ashes Test.Speaking on 6PR radio, former Test bowler Rodney Hogg called Martyn’s hospitalisation “shocking news”. “We wish him all the best,” Hogg said.View image in fullscreenDamien Martyn plays a sweep shot on his way to an unbeaten 101 for Australia against England in 2003.Photograph: Leigh Winburn/EPABorn in Darwin, the right-hander earned a Test debut at 21 replacing the late Dean Jones in the 1992-93 home series against West Indies and was Western Australia’s captain at 23.He was player of the series the last time Australia won an away series in India, top-scoring in four of Australia’s eight innings at the crease in the 2004 battle for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Martyn is considered one of Australia’smost talented batters, playing 67 Tests and scoring 4,406 Test runs for an average of 46.37 between 1992 and 2006.

Finnish coastguard officers boarded the ship at 11am, about six hours after disruption to the cables was first reported. Fourteen crew members, including several Russians, were taken into custody.A helicopter sent to investigate reported that the ship was dragging its anchor along the bottom of the seabed. “At this stage, it is still too early to assess whether this was an intentional act or an accident,” Helsinki’s deputy police chiefHeikki Kopperoinentoldthe Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat.Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, some experts and political leaders have viewed the suspected sabotage of cables in the Baltic Sea as part of a hybrid war carried out by Russia against western countries.Detectives said they would interrogate the crew, which includes sailors from Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. The vessel, sailing under a flag of convenience from St Vincent and the Grenadines, has been taken to a port near Helsinki.EU countries accuse Russia of using dilapidated vessels belonging to a “shadow fleet” to smuggle oil around the world in defiance of western sanctions. The fleet has been linked with previous cases of cable-cutting and with themysterious appearance of dronesin Denmark and Germany.MapIn January, Nato stepped up its naval presence in the area under an operation called Baltic Sentry. It came after Finnish commandos seized another ship, the Eagle S, on Christmas Day 2024 when it damaged critical infrastructure. A court in Helsinki later acquitted its crew on the grounds the incident took place outside Finnish territorial waters.“Finland is prepared for security challenges of various kinds, and we respond to them as necessary,” the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, said on X on Wednesday.Finland’s deputy prosecutor general, Jukka Rappe, said there were “strong indications of a crime” involving the Fitburg but that it was too soon to reach a conclusion. There was sufficient evidence to open a preliminary investigation, he added.The vessel was in Finland’s exclusive economic zone when it was located by a border guard patrol boat and helicopter. Its anchor chain was found to be lowered into the sea, police said. Finnish police said they were investigating “aggravated criminal damage, attempted aggravated criminal damage, and aggravated interference with telecommunications”.The damaged cables were in the Gulf of Finland between Finland andEstonia. One belonged to the Finnish telecommunications operator Elisa and the other, according to Estonia, was owned by the Swedish provider Arelion. Services were routed via other cables.Wednesday’s incident came as Russia launched a large-scale drone attack on the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. Six people were injured, including children, with four blocks of flats hit. Two energy facilities sustained significant damage, the power company DTEK said.Risk of undersea cable attacks backed by Russia and China likely to rise, report warnsRead moreRussia has been systematically targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, leaving civilians without heat and light in freezing winter conditions. More than 170,000 people had no electricity after the Odesa attack, Ukraine’s energy ministry said. The Kyiv region is also experiencing severe blackouts.Meanwhile, the defence ministry in Moscow released video footage that it said was of a crashed drone that was on its way on Sunday to Vladimir Putin’s presidential palace in the Novgorod region. Russia claims Ukraine carried out a major attack with 91 drones.The story has been widely debunked. On Wednesday Ukraine’s foreign ministry dismissed the video three days after the event as “laughable”, Reuters reported, and said Kyiv was “absolutely confident” the attack did not happen. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, dismissed the report as “unfounded”.Explore more on these topicsFinlandEuropeEstoniaRussiaTelecomsInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Six-hour waits were ongoing in Calais but passengers were advised to check in as planned.On Tuesday, Eurostar staff at St Pancras station in central London were seen handing out water bottles to people waiting by a cordon who were caught up in the delays. Meanwhile, cars hoping to cross the Eurotunnel caused traffic jams on the approach to the Folkestone terminal.Meanwhile, those caught up in the chaos on Tuesday have described their ordeals. Ghislain Planque told French TV station BFM that his Eurostar journey from London to France was meant to take just under 90 minutes but instead was 11 hours.He said: “We were left without electricity, so with no heating, no air-conditioning, no possibility to charge phones. We were in total darkness for some of the time.”TikTok user Eloise De Marco posted a video onboard a stranded Eurostar train with the caption: “When you’ve been stuck on the Eurostar for 10 hours.”Another passenger stuck overnight on a train from London posted on X at 1.28am that there was “no electricity, no toilet, no info”, the Daily Mail reported.A French passenger on Tuesday’s 7.01pm train to Paris told the BBC they were stuck onboard the service in London as of 3am and that the crew were “on no sleep” and were dealing with some “angry passengers”.A LeShuttle passenger, Tim Brown, told the PA Media news agency he had been stuck in his car on the train at the Calais terminal for more than three hours with “no access to food or water. The fact that nobody has come around offering everybody a bottle of water is what has shocked me the most,” he said. “I know things happen, but surely that would be an easy way to help.”Eurostar’s site earlier showed that even services on the continent not using the Channel tunnel – such as those between Paris and Brussels – had been cancelled during the day.Eurostar has held a monopoly on passenger services through the tunnel linking Britain and France since it opened in 1994. The Virgin businessman Richard Branson has vowed to launcha rival service. Italy’s Trenitalia has also said it intends to compete with Eurostar on the Paris-London route by 2029.Tuesday’s disruption affects Eurostar at a time when the company faces criticism over its high fares, especially between Paris and London.An electrical fault forced the cancellation of Eurostar services and severe delays on others in August. The theft of cables on train tracks in northern France caused two days of problems in June.Explore more on these topicsEurostarRail industryRail travelEuropeTransportLondonFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

But you no longer need to be a multimillionaire to own a Picasso – for €100, anyone in the world has the chance to walk away with a painting by one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.The French charity Alzheimer’s Research Foundation announced recently it was raffling Picasso’s 1941 portrait, Tête de femme, which is worth more than €1m, to a single winner. Proceeds from the tickets will help fund Alzheimer’s research, one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.The project, entitled “1 Picasso for 100 Euros”, is the first of its kind in the world, and a natural continuation of Picasso’s legacy, according to his grandson Olivier Picasso.“My grandfather was very generous, but he was also discreet,” Olivier told the Guardian. “He helped his family, especially my grandmother Marie-Thérèse [Walter]. He helped friends. He helped people in need during the civil war in Spain, during the second world war, and even after, in the 50s and 60s.View image in fullscreenOlivier Picasso, grandson of the artist, poses next to Tête de femme.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/Reuters“So for me, this project is an absolutely logical and legitimate part of his legacy. I hope in the future to be able to do this every year if possible.”The raffle is the brainchild of Péri Cochin, a French television producer and owner of the tableware company Waww La Table. Cochin came up with the idea after seeing her mother use them at fundraising events she hosted.“I thought, wouldn’t it be great to do a worldwide raffle, by selling tickets online? I decided it should be a piece of art, and what is the most famous name in art? Obviously, it’s Picasso,” she said.Cochin contacted Olivier Picasso, a childhood friend of hers. When he and the rest of the Picasso administration and the Picasso estate gave their approval, she reserved the 1941 painting from the Opera gallery, which will receive just under €1m after the draw.“We are used to hearing about Picasso and these high-priced auctions, but this was the first time where Picasso was really related to a charity,” she said.Olivier said the family “had an instant connection with the project”, not least because the money raised is going to a good cause. There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, and no treatment that can stop or reverse its progression. “Now that we are living older than before, we or people around us could be affected by this disease. And I know how difficult and painful it is,” he added.The goal is to sell 120,00 tickets, raising €11m for Alzheimer’s research. The draw is scheduled to take place at Christie’s auction house in Paris on 14 April. If not enough tickets are sold to cover the cost of the painting, all participants will be reimbursed.Olivier said Tête de femme was a “very interesting” work that was painted in the same studio in the Left Bank in Paris as Picasso’s 1937 masterpiece Guernica. “The period was important for my grandfather, because he was at the end of a process to divorce his first wife, Olga Khokhlova – a divorce that never happened because Franco abolished the divorce law [in 1939], despite meeting my grandmother and Dora Maar.“The period was also very complicated because of the occupation of Paris by the Nazis. And so the colours are darker than usual, with brown, black, and grey. While it’s a beautiful depiction of a woman, there is still the ambience of Picasso. My grandfather kept the painting as a souvenir of the moment.”Cochin has organised two previous raffles for Picasso paintings, in 2013 and 2020, raising a total of more than €10m. The first winner was 25-year-old Jeffrey Gonano, who became the owner of a Picasso drawing valued at €860,000. “He put the painting in the Museum of Pittsburg for a while, and now it’s in storage at Christie’s in New York, because he didn’t want to keep it at home,” she said.The second winner was Claudia Borgogno, an accountant from Ventimiglia, Italy, whose son had given her a raffle ticket for Christmas. She became the owner of a 1921 Picasso valued at €1m.“She still has the painting, she said it would change her life. It’s a really beautiful story,” Cochin added.This article’s headline was amended on 31 December 2025. An earlier version said that an auction was taking place instead of a raffle.Explore more on these topicsPablo PicassoFranceCharitiesEuropeAlzheimer'sHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It makes it a no-go area for people.”Frank McDonald, who writes about urban planning for the Irish Times, recalled how he moved into the area in 1995, full of optimism, but fled in 2022 amid hordes of pub-crawlers and thumping nightclub music. “I feared that our home would become uninhabitable,” hewrote in July.View image in fullscreenGardaí enforcing coronavirus restrictions in Temple Bar in 2021.Photograph: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockSince then, there have been more grim headlines, including the alleged mugging of a visiting NFL quarterback and an assault on an English tourist who later died. Astudy of online reviewsrated Temple Bar the world’s third biggest tourist trap, reinforcing the perception of a raucous, brawling district best left to stag parties.It adds up to a crushing indictment of the original vision: instead of art and culture, crime and overpriced Guinness.MapThere is, however, an alternative view that Temple Bar is a victim of outdated stereotyping and that a renaissance is under way, making the area a vibrant and a worthy home for organisations such as the Irish Film Institute, Project Arts Centre, Smock Alley Theatre and Graphic Studio Gallery.“It is Dublin’s cultural quarter,” said Martin Harte, the chief executive officer of theTemple Bar Company, a business association. “The era of massive drinking – it’s not that now. Temple Bar is an entirely different place. It’s the front room of Dublin city.”View image in fullscreenMartin Harte, CEO of the Temple Bar Company, says the era of ‘massive drinking’ is over and the area is ‘the front room of Dublin city’.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianViolent incidents garnered publicity but set against an annualised footfall of 24m visits they were very rare, said Harte. “To say Temple Bar is unsafe is not accurate. Walk around, it has everything from small art galleries to coffee shops, tattoo parlours, vintage clothes shops, hotels. It’s where people come, it gives it that electricity.”Tom Roo, 39, and Heather Mitchell, 28, a couple from Leeds, agreed. “I was expecting young lads and drinking everywhere but it’s really nice to walk around, it’s relaxed,” said Roo. Mitchell found the pubs picturesque – more so even than their images on Instagram.View image in fullscreenTom Roo and Heather Mitchell, visitors from Leeds.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianIn the 1980s, much of this web of lanes and streets was derelict and due to become a bus terminus. Instead, in 1991 the government decided to channel Dublin’s year as European city of culture into a showcase project driven by a state agency and tax incentives. Renovated historic buildings and new contemporary structures and art installations created a landmark in urban renewal.The decade also brought cheap flights, laddish culture and superpubs that turned Temple Bar into a boozing destination. “That’s where it got its initial stripes, its brand,” said Harte. “You had to queue behind 30, 40 people to get in anywhere to have a drink.”The supposed culture hub was nicknamed the Temple of Bars and likened to Ibiza. Bacchanalia continued through the 2008 economic crash and prompted another judge – ruling in a 2017 assault case – to brand Temple Bar a vomit-splattered“disgrace to Ireland”.The Covid pandemic brought more challenges.Gangs maraudedthrough under-policed streets, stealing and vandalising. “All the zombies came out,” said Ángel Luis González, director of PhotoIreland, which runs exhibitions and a bookshop called The Library Project.View image in fullscreenÁngel Luis González in The Library Project.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianHowever, improved policing has restored safety, confidence and an eclectic vibe, said González, echoing a widespread view among stakeholders. People who come to take selfies outside famous pubs end up visiting galleries and discovering artists.John Cullen, who runs a jewellery shop and stall in a refurbished square, said the outdoor market drew in families with children. “It civilises the place.”View image in fullscreenJohn Cullen at his jewellery and accessories stall in Temple Bar.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianPubs such as the Palace, Gogarty’s and the Norseman still drew big crowds but the number of late night licences – which allow venues to serve alcohol until 3am – had plunged from 25 to seven and fine dining was making inroads, said Harte. “Every single pub now serves food. People are still drinking but nowhere near at the old levels.”Will Wollen, who moved to Temple Bar two years ago to run the Gaiety School of Acting, said the area’s reputation for excess was unfair. “There is an energy but it’s not a hen party hellscape. It’s a pub culture with warmth and friendliness.”Stephen Kennedy, who runs the Copper and Straw cafe and chairs the Aston Quay and Temple Bar Business and Residents’ Alliance, said there were plans for more street art, seating, lighting and perhaps an outdoor cinema. “I would tell any tourist coming to Dublin that Temple Bar is a must.”Other Dubliners, in contrast, urge visitors to steer clear unless they like crowds, price gouging and ersatz Irishness. Critics also accuse platforms such as Airbnb of driving up rents and driving out people.View image in fullscreenLondoners Tom Salter, left, and Ben Early at a pub in Temple Bar.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianPerry Share, a sociologist and co-editor ofa book on Irish pubs, said Temple Bar was a “pub theme park” that offered a degree of authenticity. “Tourists come to replicate an Irish pub experience they have perhaps seen online. The music and drink is essential to that.”A vox pop of early evening drinkers last week yielded toasts to Temple Bar. “TikTok said it was too touristy but the buzz is great,” said Tom Salter, 22, from London. Dave Howard, from Derbyshire, had a caveat. “It can be quite fun watching a stag party. But not for the locals, obviously.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As a small state, we are dedicated. We don’t see [the presidency] as something we have to do; we want to do it in the best possible way.”As the conflict in Ukraine enters a fourth year, the foreign minister said the EU’s focus would remain on the wartorn country and Russia’s aggression. More than 50 years after the Turkish invasion – launched in response to a coup aimed at union with Greece – Cypriots knew only too well what military strife and occupation meant, he said.Even if the eastern Mediterranean country had once enjoyed close ties with its fellow Orthodox state Moscow, with high net-worth Russians including oligarch allies of Vladimir Putin seeking refuge on its shores, he said Cyprus was particularly sensitive to the Ukrainians’ plight.“The agenda is rightly about Ukraine and it will remain so,” said Kombos, an academic before he was appointed to the post. “But we want to bring into the mix issues relating to the wider Middle East region because we see Cyprus as being part of that region as well.”Cyprus has spent more than two years preparing for a role it last held in 2012. EU diplomats describe the dossiers it wants to push through as highly ambitious. Buildings and roads in Nicosia, the partitioned capital, have been spruced up, with “Cyprus EU presidency” bunting greeting visitors upon arrival at the island’s international airport.But the island’s continued division between the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot south and breakaway Turkish Cypriot north has raised concerns.There are worries, voiced openly by officials, that perennial tensions withTurkeycould obstruct military cooperation with Ankara at a time when closer alignment is seen as key to stability by Brussels.Nicosia, like Athens, has blocked the Nato member’s participation in the EU-funded defence procurement programme, Safe, with the Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides, ruling out the move, citing the presence of Turkish troops in the north as occupation of EU territory.The quest to reunite the country poses further complexity. Long regarded as a graveyard for peace mediators, Cyprus is the west’s longest-running diplomatic dispute.In his interview, Kombos insisted Nicosia would not “get in the way” of the bloc’s ties with Ankara. “The president has said very publicly that he would like to see President [Recepp Tayyip] Erdoğan attend the informal council meeting in April,” he said. “We are not going to use the presidency to raise national issues.”In the stewardship role, the 1.2 million-strong country will oversee the EU’s legislative agenda and the course of diplomatic negotiations. Christodoulides has pledged to prioritise security and defence readiness to shore up the union’s strategic autonomy.The Cyprus presidency’s motto is “an autonomous union, open to the world”, a nod, Cypriot officials say, to the country’s determination to apply policies aimed at augmenting the bloc’s independence and global engagement. In that spirit, Kombos added, emphasis would be placed on mining the potential of regions that often go under the radar with decisive action being taken to address the EU’s outreach.“Normally this part of the world is associated with crises and Europeans get engaged when they have a crisis to manage,” he said, listing Syria, Gaza, Lebanon and the Red Sea. “But this is also a region of opportunities.”As the Trump administration’s tariffs upend global trade, Cypriot officials say there has never been a more opportune moment for the EU to look for alternative markets.Kombos vowed that with the bloc’s competitiveness also high on the agenda, Cyprus would use its presidency to forge a free trade zone between India and the EU.“We want to open up the EU towards the Middle East, towards India,” said Kombos. “The EU is a success precisely because it has managed to go through all the different crises that it has had to navigate. Despite all the despair and complaining about how it works, all of its deficiencies, it surprises us all because it always moves forward, always evolves.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionCyprusEuropeTurkeyUkraineMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He closed his shop and took to the streets, joining merchants acrossIranwho shuttered their stores and students who took over their campuses to protest against declining economic conditions.The sudden loss of purchasing power pushed Alborz andtens of thousands of other Iranians into the streets, where protests are now entering their fourth day. Students have paralysed university campuses, traders have shut down their stores and demonstrators have blocked off streets in defiance of police. Protests have spread from the capital, Tehran, to cities across Iran.Despite the risk of being jailed for his political activism, the father of four had run out of options. On Sunday, the national currency plunged to a historic low, putting further pressure on Alborz, who was already struggling to provide for his family.“What will my children eat? Do we have to bring suitcases of cash to simply buy bread? Do you find that normal?” Alborz told the Guardian over the phone, speaking under a pseudonym for fear of security reprisals.The unprecedented depreciation of the national currency on Sunday – when the Iranian rial dropped to 1.42m to the US dollar, a more than 56% decrease in value in six months – was a breaking point for an already struggling economy and population. The plunging currency has caused soaring inflation, with food prices up by 72% on average compared with the same time last year.Iranian inflation graphicIran is also under some of the world’s most intense sanctions, which have spurred inflation as the country struggles to access frozen funds abroad and foreign exchange, something exacerbated by its growing reliance on imports.View image in fullscreenA currency exchange office in Tehran.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyThe protests are the largest in Iran since 2022, when Iranians erupted in anger at the death of 22-year-oldMahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested for not wearing her hijab properly. Those protests were violently quashed and ultimately simmered out.Social media in Iran has been filled with videos of protesters chanting anti-government slogans and throwing stones at security forces. In one video from Tehran, a lone man sits blocking the way of security services on motorbikes as crowds of protesters flee from teargas.VideoThough the protests started as demonstrations against deteriorating living conditions, they have widened to express grievances at the way Iran is being governed. Women’s rights activists, shopkeepers and students have begun chanting “death to the dictator” and “woman, life, freedom” – slogans that could put people in prison.Alborz said: “For years now, we have slowly but surely made significant changes to our lifestyles because of this corrupt government. This was the last nail in the coffin. We wanted this regime gone and now there’s no way this regime will continue.”The government, still shaken from a brutal 12-day war with Israel in June which rocked the foundations of the Iranian regime, has called for dialogue with protest leaders. Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said the government should listen to the “legitimate demands” of protesters.But they are wary of the offer, believing it to be an attempt to co-opt their demands and kill the momentum of the rare protest movement.“You must be naive to think Iranians trust this government or the regime,” said Farhad, a 19-year-old university student active in the protest movement who spoke under a pseudonym.He and other students described how security services had confiscated student IDs and beaten and arrested some protesters. A protester in Tehran sent the Guardian a picture of a metal pellet, which they said was shot at them by security forces. The Guardian could not independently verify the claim of the protester.Iranian GDP growth graphic“If the administration wanted to talk, they wouldn’t fire teargas, shoot at protesters and if dialogue is what they wanted, they would not have executed protesters in 2023. There is no willingness from any of us to talk to them, we want the mullahs gone and we want democracy,” Farhad added.As the Iranian government dealt with protests at home, it was also facing threats from abroad.On Monday, the US president,Donald Trump, flirted with the idea of striking Iran again, suggesting there could be renewed nuclear activity in Iran – telling reporters if there was, “we’ll knock them down”. Iran has rejected claims it is enriching uranium and has said its nuclear programme is peaceful.On Monday, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said in a statement it would confront any “sedition, unrest” or security threats.The IRGC said: “Enemies are seeking to sow the seeds of sedition within Iranian society through cognitive warfare, psychological operations, falsified narratives, fear-mongering and encouragement of capitulation to them.”Despite intimidation from authorities, protesters said they were not cowed. They expected trade unions to soon join the merchants in striking.“Yesterday, we blocked roads and stopped the security forces from advancing. People sat on the roads and chanted that they could kill us, but we wouldn’t let them pass. We are not going to open shops until the regime weakens further,” said Alborz.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaProtestDonald TrumpIran nuclear dealIran's nuclear programmefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Successive UK governments campaigned for his release.In the days since Abd el-Fattah’s return, social media comments have surfaced – dating back to 2010 – in which he said Zionists, colonialists and police officers should be killed and British people were “dogs and monkeys”.Earlier this week, heapologised “unequivocally”for his tweets. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, who initiallysaid he was “delighted”by the activist’s arrival back in the UK, has since condemned the tweets and said he was unaware of them.The Conservatives and Reform UK have both suggested Abd el-Fattah should be deported from the UK and have his British citizenship revoked.On Wednesday the shadow home secretary, Robert Jenrick, who has led calls for Abd el-Fattah’s British citizenship to be revoked and for him to be deported, highlighted social media posts reportedly from an account belonging to his sister, Mona Seif, in which she referred to the “imagination” of Hamas in its deadly attack on Israel in October 2023.The post said images of Hamas militants flying into Israel by paraglider were like “something out of a sci-fi movie”, adding: “I guess it takes a special kind of imagination to find new ways of resisting an extremely advanced occupation army whose war crimes are constantly justified and endorsed by some of the most powerful governments!”The comment was posted on X at 10.57am on 7 October 2023. Twenty-one minutes later, another post said: “Once again the discrepancy between many of those celebrating Ukrainian resistance but now condemn Palestinian resistance, speaks loudly of their hypocrisy.“You are either with people’s right to resist an army occupation or not! It can’t be ‘only for people who look like me’.”In other comments uncovered this week, Abd el-Fattah asked in 2011 “who would weep if we killed Osama Saraya?”, referring to the editor of an Egyptian newspaper that had backed Hosni Mubarak, the dictator who was swept from power in the Arab spring.In a 2010 tweet, Abd el-Fattah appeared to joke about a “suicide bombing taking a few zionists’ lives”.Cooper haslaunched a reviewinto “serious information failures” in the Abd el-Fattah case.Government sources say theHome Officewillnot strip him of his citizenshipbecause his past social media posts do not meet the legal bar for such a sanction.Human rights campaigners have said such a punishment would be an “extremely authoritarian step”.Explore more on these topicsHome OfficeEmily ThornberryEgyptActivismMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

By staying the course, we will defeat the decline and division offered by others.”Conditions may feel rife for a coup within Labour – but a change of leader alone isn’t going to fix things | Polly ToynbeeRead moreIn an indication that he believes 2026 could be the year when the fortunes of the country and his party begin to change, he added: “When Britain turns the corner with our future now in our control, the real Britain will shine through more strongly.”Starmer goes into 2026 as theleast popular prime minister ever, according to some polls, with his party heading for bruising results in May’s elections and some of his MPs agitating for his removal.Many Labour MPs have spent the Christmas break in their constituencies, where they have had to confront voter anger at early policy decisions.“I’ve spent a bit more time in the constituency in the last couple of weeks and it’s far worse than I thought,” said one. “There are real levels of hostility.”The prime minister’s advisers acknowledge the scale of the problem, but believe they can begin to change voters’ minds this year as the impact of decisions made over the first 18 months begins to be felt.Speaking to fellow advisers before Christmas, McSweeney said this would not be a “year of promises” but a “year of proof”, when public services would begin to improve and bills start to fall.Starmer and his ministers will highlight their action on the cost of living in the first few weeks of the new year, including in a speech by the prime minister that will emphasise recent interest rate cuts that have brought mortgage costs to their lowest since 2022.He will also talk about abolishing the two-child benefit cap, a policy the government is planning to focus on when it introduces a standalone bill to parliament next week to enact it.Meanwhile, Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, is putting the finishing touches to the£13bn warm homes planthat will detail how the government will spend its energy efficiency and low-carbon funding.Officials say the plan will focus on green technology such as solar panels and batteries, rather than home insulation, which was the focus of the recently scrapped energy companies obligation (Eco).The plan will scrap regulations that prevent people from plugging solar panels into domestic plug sockets, a technology widely used in Germany and other European countries.Scrapping the Eco scheme and reducing renewables levies will save energy users an estimated £138 on average, according to acalculationby the consultancy Cornwall Insight.From Send to single-sex spaces: key tests facing Keir Starmer in 2026Read moreMinisters are keen to show how their energy efficiency funding will also help bring bills down in the longer term, with Miliband framing his package as another cost of living measure.One government source said: “There will be a big focus in our warm homes [plan] on the clean tech products that can deliver energy bill reductions in the short and medium terms for households.”Starmer plans to couple this action with a charm offensive designed to win over his own MPs. The prime minister has invited Labour members to receptions at his countryside grace-and-favour home in a series of events across January and February.Officials say he will use the informal gatherings in part to strengthen the message that MPs should spend the run-up to May’s elections talking about the cost of living. Early indications, however, suggest his plans are being met with a mixed reception among parliamentary colleagues, many of whom feel angry about a bruising first 18 months in power.One said: “The parliamentary Labour party has a wealth of skills and experience which are being ignored. It is a bizarre approach that weakens us as a government and breeds resentment.”Another said they would not be taking up the invitation to attend Chequers. “I’ve been invited but the idea of making small talk and pretending everything is fine is just [being sick emoji].”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerUK cost of living crisisBenefitsEnergy billsHousehold billsConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

I would rule it out withKeir Starmer, but I wouldn’t rule it out with Burnham.”A coalition would require the Greens getting an adequate number of seats at the next general election to make the party useful to Labour, and would also need Burnham to once again gain a seat as an MP.Polanski argued Labour’s plan for the economy was not working. He called for a wealth tax, as well as an increase in capital gains tax to bring it in line with income tax. “I am challenging a broken, failed economic model, and the people defending it have no answer other than just to continue with what is broken,” he said.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer ‘seemed a very nice guy’, said Gary Lineker, left, in an interview with Zack Polanski.  Lineker is seen here attending a St George’s Day event at No 10 in April.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAHowever, Gary Lineker defended the prime ministerin an interviewwith Polanski, saying he had met Starmer “two or three times” and he “seemed a very nice guy”.“I think he’s having a tough time. Obviously he’s not a hugely charismatic leader, but I don’t necessarily think that’s important,” the football pundit and TV presenter said.Speaking on the podcast Bold Politics withZack Polanski, Lineker also said there was “too much political influence from the very top” of the BBC, and the organisation had “tied itself up in knots” over impartiality.The former Match of the Day presenter, whoquit the BBCearlier this year, said he had a “great affinity” with the institution but: “I think they’ve got a little bit broad into this whole impartiality thing and I think that that makes it very, very difficult for them.”Lineker said in recent years, impartiality had been expanded beyond news and current affairs and into the rest of theBBC. “Even though we’d been on social media for years, we were expected to suddenly change. And I thought that was difficult,” he said.“Overall, there are thousands and thousands and thousands of people that work for the BBC that are really, really good people that do excellent jobs. But I think it’s tied itself up in knots a little bit with the impartiality thing because I think what we really need is truth and reporting, in that sense. It’s impossible to be impartial on everything.”He added: “My personal issues, it was difficult, it was over a long period of time.”Lineker said the way a government decided who was on the board of the BBC and who was chair should be done with more of a “neutral” perspective, because those brought in by politicians “will obviously be partial”.“If they’re going to talk about impartiality, start at the top,” he said. “It’s incredibly difficult for the BBC, but I think at the moment there’s too much political influence from the very top.”Polanski asked the presenter why he had been sooutspoken about immigration.Lineker said: “I know it’s an issue, immigration, I know it’s difficult, you can’t take everybody. But I think we should do our fair share and look after people.“I have empathy towards their situation. I think there’s a small percentage that are the opposite, so I felt it was quite important to use my platform to perhaps speak on behalf of those that don’t have a voice.”Though he had suffered a backlash online from the right, having been a footballer, “you learn to deal with abuse”. He said: “I took it as a compliment.”In 2026, Lineker said, he wanted to see “proper peace” in Gaza.“We’ve got a ceasefire but it’s not really a ceasefire at the moment,” he said. “I’ve spoken about this quite a bit and I look at my phone every day and I cry most days when I see it. I mean, innocent kids being just killed [with] snipers and bombs. It’s just immeasurably wrong.”He added: “And of course Israel has the right to defend itself. But then why doesn’t Palestine have the right to defend itself? It doesn’t.”Lineker, who hasreceived criticismfor talking about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza, said: “People will disagree with this and they try and make an argument but I always say to them, if you genuinely think this is fabricated, let journalists in.”Explore more on these topicsZack PolanskiGreen partyGeneral electionsLabourAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerGary LinekernewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, return it to the store from where it was bought for a full refund,” the FSA said.While the FSA and Waitrose did not give an estimate as to how many of the Deeside waters may be affected, they urged customers to take note of batch codes on the bottles.For still mineral water, they included: NOV2027 28, DEC2027 01, DEC2027 02, DEC2027 10, DEC2027 11, and DEC2027 16.For sparkling mineral water, the potentially contaminated bottles would be marked: DEC2027 01, DEC2027 03, DEC2027 12, DEC2027 15, and DEC2027 25.Waitrose also urged customers to call their customer care line for further information. “We apologise that it has been necessary to recall this product and for the inconvenience caused,” the supermarket said in a statement.Earlier this month, Waitrose was forced torecall a Santa-themed drinks bottle for “safety reasons”,while in October it had to pull a plant-based fake meat product that had undeclared ingredients including wheat gluten and soy.Glass shards also led to the FSA recallingbottles of spirits under the Disaronno Originale brandin early December.Explore more on these topicsWaitroseFood safetyRetail industrySupermarketsFood & drink industryRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

States’ funds will be released “only when states prove they are being spent legitimately”.The report came a day after Jim O’Neill, the HHS deputy secretary, and Alex Adams, an HHS assistant secretary who oversees the Administration for Children and Families (ACF),appeared in a Tuesday evening video message. O’Neill declared that the department had “activated our defend-the-spend system for all ACF childcare payments across America” and would now require “justification, receipt or photo evidence before we make a payment”.Originally, O’Neill and Adams’s message was interpreted as an announcement that HHS would stop childcare funding in Minnesota, not all 50 states. However, the Associated Press reported late Wednesday that the freeze would apply to every state and that all states would need to provide more documentation about their childcare programs before receiving federal money.The department did not immediately reply to a Guardian request for comment to clarify the nature of the freeze, but HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told ABC News that “it’s the onus of the state to make sure that these funds, these federal dollars, taxpayer dollars, are being used for legitimate purposes”.Recipients of childcare funding will have to provide HHS with extensive documentation, such as “attendance records, licensing, inspection and monitoring reports, complaints and investigations”, Nixon added.The changes to US childcare services as part of a response toa viral video, made by a self-described “independent journalist” and rightwing influencer, that purported to discover massive fraud at daycare centers operated by Somali Americans in Minneapolis.Trump attacks Walz and Omar after freezing Minnesota childcare fundingRead moreHowever, other news outlets havenot been able to verify the claimsmade in the video. Allegations of exploitation of Minnesota’s social safety net have also been extensively covered by local and national news media over the past several years, andprosecutors brought charges over one allegedly massive schemeduring the Biden administration.In recent weeks, Trump has intensified hisxenophobic attacks on Somali Americans, including his long-running nemesis Ilhan Omar, a representative from Minnesota who is Somali American and came to the US as a refugee. He has said that Omar is “garbage” and said Somalia is “no good for a reason”.“When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country,” Trump said in one December cabinet meeting. “Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.”Tim Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota who is running for re-election this year, denounced the Trump administration’s freeze of Minnesota’s funding as part of “Trump’s long game”.“We’ve spent years cracking down on fraudsters. It’s a serious issue - but this has been his plan all along,” Walz said in a Tuesdaypost on X.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationChildcareUS politicsChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

The Republican-controlled House judiciary committee earlier this year heard testimony from one ofSmith’s top deputies, and months later subpoenaed the former special counsel for private testimony. Smith had offered to voluntarily testify in public, as special counsels typically do.In questioning from Democratic congressman Dan Goldman, Smith said he operated without interference from Merrick Garland, the attorney general who appointed him, or any other top justice department officials.“Did President Biden ever give you any instructions about what you should or should not do related to these investigations?” Goldman asked.“No,” Smith replied, later specifying he had not spoken to Biden about his cases in any way.Smith was appointed in November 2022, and quickly brought the two federal cases against Trump, who also faced state-level charges of election interference in Georgia, and falsifying business records in New York.While he wouldlater be convictedof 34 felonies in the Manhattan case, neither of Trump’s federal indictments went to trial before he returned to office following the 2024 election, after which Smith, in line with justice department policy,dropped the charges.The election-interference case was slowed by pretrial motions, including asupreme court rulingthat gave presidents immunity for official acts and forced Smith tomake changesto his case. The classified-documents case was hampered by rulings from Florida judge Aileen Cannon, who at one pointdismissed Smith’s indictment.Smith authored a report into his prosecutions, and the portion covering the election interference case was released prior to Biden leaving office. However, Cannon has barred the chapter discussing the classified-documents charges from being made public, though Democrats on the judiciary committeehave askedher to reverse her decision.At the outset of the hearing, an attorney for Smith, Peter Koski, told the committee the former special counsel had received an email from the justice department advising him to avoid talking about his evidence in the case because of Cannon’s ruling.“This restriction significantly limits Mr Smith’s ability to discuss the classified-documents case. Nevertheless, Mr Smith is committed to doing his best to answering questions consistent with the department’s guidance,” Koski said.In his more-than-eight-hour of testimony, Smith insisted he had no political motivations in indicting Trump, and said he believed “we had proof beyond a reasonable doubt in both cases” that he brought.“If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Republican or a Democrat,” he said in his opening statement. Smith later told an unnamed committee staffer he would have indicted Biden or Barack Obama over similar evidence.Republicans have been in uproar after it emerged that federal investigators obtained data related to the phone usage of several members of Congress, which was used as part of Smith’s prosecutions. Smith hit back in his testimony, saying: “Recent narratives about my team’s work are false and misleading” and the “records were lawfully subpoenaed and were relevant to complete a comprehensive investigation”.The only data collected, Smith said, was incoming and outgoing phone numbers and the calls’ durations, not their contents themselves. The data helped show that Trump continued to press his allies to stop Biden from formally becoming president, even as his followers were attacking the US Capitol on January 6, he added.“President Trump and his associates tried to call members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I did not choose those members, President Trump did,” Smith said.Trump has repeatedly railed against Smith, and in his testimony the former special counsel acknowledged the risk that the president could come after him.“I have no doubt that the president wants to seek retribution against me,” Smith said.Explore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesDonald TrumpTrump administrationJoe BidenUS CongressUS crimeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It also followed a rare rebuke from the US supreme court, which blocked the White House’s efforts to deploy national guards inIllinois.Trump attempted to paint the decision as temporary in a post on his Truth Social platform, vowing to redeploy at a later date and insisting the initiative had been a success.ICE plans $100m yearlong ‘wartime recruitment’ media blitz to attract new agentsRead more“We are removing the National Guard from Chicago,Los Angeles, and Portland, despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities, and ONLY by that fact,” he wrote.“Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago were GONE if it weren’t for the Federal Government stepping in. We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again – Only a question of time!”Yet there seemed little doubt that the latest move amounted to a retreat. Earlier on Wednesday, Newsom had hailed the justice department’s decision, announced in a filing with the ninth circuit court of appeals, backing away from its argument that Trump had a right to put state national guard troops under his authority indefinitely.“This admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end,”wroteNewsom, who vocally and vigorously opposed the deployments on the streets of Los Angeles.In a statement on Wednesday evening, Newsom said he had directedCalifornianational guard leaders to “return state service members home to be with their families as soon as possible”.Trump initially ordered national guard members into the city last June in response to protests against raids conduced by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The deployment has been subject to a succession of legal challenges, with Newsom arguing that the situation did not justify the presence of federal forces and that Trump was exceeding his powers.A lower court ruled earlier this month that Trump had seized control of the national guard members illegally and ordered them returned to state authority. The administration had originally contested that ruling.Its change of tack amounted to the second setback in a week to Trump’s quest to federalize national guard units to quell displays of dissent against his highly contentious immigration policies, which he and other administration figures have depicted as violent riots.Last week, theUS supreme court delivered a rare rebukeby refusing to allow the administration to deploy national guards in Chicago – a move opposed by the city’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, who are both Democrats.Trump’s announcement casts doubts on the future of national guard deployments in other Democratic-run cities, including Washington DC andNew Orleans, where 350 troops were expected to arrive by New Year’s Eve.Troops have been deployed in Washington DC since last August, purportedly to counteract a supposed “crime wave”. One national guard was killed and another seriously wounded after beingshot by a gunman outside a metro stationin the city on 26 November.The incident led to an increase in the number guard members deployed in Washington, as well as an intensification of Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric after it emerged that the suspected assailant was an Afghan national who had been granted political asylum in the US. More than 2,000 troops have been deployed in Washington DC since August, with many being drafted in from at least 11 Republican-led states.A federal appeals court ruled this month that the troops can remain while a panel of judges establish whether their deployment is legal. A lower court had earlier ordered that they be removed.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryDonald TrumpChicagoLos AngelesPortlandCaliforniaIllinoisnewsShareReuse this content"

We need YOU to get them out,” ICE’s recruiting websitesays.The administration’s hiring push comes after Donald Trump signed HR 1 into lawin July, which allotted $45bnfor immigration detentionand $32bn for immigration enforcement-related activities and personnel.Yet even as ICE now has the funds to hire about 14,000 new employees, its efforts to quickly do so have raised red flags among everyday citizens disgusted by the recruitment ads themselves and experts concerned that the speed and tone with which the federal government is pursuing new agents could attract more aggressive, combat-hungry applicants.“They’re aiming for that sweet spot of people who’ve got something to prove, who want to have that power, under the guise of patriotism,” Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told the Post.ICE’scontroversialads have leaned heavily on American symbolism –Uncle Sam,George Washington, Lady Liberty – while casting immigrants as bad actors to convince potential deportation officers to apply.Meanwhile, ICE is offering an up to $50,000 signing bonus,higherthan the real median personal income for a year’s work in the US, as well as up to $60,000 in student loan repayment for those who join.The agency has already received more than 220,000 applications and made more than 18,000 tentative job offers, sometimes on the spot. At an ICE recruitment fair in Arlington, Texas, more than a hundred people were waiting outside before the event started. Attenders told theNew York Timesthey were there because they were “very patriotic” and committed to “guarding the homeland”.“When I saw Uncle Sam pointing that finger, I just had it in my heart,” Mahin Ahmed, an ICE applicant, told the Times. “You’re thinking, ‘Look at this guy. He’s an immigrant. He wants to become a deportation officer.’ It doesn’t make any sense to you, makes 100 percent sense to me.”With more ICE officers available, the White House border czar, Tom Homan, said that the number of immigrant arrests will “explode” in 2026, including through an increase in enforcement at workplaces, Reutersreported.Homan’s comments came after the administration hadsignaledit would instead be toning down its public-facing immigration actions to focus on apprehending people with serious criminal convictions, in the face of widespread backlash to its violent and highly visible tactics in major cities around the country.Already, ICE held a record number of people –68,440– in detention in recent weeks, thevast majoritywith no criminal conviction. But the administration remained far below its goal of a million deportations in its first year, with about 300,000removalssince Trump’s second inauguration.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now here was the US president, on a rare visit, examining the project for himself.“It looks like it’s about $3.1bn. It went up a little bit – or a lot,” Trumpsaid, as Jerome Powell, the typically calm Fed chair, vigorously shook his head. “So the $2.7bn is now $3.1bn–”“I’m not aware of that, Mr President,” Powell quickly interjected, as Trump pulled out a paper from his suit pocket as evidence. “I haven’t heard that from anybody at the Fed.”Donald Trump promised a new ‘golden age’ for the US economy. Where is it?Read moreThe remarkable public encounter in late July was described as a “tussle”, “spar” and “feud” by news outlets and came to symbolize an extraordinary battle for control of the world’s largest economy.Never before has a president been so publicly, and relentlessly, critical of the country’s top monetary policymaker. For decades, successive administrations have allowed the Fed, as the institution tasked with steering theUS economy, to function independently, without political interference. No longer.Trump, who later embarked upon a vast construction of his own, with the surprise demolition of the entire East Wing of the White House for a new ballroom,continuesto threaten legal action over the Fed renovations, and direct seemingly unlimited anger toward Powell.Few believe this historic test of the central bank’s independence has run its course. In fact, it is widely expected to intensify in the coming months.“The institution was built to withstand a moment like this,” said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist. “Some of the battle lines were drawn, but we haven’t seen this play all the way out.”‘The president should at least have a say’The US economy has had a rollercoaster year. Trump’s widespread tariffs and crackdown on immigration destabilized prices and the labor market – the two domains the Fed aims to protect, and balance, by setting interest rates. Higher interest rates can calm inflation, but also risk raising unemployment. Lowering rates can stimulate economic growth, but risk higher prices.At the beginning of the year, it looked like the Fed had achieved a so-called “soft landing”: inflation had fallen significantly from the 40-year high it scaled in 2022, during the feverish post-pandemic economy, but the labor market had remained broadly stable. Interest rates went from near zero to 5.25% to 5.5%.Wall Street was nevertheless anxious for rates to come down. On the campaign trail, Trump had made clear that he would want a say over how things are run at the Fed, and repeatedly suggested that he would pressure the central bank to lower rates.“I feel the president should at least have say in there. I feel that strongly,” hesaidin August 2024. “In my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in my cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve, or the chairman.”Interest rates in the US‘Too Late Powell’Once he retook office, Trump’s laser focus on lowering rates only intensified. When his“Liberation Day” tariff announcementin April caused stock markets to plummet, he raged against the Fed for not acting quick enough.“If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Trump said of Powell in mid-April. Markets did notrespond kindlyto the threat, and Trump eventually said that Powell’s job was safe.It was the beginning, however, of what would be a long summer of presidential attacks against the Fed. Trump continued to blast “Too Late Powell” on social media, and attempted to draw the central bank’s renovations into the spotlight.Once it was clear those strategies weren’t working, the White House changed course. In August, when Trump announced he wouldfireLisa Cook, a Biden-appointed Fed governor and member of the rate-setting federal open market committee.Bill Pulte, a close ally of Trump and head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates mortgages, alleged that Cook had committed mortgage fraud. She had purportedly listed two homes as her primary residence, which could get her a better mortgage rate.Cook, whose term ends in 2038, has since sued the White House to keep her role. The case will ultimately bedeterminednext year by the supreme court, which temporarily blocked Cook’s firing. Her lawyers arearguingthe president needs demonstrated “cause” to fire a Fed governor, and that the fraud allegations come from “cherrypicking” facts.‘No risk-free path’While the highly anticipated decision on Trump’s bid to fire Cook will have sweeping consequences for his campaign to exert great control over the Fed, he is also preparing to pick Powell’s replacement as Fed chair.Earlier this year, the supreme court mentioned the Fed in a separate ruling in which it allowed Trump to fire two members of independent labor boards. In its decision, the court said: “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.”The suggestion that the court views the Fed differently compared to other federal agencies provides some hope to allies of Cook, and proponents of central banking independence, but it’s still unclear how the justices will ultimately rule.The White House is “testing the defense”, Sahm said. “Some have held up, and some may not. It’s a pressure campaign.”But the Fed has so far remained stoic in face of the White House’s assaults, and Wall Street still appears confident in the Fed’s policymaking – essential for the stability of markets.“The Fed is always a political lightning rod. When things go wrong, the Fed is the first to blame. They get a lot of criticism when things aren’t going right, and they don’t get a lot of praise when things are going well,” said Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics.But Trump’s attacks have largely “fallen on deaf ears”, added Sweet. “I don’t think it had any influence on what they did this year with regards to monetary policy.”In the fall, the Fed started to lower rates, but Powell made it clear that the move was taken out of caution for risks in the labor market. “There is no risk-free path” for the central bank, Powellsaidin both his October and December press conferences.Could tension pick up in the new year?Rates are now sitting at a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, almost 2% lower than two years ago. While the White House has softened against the Fed in recent months, tension could pick up in the new year.Trump said that he wants to see interest rates go down to 1%, but new projections from Fed officials suggest that most of the 12 voting members in the rate-setting committee don’t expect much change to rates in the next year.“We’ve now gotten to a place where the risks of [inflation and unemployment] are what we think are broadly, roughly, in balance,” Powell said in December.Still adamant to lower rates, Trump has instead focused on picking a new chair to replace Powell, whose term as chair is up at the end of May 2026. In recent weeks, he appears to have narrowed his focus on “Two Kevins”: Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who Trump says “thinks you have to lower rates”, and Kevin Hassett, current director of the National Economic Council and a staunch Trump loyalist.Trump said that the next Fed chair should listen to the president. “Typically, that’s not done any more,” he told theWall Street Journal. “I don’t think he should do exactly what we say, but certainly we’re – I’m a smart voice and should be listened to.’Economists are mixed on the impact a new Trump-appointed Fed chair can have on overall decision making. The chair is just one vote among 12 on rates, but a Fed chair is also the face of the Fed. Though other officials speak publicly, and frequently espouse their views on the economy, the chair has the biggest microphone, and sets the tone.“If there are any cracks in the Fed’s independence, it will spread very, very quickly,” Sweet said. “That’s going to really affect market and inflation expectations … So it’s actually counter to what the White House wants.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyDonald TrumpJerome PowellTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Australian billionaire Gina Rinehart saw her net worth nearly triple from $12.6bn to $37.7bn through her rare -earth metals portfolio.A handful of billionaires experienced declines in their net worth, including Philippine billionaire Manuel Villar, who lost $12.6bn.Villar’s net worth dropped to $10bn after shares of his property development firm, Golden MV Holdings Inc, dropped by 80% at the end of a six-month trading suspension for the firm.According toOxFam, a global confederation of non-government organizations, the $2.2tn growth in net worth for the world’s wealthiest 500 individuals would have been enough to lift 3.8 billion people out of poverty.“Inequality is a deliberate policy choice. Despite record wealth at the top, public wealth is stagnating, even declining, and debt distress is growing,” said Oxfam’s international executive director, Amitabh Behar, in a statement.Explore more on these topicsThe super-richIncome inequalityElon MuskDonald TrumpJeff BezosInequalityShareReuse this content"

The wider all-share market was 19.75% higher.The precious metal producer Fresnillo was the top performer – its shares have soared by 450% in 2025, boosted by record prices for gold and silver. Its rival, Endeavour Mining, gained 170%. The telecommunications company Airtel Africa was the second-fastest riser, up 210%.Defence company stocks also surged as Europe boosted its spending on weapons amid the Russia-Ukraine war and pressure from Donald Trumpon Nato allies to spend more on defence.Babcock International, the defence contractor which kits out the Royal Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet, jumped by almost 150% this year. Rolls-Royce, which supplies engines for fighter jets, turbines and propulsion systems for warships and power systems for the British army, doubled in value.The FTSE 100 index in 2025On Tuesday, the FTSE 100 hit a new intraday record high of 9,954 points, but fell short of breaking through the 10,000-point mark for the first time.More than a fifth of the stocks on the FTSE 100 went down. The biggest fallers were the distribution company Bunzl and drinks maker Diageo. Both lost a third of their value.World stocks rallied by 21%, their strongest year since 2019 and the sixth annual rise in the past seven years.It was a turbulent year for global markets, however. In January, the launch of the Chinese chatbot DeepSeek wiped $1tn from US technology stocksin a “Sputnik moment”for the world’s AI superpowers.The bigger shock came on 2 April, when Trump announcedsweeping tariffs on trading partners. The ensuing market panic knocked 10% off the FTSE 100 by mid-April, but there wasa recovery rallywhen the US president decided to pause the new levies.Toward the end of the year, hopes for US interest rate cuts in 2026 pushed shares higher, with Trump signalling that he would appoint a new head of the Federal Reserve who would lower borrowing costs.“Investors have been looking beyond the usual suspects for value and diversification as the US dollar came under pressure and the world continued to be beset with geopolitical turmoil and fears of an AI bubble,” said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.Despite the lingering fears of an AI bubble, Wall Street’s S&P 500 was on track to record a 17% rise for 2025, while the Nasdaq was about 21% up. Among tech stocks, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has gained 65% in 2025 as its Gemini artificial intelligence product gained market share.Meta, which owns Facebook, lagged behind with a 13% rise, while online retailer Amazon gained only 6%.Anxiety over the US economy, and three interest rate cuts since September,pushed the US dollar downby 9% in 2025, its worst year since 2017. Wall Street analysts expect further losses over the next 12 months.Fears of currency debasement drove a sharp rally in precious metals this year. Gold has gained 65%, its best showing since 1979, as investors sought out protection from inflation and geopolitical tensions.The pan-European Stoxx 600 index recorded its best year since 2021, gaining almost 17%. Germany’s plans to boost government spending supported stocks, as did better-than-expected economic data.“2025 has been a pivotal year for Europe,” said Anthi Tsouvali, multi-asset strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investment office. “After a strong start driven by German fiscal stimulus and rising defence spending, markets faced headwinds from US tariffs and weak data. Yet sentiment is improving, and we’ve upgraded our outlook for European equities to ‘attractive’.”Explore more on these topicsFTSESharesLondon Stock ExchangeInvestmentsStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

The company’s customer service team told the FT that the recent government shutdown had disrupted shipments.The T1 smartphone, described by the company as “proudly American”, was initially promoted as a US-made rival to devices from Apple and Samsung. Almost all smartphones sold in the US are made overseas, primarily in China and South Korea but also increasingly in India and Vietnam.Etched with an American flag, the T1 was initially promised in August and thewebsite still statesit will be released “later this year”. Customers are required to pay a $100 payment to pre-order the device.The T1 launch came shortly afterTrump criticised Appleover its plans to move the production of iPhones destined for the US market from China to India.It remains unclear who could manufacture the T1 handset, given the low levels of domestic smartphone production in the US.Trump Mobile also offers a phone contract costing $47.45 monthly, with the name of the service plan and the price referencing Trump’s status as the 47th US president.The company has also recently started selling secondhand smartphones from Apple and Samsung on its website, which it states come “without the inflated price tag”.However, a refurbished iPhone 15, which was launched in September 2023, costs $629 (£467) through Trump Mobile, whereas customers can buy a newer model, an iPhone 16 from 2024, directly from Apple for $699. A Samsung Galaxy S24 is being sold for $459, slightly lower than the $489 listed on Samsung’s US website.The phone venture is headed by Trump’s sons Donald Jr and Eric, who took over the family company after their father transitioned to his second presidency.The mobile service joins Trump-branded watches, footwear and Bibles as products capitalising on his political brand, while Trump’s sons have indicated there will be more to come.The Trump Organization has expanded from real estate into digital media and telecommunications. The venture will operate through licensing deals that generatedmore than $8mfor the president in 2024, according to financial disclosures.The move into phones also raises questions about conflicts of interest, as the president’s family business operates in a sector that is heavily regulated by federal agencies over which Trump wields executive power.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTelecommunications industrySmartphonesTechnology sectorMobile phonesDonald Trump JrEric TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

And will the hot streak for gold and silver continue in 2026?Get ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastJonathan BarrettBusiness editorWed 31 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 16.03 ESTShareThe Australian share market delivered a 6.8% return in 2025, representing a third consecutive year of gains in a volatile period marked by trade wars, reigniting inflation and fears of an artificial intelligence-fuelled bubble.Here are three things to watch for in 2026.1.Sticky inflationWhile Australian shares recorded positive returns in 2025, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 is down more than 4% from its record high, struck on 21 October, to close the year at 8714.3 points.The selldown coincided with achanging outlook on inflation, whereby traders swapped their forecasts of further rate cuts for probable hikes. Interest rate rises are generally viewed as a drag on stocks, given they make funding more expensive for businesses, and weigh on consumer spending.Australians obsessed with interest rates because ‘there is not enough else to talk about’, former RBA governor saysRead moreTwo of the four big banks expect a rate increase at the first Reserve Bank of Australia meeting of the year, in early February, while none are forecasting additional rate cuts.The rate outlook partly explains the recent divergence in performance between the ASX and Wall Street, with the US market recording strong double-digit returnsbacked by a December rate cut and the possibility of more to come.Wall Street’s strong performance has also been fuelled by an AI run by the country’s big technology stocks, which differs from Australia’s resources and banking-led market.The chief economist at Betashares, David Bassanese, says the critical question for the Australian economy in 2026 is whether inflation can moderate without the need for more monetary restraint and slower growth.2.Geopolitical riskMost analysts expect the global and Australian equities markets to rise in 2026 despite the presence of geopolitical risks, including heightened tensions between Beijing and Taiwan and a US oil blockade of Venezuela.Traders tend to overlook geopolitical risks until they disrupt physical supply chains.The potential of an AI bubble bursting and signs of global inflation reigniting did spark waves of volatility in 2025, although many investors used the sell-offs to top up their holdings.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe challenge with bubbles is that, even if an investor knows one is forming, they often struggle to predict when it will actually burst.Bassanese says the market still seems to be in the “early-to-mid stages of a potential bubble” as AI computing capacity outstrips supply.UBS expects AI to fuel further gains in global equities although it warns investors to be “mindful of bubble risks”.Meanwhile, the value of crypto assets, including bitcoin, have been sold down in recent months after being caught up by the growing fears around a market bubble.Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG Australia, expects the best-known crypto asset to turn lower in the new year, with a potential retest of its 2025 lows struck afterDonald Trump’s “liberation day” tariff announcementsin early April.A fall in the value of bitcoin would be bad news for many younger Australians who increasingly view crypto as a means of supplementing their income to pay for high living costs, including housing.Data from financial comparisons site Finder shows that young adults aged under 30 are the most prolific investors in crypto, with nearly one in four putting money into the asset class.3.Silver and goldPrecious metals have been on a hot streak led by huge gains in silver and gold, as well as platinum and palladium.CMC Markets analyst Luis Ruiz says that precious metals are traditional safe-haven assets, and their appeal tends to rise when uncertainty increases.“The forces driving demand are deeply rooted and unlikely to fade quickly,” Ruiz says.“New investors continue to enter the market, while existing holders have little reason to sell unless they need cash or find a more attractive alternative.”The spectacular price rises – silver is up by more than 150% over the year and gold by about 70% in US dollar terms – means they have been susceptible to sharp corrections but both assets have rebounded after recent sell-offs.Parts of the Australian share market are well placed to benefit from ongoing demand in precious metals, given the country’s rich gold deposits and silver production.The downside is that the sharp increases in precious metal prices might prove to be a warning sign of economic trouble ahead.Explore more on these topicsBusinessAustralian economyAI (artificial intelligence)CryptocurrenciesGoldSilverInflationnewsShareReuse this content"

Six-hour waits were ongoing in Calais but passengers were advised to check in as planned.On Tuesday, Eurostar staff at St Pancras station in central London were seen handing out water bottles to people waiting by a cordon who were caught up in the delays. Meanwhile, cars hoping to cross the Eurotunnel caused traffic jams on the approach to the Folkestone terminal.Meanwhile, those caught up in the chaos on Tuesday have described their ordeals. Ghislain Planque told French TV station BFM that his Eurostar journey from London to France was meant to take just under 90 minutes but instead was 11 hours.He said: “We were left without electricity, so with no heating, no air-conditioning, no possibility to charge phones. We were in total darkness for some of the time.”TikTok user Eloise De Marco posted a video onboard a stranded Eurostar train with the caption: “When you’ve been stuck on the Eurostar for 10 hours.”Another passenger stuck overnight on a train from London posted on X at 1.28am that there was “no electricity, no toilet, no info”, the Daily Mail reported.A French passenger on Tuesday’s 7.01pm train to Paris told the BBC they were stuck onboard the service in London as of 3am and that the crew were “on no sleep” and were dealing with some “angry passengers”.A LeShuttle passenger, Tim Brown, told the PA Media news agency he had been stuck in his car on the train at the Calais terminal for more than three hours with “no access to food or water. The fact that nobody has come around offering everybody a bottle of water is what has shocked me the most,” he said. “I know things happen, but surely that would be an easy way to help.”Eurostar’s site earlier showed that even services on the continent not using the Channel tunnel – such as those between Paris and Brussels – had been cancelled during the day.Eurostar has held a monopoly on passenger services through the tunnel linking Britain and France since it opened in 1994. The Virgin businessman Richard Branson has vowed to launcha rival service. Italy’s Trenitalia has also said it intends to compete with Eurostar on the Paris-London route by 2029.Tuesday’s disruption affects Eurostar at a time when the company faces criticism over its high fares, especially between Paris and London.An electrical fault forced the cancellation of Eurostar services and severe delays on others in August. The theft of cables on train tracks in northern France caused two days of problems in June.Explore more on these topicsEurostarRail industryRail travelEuropeTransportLondonFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

The question is whether an American can still carry the crownLee EscobedoWed 31 Dec 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 13.48 ESTShareThat theNBAis reckoned in seasons is apt. To measure a legacy this way is as much existential as it is symbolic. Martin Heidegger argued that time is not something we pass through, but the condition of our being – less a pathway than a pressure. Heavy stuff, yes, but the NBA has always operated under similar weight.The millennial superstars who stabilized the league for two decades are now entering their twilight: LeBron James (who turned 41 on Tuesday),Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Chris Paul. In their wake comes something genuinely new. For the first time, the league’s next dominant generation is unmistakably international. The NBA’s gen Z elite now emerge from Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, Canada and France.The ascendant San Antonio Spurs are the gift the NBA neededRead moreAmerica’s domestic pipeline still produces talent, but the excesses of AAU culture, one-and-done college basketball and eroding fundamentals have dulled its once overwhelming edge. In a garden crowded by its own overgrowth, the question is which strain ultimately thrives.Each of the millennial stars now plays under the pressure of finitude. Heidegger described this as livingtowardan ending – an awareness that sharpens responsibility rather than diminishing it. That sense defines the league’s aging icons. For them, responsibility means one more run. Collectively, this group has won 10 championships and appeared in 23 Finals, but the odds of one last triumph are slim. Curry is straining to extend a dynasty time is quietly dismantling. LeBron is both the Lakers’ largest contract and no longer their centerpiece. Westbrook chases relevance on a lottery-bound roster. Harden remains productive but unsettled. Only Durant, newly aligned with a rising Houston team, appears plausibly positioned for one more push.The question of succession is unavoidable. Elder statesmen Nikola Jokić (30) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (31) understand the clock well enough to know urgency has arrived.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander(27) looks capable of anchoring something durable in Oklahoma City, with Luka Dončić (26) and Victor Wembanyama (21) pressing close behind. The American presence has not vanished, but it has dimmed since the 1990s. Jalen Brunson, Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham and Jayson Tatum keep the idea of domestic succession alive, while 19-year-old Cooper Flagg now complicates the hierarchy entirely.The NBA has never struggled to define its image. From its rise into national consciousness, the league’s authority flowed through Black American players who made the game modern and irresistible, even while navigating deep economic contradictions. But dominance erodes. The world has caught up.Generation Z moves differently. Previous generations were asked to embody systems that rarely worked in their favor. These players arrive as brands unto themselves, unburdened by history. American moxie still matters, but it no longer travels alone.For decades, only Hakeem Olajuwon briefly disrupted American supremacy, and even that required Michael Jordan’s retirement. Now the balance has shifted. The millennial generation reshaped the sport – stretching shooting, flattening positions, weaponizing collectives – but even golden eras end, and their fading has left a vacuum no single nation can easily fill.There is an uncomfortable symmetry to the timing. As American authority softens on the global stage, so too does its basketball hegemony. Players from countries once peripheral to the sport now produce its gravitational centers.Can an American reclaim the mantle? Until recently, the answer felt unconvincing. ThenCooper Flaggarrived. As his shooting stabilizes, his path becomes clearer – and it begins where greatness has always been defined: defense.Across generations, the truly defining stars shared not just brilliance, but responsibility on both ends of the floor. Julius Erving, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant andLeBron Jamescould dominate a game while guarding its most dangerous opponent. That same two-way versatility distinguishes Flagg. It is what gives his ceiling historical weight.Thrown immediately into the burden of replacing Dončić-level expectations, Flagg initially wavered. But after Dallas moved on from general manager Nico Harrison, the collective exhale allowed him to find his footing. The Mavericks sit on the fringes of the play-in picture, but Flagg already checks the league’s most important box: trust.What makes him viable as the NBA’s next face is the rare blend of responsibility, versatility and control at an age when most players are still learning how to stay on the floor. He plays the basketball the league prefers to elevate – two-way, connective, portable. His defensive impact resembles that of elite bigs, while his offensive reads mirror those of primary creators. He spots mismatches early, toggles between force and patience, and resists rushing possessions into waste.The NBA crowns players it can trust. As the youngest player in the league, Flagg already plays like an old one.If the NBA is shaped by contingency rather than ceremony, then the passing of the torch is not an event but an obligation. LeBron’s generation carried the league until their bodies gave way. The world has stepped forward to claim it. But as Heidegger reminds us, what matters is not the future we imagine, but how we handle it once it arrives.The league is not waiting for Cooper Flagg to become something else. It is already responding to what he is.Explore more on these topicsNBACooper FlaggBasketballUS sportsStephen CurryShai Gilgeous-AlexanderNikola JokićfeaturesShareReuse this content"

USA Hockey plans to announce its roster Friday morning on NBC’s “Today.” This is the first time in 12 yearsthat NHL players will compete in the Olympics.The tournament begins in Milan, Italy, on 11 February. The US are scheduled to oppose Latvia on 12 February, Denmark on 14 February and Germany on 15 February.The aforementioned trio joins six players previously named to the US team – forwards Jack Eichel of the Vegas Golden Knights, Auston Matthews of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Brady Tkachuk of the Ottawa Senators and Matthew Tkachuk of the Panthers and defensemen Quinn Hughes of the Minnesota Wild and Charlie McAvoy of the Boston Bruins.Except for Hughes, who was injured at the time, those players were part of the 4 Nations Face-Off team thatlost to Canada in the tournament finallast February in Boston.Under head coach Mike Sullivan of the New York Rangers, Team USA seeks their first Olympic gold medal since the 1980 “Miracle on Ice” team won gold in Lake Placid, New York.“The expectation is to go to Milan and win the gold medal,” Eichel said at the US Olympic orientation camp in September. “I think anything short of that, it would be disappointing.“Keller, 27, is no stranger to Team USA. He served as captain at the world championships last May when the Americansearned their first gold medal at the event since 1933.Keller, a St Louis area native who was the No 7 overall pick of the Arizona Coyotes in 2016, posted a career-best 90 points last season and is currently tied for the Mammoth’s team scoring lead with 33 points (12 goals, 21 assists) in 40 games. Keller’s 10th NHL season has already been filled with emotions after his father, Bryan, died unexpectedly in November.Thompson, 28, was selected No 26 overall by the St Louis Blues in 2016 and is enjoying another strong season with the Sabres, who acquired the Phoenix native in the 2018 trade that sent forward Ryan O’Reilly to the Blues.Thompson leads the Sabres in scoring with 34 points (18 goals, 16 assists) in 38 games this season, his ninth in the NHL. He scored in overtime against Switzerland to lift Team USA to a 1-0 win in the gold-medal game at last May’s world championships.Jones, 31, the son of former NBA player Popeye Jones, is playing in his 13th NHL season and earned his first Stanley Cup ring with the Panthers in June.An Arlington, Texas, native, Jones has posted 24 points (six goals, 18 assists) this season in 39 games. He was the No 4 overall pick of the 2013 draft by the Nashville Predators and has also played for the Columbus Blue Jackets and Chicago Blackhawks.Explore more on these topicsUSA ice hockey teamUSA Olympic teamWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsUtah MammothShareReuse this content"

The 25-year-old crossed the line in 9:35.4 to secure only the second World Cup victory of his career, edging Austria’s Benjamin Moser by two-tenths of a second. Norway’s Lars Heggen finished a further four-tenths back in third.The win lifted Schumacher to sixth overall in the Tour de Ski standings and capped a breakthrough performance in a discipline rarely contested on the World Cup circuit in recent years.Later in the day, Diggins matched the achievement on the women’s side, adding another chapterin the final season of an already decorated career. The American claimed her 31st World Cup victory in a race that unfolded less as a traditional mass start than a test of shared tempo and efficiency, with athletes rotating the lead to sustain maximum speed.Diggins finished well clear of Sweden’s Emma Ribom and Moa Ilar, who completed the podium, and extended her lead at the top of both the World Cup and Tour de Ski overall standings.Beyond the results, the day carried symbolic weight for a US team that hassteadily closed the gap on traditional European powers. Julia Kern finished 10th in the women’s race for her first top-10 result of the season, while Schumacher’s win underscored a growing American presence on the men’s side.The Tour de Ski continues on Thursday with the 20km pursuit races, where athletes will start according to their accumulated time deficits, chasing overall points as the series moves into the new year.Explore more on these topicsJessie DigginsSkiingUSA Olympic teamUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The matter remains part of an ongoing legal process. We will respect that process, continue to monitor the situation closely, as we have over the past few months, and cooperate fully with the league. We will have no further comment at this time.”Barmore is the second Patriots player this week to face off-field legal scrutiny. On Tuesday, it emerged that wide receiver Stefon Diggsis facing a felony strangulation chargein connection with an alleged incident on 2 December.Head coach Mike Vrabel said Wednesday that Barmore did not practice due to illness and added that he had not heard “anything that would keep either player from the game”.Asked whether he was disappointed by the distractions surrounding Barmore and Diggs, Vrabel said: “I would say not disappointing at all. I think that these are allegations. It’s things that we have to handle. Every day there are distractions, some are smaller than others. I’m confident that we’ll focus on the Dolphins, and those two individuals will be able to handle the ongoing legal process.”Barmore has played in all 16 games this season, making 15 starts for the AFC East champion Patriots (13-3). He has one sack, 26 tackles and nine quarterback hits. He was selected by New England in the second round of the 2021 draft.Explore more on these topicsNew England PatriotsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

He could make his debut Saturday in Baylor’s Big 12 opener at TCU.Nnaji was the first pick of the second round, 31st overall, by the Detroit Pistons two and a half years ago. His draft rights have since been traded to Boston, then Charlotte and most recently the New York Knicks in October 2024. The 21-year-old Nnaji, who was playing in Europe before he was drafted, hasn’t been on an NBA roster. He was 18 when he was drafted.International players with varying backgrounds, including professional leagues, have played college basketball for years. With players now getting paid under name, image and likeness (NIL) deals, college teams have added players from the NBA’s developmental G League.The NCAA said players wouldn’t be eligible if they signed regular NBA contracts or two-way deals that involve G League affiliates. But the association said that won’t necessarily apply to G League players without NBA deals, or other professional leagues in the U.S. and elsewhere.“As schools are increasingly recruiting individuals with international league experience, the NCAA is exercising discretion in applying the actual and necessary expenses bylaw to ensure that prospective student-athletes with experience in American basketball leagues are not at a disadvantage compared to their international counterparts,” NCAA president Charlie Baker said in a statement released by the association. “Rules have long permitted schools to enroll and play individuals with no prior collegiate experience midyear.”Arkansas coach John Calipari said he wasn’t criticizing Baylor’s Scott Drew or others trying to add players amid a shifting college landscape. But he said a rule should clearly disqualify any NBA draft pick.“I don’t blame coaches,” Calipari said. “Let me give you this, real simple ... If you put your name in the draft – I don’t care if you’re from Russia – and you stay in the draft, you can’t play college basketball. Well, that’s only for American kids. What? If your name is in that draft and you got drafted, you can’t play, because that’s our rule. But that’s only for American kids. OK.”Drew defended the move by pointing to other undrafted international players who are playing college basketball right now. Nastja Claessens, a 2024 third-round WNBA draft pick, is averaging 10.6 points in 11 games for the Kansas State women this season.“Until we get to collective bargaining, I don’t think we can come up with rules that are agreeable or enforceable,” Drew said. “Until that, I think all of us have got to be ready to adjust and adapt to what’s out there. Early on, when it first came out with G League players, I wasn’t in favor of that either. But again, we don’t make the rules and as we find out about things, we’re always going to adapt to put our program in the best position to be successful, because that’s what we get paid to do.”The NCAA said court rulings in lawsuits challenging eligibility standards are making its rules difficult to enforce. Attorneys for Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, who is suing for more eligibility, latched on to Baylor’s signing of Nnaji to try to bolster their argument.“While the NCAA has prevailed on the vast majority of eligibility-related lawsuits, recent outlier decisions enjoining the NCAA on a nationwide basis from enforcing rules that have been on the books for decades – without even having a trial – are wildly destabilizing,” Baker said in the statement. “I will be working with D-I leaders in the weeks ahead to protect college basketball from these misguided attempts to destroy this American institution.”Explore more on these topicsCollege sportsNCAACollege basketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Gabriel Magalhães had just opened the scoringagainst Aston Villaafter a first half in which Mikel Arteta’s nervous side were struggling without the influential Declan Rice. Then it happened.Jadon Sancho was waiting to receive a pass from Youri Tielemans inside Villa’s half but, before the forward knew it, Ødegaard had pinched the ball and was haring towards Emiliano Martínez’s goal. A jink back on to his left foot fooled Tielemans and allowed Ødegaard to play the perfect through ball for Martín Zubimendi to score the crucial second. It was the fifth goal or assist that Zubimendi has contributed since he joined in the summer – the joint-best return of his club career – and the Spaniard’s impact was rightly hailed by a delighted Arteta. “Credit to his teammates as well, how easy they make it for him,” said theArsenalmanager in a nod to Ødegaard.Rampant Arsenal make a strong title statement and bury the Emery bogey | John BrewinRead moreThe Norway international, who scored his first Premier League goal of the season inthe win over Brighton on Saturday, also had a hand in Leandro Trossard’s third goal with a devilish cross that Villa failed to clear, and looked back to his best after injuries affected him both last season and for the first half of this one. Ødegaard had more touches and shots than any other Arsenal player, even if he could not cap his performance with a deserved goal.“He needed some consistency as well,” Arteta said. “Obviously he had two times a shoulder injury, thenhe had a big knee injuryand that takes a little bit of time. Now you can see that he is flowing, that his energy level is back to where it is, that he is taking risks, that he is affecting the game in a great way. I think he was playing really well today.”In August the former Arsenal captain Tony Adams suggested Ødegaard should be replaced as captain by Rice given his drastic loss of form. That was never going to happen, such is his standing within the squad. The arrival of Eberechi Eze for £67.5m in the summer was meant to provide the creative spark Arsenal were missing last season, but the England forward has been increasingly marginalised since Ødegaard returned in late November from a knee injury that forced him to miss seven matches.View image in fullscreenMartin Ødegaard salutes the Arsenal fans after the 4-1 win over Aston Villa extended their lead at the top of the Premier League.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesThat is a reflection of Ødegaard’s rejuvenation, although he has admitted his goals return has not been good enough since he scored 15 in the 2022-23 Premier League season when Arsenal finished as runners-up for the first time under Arteta. “I’ve been waiting for that one,” he said of his strike against Brighton.Ødegaard managed only three goals last season in another campaign interrupted by injuries, with the arrival of his first child last December probably not helping him catch up on sleep. He could have made more of a couple of opportunities late on against Villa, but the signs are there that he is ready to contribute much more as Arsenal head into the new year with a spring in their step, five points clear of Manchester City for now although that could become two again on New Year’s Day.PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal1925452Man City1826403Aston Villa197394Liverpool184325Chelsea191130The same cannot be said of Viktor Gyökeres. For the first 45 minutes against Villa, Arsenal supporters must have been wondering whose idea it was to spend £64m on a striker who did not appear to offer much in any department. Of the five touches Gyökeres managed, three were shots or headers that missed the target and another involved a loss of possession to Ezri Konsa in the centre circle that should have led to a goal for Ollie Watkins. With Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus back on the bench after long injury layoffs, it seemed possible Gyökeres would not re-emerge for the second half after Arsenal had been second-best against Unai Emery’s in-form team.Perhaps mainly because of a lack of alternatives until now, Arteta has shown real faith in the striker who plundered 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season. That was rewarded to an extent when Gyökeres was heavily involved in the move that led to the Arsenal corner from which Gabriel opened the scoring on Tuesday, although that was as good as it got for him.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres heads a chance over against Aston Villa on a night when Arsenal’s Swedish striker again failed to convince.Photograph: Matt Impey/ShutterstockAt least Ødegaard proved there was another Scandinavian in the mood to take the game by the scruff of the neck before Gyökeres was replaced by Jesus, who scored with his first touch and must be in the frame to start against Bournemouth on Saturday instead. The only saving grace for Gyökeres was that Watkins – the Arsenal fan spotted after the game asking Patrick Vieira for a selfie and who Arteta tried to sign last January – also endured an off night on his 30th birthday until he scrambled a late consolation goal to make it seven in 12 appearances against the club.Competition and scrutiny are poised to heat up for Gyökeres over the next few weeks with Havertz also back in the frame. Rice looks likely to return against Bournemouth but Arsenal have already got their captain back.Explore more on these topicsArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But that also makes any more expensive incomings unlikely in January, especially after the timely return of the influential Gabriel Magalhães this week. A loan signing or two could be on the cards, however, with Arsenal not having filled either slot so far after bringing in Neto from Bournemouth and Raheem Sterling from Chelsea last season. Mikel Arteta could do with more cover at right-back and must also decide whether to allow Ethan Nwaneri to go on loan with the 18-year-old having made only three starts in all competitions.Ed AaronsAston VillaThere remains little wiggle room for Unai Emery to strengthen his squad owing to financial regulations but the Villa manager is keen to bolster his frontline with Ollie Watkins still the team’s only bona fide No 9. A €12m (£10.5m) deal for Grêmio’s teenage winger Alysson is advanced and another young forward could be sought to complement Villa’s attack. Loanee Harvey Elliott has not featured for almost three months and with Emery reluctant to trigger a £35m permanent move fromLiverpool, all parties are seeking to find a sensible solution; Villa would have to pay to terminate the deal prematurely. They are not expected to be aggressive in the market but will pursue moves deemed good opportunities.Ben FisherView image in fullscreenHarvey Elliott’s future remains unclear.Photograph: Sportimage Ltd/AlamyBournemouthThere is an acceptance that an elite Premier League club – Manchester City are at the front of the queue – will trigger the £65m release clause inserted into the contract extension Antoine Semenyo signed last summer.The noise surroundingthe forward has been unrelenting but Bournemouth have been preparing for this scenario and while Andoni Iraola recognises it is “impossible” to replace Semenyo with a like-for-like signing, they have proved savvy when it comes to succession planning. Bristol City are due 20% of the profit Bournemouth generate for a player signed for £10m in 2023. As well as a winger, they are keen to add an imposing centre-back with Marcos Senesi’s contract up at the end of the season. The club may also target another central midfielder with the USA captain, Tyler Adams, sidelined for up to three months and a goalkeeper to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic, their No 1, who signed last summer.BFBrentfordAfter banking £50m of summer transfer profit, Brentford have spending power to match their European ambitions. Igor Thiago and Kevin Schade will attract attention, but there is no need – or desire – to sell in January. Instead, Tottenham’s Brennan Johnson is a possibility to join Keith Andrews’ forward line, thoughCrystal Palaceare the likelier destination. Lille’s Matias Fernandez-Pardo is another option. Midfielder Vitaly Janelt can sign a pre-contract with another club on 1 January and Eintracht Frankfurt lead the queue for his signature. Feyenoord’s Quinten Timber, brother of Arsenal’s Jurriën, is a possible replacement. Dimitris Kaloskamis of AEK Athens, 20, has also been floated, fitting the Brentford template of unheralded, promising talent others overlook and might end up coveting.John BrewinView image in fullscreenWill Quinten Timber join brother, Jurriën, in the Premier League?Photograph: Wart Brinkerhof/MTB/AlamyBrightonThe jury is still out on several of Brighton’s summer signings and they could expect to bring in more players in January, with a right-back, a central midfielder and a new forward believed to be top of Fabian Hürzeler’s wishlist. Carlos Baleba is not expected to depart in January despite strong interest in the Cameroon midfielder from Manchester United, although that hasn’t stopped the club’s scouting department from accelerating plans to bring in a replacement before then. A number of experienced players, includingtop scorer Danny Welbeck– who has been dogged by a back injury this season – Joël Veltman, Adam Webster and 39-year-old James Milner are all out of contract in the summer.EABurnleyBurnley are desperate not to return to the Championship at the first time of asking, so will be active.Goals are their biggest problemand finding a way to rectify that is the key ambition in January. Whether that comes in the form of a new striker or someone more creative, if not both, will be an intriguing aspect of the recruitment strategy. One further potential issue is the injury the captain, Josh Cullen, picked up against Everton. If it is as serious as first feared, finding cover in midfield could lengthen the wishlist. They will also be very open to allowing those lacking action to depart to cut back on wages.Will UnwinChelseaThe world champions are unlikely to conduct big business.Chelseaare planning to improve their attack next summer and also want to find cover for Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo in midfield. But mostly there is a focus on the future, with the recruitment team monitoring youngsters such as the Rennes centre-back Jérémy Jacquet and Saint-Étienne forward Djylian N’Guessan. Enzo Maresca would have liked to sign a centre-back after losing Levi Colwill to injury last summer. But there may be a bigger focus on outgoings. Buyers need to be found for Axel Disasi and Raheem Sterling. Tyrique George almost joined Fulham last summer.Jacob SteinbergCrystal PalaceOliver Glasner has repeatedly called out Crystal Palace’s lack of preparation for their first European campaign and it looks like being a busy month in south London as they scramble for new additions to a squad that has already played 30 games this season. Injuries to key players Chris Richards, Daniel Muñoz and Daichi Kamada have exposed Palace’s weaknesses and they are likely to pursue a new right-back as a priority, with Bayern Munich’s Sacha Boey having been linked with a move. There is alsointerest in Tottenham’s Brennan Johnsonwhile Palace will be braced for any January approaches for Marc Guéhi or the likes of Adam Wharton and Jean-Philippe Mateta.EAView image in fullscreenOliver Glasner will want to keep hold of Adam Wharton.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersEvertonDavid Moyes is confident The Friedkin Group, Everton’s owners, will support efforts to sustain the undoubted progress that has been made since he returned in January but availability may prove more of an issue than affordability.Everton’s weakness is glaringand holding the team back. Thierno Barry and Beto have scored twice and once in the Premier League goal this season respectively despite Everton’s forward play improving courtesy of Jack Grealish, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Iliman Ndiaye. Signing a goalscorer more worthy of their talents would be top of the list, but difficult in January. Ideally Everton would also strengthen at full-back and in midfield.Andy HunterFulhamThe west Londoners could do with adding more depth to their squad. They had a quiet summer and it remains to be seen if they can convince their manager, Marco Silva, to sign a new contract. He will want to see ambition. Fulham could do with a new forward given thatRaúl Jiménez, 34, is out of contractnext summer, Jonah Kusi-Asare is only on loan from Bayern Munich and Rodrigo Muniz is injured. Similarly a right-winger could be useful given that Harry Wilson’s deal expires soon and Adama Traoré is likely to join West Ham. Could a move for Chelsea’s Tyrique George be revisited?JSLeedsWhen the summer transfer window shut, Daniel Farke was disappointed not to have signed two more forwards and appeared particularly stung by a failed move for Fulham’s Harry Wilson. DespiteDominic Calvert-Lewin’s recent goalscoring renaissanceand some impressive performances from the often criticised Brenden Aaronson, Farke still covets at least one more frontline addition. He may also seek cover at wing-back but, given that barely a month ago the German was deemed to be “under severe pressure” at Elland Road, it will be intriguing to see how far the board are willing to back a head coach who has choreographed a dramatic upturn in the team’s fortunes. With profitability and sustainability constraints very real, Leeds will need to sell some fringe squad members before the 30 June accounting deadline and it is not impossible that one of Illan Meslier, Joël Piroe and Jack Harrison could depart in January.Louise TaylorLiverpoolArne Slot insists Liverpool do not have “unlimited money” despite the impression given by their summer spending spreeof almost £450m, yet mistakes from that extravagant window need addressing. The attempt to sign Marc Guéhi on a cut-price deal backfired and, coupled with Giovanni Leoni’s cruciate ligament injury, has left Liverpool light in central defence. Not adding attacking width disrupted the balance of the team with Luis Díaz sold and Mohamed Salah in decline. Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo is a target.Salah’s issues with Slot, and vice versa, have not disappeared and that saga will be reignited should the £65m-rated Semenyo arrive at the expense of one of Liverpool’s greatest players.AHView image in fullscreenWill Antoine Semenyo swap the south coast for the north-west?Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersManchester CityPep Guardiola’s winter window is primarily about signing Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo by triggering a release clause that is slightly less than £65m. If the 25-year-old agrees terms and does give the transfer the green light – his clause has to be activated early in January – Guardiola, who prefers a smaller squad, will hope to offload at least one wide player, so Savinho or Oscar Bobb could depart. The manager has been asked if James Trafford could be loaned out after Gianlugi Donnarumma became the first-choice goalkeeper but – so far, anyway – Guardiola has batted the prospect away.Jamie JacksonManchester UnitedRuben Amorim considered adding Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth if the player signalled interest butManchester Cityare the favourites to sign him. A No 6 midfielder is the prime target, with Al-Hilal’s Rúben Neves, 28, of interest – the fee would be around £20m. Atlético Madrid’s Conor Gallagher is also on the radar – his club value him in the £35m-45m bracket. United would prefer a loan and the deal may depend if the 25-year-old wants the move. Regarding outgoings, Kobbie Mainoo seems the only player who may leave – on loan – though Amorim indicated recently this would be countenanced only if a midfielder is signed.JJView image in fullscreenConor Gallagher in action for Atlético Madrid, who he joined in the summer of 2024, but he could return to the Premier League.Photograph: Bagu Blanco/Pressin/AlamyNewcastleNewcastle have nine games in January and arather jaded squadseems in need of fresh legs and new ideas. Yet if a creative midfielder in the mould of the much-admired 19-year-old AZ and Netherlands Under-21 international Kees Smit looms large on Eddie Howe’s shopping list, the defence could also do with fortifying. The acquisition of cover for Tino Livramento and Lewis Hall at full-back seems imperative and it is not impossible that Matt Targett could be recalled from his successful loan spell at Middlesbrough. Newcastle, though, have frequently watched Dayann Methalie, the versatile 19-year-old Toulouse and France Under-21 defender. There is money available but a board that prioritises signing players under 25 would prefer to invest more heavily in the summer. Even so, Howe would ideally like to welcome an extra striker during a month when he could possibly bid farewell to Joe Willock, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth and Will Osula.LTNottingham ForestSean Dyche has already suggested it is “unlikely” to be a busy window but Forest usually produce a surprise. The main focus at the City Ground will be to reduce the size of the squad. It became bloated over the summer when they invested heavily in strengthening depth but did result in Omari Hutchinson not being registered in the club’s 25-man Europa League squad. Fringe players, such as Willy Boly, will be made available but Forest have no intention of selling the midfielder Elliot Anderson, who has attracted interest from numerous Premier League rivals, includingManchester United.WUSunderlandEvents in Morocco could shape January on Wearside. Régis Le Bris has six players at Afcon and Sunderland’s manager will be hoping that Noah Sadiki, Reinildo, Habib Diarra, Chemsdine Talbi and co avoid injury and return in good shape for the second half of a hithertorather wonderful season. Le Bris has said the club are looking at potentially reinforcing “two or three positions” but bolstering the frontline seems a priority. As well as Sunderland have done, their leading scorer, Wilson Isidor, has only four goals and the arrival of a prolific striker to capitalise on defence-splitting passes from Granit Xhaka and Enzo Le Fée would be welcome. Le Bris, meanwhile, will be hoping Chelsea abandon their interest in another outstanding midfielder, Sadiki, but could be open to moving fringe players on. The midfielder Dan Neil is among those who may depart.LTTottenhamThomas Frank says his club will “definitely be in the market” and the money is available after the owners, the Lewis family trust, oversaw a £100m cash injection in October. There are caveats. January is a complicated month. Spurs will be competing, according to Frank, with “eight clubs for the same players”. The squad is up to its Uefa limits on overseas personnel. There are already two players for every position; more in some. The overriding message is that only fits for the longer term will be considered. Left wing is the most obvious area for an upgrade. Spurs wanted the Manchester City winger, Savinho, last summer; the noise around him has not gone away. Brennan Johnson and Yves Bissouma could be moved on. The club must become better at selling.David HytnerWest HamReinforcements are a must fora side in increasing peril. Fulham’s Adama Traoré is a likely addition on the wing and a replacement in attack for Niclas Füllkrug, who is heading to Milan on loan, is a priority. The Wolves striker Jørgen Strand Larsen is a target, albeit an expensive one. Coventry’s Haji Wright and Ellis Simms and the Viktoria Plzen striker Rafiu Durosinmi have been monitored too. However, Nuno Espírito Santo has problems at both ends. A new defender is needed and West Ham have looked at Toulouse’s Charlie Cresswell. A nagging concern, though, is whether players will want to join West Ham when their plight looks so hopeless.JSView image in fullscreenWill Haji Wright swap a title push with Coventry for a relegation scrap at West Ham?Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAWolvesIt would be foolish for Wolves not to have the Championship in mind when it comes to new signings. They want players who could play key roles in a promotion push next season, with relegation increasingly inevitable. They are seeking improvements across the pitch but are prioritising a goalkeeper, wingers and a right-wing back. Matt Jackson, promoted to technical director, will oversee recruitment, working closely with the head coach Rob Edwards, who had lost his first seven matches in charge before Tuesday’sdraw at Manchester United. André and João Gomes have interest from rivals but, barring huge offers, are unlikely to be sold in January. Jørgen Strand Larsen is of interest to West Ham, while Fer López, among the summer signings who have struggled to impress, could depart on loan. Enticing players might be tricky.BFExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalAston VillaBournemouthBrentfordBrighton & Hove AlbionBurnleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the surprise advantage lasted only five minutes before a bizarre own goal tied matters at the Grand Stade d’Agadir.It came when the Cameroon striker Frank Magri’s shot was deflected by full-back Nené on to the post.

Because it’s how you overcome the problems. In this perspective, now every time when I reflect on what happened last season, I’m more proud than ever about what we have done as a club, how we handled the bad, bad situations.”Rodri, who completed 90 minutes in the Premier League twice in 2025, is available after a hamstring injury. The midfielder missed most of the year because of a cruciate ligament injury sustained in September 2024, which sparked a poor run of form for City, and further setbacks.City sit five points behind Arsenal with a game in hand, having been 14 points off the top at this point last year. They invested heavily last January, spending £172m on signings.Premier League points-per-game standings for 2025“Without those players we wouldn’t be in the Champions League this season,” Guardiola said. “I think we would have been playing in the Conference [League] without those signings. Basically we didn’t have players for a long, long time, and the moment with the new players and then with three-quarters of the season gone others came back, we were the best team in the Premier League in the last 10 to 15 games in the season. Sometimes you have to take a decision as you don’t expect something.“When we had all the seasons as a squad, we were competing like we are doing this season and obviously, come on, with Rodri we are a stronger team. There’s no doubt about that.”This winter window is expected to be quieter but a deal for Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo isclose to completion. The winger is keen on a move to City, despite interest from elsewhere. He played in the2-2 draw at Chelseaon Tuesday, creating two goals with long throws, a threat Guardiola has admitted is absent from his squad.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolanewsShareReuse this content"

However, there is a scattergun feel to West Ham’s recruitment and they have developed cold feetover the finances around Strand Larsen. Wolves want £40m for the Norwegian, whose wage demands are high.From Guéhi to Yildiz – who could be on the move in the January transfer window?Read moreWest Ham, who are closing in on a deal for the Fulham winger Adama Traoré, made an informal inquiry for Strand Larsen this month but have identified Pablo as a cheaper option. Gil Vicente, the surprise package in Portugal this season, are expected to want €20m (£17.5m) for the Brazilian. It is understood negotiations are moving in the right direction.Pablo has scored nine goals this season, lifting Gil Vicente to fourth in the Primeira Liga. The 21-year-old is a client of Nuno’s agent, Jorge Mendes. He is rated as a top prospect, although there is a recognition within West Ham that he would need time to adjust to English football.West Ham are 18th, four points below 17th-placed Nottingham Forest, and desperately need to strengthen their squad. David Sullivan, the largest shareholder, is prepared to back Nuno and West Ham are looking far and wide for forwards. They were monitoring Eddie Nketiah but the Crystal Palace forward has been sidelined by a hamstring injury.Nuno has also looked at the Coventry duo Ellis Simms and Haji Wright. There is interest in the Viktoria Plzen striker Rafiu Durosinmi.West Ham’s only natural forward option at the moment is Callum Wilson. Nuno has used Jarrod Bowen and Crysencio Summerville as central strikers in recent games. The manager wants a defender but an attempt to sign Manchester City’s Nathan Aké on loan has failed. Aké is not interested in the move. West Ham may revive interest in the Chelsea defender Axel Disasi.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

That would cost it about €53m.Dazn has also been ordered to pay 25% of the Pro League’s arbitration costs and warned that it will be fined €50,000 a day if it does not meet specified requirements.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Dazn had triggered the legal dispute by withholding November’s contractual payment of €6.6m to the Pro League, although it continued to broadcast matches, on the grounds that it had been unable to agree a financially viable distribution deal with Belgium’s TV operators.Despite months of negotiations, Dazn was unable to secure carriage deals with the Belgian TV networks Proximus and Telenet, with the result that Pro League games have been available only via its own app this season, a model the company said was not commercially viable.Twelve months ago Dazn won a five-year contract for Belgian rights to the Pro League until 2030 worth €84.2m a season to the clubs, but claimed that without a wider distribution deal it could not continue under the original terms.An arbitration tribunal on the matter is due to be constituted in the spring and Cepani could then issue interim measures.“It is important to emphasise that these provisional measures, including on interim payments, do not pass any judgment on Dazn’s legal position in the ongoing dispute with the Pro League,” said Massimo D’Amario, chief executive of Dazn Belgium. “Dazn remains convinced that the Cepani arbitration panel that will be constituted in the coming weeks will rule that the original contract ended lawfully.View image in fullscreenLigue 1 matches at clubs such as Lille are now shown on the league’s own streaming service.Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/Reuters“While not being able to comment on the content of the decision by Cepani’s emergency arbitrator, I find it important to emphasise that Dazn will in any event continue to produce and broadcast Pro League matches as it has been doing over the past months. This is a promise that we made even prior to the decision of the Pro League to commence emergency arbitration.”Dazn succeeded this year in breaking its contract to broadcastLigue 1in France, one season into a five-year deal, agreeing to pay €100m to the Ligue de Football Professionnel in compensation after a vote of the clubs. That decision continues to have major ramifications for French football, with Ligue 1 responding to the collapse of its TV deal by becoming the first of Europe’s top five leagues to launch a direct-to-consumer streaming service to broadcast matches.Subscriber numbers have been disappointing, however, with the result that Ligue 1 has forecast paying only €142m to the clubs in media rights fees this season, including €30.1m to the champions. Liverpool received £174.9m from the Premier League after being crowned champions last season.Many French clubs remain unhappy that Dazn was allowed to walk away without a legal challenge, feelings that the result of the Belgian arbitration are likely to magnify.Dazn’s position in the market is curious, given it has defaulted on two major rights deals with European leagues but last year paid $1bn to secure exclusive global rights for the Club World Cup, albeit after receiving an equity injection from Saudi Arabia’s Surj Sports Investments.Dazn, despite its problems in France and Belgium, last month extended its contract with La Liga to broadcast five matches each week in Spain until 2032 in a deal costing it about €500m each season, an increase of 6% on its previous deal.Lorin Parys, the CEO of the Pro League, said: “We are satisfied that Dazn must honour its commitments regarding, among other things, production, distribution, payments and negotiations with telecom operators. The winners of this ruling are our fans, our clubs and Belgian football as a whole.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballSports rightsLigue 1newsShareReuse this content"

There’s an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.”Asked if Højlund’s permanent Napoli transfer was just a “formality,” Manna replied: “As of today, I think so.”Højlund joined United from Atalanta in August 2023 for £64m, plus a potential £8m in add-ons. The 22-year-old scored 14 goals in 62 Premier League appearances, and the fee for Højlund to move to Napoli is believed to be £38m. Benjamin Sesko, Højlund’s replacement at Old Trafford, has struggled to adapt to the Premier League and scored only twice since joining from RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £73.7m.United finish 2025 in sixth place after a disappointing performance, which their former captain Gary Neville described as “the baddest of the bad”, in Tuesday’s1-1 draw against Wolves.“They weren’t just booed off at full time,” Neville said on his Sky Sports podcast. “The fans waited in the stadium to continue to boo them. They’ve gone backwards.”Joshua Zirkzee scored just his second goal of the season to put United in front but was substituted at half-time in a move that Ruben Amorim described as “just tactical”. On the manager’s substitutions, Neville added: “They made Manchester United worse. Every single substitution was bizarre. If Zirkzee wasn’t injured and that was a tactical substitution, it was a really poor one. Zirkzee isn’t Eric Cantona, by any stretch of the imagination, but he needed to be out there for physicality, for presence, for experience.”Explore more on these topicsNapoliManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

The tech titan began the year holding court withDonald Trumpin Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Muskappeared to givea Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a19-year-old staffernicknamed “Big Balls,”denied reportsof being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conferencewith a black eye– all in the first half of the year alone.“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff,told Vanity Fairin an expansiveinterviewearlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”Musk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormousgovernmentcontractsand expandSpaceX’soperations. WithTesla, he was approved for apay packagethatcould make himthe world’s first trillionaire even as the company’sglobalsalesplunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some$600bn.In the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clairsued Muskin February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regularattacksin posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughterVivian Wilson, who is trans, wasfeaturedin New York magazine andmodeledat New York fashion week. And the New York Timespublisheda lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.The relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship andfalling outwith Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump hadbroken up. Theirbromanceburned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musklashed outat the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.Elon Musk, AI and the antichrist: the biggest tech stories of 2025Read moreThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought toadvancehisrightwing agendaand grow his tech empire.While Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire wasinvited backin November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.“Well, I really don’t know,” Trumpsaid. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”Musk expressedmore regretthan the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”Musk goes to WashingtonAfter becoming aRepublicanmega-donorandcampaigningforTrumpduring the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set atone of chaosand outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.View image in fullscreenElon Musk speaks alongside Donald Trump to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on 30 May in Washington DC.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Muskissuedwhat many people interpreted as back-to-backfascist-syle salutesas he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla ownerssold their carsin response to Musk’s gestures.Musk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups afterappearingvirtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEOtold the crowdvia livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.View image in fullscreenA protester holds a sign depicting Elon Musk during a demonstration outside of Los Angeles city hall to demonstrate for immigration rights on 5 February.Photograph: Qian Weizhong/VCG/Getty ImagesAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved togut federal agenciesandconduct mass layoffsacross the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personallybragged aboutfeedingthe United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions andresult in children starving to deathin ahunger crisisthat experts agree was needless.We still don’t really know what Elon Musk’s Doge actually didRead moreAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. Hebrandished a chainsawon stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began topour more moneyinto Republican causes byholding ralliesandhanding out $1m checksto support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.The pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges thatruledDoge’sactivitiesillegalor issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, whocalled forthe widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court racelostby a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.Muskleft his rolein the White House in May amid disputes aroundhis pickfor who would head Nasa andclashesoverTrump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he wouldreducehis campaign finance contributions in the future andreturnto his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with hispublic battlewith Trumpon social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.Musk’s political leaningscontinued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson andtelling Joe Roganthat “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led anonline grievance campaignin early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.Musk’s constellation of businessesThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.Unlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which hebought for a second timethis year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.Of all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as peopleenragedbyMusk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’sshowrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing“Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide wereset on fireas one-off vandals protested the billionaire.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold signs when they gather outside of the Tesla dealership at a ‘Tesla Takedown’ protest on 22 March in New York City.Photograph: John Angelillo/UPI/REX/ShutterstockThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to aTesla sales eventon the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw itssales slumpworldwide.By June, Musk had announced therolloutof its self-driving robotaxis in Austin. Within the first week, bystanders had recorded videos of the cars having difficulty turning left or picking which side of the road to drive on, whichattractedthe attention of regulators. These robotaxis, which were required to operate with a human safety driver up until earlier this month, have encountered only ahandful of documented safety incidentssince then.Lawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida juryawarded more than $200mto victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California,twoseparatelawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration alsoopenedseveralinvestigationsinto the carmaker oversafety issues.AI boom adds more than half a trillion dollars to wealth of US tech barons in 2025Read moreWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders fromapprovinga pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.Tesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the companywill be bannedfrom selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.With SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX thego-ahead to increase rocket launchesin Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day flytoMars,repeatedlyblowing upandshowering shrapnelacross the Caribbean. One such explosion promptedlegal actionfrom Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.Musk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, heannouncedthat xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.xAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about“white genocide”, claimed Trumpwon the 2020 electionand spewed numerousantisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a$200m contractfrom the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.Meanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, wereaccused of pollutinghistorically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gasgeneratorsto power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and apending lawsuitfrom the NAACP.View image in fullscreenConstruction continues at an xAI datacenter in Memphis, Tennessee on 25 April.Photograph: Brandon Dill/The Washington Post/Getty ImagesNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing itsfirst successful implantationin 2024, the companyannouncedin September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.Throughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarinodepartedas X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Teslasaw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.A year of personal feudsMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media,Wikipediaand a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.Musk began the year byaccusingthe governmentof South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, includingdeclaringthat the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.Elon Musk makes himself far-right fixture after White House departureRead moreAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports oftense meetingsin the Oval Office and aloud, near-physicalyelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Muskcalling him“Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.Even Musk and Trump’sformerly close friendshipsoured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musklashed outat Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated hecould cancelMusk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Elon Musk speak to the press as they stand next to a Tesla vehicle on the South Portico of the White House on 11 March in Washington DC.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from theconstantpresenceat Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.Musk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added tohisseries of lawsuitsagainst Altman’s AI company with a case in August thatallegedApple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.One of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whosecutting observationabout him on X received more than 5.6m views.“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oatespostedin November.A day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies onX, he responded to Oates’s critique.“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Muskposted. “Not a good human.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTeslaSpaceXXTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The company’s shares are worth $1.4tn on the back of hopes for self-driving cars and robotics.Photograph: ReutersTeslaTesla publishes analyst forecasts suggesting sales set to fallTesla endured tough year in part thanks to some consumers’ distaste for Elon Musk’s embrace of rightwing politicsJasper JollyWed 31 Dec 2025 11.24 ESTFirst published on Wed 31 Dec 2025 10.58 ESTShareTesla has taken the unusual step of publishing sales forecasts that suggest 2025 deliveries will be lower than expected and future years’ sales will be well below targets set by its chief executive,Elon Musk.The US electric vehicle maker published figures from analysts suggesting it will announce 423,000 deliveries during the fourth quarter of 2025, in a new “consensus” section on its investor website. That would represent a 16% decline from the final quarter of 2024.The estimates suggested thatTeslawould deliver 1.64m cars in 2025 as a whole, down from 1.79m in 2024. Deliveries are then estimated to rise to 1.75m in 2026 and 3m in 2029.Musk claimed at a shareholder meeting in November that the company was aiming to produce 4m cars a year by the end of 2027.Tesla’s shares are valued at $1.4tn (£1.04tn), making it worth more than the next 30 carmakers combined despite its output being less than a fifth of that of Japan’s Toyota. Musk’s Tesla shares, as well as his stake in the rocket company SpaceX, have made himby far the world’s richest man, with a fortune estimated at $623bn, according to Bloomberg.However, much of Tesla’s valuation has been based on shareholder hopes that Musk will lead the carmaker to become the global leader in self-driving technology and robotics more generally.When it comes to actual sales,Tesla has endured a tough yearin part thanks to distaste among some consumers for Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics.In 2024, Musk was the biggest donor to the election campaign of Donald Trump and then launched an effort to cut government spending with the Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge). His alliance with the US presidentdid not survive the summer, with Trump instead scrapping buyer subsidies worth $7,500 a vehicle and slashing supportive regulations for electric cars.The estimates published by Tesla this week are lower than other compilers have suggested. An average of forecasts by investment banks compiled by Bloomberg suggested that Tesla would deliver 440,907 vehicles in the fourth quarter.Investment banks often publish sales and profit forecasts for large companies in order to judge the prospects for share price movements. “Missing” consensus forecasts often result in share price declines, and vice versa for a “beat”.The forecasts for later years are also far below Musk’s stated targets. In November, Musk said the carmaker was trying to increase production by 50% by the end of 2026, and to produce 4m cars by the end of 2027, according to a transcript compiled by AlphaSense, a data company. However, the forecasts suggest the carmaker will hit the 3m mark only in 2029.Tesla shareholders in Novemberapproved a $1tn compensation planfor Musk, in part on the basis of Tesla delivering 20m cars. Of those cars, 10m will have to have active subscriptions for “full self-driving”, its autonomous software, in order for Musk to qualify for the payment.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsSpaceXMotoringSelf-driving carsnewsShareReuse this content"

They don’t always get the plaudits they deserve, but these low-impact cardio machines not only putless strain on your jointsthan a treadmill but also help you get an impressive, full-body workout. Whether you hop on one to warm up before an intense strength-training session or use it to gently burn calories while listening to your favourite podcast, the elliptical or cross trainer can strengthen muscle, reduce fat and improve cardiovascular fitness.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, there is a catch in that these machines vary wildly in their design – and therefore the emphasis they place on different muscles. Traditional elliptical machines eschew moving handles, instead opting for static poles, while cross trainers usually have dynamic handles that recruit the muscles in your back, shoulders and arms. On top of this, stride length, the shape of the handles and the positioning of the footplates can make a big difference to the type of workout you’ll have.They can vary considerably in their weight and size, but are usually bulkier and more cumbersome than, say, a compacttreadmill. Home gym aficionados beware: you’ll likely need a fair amount of room for one of these. If you have enough space, though, an elliptical or cross trainer can be a valuable addition to your home training setup.At a glanceBest cross trainer overall:BowFlex Max Trainer M6£1,149.99 at JohnsonBest value elliptical trainer:Horizon EX-59£699.99 at JohnsonBest premium elliptical trainer:Technogym elliptical£3,940 at TechnogymBest compact cross trainer:JTX Strider-X8£399 at JTX FitnessBest full-body trainer:Schwinn 590 Elliptical£1,499 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’m a keen fitness fan who does gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes, as well as outdoor trail runs, cold-water surfing, and more. As a result, I’ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for magazines, newspapers and websites. I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I’m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells.I’m also a strong believer that you have to use new tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the correct environment. With exercise ellipticals and cross trainers, that meant getting hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.How I testedView image in fullscreenMost of the testing was performed in purpose-built boutiques or customer experience centres.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianAs with any modern piece of fitness equipment, the only way to ascertain whether it’s any good is to don your gym kit and get stuck in. So, after researching the newest and most popular models on the market, I set about trialling all eight of them.Most of my testing was carried out in purpose-built boutiques or customer experience centres because accommodating so many examples of such gym equipment in my home is not easy. I did manage to squeeze a couple into my garage via short-term loans, though.During workouts, I used a smartphone-based decibel reader to get a sense of how loud they were in use, and I also tested any connected or online features, which often meant downloading relevant apps and trialling their workout content.Where trainers had displays, I used these to log in to apps, such as Spotify and YouTube, and I also used any built-in Bluetooth speakers (if this function was offered). For each model, I made notes on ease of use, build quality and any features, as well as the overall size of the machine. If it had transport wheels, I used these to move the trainer around, simulating how easy it would be to manoeuvre in a domestic environment.The best cross trainers and elliptical machines to buy in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Will have your glutes and quads burning in rapid time’: the BowFlex Max Trainer M6.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianBest cross trainer overall:BowFlex Max Trainer M6BowFlexMax Trainer M6from£1,149.99£1,149.99 at Johnson£1,499 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat lower-body workout and fairly compactWhat we don’t loveCould be better for upper body; can’t adjust stride lengthPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£1,149.99 at Johnson£1,499 at AmazonBeing a petrolhead, I have to confess I was initially drawn to the BowFlex Max Trainer M6 because its LCD console reminds me of the dials found in a Mk3 Golf GTI. However, that’s not all that’s special about this cross trainer.Blending the motion of a stair-stepper with that of an elliptical machine, it has relatively compact dimensions and provides 16 resistance levels, enabling it to offer punishing, connected workouts.Those looking for powerful upper-body workouts or large, adjustable stride lengths may want to look elsewhere, but if you’re searching for a cross trainer that’ll have your glutes and quads burning in rapid time, look no further.Why we love itMost elliptical machines offer a gentle, calorie-burning workout, but the Max Trainer M6 is among the few that have left me fully gassed, with slightly weak legs at the end of a workout.This is because of its combination of elliptical and stepping motion, favouring shorter strides and an emphasis on downward pressure instead of the large strides of traditional machines. The handles are also intriguing as they offer a plethora of grip options, opening up the possibility of training multiple sections of the upper body (back, biceps, triceps and so on). But they’re fairly short, not offering a great range of motion to really work the upper body.The machine instantly connects with theBowFlex Jrny app, which is the company’s answer to Peloton, offering video-based workouts to make the experience more interactive. You’ll need an internet-connected smartphone or tablet, but the sessions are good, if limited, providing guided workouts that span all manner of fitness goals.Small(ish), quiet and relatively easy to move around, this is one of the few ellipticals that can be put away in the corner of a garage or living room without too much impact on living space.It’s a shame that… it doesn’t offer an adjustable stride length, and it will feel too much like a stepper for true elliptical fans.Dimensions:66 x 117 x 163cm (WLH)Weight:61.7kgDrivetrain:front-drive with magnetic resistance (16 levels)Stride length:38cmConnectivity:Bluetooth (for Jrny app access and HR tracking); USB charging port; media shelf for device placementFolding?NoNoise level:about 45dBMaximum user weight:136kgBuilt-in entertainment:no; burn rate dial and basic LCD, supports third-party workouts including Jrny via smartphone, tablet or laptopBowFlexMax Trainer M6from£1,149.99£1,149.99 at Johnson£1,499 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat lower-body workout and fairly compactWhat we don’t loveCould be better for upper body; can’t adjust stride lengthBest value elliptical trainer:Horizon EX-59HorizonEX-59 Ellipticalfrom£699.99£699.99 at Johnson£999.99 at DecathlonWhat we loveGreat build quality; good valueWhat we don’t loveResistance slow to adjust; display and speakers poorPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£699.99 at Johnson£999.99 at DecathlonAlthough it’s not the cheapest elliptical trainer on this list, the Horizon EX-59 is still my top value pick thanks to its array of features, robust build quality and a relatively low price.Why we love itA smooth, front-mounted flywheel provides 10 levels of quiet resistance, and oversize pedals accommodate a variety of different-sized users. With a stride length of 46cm, it’s not dissimilar to the larger elliptical machines you might find at a gym – meaning it feels more natural and less intense than a stepper or cross trainer.The EX-59 connects to third-party apps via Bluetooth, but it won’t automatically adjust the resistance like some rivals do. As with most Horizon fitness equipment, this model works with the brand’s@Zone app, which provides several high-quality on-demand workouts and training plans for free. There’s not a huge amount of content geared towards elliptical training, but most treadmill and exercise bike high-intensity interval training sessions work just as well.To me, it’s not the prettiest fitness machine, though it certainly does the job, offering drinks holders, a place to stash your smartphone or tablet, and a built-in heart-rate monitor on the static handles.The build quality is great, especially considering the price, although that doesn’t extend to the LCD display and console, which are basic. During testing, I found the changes to resistance inputs slow to react: not great if you’re indulging in a Hiit session and you need to spike the heart rate quickly. Similarly, the built-in Bluetooth speakers aren’t really worth the hassle of tethering a device – you’d get better sound quality out of a tin can. Instead, bring a pair of headphones, fire up the @Zone workout app and make the most of those free on-demand classes.It’s a shame that… the Bluetooth speakers are tinny, and ECB magnetic brake resistance is slow to react to inputs.Dimensions:61 x 186 x 167cm (WLH)Weight:74.5kgDrivetrain:front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (10 levels)Stride length:46cmConnectivity:Bluetooth speakers, device rack, USB rapid-charge port; compatible with popular fitness apps via Bluetooth FTMSFolding?NoNoise level:about 42dBMaximumuser weight:136kgBuilt-in entertainment:no touchscreen; has Bluetooth-enabled speakers and a tablet holder for external contentHorizonEX-59 Ellipticalfrom£699.99£699.99 at Johnson£999.99 at DecathlonWhat we loveGreat build quality; good valueWhat we don’t loveResistance slow to adjust; display and speakers poorBest foldable elliptical trainer:Technogym EllipticalTechnogymElliptical£3,940£3,940 at TechnogymWhat we loveClassy, quiet and compactWhat we don’t loveYou need a separate device for classesPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£3,940 at TechnogymIf money’s no object, it’s worth a visit to Technogym’s London Mayfair store, which is packed with drool-inducing fitness equipment that will make any home workout space feel like a five-star hotel.This elliptical trainer is part of the brand’s focus on the home and, as such, it folds upright to minimise its footprint in your living room, home gym or – in my case at least – cobweb-strewn garage.As a result, it shuns the traditional front- or rear-mounted flywheel for a suspended set of footplates and a resistance system that’s in its upright body. This helps save space but still offers a comparable, almost anti-gravity upper- and lower-body workout to other premium elliptical machines.With 25 difficulty levels and up to 600W of electrically adjustable resistance (up to 160 strides a minute: good luck with that), the elliptical packs a mean punch – and it works perfectly with the brand’s digital workout portfolio. Having said that, although there’s a basic screen to show all the usual important data, you’ll need to bring your own device if you want any sort of guided workout.Why we love itTechnogym’s “sessions” are up there with some of Peloton’s interactive classes, although you’ll need to provide your own tablet, smartphone or laptop. Unlike other fitness apps, there are plenty of elliptical-based classes to enjoy, which makes the experience feel much more enjoyable.Indeed, where some elliptical trainers can send me to sleep, the instructor in Technogym’s interactive classes will have you hanging off the unit, torching your glutes and pummelling your quads. It will keep you coming back for more.The movement itself takes a bit of getting used to: the stride isn’t quite as obvious as the larger units found in commercial gyms. I had to adapt my approach to get the most out of it, and I found it lacked the multiple grip positions and range of motion for effective upper-body focus training.Regardless, this trainer has Technogym quality baked into its core. It offers a huge spread of resistance levels, is virtually silent, and is all wrapped up in one of the most compact, storable and classy units on test.It’s a shame that… you have to bring a device to enjoy a workout, and Technogym’s monthly subscription fees are, predictably, expensive.Dimensions:65 x 162 x 160cm (WLH)Weight:100kgDrivetrain:front-drive electronically adjustable magnetic resistanceStride length:not specifiedConnectivity:tablet-compatible console for use with Technogym’s appsFolding?Yes (folds to 75cm length for compact storage)Noise level:about 36dBMaximum user weight:130kgBuilt-in entertainment:no built-in screen; designed for tablet use via consoleTechnogymElliptical£3,940£3,940 at TechnogymWhat we loveClassy, quiet and compactWhat we don’t loveYou need a separate device for classesBest compact cross trainer:JTX Strider-X8JTXStrider-X8from£399£399 at JTX Fitness£499 at AmazonWhat we loveSuper compact and affordableWhat we don’t loveSmall footplates won’t suit larger feet£399 at JTX Fitness£499 at AmazonThe JTX Strider-X8 was one of the most compact true ellipticals I got my hands on: it’s just 130cm long. The BowFlex Max Trainer M6 will fit better into tight spaces, but it doesn’t offer the same kind of traditional elliptical stride.Why we love itThe Strider-X8 provides 41cm of glorious gliding, corralled by a 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel at the rear. It’s quiet, although perhaps not as whisper-quiet as some rivals, and offers 16 levels of easily adjustable resistance.However, there are a few compromises. The compact proportions restrict the maximum user height to 5ft 9in, which means even a vertically challenged individual like myself is butting up against the limits. The build quality isn’t a strong point: the console, complete with basic display, looks and feels a bit like an oversized school calculator. However, this trainer is very much at the budget end of the budget spectrum. JTX offers a two-year at-home warranty, which should give some peace of mind for those worried it may not go the distance.Weighing 51kg, the Strider-X8 isn’t something you will want to pick up and heft around, but it’s easy to tip it on to its transport wheels and stash it somewhere convenient. Without going for a foldable, there are few cross trainers that can compete with it in terms of space-saving – and I managed to cram it into the corner of my busy garage with little stress.The workout experience is largely fine, although the smaller footplates will be a problem for users with larger feet. It connects seamlessly with third-party apps and can even be used with virtual training software, such as Zwift.The digital console is basic, but it all works, with a simple dial adjusting the levels of resistance. There are even 18 built-in programs for those who simply want to hop on and work out.It’s a shame that… parts of the machine feel cheap, and the built-in heart-rate monitoring is useless.Dimensions:70 x 130 x 169cm (WLH)Weight:51kgDrivetrain:7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel and electromagnetic resistanceStride length:41cmConnectivity:Bluetooth to fitness apps (such as Kinomap, iConsole+), built-in Polar heart-rate receiver (chest strap), hand pulse sensorsFolding?No; includes transport wheelsNoise level:about 38dBMaximumuser weight:120kgBuilt-in entertainment:no; LCD console with 18 workoutsJTXStrider-X8from£399£399 at JTX Fitness£499 at AmazonWhat we loveSuper compact and affordableWhat we don’t loveSmall footplates won’t suit larger feetBest full-body trainer:Schwinn 590 EllipticalSchwinn590 Ellipticalfrom£1,499£1,499 at Fitness Superstore£1,499 at AmazonWhat we loveOne of the best full-body workouts on testWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive, and speakers are mediocrePhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£1,499 at Fitness Superstore£1,499 at AmazonSchwinn packs a lot into its relatively compact 590 Elliptical, including the ability to electronically adjust the platforms to simulate gradients of -5% to 15%. Along with the multitude of upper-body handles, this sees it bundled into the cross-trainer category (despite its name). I found it offered one of the best full-body workouts on test.There are built-in speakers that are of mediocre quality (they’re better than those found on the Horizon EX-59 but still not brilliant) and a 7in digital display that allows for rapid leaps in resistance.Why we love itThere are handle-mounted controls for both the incline/decline and resistance settings, which is a welcome premium touch, and the unit is compatible with a multitude of virtual training software, includingZwiftand Schwinn’s recommendedJrny app.The 25 levels of resistance, the ability to adjust the incline and decline, and the multiple grip locations ensure the Schwinn provides one of the best and all-encompassing full-body workouts on test. With a pronated grip on the horizontal handles, I found it possible to work the big muscles of the back and the lats, while a supinated grip on the inner-most handles would place more emphasis on the shoulders and rear deltoid muscles.It’s a similar case for the lower body, as adjusting the decline and incline places a focus on muscles in the legs that I rarely use. Start playing around with body positioning, and it offers all of the benefits of a static hold with dynamic movement.Of course, you can adjust the intensity as you want, but I found the unit to be one of the best for working up a sweat. It all comes in one of the most compact and easy-to-store packages on this list, too.It’s a shame that… the built-in speakers aren’t really worth the effort, and it’s an expensive machine.Dimensions:86 x 148 x 173cm (WLH)Weight:96kgDrivetrain:front-drive with magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (25 levels)Stride length:51cmConnectivity:Bluetooth (heart-rate enabled and built-in speakers), USB charging port, tablet/media holder, Jrny and app compatibilityFolding?No; includes transport wheelsNoise level:about 32dBMaximum user weight:147kgBuilt-in entertainment:no; a 7in full-colour LCD with workout programs and connectivitySchwinn590 Ellipticalfrom£1,499£1,499 at Fitness Superstore£1,499 at AmazonWhat we loveOne of the best full-body workouts on testWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive, and speakers are mediocreThe best of the restSole E35 elliptical cross trainerSoleE35 elliptical cross trainer£1,799£1,799 at Fitness SuperstoreWhat we loveGreat for taller usersWhat we don’t loveTakes up a lot of spacePhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£1,799 at Fitness SuperstoreBest for:taller usersWith a generous 50.8cm stride length and oversized footplates, the Sole E35 is designed for taller and larger users, offering multiple handles and grip positions for a full-body workout.To me, it’s also one of the better-looking elliptical machines on this list, with modern styling and a sleek 10.1in touchscreen to use for a number of built-in workout sessions and longer-term fitness plans, as well as popular streaming apps, such as YouTube, Disney+ and more.There’s a built-in fan for keeping users cool, although it’s not hugely effective, as well as a set of speakers for streaming music. These are perfectly adequate, but don’t expect room-filling sounds.The 9kg flywheel provides plenty of resistance though, and with the FTMS protocol, it syncs up with Zwift and the brand’s ownSole+ app, offering a huge array of virtual workouts.It didn’t make the final cut because… it’s a large and heavy machine that requires plenty of storage space.Dimensions:60 x 177 x 177cm (WLH);weight:110.8kg;drivetrain:front-drive with computer-controlled magnetic ECB resistance (20 levels);stride length:50.8cm;connectivity:Bluetooth audio speakers, USB charging port, wifi, Sole+ and Kinomap app compatibility, tablet holder, wireless charging pad;folding?No; includes front transport wheels;noise level:about 35db;maximum user weight:158kg;built-in entertainment:10.1in touchscreen with built-in apps (YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ and so on), wifi and screen mirroringSoleE35 elliptical cross trainer£1,799£1,799 at Fitness SuperstoreWhat we loveGreat for taller usersWhat we don’t loveTakes up a lot of spaceMatrix Fitness E30Matrix FitnessE30from£2,249£2,879 at Fitness Superstore£2,249 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent qualityWhat we don’t loveThe quality comes at a high pricePhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£2,879 at Fitness Superstore£2,249 at AmazonBest for:gym quality at homeIt’s a little tricky to get your head around how the Matrix E30 works. On paper, it’s one of the more compact elliptical trainers I tested, yet it still manages to offer a 51cm stride length. This is all down to the clever, and quite complex, suspension system that houses the oversized footplates and traditional elliptical handles.Matrix kit is often found in commercial gyms and that’s pretty obvious here, as the build quality is excellent. It also sports a 10.5kg flywheel, which is one of the heaviest on test. It allows for 20 levels of resistance and is capable of a pretty hardcore workout.An updated XER console has a crisp 10in touchscreen that takes care of most of the functionality, as well as allowing access to a handful of streaming apps and virtual training programs.If you don’t want to pay for yet another monthly membership (Matrix suggestsiFIT), it can also play nicely with whatever third-party apps you like to use and features 11 built-in workout programs.It didn’t make the final cut because… it’s expensive, and the screen isn’t overly impressive.Dimensions:73x 166 x 148cm (WLH);weight:126kg;drivetrain:suspension elliptical front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels);stride length:51cm;connectivity:wifi, Bluetooth, USB port and entertainment apps (YouTube, Netflix and so on);folding?No;noise level:about 38dB;maximum user weight:147kg;built-in entertainment:10in touchscreen with apps, media streaming, web browser (XER console)Matrix FitnessE30from£2,249£2,879 at Fitness Superstore£2,249 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent qualityWhat we don’t loveThe quality comes at a high priceLife Fitness E1Life FitnessE1from£2,145£2,145 at Fitness Superstore£2,345 at Best Gym EquipmentWhat we loveFuss-free and simple to useWhat we don’t loveFeels basic compared with competitors£2,145 at Fitness Superstore£2,345 at Best Gym EquipmentBest for:build quality on a budgetLife Fitness is another brand often selected by commercial gyms for its reliability, and this also filters down into its domestic range.Considering how basic the E1 feels compared with some rivals, the price seems high, but this is a fuss-free elliptical with a massive fixed stride length, oversized footplates and an impressive spread of smooth and natural-feeling resistance. It’s also quiet.The basic digital Go Console lacks the flashiness of a massive interactive touchscreen, but it has 13 workout programs that are easily accessed via large and obvious buttons, great for those not fussed about binging Netflix during a workout. During testing, I found the lack of a touchscreen quite refreshing: it was easy to hop on and work out without the faff of connecting Bluetooth-enabled devices.Heart-rate monitoring is fairly reliable via its handles and sports the FTMS protocol for third-party app integration, but it also works perfectly well without it, and its built-in programs span hill training and fat-burning sessions.It didn’t make the final cut because… it feels expensive for what it is and looks dated.Dimensions:77 x 209 x 150cm (WLH);weight:96kg;drivetrain:front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels);stride length:51cm;connectivity:Go Console with LCD, Bluetooth telemetry heart-rate monitoring, 13 pre-loaded workouts;folding?No;noise level:about 32dB;maximum user weight:182kg;built-in entertainment:no built-in media apps; simple display for workout metrics and an integrated accessory tray for external device placementLife FitnessE1from£2,145£2,145 at Fitness Superstore£2,345 at Best Gym EquipmentWhat we loveFuss-free and simple to useWhat we don’t loveFeels basic compared with competitorsWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenGetting the right stride length for your height is key.Photograph: richiesd/Getty ImagesWhat is the difference between an elliptical and a cross trainer?The two terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences. A standard elliptical machine focuses on the forward and backward pedalling motion with fixed handles, providing a low-impact cardio workout that mimics running without the joint stress. A cross trainer typically includes moving handlebars that allow you to work your upper body as well, giving a more complete, full-body workout. In most modern home fitness equipment, “elliptical” and “cross trainer” usually describe the same type of machine.How much should I spend?Entry-level elliptical trainers start at about £400 and offer basic stride motion and limited resistance levels. Spending more than £1,000 typically gets you a sturdier build, smoother motion, more resistance levels and better consoles with Bluetooth or app integration. At the top end (£2,000+), you’ll find commercial-grade machines with advanced consoles, streaming services, more compact footprints, greater levels of resistance and suspension technology that greatly reduces noise and wear.How much room do I need at home?Ellipticals tend to be large machines, with footprints ranging from about 150cm in length and 70cm in width, all the way up to 200cm in length and 80cm in width, or more. You’ll also need to consider ceiling height – especially with front-drive machines, as pedals can lift you an additional 30-40cm off the ground.What features should I look out for?Stride length is a key factor: shorter strides (about 40-45cm) are suitable for smaller users, while taller users will benefit from 50cm or more. Look for adjustable resistance levels and incline options if you want to vary the intensity and muscle groups worked. Consoles with Bluetooth and app support can help track progress and keep workouts engaging, and some higher-end models include large touchscreens with streaming apps, fans, speakers and wireless charging pads. If space is a concern, compact or folding designs are worth exploring.Are there any maintenance concerns?Ellipticals are generally low-maintenance compared with treadmills. Most use magnetic resistance systems that don’t require ongoing adjustment as a treadmill’s belt does. Look out for manufacturer warranties that cover any wear and tear. Suspension ellipticals – which remove the traditional track and wheel system – tend to be even quieter and need virtually no lubrication.For more ways to get fit at home:The best treadmills, tested by our expert runnerPersonal trainers on the best home exercise kitLeon Poultneyis a lifelong fitness enthusiastwho can often be found trying not to kill himself on a mountain bike/surfboard/other extreme thing, often at the request of an editor.

Reviewing the top-performing articles that we published in 2025, I see a portrait of a conflicted year: plenty of great works and games that captured the imagination and the world’s attention, but also growing anxiety about their place in the real world, and the political circumstances they reflect. And a lot of (justified) hand-wringing over Roblox.But first: I wanted to extend heartfelt thanks to everyone who reads this newsletter and the rest of our work at the Guardian. If you’ve enjoyed our coverage, do consider supporting us to do more of it – either through arecurring or one-off contribution. Without your support, none of the great journalism we produce would be possible. Thank you for being with us in 2025, and I hope you stick around to watch me slowly lose my mind working overtime in the buildup to Grand Theft Auto 6’s release in November 2026. (Finally).In no particular order, here are the most read feature articles of the year.My chilling week on Roblox:sexually assaultedand shat on as a child avatar roaming the online worldThe Guardiancovered Roblox a lot in 2025, mostly from the perspective of child safety. As Sarah Martin discovered inthis article, it is extremely easy to get into inappropriate situations and chats in this free-for-all of a game platform, which has more than 150m daily users (most of them children). I am no fan of Roblox and don’t let my own kids play it, but if your little ones get joy out of it and you don’t want to prohibit the game entirely I recommend making sure it’s supervised where possible and those parental controls are locked down.I cannot stop playing this preposterous game about falling down a mountainFor some reason this tale ofmy self-flagellating travails with Baby Stepsseemed to speak to a lot of people.

As is my duty, I have to add to the pile. But does it all have to be quite so sad? Do we have to dutifully trawl through the muck to find some elusive meaning to what we’ve been forced to endure? Unfortunately, yes. It was a tough year (again) and we met it all with a shrug. As we’ve all been made punishingly aware,Dictionary.com’s word of 2025 is “6-7,”a viral meme slogan which is technically two words. Pretty cheeky of the Dictionary to cheat on their own assignment.How tragically emblematic of the year we just witnessed. We’re all too apathetic to even complain about getting swindled by a gaggle of word snobs. “Apathy” would have been a better choice for word of the year, considering how we’ve collectively shrugged at every dispiriting development of the last 12 months. Nicki Minaj popped up at the Turning Point USA conference to kiki with Erika Kirk and the most I could muster was “I guess she’ll do a concert at the Trump-Kennedy Center soon.”The year started with the back-to-back monstrosities of the Los Angeles wildfires and the second presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. I’d say it was all downhill from there, but we’ve already rolled down, hit every tree on the way, and ended up getting mauled by a pack of hungry grizzly bears.The year in patriarchy: Taylor Swift, Trump 2.0 and the Epstein files | Arwa MahdawiRead moreProtests against ICE grew, and there was another massive No Kings event in October, but most of the year was met with groaning resignation. We act as though we just have to wait out the clock on this accursed era, like the world’s worst NBA team hopelessly tossing up three-pointers while down by 50.Eventually, getting dunked on by LeBron James becomes tiresome. But what if, at the bottom of the restaurant dumpster that is life on Earth, there’s an unopened tin of caviar? Plus, a box of blinis, some creme fraiche, a bottle of ice cold champagne and also a lovely silver spoon. And a copy of Architectural Digest.The most luxurious indulgence imaginable is being able to fixate on people and events that actually don’t matter. Back in the old days, a series of stupid things would happen during the year and we’d all have a laugh about it. Remember the Macarena? That wasgreat. 2025 didn’t launch a dance craze on par with yuppies swiveling their hips like a broken car radio antenna in a windstorm, but we were blessed with just enough inanity to get us through a cursed year.Let’s start with Labubus. Doesn’t that sound nice? Little furry gremlin dolls that people who are bad with money decided to hoard like toilet paper during a mass quarantine. These dolls were everywhere, dangling from women’s purses and grinning up at us as though they pilfered the entire contents of the cash register at a Cinnabon. Labubus seemed to be the only ones smiling through 2025. Maybe they know 2026 is going to be worse.Sydney Sweeney sparked a good old-fashioned internet outrage cycle over anad for American Eagle jeansthat was only offensive if you were hoping to be offended. A pun about “genes” and “jeans” only seems like a nod to eugenics if you specifically cast an attractive blonde lady for the ad. If I had been the spokesperson, people would have had a hearty laugh over it. “Good genes? He can barely fit into his pants!” Honestly, I chuckled at the ad anyway. Mostly because someone actually thought it was a good idea.Speaking of internet outrage, Andy Byron, a tech CEO, and his head of human resources, Kristin Cabot, were caught on the kiss cam at a Coldplay concert. Cabot has subsequentlygone on a press tourto convince maniacs to stop threatening her life. She claims her and Byron had not been engaged in an affair prior to the explosion of #coldplaygate. I, for one, believe her. I’m constantly finding myself being held tenderly by my colleagues while Chris Martin warbles “Adventure of a Lifetime.”Everyone was eating Dubai chocolate, an expensive candy bar filled with pistachio cream so brightly green that it looks like it was injected with actual money. I didn’t buy one because I’m still saving my money for a Labubu.You know who can afford all the expensive chocolate and nightmare dolls they want? The thieves who robbed the Louvre of$102m worth of jewels. It took them less than seven minutes to swipe the treasures, which is the fastest anyone has made that amount of money outside of acrypto casino.But the most “important” story of 2025 was the engagement ofTaylor Swiftand football hunk Travis Kelce, an event stage managed to both drive listeners to Kelce’s podcast and hard launch Swift’s latest album cycle. The obviousness of the scheme was hard to ignore, though I don’t begrudge them the opportunity to leverage their romance for personal gain. I think we all would, if given the chance. I’d let American Eagle sponsor my wedding if they asked. “Dave Schilling does not have good genes, but he does have a delightful buffet for his guests to enjoy.”May we all be blessed with the honor of being walking sponsored content in 2026.

But we’ve found hope in unlikely placesRahila GuptaFrom El Salvador to Russia, Iceland and Syria, women are pushing back against the rise of regressive forces. Let’s support their fightRahila Gupta is an anti-racist feminist activist and the co-author, with Beatrix Campbell, ofPlanet PatriarchyWed 31 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 12.57 ESTShareIn 2025, the world that had been opened up by women has often seemed to be closing in. The forces behind the rollback of abortion rights in Donald Trump’s US are attempting todo the same in the UK. In Afghanistan, the Taliban has doubled down on its attacks onwomenandgirls. Sexual violence is commonplace inHaitiand theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. In Mexico, even the president is not safe fromsexual assault. A perverse rewilding appears to be taking place.You’d be forgiven for thinking that around the world, women’s rights are being concreted over. But in researching our book, Planet Patriarchy, Beatrix Campbell and I found women’s resistance erupting like green shoots through the cracks. In El Salvador, women can receive sentences of30-50 yearsfor miscarriages construed to be abortions. Yet feminists have managed to free all 72 women who had been imprisoned for this, using innovative penal and legal strategies. In Russia, feminists have taken to wearing blue and yellow ribbons, the colours of the Ukrainian flag, to signal their anti-war solidarity.The story that has emerged from Iceland is more hopeful still, as it overturned our assumptions about the conditions in which feminism thrives. The country’s much-vaunted place at the top of theWorld Economic Forum’sleague for gender equalitywas achieved under mainly conservative governments in the past 50 years, while social democratic governments held power for only five years. The presence of women in unions has been partly responsible for these achievements –more than 90%of the workforce is unionised, approximatelyhalfof the members are women and there is a growing number of womenin leadership roles.The1975 Icelandic women’s strike, in which 90% of its women participated, shut the country down for a whole day, inspiring women around the world to follow suit, demonstrating the indispensability of women’s paid and unpaid labour. The following year, Iceland passed a law guaranteeing sex equality. This year, an estimated50,000 peopletook part inthe 50th anniversarycommemorations of the strike because Iceland, too, has felt the global waters of misogyny lapping at its shores.There is much to learn and implement from Iceland’s policies on parental leave and equal pay. Employers are required to prove that they operate anequal pay for work of equal valuepolicy. While much has been achieved, much remains to be done: the hourly rates of pay are close to equal, butincomes over a lifetime reveal wage inequality caused bythe penalty of motherhoodand the unequal division of labour, time and power. Therates of sexual violence against womenalso remain high.The most inspirational advance in women’s rights – a women’s revolution, in fact – has been taking place in the unlikeliest of places. Buffeted by war with authoritarian Islamist forces since 2012, the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (popularly known as Rojava) now occupiesnearly a thirdof Syria. So many of my preconceptions were punctured when I visited Rojava: war is the classic moment in which all rights get suspended or eroded. Who thinks about the importance of gender equality, or racial inclusiv­ity, or direct democracy during war? Hadn’t the Arab spring been a failure? But were it not for the Arab spring, there would not have been a power vacuum in the north-east, which allowed the Kurds to engineer a bloodless revolution against President Bashar al-Assad, who was preoccupied with crushing the rebellion in southern Syria. The blood would come later in 2014 when Islamic State attacked, partly as a land grab and partly to shore up its own experiment with a medieval form of patriarchy that was a black-mirror reflection of the freedoms of women in Rojava.Rojava is an experiment in direct grassroots democracy. Neighbourhood communes of up to 300 people elect a man and a woman under the co-presidentship rule to represent them at the town council, which in turn elects members to the city level, and so on until they are represented at the overarching quasi-national people’s council. The commune elects members of specialist committees such as health, education, services or con­flict resolution, with equal membership of men and women led by co-presidents. Parallel to this structure, I found a women-only structure with its own committees, and the power of veto against any policies impacting women’s rights.The women of Rojava have pinned their colours to secularism in recognition of the pernicious impact of religion on women’s freedoms. They have disbanded sharia councils (unlike the UK), banned child marriage, polygamy and dowry, criminalised “honour” killings, introduced civil marriages and given women equal rights to inheritance and custody of their children, whatever their marital status.That other world that we hanker for is here. But it is being bombed by Turkey – to which the UK sells arms – which is threatened by a truly democratic society on its doorstep. Rojava is also at risk from the centralising impulse of the new leader ofSyria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose sharia-based government will mark the death knell for equality. Rojava’s survival, even as an idea, depends on women around the world setting up women’s assemblies in whatever civic space is available to them, to build their democratic muscle and become a force for change. We need to do all we can to steady this flickering flame, which could light up the path to our future.Rahila Gupta is an anti-racist feminist activist and the co-author, with Beatrix Campbell, ofPlanet PatriarchyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Delete InstagramLéa AntignyEvery time I open the app I’m bombarded with reels from accounts I don’t follow, promising they’ve cracked the codeWed 31 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 18.30 ESTShareOne afternoon, on a quiet coastal holiday with my family, I lay down for a nap. The day up until then had been full of the simplest pleasures I could recall from my own childhood holidays – cereal in individual serving boxes, running barefoot on the sand, being chased by the tiniest of waves. Then I openedInstagram.I emerged from my rabbit hole an hour later, bleary-eyed and depressed from consuming reel after reel after reel, from accounts all promising they had cracked the code to parenting. It had started with a mumfluencer promising she could help me becomea more playful mother.She was targeting a specific type of mother with specific anxieties, that I perhaps reveal too much about myself by describing here. Her audience was the mum who wants to be present and playful with her kids but finds it difficult, sometimes boring. The mum who knows how important play is but can’t stay focused for long enough, or doesn’t know how to prioritise. It’s ironic that one of the main culprits for my dwindling attention span and capacity for imagination is likely the very app I was scrolling on.My five-year-old daughter is learning to love cricket. It’s a source of delight in a difficult summer | Kate LyonsRead moreIt feels as though these parenting hack accounts have exploded lately. Every time I open Instagram I am bombarded with reels from accounts I don’t follow, promising they’ve cracked the code to one or other element of motherhood: how to become the fun mum, the present mum, the self-care mum, the personal-style mum.It’s like entering a surreal immersive art experience: stare down the tunnel and watch the woman doing 80s hip-hop dances in front of her dresser telling you why you don’t look cool in barrel pants, swipe up to the woman picking tomatoes and snapdragons from her garden at sunset, swipe up to the one cataloguing “what I wear to the playground as a mum of two who still wants to look chic”, swipe up to the mother who’s presumably set up a tripod in a car park to film her getting her baby in and out of the car seat.Next the experience becomes interactive. Don’t you feel this way too? Haven’t you experienced this? I know you have: comment! Comment FUN to receive my guide in your DMs! Comment PLAY comment TIRED comment PRESENT!All these accounts are preying on common insecurities felt by modern parents: that we don’t play enough, we spend too much time at work, our temper is too short, we’ve lost our personal style and that must mean something deeper about us. And lately, many of these influencers recommend some version of putting down your phone, all the while serving up content that demands more engagement.It’s an ouroboros of influencing: content makers sharing carefully staged and edited content reminding you life is not content. Reels that show a “real home”, household clutter and dirty dishes now repackaged as a promise to “de-influence” you. Reels that encourage you to resist consumerism while tagging the brands of any outfit worn therein.When we are trying to follow scripts from online we lose our curiosity about these little people whose needs are simpleBut we don’t need any of it! Like my beach holiday reminded me, we have quotidian delights and a world that, no matter how distracted we adults have become, is full of wonder for a child. My four-year-old playing for hours with a unicorn-print pencil case found at a local op shop is proof of this.I suspect the real key to enjoying play or having more patience or a wilder imagination, or even simply more time, is to exit the hamster wheel altogether. Do this by deleting Instagram and putting your phone away. I say this not to scold and not even in service of any goals of being more present, playful, engaged (though surely these are outcomes too). I say it because these apps and influencers invite us to play an unwinnable game.I think it’s perfectly fine for a parent to need a place to zone out. We aretired.If I manage to grab a moment alone and want to spend it doing Wordle or texting friends or browsing 70 versions of nearly identical brown loafers, who really cares?The thing I want to reject in these moments is the drive to optimise parenthood. I already have my gut instinct which, with enough time away from social media, only gets stronger and louder and more reliable. Funny that scrolling through other parents’ content for hours on end might make you less sure of that instinct.I want to reject the trick premise that we should, or even can, optimise parenthood. That we should approach raising our children like a project rather than a relationship with a growing person. When we are trying to follow scripts from online we lose our curiosity about these little people whose needs are simple most of the time: love, kindness, belief, safety, calm. Dinner with the green bits picked out.Instagram is like a slot machine and I guess the fun thing about slot machines is that you do occasionally win. You see the lights go flash and the sound go bing and collect your coins. But the only way to actually win on slot machines is to shut the door and leave them where they are.Léa Antigny is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionSocial mediaFamilyInstagramcommentShareReuse this content"

I don’t fully agree, but I get itDevi SridharWhile GLP-1 drugs promise an easy fix, our bodies still need what they have always needed: healthy food and regular exerciseProf Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghWed 31 Dec 2025 08.13 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 13.45 ESTShareIf there has been a hot topic in health in 2025, it’sdefinitely been GLP-1s, colloquially referred to as “anti-obesity” jabs. These medications, taken weekly as an injection into the abdomen, result in significant weight loss and, despite being developed to manage type 2 diabetes in those with metabolic disorders, have become mainstream in many countries as a treatment for obesity.Clinicians rave about the health outcomesin patients taking the medication, with study after study emerging on the health benefits of the associated weight loss in those who are obese. Celebrity endorsements, online sales and off-label use have seen them widely used by people of all ages and sizes who want to drop weight.For the public health community, it’s an odd moment. For years, we’ve advocated forgovernment action on obesity– not through new drugs, but by taking nutrition and food systems seriously. We’ve highlighted the need for government action on making nutritious food affordable, regulatingultra-processed foods,bringing in sugar taxes and banning advertising of unhealthy products to young people, alongside encouraging an increase in physical activity. The solutions are simple: get people to eat more nutritious food and move. The challenge has been implementation, especially in deprived areas.So when GLP-1 drugs such as semaglutide started to be used as a widespread weight-loss solution, resulting in massive profits for pharmaceutical companies, the first reaction in public health circles was something between horror and exasperation. Not because the drugs didn’t work, but because they symbolised a kind of surrender. After decades of fighting to change the food and physical activity culture, here came a pharmaceutical company offering a weekly jab as the answer to a problem created by the transnational food industry.The irony isn’t lost on me. One set of companies profits by making populations obese; another now profits by promising to reverse it, at least for as long as people can keep paying and injecting. We still don’t know thelong-term side effectsof these drugs, especially in those within a healthy weight range and with normal metabolic function.But in the past year, more and more countries have been moving towards rolling out GLP-1 drugs as the main treatment for obesity. In fact, theWorld Health Organization(WHO) recently recommended GLP-1 drugs as treatment for obesity in all countries. For decades, the WHO had resisted pharmaceutical solutions for obesity, insisting the crisis was environmental, structural and political. The agency is now saying something different: people are dying of obesity-related diseases across the world, and we have a tool that works.For some, this is capitulation. Has 2025 been the year that global health finally gave up on fixing the social and commercial causes of obesity and talking about nutrition? Obesity rates are tightly linked tosocioeconomic status.In fact, it’s been said that child obesity is a reflection of child poverty. GLP-1s were created to medically treat those with a metabolic disorder. Are we saying that the poorest 20% of people (who have higher obesity rates) have a metabolic disorder that the richest 20% don’t have? Surely not.We know diet is linked to income, time, education and resources. If obesity is “treatable” with a jab, why take on the food industry? Why invest in affordable fruit and vegetables or healthy school lunches? GLP-1s have become a way for many politicians to appear to be doing something while avoiding dealing with thesystematic food production and consumption issuesthat are making us sick.But I can understand the WHO’s pivot, because obesity is not a theoretical problem that we have time to solve. It’s killing people and disabling them in daily life. Just ask any clinician about the impact of these drugs on people with heart disease, diabetes, fatty liver disease, joint failure … the list goes on. It’s all well and good talking about redesigning food systems, but right now, we have a drug that reliably reduces weight, improves metabolic markers and reduces cardiovascular risk. In that context, you can understand doctors seeing the health benefits in their patients and the WHO advocating for these drugs to be made affordable and accessible all across the world, including in low-income countries.We still need to be careful about the reality of these drugs for individuals. They require a weekly injection, potentially creating lifelong dependency, given that studies have shown thatweight rebounds when they’re stopped. They have side effects and can cause serious complications, especially for people who aren’t prescribed them by a doctor. They also don’t negate the need to eat a nutritious diet. Just like you can be overweight and malnourished, you can also be thin and malnourished.Plus, losing weight alone doesn’t bring the health benefits of physical activity. Exercise strengthens the heart, builds muscle, protects the brain from depression, anxiety and dementia, and helps reduce chronic pain. Perhaps 2026 will bring an exercise pill, but so far, we don’t have any drug that can mimic its benefits. For all the promise of GLP-1s, the body still needs what it has always needed: affordable and accessible nutritious food and daily movement. Perhaps it’s a pipe dream, but I hope the coming year will bring societal changes to make that possible for all of us, without needing a weekly jab.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghFit Forever: Wellness for midlife and beyondOn Wednesday 28 January 2026, join Annie Kelly, Devi Sridhar, Joel Snape and Mariella Frostrup, as they discuss how to enjoy longer and healthier lives, with expert advice and practical tips.

But in 2025, words of depth and courage have been an antidote to numbnessWed 31 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 07.20 ESTShareIonce saw a young glassblower in Istanbul, still new to his craft, shatter a beautiful vase while taking it out of the furnace. The artisan master standing by his side calmly nodded and said something that I still think about. He told him: “You put too much pressure on it, you kept it unbalanced and you forgot that it, too, has a heart.”The year we are leaving behind has been plagued from the start by a series of social, economic, environmental, technological and institutional challenges, all happening with such speed and intensity that we are yet to fully comprehend their impact on our lives, let alone on future generations. As the overwhelming strain of domestic and geopolitical changes continues to build up, I cannot help but remember the man’s words. Too much pressure. Unstable, uncertain and replete with deep inequalities. This could well be the year we forgot that the Earth, too, has a heart. It definitely feels like the year when the world was broken.In 2024, to be fair, many of the current problems were already present and growing. But there was also a strong wave of positive expectations and public excitement as more than 1.6 billion peoplewent to the polls. It was a time of unparalleled concentrated democratic activity full of promises, incautious confidence, passionate speeches and fiery oratory. Many voters were keen to express their anger and discontent, and express it they did. The mammoth year of elections revealed the importance of not only the ballot box, but also of the surrounding democratic institutions and norms. Language matters. How we talk to each other matters. Democratic decline always starts with words. When political opponents are treated as “enemies”, or even worse “enemies of the people”, the whole system suffers.Compared with that, the past 12 months have been marked by an emotional and intellectual fatigue for many people across different borders. What we are used to calling “the liberal international order” no longer carries weight. Deeply fractured and unable to hide its cracks, it is coming apart. Thehousing crisis, the lack of affordable rents and equal opportunities, andsocial and economic injustices have all eroded trust. Meanwhile, climate breakdown, AI threats and risks to pluralism, the possibility of another pandemic, and increasing militarism and jingoism alongside shifting alliances have contributed to the sense that the system that emerged from the ruins of the second world war has come to an end. As we close the first quarter of the century under the shadow of anew nuclear age, uncertainty is everywhere.In 2025, divisions have sadly deepened. At a time when humanity is faced with immense global challenges, we have been pushed further into boxes of “us v them”.View image in fullscreenAn Afghan girl carries drinking water in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August 2025. Experts have warned that the city could become the first in the world to completely run out of water.Photograph: Samiullah Popal/EPAAn existential anxiety affects and drains many of us – east, west, north and south. Young and old. Perhaps some people are better at hiding their emotions than others, but when we look underneath polished social media facades of happy and fulfilled lives, we can see that anxiety is actually widespread. Fear. Frustration. Enervation. A new word has been coined to define the zeitgeist: “polycrisis”. The worst thing we can do, individually and collectively, is to allow ourselves to descend into numbness. To become desensitised to the pain and suffering of others:in Gaza, in Sudan, in Ukraine. This is why good and honest journalism matters all the more today. Many pieces published in theGuardian this year not only showed a remarkable depth and breadth, but also helped us to remain engaged and connected. In that sense, they are an antidote to numbness.There were sentimental moments this year, too. In the UK,we cried again over the Sycamore Gaptree and the senseless, meaningless hatred displayed by two men, convicted this year, who decided it would be fun to cut down something that had brought joy to so many for so long.It is interesting that the human sentimentality that we were allowed to display in response to the death of a beloved tree was denied to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, when she was caught on camera crying in the Commons. The media and social media coverage was rather sexist.Amelia Gentleman wrote a coruscating pieceasking why women’s workplace tears are regarded as a source of shame. Delving into another emotionally difficult subject, Polly Toynbeewrote courageouslyon the assisted dying debate, underlining how a decent life can end in a decent death.One of the most poignant and important pieces published this year was co-written by Malak A Tantesh and Emma Graham-Harrison about the despair of parents and grandparents in Gaza watching their children and grandchildren with skeletal bodies, so malnourished that they have become vulnerable to all kinds of horrible diseases: “We have faced hunger before, but never like this.” Dan Sabbagh composed an article about Ukraine that highlighted the devastating consequences of the occupation and war for ordinary families, with one person stating: “We never thought the war would come to our village.” Amplifying human stories can help to dismantle the cold and elitist rhetoric that treats people as sheer numbers.View image in fullscreenOasis perform during their reunion tour in Melbourne in October 2025.Photograph: Joel Carrett/EPAA recent report revealed thatKabul could soon become the first modern cityto completely run out of water, with all the aquifers drying up as early as 2030. More than 6 million people live in Afghanistan’s capital. In the UK, there is a growing public resentment and anger against water companies that keep pumping sewage into our rivers. Meanwhile, rivers are dying elsewhere, with the Middle East and north Africa being home to seven out of the 10 mostwater-stressed nations. The climate crisis is the story of water and the ones who disproportionately bear the brunt are always women, children and tpoor people.There were some moments of light. Even small miracles, such asthe reunion of Oasis. We have seen a heartwarming rise in book clubs and reading parties. Unexpectedly, in this time of hyperinformation and fast consumption, manyyoung people are taking up traditional hobbies. It feels as if the faster our world spins, the more urgent and universal our need to slow down, to connect, to think, to care.In Argentina recently, an 18th-century painting called Portrait of a Lady that was stolen from a Jewish art collector by the Nazis was recovered after beingspotted on an estate agent’s listing. She looks at us calmly, the woman in the portrait, in her flower-embroidered dress; she who has seen too many atrocities but is still resilient and full of life. As always, art, culture and literature offer us a sanctuary, a home, a sense of togetherness. Glassblowers remind us that even the worst shattered glass can be melted, resculpted and revived. It all begins with an honest recognition of what remains broken and a willingness to mend.Elif Shafak is a novelist and political scientistThis is an edited version of Elif Shafak’s introduction toThe Bedside Guardian 2025Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

To stop them, we must break the culture of silenceMukund KrishnaThe rape and murder of Sarah Everard by an off-duty officer should have led to cultural change. Without it, neither communities nor officers are safeMukund Krishna is chief executive of the Police Federation of England & WalesWed 31 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 14.38 ESTShareLast year, part one of Elish Angiolini’sgovernment-commissioned inquiryinto the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by Wayne Couzens, an off-duty police officer, considered how that outrage happened. The recently releasedpart twoof the Angiolini inquiry is just as devastating: a reminder of what happens when policing fails to face the harm in its own ranks. It confirms what the public already suspects, and many officers know: the predatory behaviour of Couzens and others like him doesn’t just slip through the cracks – it survives in the gaps created by weak supervision, flawed vetting and a culture in which silence feels safer than speaking up.Policing’s greatest challenge is not crime, but a corrosive mindset shaped by relentless demand, inadequate leadership and structural weaknesses across a broken system. Unless we confront that truth with honesty and humility, we will fail both the public and those who serve them.When I came to the UK from India 20 years ago, I was struck by the quiet authority of British policing – professional, restrained and rooted in consent. That early impression shaped my belief in what policing can and should be. Since then, I have seen policing at its best, but also the strain behind the uniform, and a culture that punishes reflection instead of learning from it. The findings of the Angiolini inquiry show what that culture costs.The problems revealed are not isolated scandals; they are symptoms of deeper failures in supervision, accountability and courage. In her report into police culture and standards of behaviour,Louise Casey warnedof a service at risk of losing its moral compass. BBC Panorama, with its undercoverinvestigation into officer wrongdoingat Charing Cross police station in central London, and other similar inquiries, have exposed behaviour that has no place in any public institution, least of all one with coercive powers.Yet the fractures in trust do not just affect the relationship between the police and the public; they are starkly evident within policing too. Over a fifth of officers have been involved in a misconduct case in which the perpetrator was another officer, and witnesses outnumber victims three to one. Nearly half of our officers do not trust their forces to handle internal misconduct properly.Women are almost three times more likely than men to be victims in these cases, and ethnic minority officers report higher dissatisfaction and greater fear of reporting. Among officers with fewer than five years’ service, 44% say fear stops them from reporting the misconduct they see. Silence becomes a survival strategy – the very dynamic that allowed the offenders described in the Angiolini inquiry to thrive.Let’s be clear: a service that cannot protect its own people cannot expect to earn the trust of the public. Some will argue the federation’s job is simply to defend officers. But protection without accountability is not protection at all. The public can’t feel safe, and neither can officers.That is why early in the new year, for the first time, we are launching the victim and witness support programme, offering confidential advice and welfare support for officers who are victims or witnesses of misconduct. It includes strict ethical walls, confidentiality protections and an option to seek support from a central, impartial team – foundations of a system people can trust.But support mechanisms alone, however welcome, will not change culture. For that to happen, leaders at every level must decide that silence is no longer acceptable. For too long, policing has met scrutiny with defensiveness and treated challenge as disloyalty. Renewal demands that we reward honesty and protect those who speak it.We must also face the pressures shaping policing today. A third of our members say low pay has pushed them or their families into debt this year; some have used food banks. Exhaustion and financial strain weaken judgment, morale and the ability to uphold the standards the public rightly expect.There is a phrase I often use: we cannot fix what we will not face. A harsh mirror has been held up to policing and whether we like what we see is beside the point; what matters now is whether we have the courage to act on it.I still believe in the founding idea of British policing: service by consent. But consent relies on trust, inside policing as well as outside it. Rebuilding that trust demands humility, not slogans, and for the police, it must begin with confronting the harm in our own house.Mukund Krishna is chief executive of thePolice Federationof England & WalesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Cameo’s Candy, one of the all-time great funk records, comes on and everyone lines up to do the dance. Maybe you throw yourself into it, maybe you are a white friend who looks around in confusion, or maybe, like me, you just sigh in resignation.The dance is a US import, beginning life as the electric slide in the mid-70s, and eventually becoming the Candy in Britain, thanks to its appearance at the end of the 1999 movieThe Best Man. Since then, be it birthdays, christenings, Christmas, NYE – even funerals – you’re certain to see the dancefloor immediately fill and get into formation once the initial few chords are played.Like many a mere mortal who failed to graduate from the James Brown & MC Hammer School of Rhythm, I despise the Candy. Not only because I’m not a great dancer – a Black counterstereotype that forces me to overcompensate in other areas – but also because I have witnessed the corrosive effect of the dance far too often. That the Candy is a cultural disaster is a hill I am more than willing to die on.First off, the Candy is not the fire-cracking party starter many have deluded themselves into thinking. A true connoisseur of the late-night boogie down knows that is a party destroyer. Yes, it’s delightful to witness everyone hop in formation and attempt a six-minute vigorously demanding dance formation, but what happens afterwards? In simple terms: everyone is too tired, too sweaty and too dizzy to continue. So they politely find their coats, car keys and excuses and make their way for the door.Another issue with the Candy is that it undermines the DJ and brings out the demon in the partygoer. Not long ago, I was hosting a memorial party for a great Black British writer. I was doing what people who can’t dance and don’t drink do: telling mean-spirited jokes and scornfully gossiping about book sales. Suddenly, I was dragged to the DJ booth. “Tell him to play Candy! Tell him to play Candy right now or I will never book him again!” said a usually reasonable friend, her eyes glowing with fury. “TELL HIM!”View image in fullscreenLarry Blackmon and Cameo perform at the Stone Soul Picnic in Hayward, California on 31 May 2004.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty ImagesThe DJ, a highly respected bluechip artist and record executive who has been in the business since I was a child, offered a bewildered shrug. Out of politeness, he played it, a mere half an hour into a four-hour shindig. The formation was formed. The dance was performed. Soon afterwards my friend was the first to reach for her bag and coat. The party was over before it started and at the end of the night we were forced to settle a hefty minimum spending bill. The DJ politely explained: “I’ve been doing this for nearly 40 years. I know exactly what to play and when. Candy should either end the party or it just destroys the party.”Perhaps the biggest sin of the Candy is that it is not inclusive. It is a one-size-fits-all dance with no variation or room for error, divergence or diversity. You’re either with the programme or have your back on the wall. On the bright side, the lack of inclusivity probably makes it the most quintessentially British national dance ever. It is a true reflection of our social order.Nels Abbey is an author, broadcaster and the founder ofUppity: the Intellectual PlaygroundExplore more on these topicsMusicThe hill I will die onBlack British cultureDanceWeddingscommentShareReuse this content"

Should you lose your account? Your job? Your citizenship? Go to jail? Die? For the people who have launched a campaign against the British-Egyptian writer and activistAlaa Abd el-Fattah, no punishment is too great.I have no interest in defending the awful tweets in question, which Abd el-Fattah posted in the early 2010s. Many are indefensible and he has apologised “unequivocally” for them. He has alsowritten movinglyabout how his perspective has changed in the intervening years. Years that have included more than a decade in jail, most of it in Egypt’s notorious Tora prisonwhere he faced torture; missing his son’s entire childhood – and very nearly dying during a months-long hunger strike.None of this suffering seems to be enough for Abd el-Fattah’s accusers. They want this man and this family to suffer yet more punishment. They are calling for him to be stripped of his British citizenship, to which he is entitled because his mother was born in the UK, and for him to be deported back toEgypt, the country that already robbed him of 12 years of his freedom. It’s a fate that could be a death sentence.I do not believe that piling torment on top of torture is what decent British people consider justice, let alone proportionate punishment.Alaa Abd el-Fattah came to global attention because he wasa leading figurein the 2011 pro-democracy revolution that turned Cairo’s Tahrir Square into a surging sea of young people. The demonstrators chanted “Down with corruption”, “Down with autocracy” and “Down with dictators.” When the uprising succeeded in toppling Egypt’s dictator Hosni Mubarak, the world rejoiced, including Europe and North America. Abd el-Fattah was all over the media, a voice for the part of the movement that was committed to building an accountable, participatory democracy from the ground up.But the Tahrir Square victory was short lived. The militaryseized powerand violently turned on the young protesters. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed and tens of thousands were thrown in jail. Alaa Abd el-Fattah was among them, and it soon became clear that keeping him behind bars was a top priority for the generals who ultimately replaced Mubarak. #FreeAlaa became a global rallying cry and remained so for well over a decade – until this past September, when Alaa finally walked free.View image in fullscreenAustralian journalist Peter Greste, arrested and imprisoned in Egypt in 2013 while reporting for Al Jazeera, stands with Laila Soueif, mother of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, as he joined her on hunger strike outside Downing Street in London, Britain, 20 January 2025.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersA travel ban imposed by Egypt still prevented Abd el-Fattah from leaving the country and reuniting with his son in the UK. Then, on Boxing Day, he landed at Heathrow, soon to celebrate his son’s birthday for the first time in 12 years. But that joy wouldn’t last long either: the calls for his deportation were unleashed less than 24 hours after he landed.Abd el-Fattah’s tweets surfaced online on 27 December, and were quickly picked up by British far-right activistTommy Robinsonand Reform UK leaderNigel Farage. The next day, the Sunday Telegraph led the campaign with afront pagereading “Starmer welcomes ‘extremist’ to Britain”. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, had spoken to the Telegraph for this story, saying: “This awful extremist should never have set foot in the UK again.” By Monday, the Tories were reported as calling for thedeportation of “scumbag” Abd el-Fattahand revocation of his citizenship, with Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch saying that citizenship decisions “must take account of social media activity, public statements, and patterns of belief”. (Which sounds very much like Donald Trump’s United States.)Reform UK had also set up a websitewith a petitioncalling for Abd el-Fattah’s removal from the UK.Many people tuning into the manufactured storm know little of Abd el-Fattah, and less about his role in a historic revolution for democracy and human rights. They see only the ugly screengrabs, designed to paint a picture of a religious sectarian who must hate Jews and white people, and who celebrates terrorism that targets civilians. Many of the attacks on Abd el-Fattah invoke the hideous antisemitic crimes atBondi beachon the first night of Hanukkah and at asynagogue in Manchesteron Yom Kippur, implying, outrageously, that this pro-democracy, anti-sectarian, human rights activist is somehow a similar danger. And it works: many dofeel vulnerable and frightened, because these are frightening times. That fear is what this campaign is all about: trying to make people afraid of Abd el-Fattah, and by extension, Muslims and migrants. Like so much in this political moment, in the UK and elsewhere, they are tightening the circle around what is considered a “real” citizen.The people who curated the posts to achieve maximum fear and shock don’t want us to know about other tweets Abd el-Fattah posted in this same period. Such as the times he confronted people who blamed Jews for the actions of the Israeli state,writing: “We stand against zionism never against a religion, and there are many brave anti zionist jews.” Or when helifted upthe voices of young Jewish descendants of the Arab and Islamic world living in Israel who, he wrote, were “demanding a just solution to the Palestinian cause that includes them”.They also skipped over the many times that Abd el-Fattah spoke out against terrorism that targets civilians, including attacks committed in the name of Islam. In one post hewrote: “To me the context never justifies killing civilians”; inanother, “I’m saying killing civilians is never justified”; and onemore: “It doesn’t matter at all who started it; there’s no reason in the world that justifies raising an automatic weapon against civilians in front of their homes.” He alsowrote, in 2013: “Islamic terrorism is really ramping up its efforts these days, and … all the victims are unarmed civilians.”Do these posts cancel out the ones that say the exact opposite? No. But they do make it harder to turn Abd el-Fattah into the unrecognisable menacing “anti-white Islamist” figure currently flooding the internet. Further complicating that caricature are the staunchly anti-sectarian, egalitarian actions he took as a human rights advocate, in the real, non-online world.For instance, in October 2011, the Egyptian military violently attacked a peaceful protest of the Coptic Christian minority, killing 28 people and injuring hundreds more. To cover up those crimes, state media tried to foment a religious war, and “turned neighbours against each other, Muslims against Christians and transformed the hospital into a sectarian site under siege,” as the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policyreported.Abd el-Fattah, who is Muslim, stood with his Christian comrades, spending the night rushing from morgue to hospital, desperately trying to make sure that evidence of the military’s crimes was not buried with the bodies of the fallen. He comforted families, and argued with clerics. “I smell of morgues, dead bodies and coffins, I smell of dust, sweat and tears,” hewrotethe next day. “I don’t know if I can wash it all away.” For these acts of solidarity, he was thrown in jail, not for the first time, or the last.When hasty electionsbriefly broughtthe Muslim Brotherhood to power, and a new wave of repression began, Alaa Abd el-Fattah again raised his voice against the thwarting of the revolution’s dream of real democracy. Again, he was arrested. But the real nightmare began when the military, led by Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood in a military coup in 2013.The top priority of the al-Sisi regime, still in power to this day, has been to crush the liberatory dream of the Arab spring. This meant keeping Abd el-Fattah behind bars almost continuously, mostly under maximum security. Even when the worlddescended on Sharm el-Sheikh in 2022for a UN climate summit, and#FreeAlaa becamethe conference’s rallying cry, even when film stars and Nobel laureatescalled for his release, the regime would not relent.The rationales changed, the charges shifted. In 2013, he was imprisoned for allegedly organising a peaceful demonstration (earning him a five-year sentence), then for sharing a Facebook post about the torture of another prisoner (another six years for “fake news”). Everyone knew that Abd el-Fattah’s real crime was always the same: being the most prominent reminder of the dream of a non-sectarian, decolonial, democratic Egypt. As he once tweeted: “I’m the ghost of spring past.”Keir Starmer appears surprised by the attack, and embarrassed that he and his staff failed to go through every single one of Abd el-Fattah’s social media posts before advocating for his release from unjust imprisonment and welcoming him to the UK. The prime minister said the government was “taking steps to review the information failures in this case”.That will prove to be a very big task. Back in the day, Alaa Abd el-Fattah was what is known as extremely online. He posted 280,000 times on Twitter alone. When his colleagues set out to compile theanthology of his writing, they calculated that his social media posts could have filled one hundred books, each of them 300 pages long.Or maybe the government could skip the retroactive surveillance and judge Alaa Abd el-Fattah neither by his best tweets nor his worst ones. Rather, he can be judged by the dignity and steadfastness with which he has fought for freedom – both the Egyptian people’s and his own. Maybe they could even trust that they did the right thing in the first place.Alaa is not a saint. He is, however, a hero of a stolen revolution, and a potent symbol of hope for millions still living under brutal dictatorship. His freedom is a hard-won victory for justice, at a time when those are few and far between. He deserves to enjoy it in peace.Naomi Klein is a Guardian US columnist and contributing writer.

It’s a journey. Mine began on an escalator at Berlin Brandenburg airport. It was a Sunday afternoon. I was heading up to the check-in counters for my return flight to Istanbul, where I’ve lived for the past few years. On the other side, people were heading down – fresh off flights into Berlin. I was daydreaming, my eyes drifting across bags and figures, when I paused at a brown leather bag and a light linen suit. Charming travel outfit, I thought. Relaxed. Timeless. Someone must’ve had a lovely weekend, maybe somewhere on the Mediterranean. I only saw the man’s face as he passed me – and suddenly I couldn’t breathe.I knew him. He was my father.Had he seen me, too? Unlikely. Who expects to run into their estranged daughter, whom they haven’t seen in years, on an airport escalator? For a moment, I thought about turning around, going back down, catching up with him and simply saying hello. But there was too much between us for a casual hello. And somehow, I liked the almost cinematic quality of the scene. We had, unknowingly, shared a moment – one that was tender, peaceful.For the first time, I looked at my father differently. I didn’t see the man whose absence I’ve been trying to come to terms with since childhood. Here at Berlin airport, in all its unpredictability, he became just one of many. Someone who, like me, travels on Sundays, prefers a leather bag over a bulky suitcase and dresses casually. Someone you see on an escalator and think: nice guy. And that changed everything between us.The American psychiatrist and therapist Phil Stutz knows this phenomenon. In the documentaryStutz, he describes how his own mother was abandoned by her father without warning – and spent 40 years trapped in a maze of anger and resentment. She refused to forgive him and held on to the pain. But Stutzis radicalin this regard. He says: “We don’t have time for that kind of bullshit. Life is too short. And the restitution we’re hoping for doesn’t come from the person who hurt us – it only comes through ‘active love’.”How does that work? Close your eyes. Imagine being surrounded by a universe of love. Let it fill your heart. Yes, yes – don’t laugh. Stay with it. Once you’re bursting with this imagined energy, think of the person you’re angry with. And then: send them everything. Every ounce of love you carry. Watch it reach them. And finally, in your mind, merge with them – become one. That kind of love, says Stutz, is the only way out of the maze.When I first watched the documentary in 2022, I was fascinated. I tried the exercise. But when it came to my father, it seemed impossible. I was like Stutz’s mother. The child in me stomped and screamed: absolutely not. Sending love? Maybe. But becoming one with him? No way.After our encounter at the airport, something shifted. I was ready to let go and forgive. When I came back to Berlin a few weeks later, I sent him a message. We met at a Vietnamese restaurant. I still remember how nervous I was. I was afraid to fall back into old patterns and kept telling myself: think of the airport. Don’t expect anything. You are just having lunch with someone.It sounded easy – of course it wasn’t. But I knew it was time to try something new. I was done being stuck in the maze. I wanted, quite literally, to reach the end of the escalator and step on to the next plateau.I grew up in Leipzig with my mother, knowing only my father’s name. He was a shadow, not a real person. Shortly after my 14th birthday, I insisted on meeting him. I was a typical teenager searching for her identity. We met in his home town, Berlin. He was a stranger – and at the same time, he looked just like me.In the years that followed, we kept trying to build some kind of relationship. We’d meet but afterwards I’d be swallowed up again by old anger and pain, and I’d cut off contact. I was stuck in the past: Why didn’t you take care of me? Why didn’t you want to see me?The accusations over everything that went wrong were louder than the present. Louder than the fact that I was no longer a child – and, to be fair, there wasn’t any way he could undo his absence. That was our story. But did the future have to stay that way?The South African psychologistPumla Gobodo-Madikizelabelieves forgiveness requires openness. You have to move beyond yourself – and that’s what makes forgiveness so unsettling. Many, she says, are afraid of what the process might stir up and change within them. Afraid of losing their identity – and with it, everything tied to that role. As twisted as it sounds, that role is also a kind of comfort zone.I believe that’s also true for the person who did wrong. We are stubborn creatures. I know that from experience. In the spring, I was the one who had to ask for forgiveness.The reason: my closest friend in Istanbul, Lara, and I had a fierce fight during a night out that ended with me calling her an expletive on the dancefloor – and her storming off, with the words: “How dare you!”Looking back, the cause of the fight – about a mutual friend – was embarrassingly banal. But I think that’s often the case. Most everyday conflicts arise from a lack of understanding and generosity.The worst part? The morning after our fight, I didn’t feel bad at all. No – I felt right. Sure, I’d gone too far in tone. But I was convinced: if anyone owed anyone an apology, it was Lara.Two days later, I wrote to her anyway, asking if we could talk. Classic move: I wanted to be the bigger person. She replied: “I need time.”We didn’t speak for almost four weeks. I flew to Berlin for work, kept thinking about her, noticing how my feelings began to shift. Who was I to judge her?Towards the end of the month, we started reacting to each other’s Instagram stories again. A heart here, a laughing emoji there. On my way back to Istanbul, I messaged her: “Can we meet as soon as I land?” She replied: “Of course.” And: “I miss you like crazy.”The moment she walked in, it burst out of me: I’m so sorry. We sat on my balcony. It turned into a long, honest conversation – one that forced me to confront my own shortcomings. I wanted to apologise, but I also wanted to know how she had felt that night, what it had revealed to her about me, and how she had experienced the weeks that followed.“You crossed a line that night,” she said. “And I knew I couldn’t see you right away. Less out of anger than out of self-protection. I knew that if we met, you’d dominate the conversation, and I wouldn’t get a word in. It wouldn’t have been a conversation on equal footing – and I didn’t want that.”In that moment, Lara saw me more clearly than I could see myself.I think we both always knew this fight wouldn’t be the end of our friendship. But it was a turning point. It forced us to look at each other – and at ourselves. Or in Lara’s words: “That’s how you learn to love.”In hindsight, I’m grateful for this experience. Life is messy. We all make mistakes. But we can also recover – and choose to act.Since that lunch at the Vietnamese restaurant, my father and I have been texting regularly. When I’m in Berlin, we meet. He has even visited me in Istanbul. And yes, I’ve forgiven him. But it’s still a practice. One meeting at a time. Don’t assign too much meaning. Stay light. Let’s see where we can go.Carolin Würfel is a writer, screenwriter and journalist who lives in Berlin and Istanbul.

It memorably ends on the stroke of midnight as heartsick Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) abandons a drunken new year’s party to be with hapless, jobless CC Baxter (Jack Lemmon) instead. Is The Apartment suggesting that Kubelik and Baxter then live happily ever after? Probably not, because I’ve never been convinced that these two lovers are going to stay the course. They’re too mismatched and desperate; their wounds are still too fresh. What the ending gives us is the next best thing: a sudden sense of hope and freedom, with everything packed in boxes except for a bottle, two glasses and a deck of cards. Nothing to lose and nowhere to go. “Shut up and deal.” A clean break, a fresh start.Xan BrooksDead Poets SocietyView image in fullscreenAbsolutely magnetic … Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society.Photograph: Touchstone/Sportsphoto/AllstarI can’t think of a better way to end the year than watching one of Robin Williams’s greatest performances. The late actor was absolutely magnetic as John Keating, the kind-hearted new English teacher at an all-boys boarding school in Vermont, who shakes things up with his unconventional teaching methods. His most important lesson is telling his students to embrace the idea of carpe diem – to “seize the day”.As a warning against the stultifying dangers of mindless conformity, Dead Poets Society is an inspiring, heartwarming and profoundly moving coming-of-age film. One of my favourite scenes is when Keating asks Ethan Hawke’s shy student Todd to sound a “barbaric yawp”, as poet Walt Whitman once put it, in front of the class. His first attempt is as meek as a sleepy kitten but soon, with the help of Keating’s supportive cajoling, he’s howling like a wolf, lines of poetry flowing out of him like a stream after a heavy deluge of rain.As we head into the new year, we could all take a leaf out of Dead Poets Society’s infinitely wise book; to leave behind the fears holding us back and make our voices heard even if we have to rage and roar to express ourselves.Ann LeeStrange DaysView image in fullscreenKick-ass … Angela Bassett in Strange Days.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarA flop on release – at a time audiences were facing an abundance of multiplex options – Kathryn Bigelow’s pre-millennial tech-noir has seen its reputation swell substantially over the decades. James Cameron and Jay Cocks’s screenplay straddles the 20th and 21st centuries: kick-ass chauffeur Angela Bassett strives to shake lovelorn VR addict Ralph Fiennes from his funk so as to unravel a conspiracy involving the LAPD. What follows is a cautionary tale about real-world structural flaws and the bedazzlements of the virtual realm; the source of Fatboy Slim’s “right here, right now” sample; and, most crucially, a propulsive, jolting, finally exhilarating thriller. Increasingly, when the clock strikes midnight on 1 January, it’s Bassett’s wearied “we made it” that sounds like a bell in my head.Mike McCahillThe Irony of FateView image in fullscreenScrewball swerves … Andrey Myagkov and Barbara Brylska in The Irony of Fate.Photograph: Mosfilm StudiosAlready most will struggle to recall the 2022 romcom About Fate. But not the 1976 New Year’s Eve classic on which it was based: The Irony of Fate, which is known by every Russian. The holiday misrule premise, beloved of many NYE flicks, works even more fruitfully in the far more rigid Soviet context: soon-to-be-married Moscow doctor Zhenya (Andrey Myagkov) mistakenly gets on a flight to Leningrad after his stag party. Thanks to identikit Soviet architecture, he drunkenly falls asleep in an apartment with the same address, where willowy Nadya (Barbara Brylska) is welcoming her cranky fiance, Ippolit (Yury Yakovlev, the Soviet John Cleese). The course of true love takes many screwball swerves, with the lead pair fanning the Slavic melancholy by often breaking out a guitar for one of Mikael Tariverdiev’s stunning songs. Epic but intimate, a kind of Kieślowskian import sets in as the night gets long; have these circling soulmates also left it too late in life?Phil HoadThe Lord of the RingsView image in fullscreenGalloping into another year … The Lord of the Rings.Photograph: New Line Cinema/Allstar“The world is changed.” So begins Peter Jackson’s epic three-part adaptation of JRR Tolkien’s epic. I have a tradition where I get together with friends (some more enthusiastic than others, it must be said), and watch the full extended cut of the whole trilogy, every New Year’s Eve. The worldhaschanged, you see: it’s a chance to reflect and look back over the year while enjoying a glorious trio of films whose comforting familiarity never breeds contempt. Instead, like a good marriage, the flaws are part of what you adore. Twelve hours well spent, we think you’ll agree.Catherine BraySunset BoulevardView image in fullscreenClosing up the year … Gloria Swanson and William Holden in Sunset Boulevard.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/AllstarYou want a bona fide, satisfaction-guaranteed classic, but also something that makes you glad you’re not going out – and Sunset Boulevard ticks both boxes handsomely. Especially since it contains what must be the bleakest New Year’s Eve party ever. To recap, William Holden’s husk of a screenwriter rocks up at faded starlet Gloria Swanson’s mansion in white tie, to discover he’s the only other guest. Eventually he storms out in search of genuine revelry, only to be reeled back in before midnight after Swanson melodramatically slashes her wrists. The new year is not going to be happy for either of them. Piercingly grim but also gloriously camp, Billy Wilder’s diamond-cut Hollywood hate letter merits endless rewatching, and you can have fun playing “spot the modern-day resonances”. From silents-to-talkies, substitute cinemas-to-streaming, lament how the pictures really have got small, and pledge to get out more next year.Steve RoseThe ShiningView image in fullscreenHappy holidays … Jack Nicholson in The Shining.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarMovie pairings for the holidays are best kept simple, nothing fussy or fancy. In that spirit of not overthinking it,The Shiningis perfect movie for New Year’s Eve. It’s a horror staple that never wears thin. Most people have seen it at least three times already, so you won’t need to hit pause to get the sausage rolls out of the oven (or if someone starts banging on about Kubrick faking the moon landing). The Shining is also a classic winter movie, ending with a snowstorm at the Overlook hotel where aspiring novelist and alcoholic Jack Torrance has been growing ever more homicidal over the winter. I first watched it aged nine or 10, plucking a VHS at random from the stack next to the telly, monitored with negligent parental guidance, and have watched it at least a dozen times since. I have my own nine-year-old now, but may give her another year before letting her join the party.Cath ClarkeThe Poseidon AdventureView image in fullscreenSwell party … The Poseidon Adventure.Photograph: Cinetext/Allstar Collection/Sportsphoto/AllstarHowever damp a squib your New Year’s Eve, it’s always worth remembering that worse things happen at sea. And rarely do they get worse than the big wet hell in which the passengers of the SS Poseidon flounder in this most glorious and absorbing of disaster movies. No sooner have the corks popped to mark the start of 1972 than the warnings of captain Leslie Nielsen against going full speed ahead (an economising measure by the avaricious shipowners) are realised and the boat is bottom up in the middle of the Atlantic, with thousands meeting grisly and often quite creative ends.A handful of survivors – including Red Buttons, Ernest Borgnine and Shelley Winters – then slowly clamber up to the hull with only the wateriest hope of salvation. The tension is ratcheted slowly, the set pieces expert, the sentimentality diluted by real grit and upset. The star of the show, of course, is preacher Gene Hackman, sweatily brave to the end, when he sacrifices himself in a polo neck. In a year that began withthe horrific news of his death, it’s salutary to see Hackman in his prime: tough and smart and sardonic,raging at God and rousing the rest of us to keep fighting.Catherine ShoardRadio DaysView image in fullscreenTuned to the occasion … Radio Days.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyIf there’s one cry of “happy new year” that echoes down the decades, it’s from Woody Allen’s still-wonderful memoir of his boyhood years in 1940s New York. (Allen actually grew up in Brooklyn, on the other side of Jamaica Bay from Rockaway where this is set, but the windswept boardwalk he presumably visited as a kid was just too picturesque to pass up.) There are so many jewels contained within – “You think the Atlantic is a greater ocean than the Pacific?”, a communist Larry David, the burglars who win a radio phone-in competition, the Carmen Miranda singalong – that are worth it for themselves alone, but at its heart there’s an out-with-the-old in-with-the-new wistfulness to the whole thing. Filtered through one of Allen’s favoured tropes – the hazy, movie-fuelled nostalgia for the supposed sophistication of New York nightlife of the era – the film ends with a superbly maudlin final scene that via the medium of a live broadcast as 1943 turns into 1944, brings together Little Joe and his family with the radio superstars on the nightclub rooftop. It’s such a brilliant sequence, offering joy, hope and misery all rolled into a few minutes – watching it ought to be as compulsory as Jools Holland’s Hootenanny. (Radio Days supernerds might want to know: start the film at 10.07pm – and eight seconds – to line up the movie New Year countdown with the real one.)Andrew PulverHolidayView image in fullscreenBreak from routine … (from left) Doris Nolan, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Lew Ayres in Holiday.Photograph: Granger/Historical Picture Archive/AlamyMany of the best Christmas-themed romantic comedies come from the 1940s, but their spiritual sibling Holiday got an earlier jump on a slightly later holiday; released in 1938, it’s maybe the best New Year’s Eve-set romcom. Much of it unfolds at a party, during which Johnny (Cary Grant), who has resolved to take some time off to recharge and rediscover himself after years of labour, is drawn toward Linda (Katharine Hepburn), the free-spirited sister of his fiancee. Released the same year as Hepburn and Grant’s better-known pairing in Bringing Up Baby, Holiday is the more reflective and romantic of the two, with lovely direction from George Cukor. The lead characters’ willingness to rebuke expectations of capitalistic productivity, and instead make meaningful promises about how to better live their lives, makes it a particularly inspired and heartening new year’s watch.Jesse HassengerLa bonne annéeView image in fullscreenJoyeux … Lino Ventura and Françoise Fabian in La bonne année.Photograph: Rizzoli FilmFor a happy new year with a French accent, try La bonne année (1973) directed by Claude Lelouch, a director whose films are too glossy and romantic to appeal to high-minded critics. In this non-linear narrative he channels his inner Jean-Pierre Melville by casting Lino Ventura, one of Melville’s favourite actors, as a convict out on Christmas parole and remembering a heist that went wrong. The robbery flashbacks alternate with his wooing of Françoise Fabian as the proprietor of an antiques shop next door to the targeted jewellery store, allowing granite-faced Ventura to show his goofy side. Seasonal delights include a drag queen miming to Mireille Mathieu singing Francis Lai’s title song – with Mathieu herself in the audience! If you can’t handle subtitles, Hollywood remade it as Happy New Year (1987), the highlight of which is Peter Falk disguising himself as an old lady.Anne BillsonPhantom ThreadView image in fullscreenAfter the omelette … Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps in Phantom Thread.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyPhantom Thread is pretty much the perfect movie for most occasions – Christmas, breakfast, date night, mid-food poisoning fever spiral – but one of its most effectively date-specific sequences takes place during New Year’s, a relatably tumultuous night for us all. She wants to go dancing, he wants to do nothing and in one of the movie’s most ravishingly orchestrated moments, he goes after her, forced to play prince and save her from the extravagant party chaos. It’s too little too late but in the hopeful, post dodgy omelette flash forward at the end, they’re dancing instead of arguing their way into a new year, a dream replacing a nightmare. Paul Thomas Anderson knows it’s usually a rotten night for most of us but he also knows that we still naively hope that next year might somehow be better.Benjamin LeeWhen Harry Met Sally …View image in fullscreenRob Reiner and Meg Ryan on the set of When Harry Met Sally …Photograph: Columbia Pictures/AllstarAppropriate for any New Year’s Eve, but even more so after this bummer of a month,When Harry Met Sallyis a classic. Made 36 years ago, it still seems remarkably fresh. The uncertainties, the awkwardness, the miscommunications, these things are just as universal as they were in 1989. Nora Ephron’s script still sparkles. Rob Reiner’s direction is still note-perfect. Watching it will make you miss them both, but that’s the point. Press play at 10.30pm, and 2026 will ring in right as Billy Crystal declares his love for Meg Ryan on New Year’s Eve. What a hopeful way to see out a crappy year.Stuart HeritageExplore more on these topicsFilmTelevisionTV streamingBilly WilderRob ReinerWhen Harry Met SallyThe ApartmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Airtight character work, pitch-perfect action and the ideal moment to tell an inherently political story about the hope of truth and resistance against an endless barrage of falsehoods and atrocities.Eoin, LondonThe Rehearsal(Sky/Now) I’ve always been a fan of Nathan Fielder’s work but this show was incredible. The work and detail put into this was amazing. So many layers. So many hoops he had to jump through and then, the most incredible ending I’ve ever seen. I won’t spoil it. It has to be seen to be believed.Keith Miller, 57, SurreyPluribusView image in fullscreenCarries the whole show on her shoulders … Rhea Seehorn in Pluribus.Photograph: Apple TV+(Apple TV) Pluribus is another great show by Vince Gilligan. It completely overturns the theme of alien invasion, leading the viewer to ask philosophical questions about society, the concept of freedom and free will. Rhea Seehorn is phenomenal in carrying the entire series practically on her own shoulders.Fabio, Long EatonBlue LightsView image in fullscreenGenuine sense of dread … Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/Two Cities Television(BBC One/iPlayer) My favourite show of the year is Blue Lights. This series was absolutely fantastic in its storytelling, with a cast of characters you really empathise with, even if they don’t always act in the best way. The tensions of being a police officer in Northern Ireland are portrayed really well, with a genuine sense of tension and dread at times. One of my favourite moments was after a character is stabbed and bleeding out through their femoral artery, a 999 paramedic talks the police officer through the steps to saving the officer’s life, then we get 10 seconds of that unnamed telephone emergency paramedic getting their next call and dealing with yet another life-threatening situation calmly and effectively. The show that makes you wonder why anyone would put themselves through this!Catherine O’Grady, 60, CoventryLeonard and Hungry PaulView image in fullscreenA joy … Jamie-Lee O’Donnell and Alex Lawther in Leonard and Hungry Paul.Photograph: BBC/Subotica(BBC iPlayer) Leonard and Hungry Paul was a joy. I’d read Ronan Hession’s book and loved it dearly, so was fearful of this adaptation. Yet from the form of the storytelling to the characterisations, we saw Leonard and Hungry Paul realise their paths from grief and change, upending their norms. What might love and opportunity do for these friends? These two pass under our radar so how can Leonard hope that someone might love him in return? Will anyone appreciate how much he misses his mother? This series is perfect. The light, hope and dexterity of the storytelling is intact and honoured so carefully and beautifully.Bronnie Mayho, HertfordshireHeated Rivalry(Coming to Sky on 10 January) Heated Rivalry has been the television event of the year, if not the decade. I haven’t ever been so invested and hyper-focused on a show before, and judging by the reactions on social media I am not alone. Watching the evolution of the two main actors – from the first casting announcement in the spring to overnight success – has been phenomenal. Episode four was possibly the best piece of television I have ever seen in my life. I had a visceral reaction to the final scene which left me sobbing, having felt every possible emotion within just a few minutes. Jacob Tierney is a legend and needs to be given an Emmy. Plus, there’s the portrayal of a successful autistic character on the screen, helping people feel seen like never before.Stephanie, UKParadiseView image in fullscreenAwe-inspiringly wonderful … Sterling K Brown in Paradise.Photograph: Brian Roedel/Disney(Disney+) An awe-inspiringly wonderful series that had me gripped from the start. You think you are in for a political thriller based in the White House, but it is so much more. Sadly it is almost impossible to write about without giving away the plot twists that make it so very good. Suffice to say those twists will astound and amaze you. Superb acting, particularly from Sterling K Brown, and sharp scripts make this a total pleasure to watch. Although the whole series is brilliantly done, episode seven – The Day – is possibly the best hour of television I have ever watched. Edge of your seat goes nowhere near describing its tension. I actually had to pause it halfway through to regain my composure and remind myself to breath. A truly outstanding episode in a brilliant series. And we will get season two in February. I can’t wait.Gary Chapman, New ForestThe Death of Bunny MunroView image in fullscreenA welcome relief … The Death of Bunny Munro.Photograph: Sky UK, Clerkenwell Films(Sky/Now) The Death of Bunny Munro kept me gripped with its story about a sex-addicted salesman on the run with his young son. Combining moments of sadness with moments of hilarity, the show was a welcome relief at the end of a somewhat chaotic 2025. Matt Smith did not seem the obvious choice for the character of Bunny but he quickly won me over and proved himself charismatic and fully adept at playing both comedy and tragedy simultaneously. The show was brilliantly directed and the setting of Brighton was well captured. The show left me feeling melancholic but also pleased that in an era of self-censorship and extreme caution, a character like Bunny Munro can still be presented flaws and all.Khalid Peerbaccus, LondonSlow Horses(Apple TV) Great acting and a witty, clever script. Suspenseful and engaging, but still humanistic. I’d like to think that there are actual slow horses out there, fighting the good fight.Lynn Meng, New Jersey, USDept QIt is so lovely to see a book transported from its native land to Scotland, with love and care. The adaptation carries the spirit of the film beautifully. The cast are all superb and such incredible acting. I have watched the entire series twice and am saving it for a third viewing on Christmas Day. The baddies are truly awful and the goodies are deeply flawed.Gail, SurbitonDying for SexView image in fullscreenRemarkable … Jenny Slate as Molly, Sissy Spacek as Gail and Michelle Williams as Molly in Dying for Sex.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/FX(Disney+) What I loved so much about this show (and what left me in tears, contemplating my most intimate relationships romantic and otherwise) is that at face value it is a crude, nihilistic adventure of a woman quickly approaching her death on a quest for sexual satisfaction before she leaves the world. But what really struck me about the show was how her non-romantic relationships changed (and didn’t) with the news of her imminent death. Jenny Slate’s performance as the protagonist’s best friend was remarkable and left me wondering what type of friend I would be – or what type of friend I would need – in the case of my young, untimely journey towards the grim reaper.David, 30, Ithaca, New York, USThe Pitt(HBO Max – coming soon in the UK) The Pitt was my favourite, obviously. So realistic and timely. I have to watch it in small increments because it can be heartbreaking and stressful. The viewers are treated to real life situations that happen every day, sometimes too emotional to digest all at once.Jean Moore, 80, USPeacemaker(HBO Max) Peacemaker season two took the character in a new direction and stopped being just a superhero show and more of a character study. We got to look at the effects of mental health, government over reach, systemic privilege and found family in very smart ways.Renee, Delaware, USExplore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Electric Ballroom is heaving, despite this being their second show here in a month. There’s no shortage of twentysomethings with shag hairstyles to explain why the duo live up to their slogan. “They’re fun, which we need right now – life is bleak,” says Dulcie. “And they’re socially aware,” adds her friend Lotte. “Even though theyare quite silly, they’re grounded.”Across the bar, Dylan, 22, says that he finds Getdown Services and their genre-agnostic beats empowering: “They’re a laptop garage band that are having fun doing what they love, and seeing that makes me want to do what I love as well.” His pal James, 29, has returned for a repeat performance. “I came to the other Getdown Services show and I felt more jubilant than I did at Oasis,” he says.Move over Gallaghers: Ben Sadler and Josh Law come on stage to Status Quo’s Whatever You Want and immediately begin the high-octane crowd interaction. Everyone on the balcony who got guestlist for tonight is pointed to en masse and told to “fuck off”; the pair stomp wide-legged like sumo wrestlers, egging on the roars and occasionally shredding a guitar. It’s part chaotic aerobics video, part Butlin’s gameshow – and though it’s blokey, it’s also a satire of blokey-ness. “This is what my fat body looks like!” yells Sadler, pulling off his T-shirt to delighted cheers. “This is not LadBible!” Law shouts.Back in Bristol where they’re based, Getdown Services are home-town heroes. No sooner have they stepped into a pub, they’re asked for a photo. They’ve had a mammoth 2025: 130 gigs, two sold-out UK tours, festival stage shut-downs, well over half a million monthly listeners on Spotify and, amazingly for a band with song titles like Vomit, Piss and Shit,a red carpet shout-outfrom Hollywood A-lister Walton Goggins. “He’s doing PR for us!” quips Sadler, though it’s clear they’re still getting to grips with the attention. “I guess we are bigger than we thought we were,” says Law.The band’s origin was an “accident”. As childhood friends who met at school in Minehead, Law and Sadler, both now 31, had messed about in various musical projects over the years. But when they started swapping ideas in lockdown while living in different towns, their unselfconscious approach to sound and subject matter clicked: pop culture word association, louche electro-house grooves, and lyrics about snacks and skidmarks. “It feels genuinely liberating to talk about that stuff,” says Law of their more scatological lyrics.First came debut album Crisps in 2023 – its ace title track is a loafing anti-rockstar anthem that begins “I’ve got choccy in my pocket” – then a succession of EPs, including last year’s Primordial Slot Machine and Crumbs 2. “Low hanging fruit” such as the pop troubadour James Bay and Jamie Oliver’s 15 Minute Meals get a ribbing – “being annoying is worse than being evil,” says Law – but these observations are usually a front for social commentary, expressing small-town frustrations and embracing anti-toxic masculinity in all its belly-jiggling messiness: “Wake up, first thought, hope I don’t piss myself today” goes Drifting Away.View image in fullscreenNo joke … Law, left, and Sadler.Photograph: Siôn Marshall-WatersTheir music shares the same stream-of-consciousness DNA as many of the post-punk shouters who’ve come through in recent years – Fat Dog, Yard Act, Big Special – but their songs are more of a supermarket sweep through a 00s indie disco, especially the chonky electro of Daft Punk and Justice. “I really love that compressed sound; they’re distilling an idea down to something really pure,” says Sadler. “I think that’s in our music a lot. We get compared to the Streets and Sleaford Mods, and I do like that stuff, but the stuff we’re really ripping off seems to go under the radar.”A lot of people see two white blokes with their tops off, shouting and swearing, and think we align with [macho behaviour] and it’s nice to remind people we’re not on that sideIf there’s a shared vision, it’s that “there’s a real desire to crack each other up”, says Law. Their influences include the TV shows Bottom, Alan Partridge and Phoenix Nights; indeed, it’s easy to imagine Peter Kay delivering lines like those on Caesar: “I don’t care if you’re working class / You’re a fucking twat / You don’t care about music / You just like trousers”. But Getdown Services stress they’re not a musical double act like Tenacious D; they’re a band that happens to be funny. “As soon as someone says ‘it’s comedy’, the joke’s gone,” says Sadler.And besides, there’s lots to be serious about. In August, they slammed Victorious festival for censoring another band’s pro-Palestine protest (Getdown donated their fee for playing the same festival to charity) and they call out transphobia on social media. “A lot of people see two white blokes with their tops off, shouting and swearing, and probably think we align with that [macho behaviour],” says Sadler, “and it’s nice to remind people that we’re not on that side.”As for 2026, there’s a second album in the works and while big labels have been knocking on their door, they’re happy on the independent Bristol labelBreakfast Records. And what about that tagline? It started as a joke, they say, but now they’re owning it. In the beginning, “we were barely even a band,” says Law, “and now I think maybe weareBritain’s best band.”Explore more on these topicsMusic2026 culture previewIndiePop and rockBristolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My Dad died recently, and I often feel sad. Ill-advised has helped me feel lighter. I have laughed out loud at both the questions and Bill’s dryly-delivered answers.

At first, it seems to be solely about nostalgia, but presenters Graham Kibble-White and Samira Ahmed’s real focus is how we look at the world today through the lens of the past. So they speak about what we loved on TV and talked about around the proverbial water-cooler, but also about why it worked then and why it might still be relevant today. It’s cosy, but its scope is large. The hosts work really well together, and you come away from this delightful listen feeling warmly enlightened.Nick, 60, graphic novelist, UKWisecrackWisecrack had me gripped in a way that I can only compare to the first series of Serial. In many ways it has all the tropes of a run-of-the-mill true crime podcast - a narrator with skin in the game, a sleepy town with sinister secrets, incessant and repetitive adverts. But it completely subverts the genre by constantly questioning how reliable our protagonist (British comedian Edd Hedges) is, and to what extent standup comedy routines can be expected to tell the whole truth.It explores an incident Edd talks about in one of his routines, in which his old school bully commits a terrible crime then knocks on the door of Edd’s family home in the immediate aftermath. When producer Jodi Tovay hears his set in Edinburgh, she contacts Edd, and he eventually agrees to allow her to dig deeper into exactly what happened that night.The production is excellent throughout, with engaging interviews from lots of the key people involved, and there’s plenty of entertaining transatlantic culture-clash banter to boot. I would massively recommend it to anyone who’s getting a bit fed up with the endless celebrities talking to each other format, and looking for something a bit more substantial to accompany long car journeys or dog walks.Hywel Sedgwick, 37, charity worker, West YorkshireMusic Is None of Our BusinessThis is an authentic, unapologetic and entertaining chat between two friends – Dave and Jake, both aged 60 – who share a passion for music.

It is the perfect setting for Neil Rollinson’s debut novel, which is its own kind of spectacular mosaic. Built from short, seemingly discrete chapters that take us between Spain in 2003 and the coalfields of Northumberland in the 70s and 80s, The Dead Don’t Bleed coheres into an extraordinarily tense and tender portrait of two brothers trying to escape their father’s gangland past.Until now, Rollinson has been known as a poet; his collection Talking Dead was shortlisted for the2015 Costa poetry prize. Here he brings his talent for compressed evocation to an exploration of fraternal rivalry and the enduring impact of a violent patriarchy. If you took Frank and his brother Gordon apart on the autopsy table, he writes, “you’d find the same bones, the same blood. Almost everything interchangeable. The corkscrews of DNA, the cells, the posture, the downcast glance.” But from a young age, change is afoot within Frank. He knows his father has “high hopes for him” in the family business of petty crime: “Frank Bridge. King of Northumberland”. But Frank wants to be a different kind of king. He carries within himself a “yearning for something more expansive” – the kind of dream that could get him killed in his family’s closed world of criminal secrecy.Rollinson’s novel is heartbreaking, but he is no sentimentalistLike his author, Frank is drawn to poetry – particularly the work of Federico García Lorca. He is also dangerously drawn to his brother’s girlfriend, Carol, often glimpsed with a mop and bucket in hand at the local pub, cleaning up after the men. Frank “loves to watch her move: tough, big boned, elegant but strong. He’s seen her put men flat on their backs for touching her up. A single punch.” In north-east England, “no one messes with Carol” – and even fewer mess with poetry. The twin risks of Frank involving himself in forbidden lust and forbidden literature power the whole plot, giving the novel the through line of a quest narrative. When Gordon and Carol flee to Spain with the proceeds of a robbery that went disastrously wrong, Frank, in the wake of his father’s death, makes the irrevocable decision to track them down.Rollinson is expert at capturing the long shadow cast by a complicated father. Laurence is a local gangster who, through his own perverse code of ethics and innate charisma, has established himself as “a man of stature. Respected. Everyone stopping to chat.” His “loud laugh echoes across the room. A man among men”. Frank is caught between wanting to please his parent and wanting to escape the family’s gaze entirely. His “father’s scrutiny is like a physical manifestation,” Rollinson writes. Frank “always feels it in his throat, as if he’s being throttled”. The novel captures the way close observation can be an expression of love, but also a kind of violence. In the Northumberland boozers where men “get mortal in the afternoon”, pints “glow in the river light, amber gold and black, like beakers in a chemistry lab”. Many of these men will drink themselves to death. What catches your eye can kill you.One of this novel’s many successes is in capturing the terror of illicit attraction – of admitting to yourself that you secretly want something more. Readers of Karl Geary,Douglas StuartorRoss Raisinwill appreciate the way Rollinson blends social realism with a knack for capturing risky intimacies. The “creeping deprivation” of Northumberland in the Thatcher era – the closure of its core industries, “more and more lads on the dole” – is put in beautiful contrast with Frank’s longing for his brother’s girlfriend. In one lovely, expertly judged scene, Frank and Carol sit “on a wall by a waste ground” as the rain beats down around them. A “demolition squad takes down a terrace behind them. A whole street. Houses he’s known, and been in.” A fireplace “hangs, mid-air, levitating, its grate gaping. Improvements, they say. For whom?”That question – “for whom?” – reverberates on every page. How much of our lives should be spent in service of the family that made us, as opposed to the family we hope to make? Spain seems to offer the relief of fresh contrasts: “the shadow and light, the scent of orange blossom, the endless, undulating fields and the high, unblemished sky”. But every landscape in this novel holds its ghosts. Lorca was murdered in Andalucía, and his exact resting place remains a mystery – one echoed in a final moment of violence that is all the more powerful for being played out largely off stage, in the space between sentences, the gap between chapters. Rollinson’s novel is heartbreaking, but he is no sentimentalist. Life and love spring up from the cracks, he seems to say, but damage continues to be done.Jonathan Lee is the author of the novels High Dive and The Great Mistake.The Dead Don’t Bleedby Neil Rollinson is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99).

But this film about actor and comicChevy Chasefaces an uphill battle given that not only does it report on what an “asshole” – to quote the epithet most often applied to him – he has been in the past, we also witness some assholery first-hand. In the opening minutes, we see him telling the film’s director Marina Zenovich that he’s smarter than her, while he also interrupts her, rolls his eyes at her questions and generally acts the dork.This is partly the infamous “teasing” Chase has always copped to, of a piece with his comically arrogant comic style which the film’s title encapsulates. (It used to be his catchphrase when he anchored the Weekend Update segment on US sketch showSaturday Night Live.) That self-aggrandisement went hand in hand with the denigration of everyone around him, which ended up turning Chase into the most obnoxious kind of coked-up insult-comic by the 1990s.‘He has come back from the dead’: Chevy Chase spent eight days in a coma during Covid pandemicRead moreThis was long after his heyday as a star in the original cast of SNL and then a Hollywood star in his own right in films such as Caddyshack, Fletch and the National Lampoon’s Vacation franchise. The times changed around him and not to his benefit. We see footage here of him calling Richard Pryor the N-word back in a 70s-era SNL sketch. Later, when he was said to have started using racist language on the set of the TV show Community, cast members of colour were not forgiving.And yet, this film gets across Chase’s good side too in a way that’s actually convincing. It helps that we learn about his miserable childhood, full of abuse from his mother, and while he was clearly always a difficult personality, the affection and love for him from his own children and current wife, Jayni, bolsters the assertion that he can’t be all bad. Best of all, Zenovich and her editor, splicing and dicing 50 years of archive material, get across Chase’s abundant talent at its best, particularly his masterly command of the pratfall, and his immaculate comic timing.I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not is on Sky Documentaries and NOW from 2 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsChevy ChaseSaturday Night LiveComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s why we should stop using itRead moreRobbie Love, a sociolinguist based at Aston University, in Birmingham, says that the lexicographers behind the selections are themselves aware that it is not an “entirely objective, scientific process”, otherwise “you [would] find the same words … they all will ensure that they’re different”.Vaclav Brezina, a professor of linguistics at Lancaster University, said: “The considerations for the word of the year is fairly narrow, so it is a word that captures people’s imagination and the lexicographer’s imagination in that particular year.“I don’t think the purpose of the word of the year is really to give scientific analysis of the English language … [it] is more to draw our attention.”Based on data analysis conducted by the Guardian, which measured the frequency of usage for words of the year chosen by Cambridge, Collins and Oxford since 2010, much of that imagination is increasingly being forged online. More than a third of chosen words are either internet slang terms or owe their meanings to technological devices. The figure rises to two-thirds for words of the year from 2021.Lynne Murphy, a professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex, is not surprised. “I think that’s sort of inevitable because that’s the way that words are spreading really easily these days. So, everybody’s much more aware of new words. There’s also just the fact that we’re in a really active time of technological change.”Yet with the fleeting nature of much online content, it is perhaps to be expected that not many previously chosen words have stood the test of time. Oxford’s choice in 2022,“goblin mode”– “a type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent … in a way that rejects social norms or expectations” – may ring a bell but is now rarely used. Cambridge’s 2018 pick, “nomophobia” – the fear of being without your phone – is similarly obscure. NFT or non-fungible token (Collins, 2021) and “youthquake” (Oxford, 2017) have also significantly decreased in use, by 96% and 92% respectively, according to analysis of the News on the Web corpus.Some have fallen out of popularity for good reason. Words such as Brexit, vax and quarantine spoke to a particular time in social history whose urgency may have faded, even as its after-effects remain felt. Others, including austerity and climate emergency, have waxed and waned in tandem with political developments and changing priorities, although it is hard to imagine David Cameron’s “big society” ever making a comeback.On the lack of longevity, Jonathan Dent, a senior editor at the Oxford English Dictionary, said: “Whether a word of the year survives as an active and widely recognised part of the language in the long term is really less important [than] that it has something to say about where we are now, this year.“If a candidate for word of the year maintains the kind of usage that led to its selection, that’s a sign that speakers and writers of English have found it a useful addition to their linguistic toolkit. If it doesn’t, that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a relevant and worthwhile choice in the year it was chosen.”While some linguists such as Murphy can be “a little bit cynical about some of the dictionary words of the years being about attention grabbing” and consider the annual ritual as “a marketing tool”, others view the exercise with less scepticism.Love said: “I would not in any way interpret [word of the year] as being a prediction one way or the other of how that word might be used in the future.“I think it’s just a fun way of getting people to talk about language, and particularly if they’re choosing words fairly consistently that are probably more likely to be used by younger people in online discourse, then that is a great way of engaging younger people with these sorts of conversations about language and words.”In summary: don’t expect a word of the year to outlast it.“It’s marketing”, Green said. “Whether it works, I mean, that’s another side of it … [but] is it really something that the public feel ‘this sums up the year I have just lived’?”Explore more on these topicsLanguageLinguisticsnewsShareReuse this content"

They also still rock, in time-honoured angst-ridden style.UK tour begins 12Februaryat the BP Pulse Live, BirminghamJill Scott – To Whom This May ConcernIt’s been a very long time since neo-soul star Scott released an album: the last was the impressively eclectic Woman, in 2015. Scott has spent the intervening years touring – including a 20th-anniversary celebration of her multi-platinum debut Who is Jill Scott?: Words And Sounds Vol 1 – and concentrating on her acting career, cropping up everywhere from US superhero franchise Black Lightning to comedy series The First Wives’ Club, making her belated return to the studio a very welcome event.Released 13FebruaryCharli xcx – Wuthering HeightsCharli xcx has described her soundtrack to Emerald Fennell’s forthcoming film adaptation of Wuthering Heights as “raw, wild, sexual, gothic and British”. Certainly, the first track released from it, the John Cale collaborationHouse, couldn’t have been more different from the sound of her epochal2024 album Brat– a homage to Cale’s old band the Velvet Underground that also bore the influence of industrial music – and that, one suspects, might be part of the point.Released 13FebruaryRayeUnder the winningly blunt title This Tour May Contain New Music – the posters also promise “at least one jazz cover”, “a brass section”, “live strings” and indeed “potential waffling” – Raye debuts material from her long-awaited second album. The singles she has released over the last couple of years have ranged from the avant and episodic Genesis to collaborations with Central Cee to the straight-up pop smash Where Is My Husband?, so who knows what that might sound like?UK tour begins 17Februaryat Manchester Co-op LiveBill Callahan – My Days of 58The title of US indie mainstay Callahan’s eighth solo album seems to reference his age when he recorded it – there’s certainly a note of concern about getting older in the lyrics of the solitary track released from it thus far, The Man I’m Supposed to Be – with the same band that appeared on his superb 2022 album, Reality. Callahan has called it “a living room record … not too loud, not otherworldly”, which sounds both mysterious and intriguing.Released27FebruaryLily AllenView image in fullscreenLily Allen … eye-popping detail.Photograph: Nicky J Sims/Getty Images for Live NationAs comebacks go, Lily Allen’s return – withWest End Girl, an album that detailed the breakdown of her marriage to actor David Harbour in such forensic, eye-popping detail it seemed to shift the bar for confessional songwriting – was pretty spectacular, although it’s worth noting that there was more to the album than gossipy revelation: if the songs hadn’t been good, it wouldn’t have had little more than news value. She’ll perform the album in full in these shows.UK tour begins2 MarchatGlasgow Royal Concert HallDaveIt says something about Dave’s skill as a rapper and the sheer size and devotion of his following that his third album, The Boy Who Played the Harp – sombre, musically understated, light on obvious bangers, lyrically self-examining – wasn’t just a huge critical success, but a massive hit: all 10 of its tracks would have made the Top 20 were it not for chart rules. It will be intriguing to see how it translates on stage, particularly in venues this big.UK tour begins 4 MarchatOVO Hydro, GlasgowThundercatIt’s five years since Thundercat last released an album – It Is What It Is was a stew of psychedelia, funk, soul and jazz shot through with mourning for the loss of his friend, rapper Mac Miller – although a string of intriguing singles have emerged over the last couple of years, including collaborations with Tame Impala and Remi Wolf, and an impressively slinky cover of Diana Ross’s Upside Down. Whatever he is currently up to, he remains a dependably fabulous live performer.UK tour begins 25 Marchat O2 Academy Brixton, LondonMy Bloody ValentineRobert Smith’s curation of this year’s Teenage Cancer Trust shows has led to a strong lineup – including Mogwai, Garbage, Manic Street Preachers, Wolf Alice and Nilüfer Yanya – but the pick might be this show, which brings My Bloody Valentine’s beautiful/deafening approach to live performance to the Royal Albert Hall – a noticeably smaller venue than they have been playing of late – with a special “stripped down” set by Chvrches as support.27 Marchat Royal Albert Hall, LondonNicki Minaj – Pink Friday 3View image in fullscreenNicki Minaj … pivot away from pop.Photograph: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Live NationPink Friday 3 started life as an expanded edition of Minaj’s chart-topping and critically acclaimed 2023 albumPink Friday 2, before the rapper reconsidered, announcing the songs “too good … too iconic” to be consigned to the status of extra tracks on a deluxe set. So a new album it is: you have to hope it continues its predecessor’s pivot away from pop towards fierce, dark hip-hop, something Minaj is exceptionally good at.Released 27MarchYungbludA jaunt around the UK’s arenas that had something of the victory lap about it, given that Dominic Harrison had a very good 2025: two No 1 albums – one the Britpop-influenced Idols, the other a collaboration with Aerosmith – three Grammy nominations, another edition of his own one-day festival Bludfest, and a show-stealing turn at what turned out to be Ozzy Osbourne’s final show, July’s Back to the Beginning gig, which seemed to win him an entirely new audience, considerably older than his usual gen Z fans.UK tour begins11 AprilatSheffield Utilita ArenaOlivia DeanWere it not for the complexities of chart rules, Olivia Dean’s Man I Need would have been No 1 for months (it was certainly the UK’s most-streamed track for weeks on end): evidence of how her second album, The Art of Loving, catapulted her into pop’s Premier League, the sole UK artist to make that leap in recent years. Live, she is an appealingly understated and relatable performer, albeit one blessed with an amazing voice and a succession of great pop-soul tracks.UK tour begins 22Aprilat OVO Hydro, GlasgowRosalíaIn a world in which pop music is supposed to cleave to the middle ground and present cautious listeners with more of the same, there’s something hugely buoying about the success of Rosalia’s album Lux: a global Top 10 hit that sounds nothing like the Spanish star’s previous work, but has managed to provoke a debate about whether or not its contents constitute classical music. Helmed by a striking live performer, its transition to the stage should be a treat.On5and 6 May,London O2 ArenaMetallicaView image in fullscreenIntriguing … James Hetfield, left, and Kirk Hammett of Metallica.Photograph: Jeff Hahne/Getty ImagesMetallica spent 2025 touring North America with their M72 show, an intriguing approach to playing live for the umpteenth time in their career. They play stadiums in the round: those prepared to stump up the requisite dosh can get “snake pit” tickets that allow you to stand in the centre of the vast circular stage. In London, they are playing two shows, and promise completely different sets at each, as well as different support acts.UK tour begins on 25 Juneat Glasgow Hampden ParkAriana GrandeYou couldn’t describe Ariana Grande’s arrival in the UK as a tour, exactly: she’s only playing London, although she is doing a fairly eye-popping run of 10 nights at the O2 Arena, testament to the continued appeal of her music despite a shift in emphasis towards acting in recent years. The dates come two years after the release of her R&B and trap-infused post-divorce opus Eternal Sunshine, the album she is ostensibly promoting, which was among the most-streamed albums globally in 2024.15August until1 September, London O2 ArenaClassical music and operaThe Makropulos AffairSimon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra’s semi-staged Janáček has become one of January’s most eagerly anticipated treats.

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 31 Dec 2025 07.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 31 Dec 2025 07.31 ESTShareWith the best games of the year duly noted (yoursandours), I’d like to highlight some of the work we’ve done covering them. Reviewing the top-performing articles that we published in 2025, I see a portrait of a conflicted year: plenty of great works and games that captured the imagination and the world’s attention, but also growing anxiety about their place in the real world, and the political circumstances they reflect. And a lot of (justified) hand-wringing over Roblox.But first: I wanted to extend heartfelt thanks to everyone who reads this newsletter and the rest of our work at the Guardian. If you’ve enjoyed our coverage, do consider supporting us to do more of it – either through arecurring or one-off contribution. Without your support, none of the great journalism we produce would be possible. Thank you for being with us in 2025, and I hope you stick around to watch me slowly lose my mind working overtime in the buildup to Grand Theft Auto 6’s release in November 2026. (Finally).In no particular order, here are the most read feature articles of the year.My chilling week on Roblox:sexually assaultedand shat on as a child avatar roaming the online worldThe Guardiancovered Roblox a lot in 2025, mostly from the perspective of child safety. As Sarah Martin discovered inthis article, it is extremely easy to get into inappropriate situations and chats in this free-for-all of a game platform, which has more than 150m daily users (most of them children). I am no fan of Roblox and don’t let my own kids play it, but if your little ones get joy out of it and you don’t want to prohibit the game entirely I recommend making sure it’s supervised where possible and those parental controls are locked down.I cannot stop playing this preposterous game about falling down a mountainFor some reason this tale ofmy self-flagellating travails with Baby Stepsseemed to speak to a lot of people. I felt somewhat vindicated for spending more than 12 hours of my life marching a useless person up a hill.Master System at 40: the truth about Sega’s most underrated consoleView image in fullscreenNo one’s favourite … Sega Master System.Photograph: Keith Stuart/The GuardianOur games correspondent Keith Stuart, goes down one of hisfavourite rabbit holeshere, emerging with a wonderfully researched tribute to one of Sega’s lesser-appreciated consoles. Revisionist history often crowns the NES as the winner of the 80s console wars, but that was only true in Japan and the US – in Europe, home computers and the Sega Master System reigned.Elon Musk stands accused of pretending to be good at video games. The irony is deliciousI must admit that this was extremely satisfying to write. After boasting about his gaming prowess on X, Elon Musk was revealed to have beencheatingin some baffling attempt to appropriate gamer credibility. As the year wore on, this proved to be just one of many embarrassing self-owns from the richest man in the world.Why Trump’s White House is using video game memes to recruit for ICEGames have a lot of economic and cultural power. They were the original site of the modern online culture wars, during Gamergate, and now the Trump administration isn’t shy to use gamer imagery to mobilise its base.This reportfrom Alyssa Mercante is a story about how Pokémon and Halo imagery is being used to recruit for ICE, but also a story about where games sit now in the wider political context of our times.Meet the new James Bond: how 007 First Light earned its licence to thrillView image in fullscreenTears of joy … 007 First Light.Photograph: IO InteractiveWho needs Grand Theft Auto: the upcoming game that Guardian readers are most psyched for in 2026 is 007 First Light.

We remember the places we tread in games as if they were real, and some of these virtual mansions feel like childhood homes.

Adrienne Matei speaks to some of Twitch’s older video game streamers (much love to TacticalGramma) to find outwhy half of people over 60 play video games, and the potential benefits of doing so.Why do some gamers invert their controls? Scientists now have answers – but they’re not what you thinkThis story has been ongoing in the Guardian games pages for years, ever since Keith wrote what he thought would be a very niche article querying why some people play games upside down. Finally, after that article inspired an actual scientific study,we have the answer.Billion-dollarvideo game: is this the most expensive piece of entertainment ever made?I have been interested in the spaceship game Star Citizen for a long time, mostly because I have wondered where the hundreds of millions of pounds it has raised in funding were actually going. (It’s been “in development” since 2012 and its creators don’t pretend it is anywhere close to finished.) Oliver Holmes talks to players to find outwhy they have invested thousandsin this science-fiction dream. Since this article was published, Star Citizen’s revenue has risen to $924,266,846, and it now has six million players.What to playView image in fullscreenStaying in … Sony’s SingStar on PlayStation 3.Photograph: SonyThis week, I will be playingGuitar HeroandRock Band, as I have small children and can’t go out for Hogmanay.

But you no longer need to be a multimillionaire to own a Picasso – for €100, anyone in the world has the chance to walk away with a painting by one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.The French charity Alzheimer’s Research Foundation announced recently it was raffling Picasso’s 1941 portrait, Tête de femme, which is worth more than €1m, to a single winner. Proceeds from the tickets will help fund Alzheimer’s research, one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.The project, entitled “1 Picasso for 100 Euros”, is the first of its kind in the world, and a natural continuation of Picasso’s legacy, according to his grandson Olivier Picasso.“My grandfather was very generous, but he was also discreet,” Olivier told the Guardian. “He helped his family, especially my grandmother Marie-Thérèse [Walter]. He helped friends. He helped people in need during the civil war in Spain, during the second world war, and even after, in the 50s and 60s.View image in fullscreenOlivier Picasso, grandson of the artist, poses next to Tête de femme.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/Reuters“So for me, this project is an absolutely logical and legitimate part of his legacy. I hope in the future to be able to do this every year if possible.”The raffle is the brainchild of Péri Cochin, a French television producer and owner of the tableware company Waww La Table. Cochin came up with the idea after seeing her mother use them at fundraising events she hosted.“I thought, wouldn’t it be great to do a worldwide raffle, by selling tickets online? I decided it should be a piece of art, and what is the most famous name in art? Obviously, it’s Picasso,” she said.Cochin contacted Olivier Picasso, a childhood friend of hers. When he and the rest of the Picasso administration and the Picasso estate gave their approval, she reserved the 1941 painting from the Opera gallery, which will receive just under €1m after the draw.“We are used to hearing about Picasso and these high-priced auctions, but this was the first time where Picasso was really related to a charity,” she said.Olivier said the family “had an instant connection with the project”, not least because the money raised is going to a good cause. There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, and no treatment that can stop or reverse its progression. “Now that we are living older than before, we or people around us could be affected by this disease. And I know how difficult and painful it is,” he added.The goal is to sell 120,00 tickets, raising €11m for Alzheimer’s research. The draw is scheduled to take place at Christie’s auction house in Paris on 14 April. If not enough tickets are sold to cover the cost of the painting, all participants will be reimbursed.Olivier said Tête de femme was a “very interesting” work that was painted in the same studio in the Left Bank in Paris as Picasso’s 1937 masterpiece Guernica. “The period was important for my grandfather, because he was at the end of a process to divorce his first wife, Olga Khokhlova – a divorce that never happened because Franco abolished the divorce law [in 1939], despite meeting my grandmother and Dora Maar.“The period was also very complicated because of the occupation of Paris by the Nazis. And so the colours are darker than usual, with brown, black, and grey. While it’s a beautiful depiction of a woman, there is still the ambience of Picasso. My grandfather kept the painting as a souvenir of the moment.”Cochin has organised two previous raffles for Picasso paintings, in 2013 and 2020, raising a total of more than €10m. The first winner was 25-year-old Jeffrey Gonano, who became the owner of a Picasso drawing valued at €860,000. “He put the painting in the Museum of Pittsburg for a while, and now it’s in storage at Christie’s in New York, because he didn’t want to keep it at home,” she said.The second winner was Claudia Borgogno, an accountant from Ventimiglia, Italy, whose son had given her a raffle ticket for Christmas. She became the owner of a 1921 Picasso valued at €1m.“She still has the painting, she said it would change her life. It’s a really beautiful story,” Cochin added.This article’s headline was amended on 31 December 2025. An earlier version said that an auction was taking place instead of a raffle.Explore more on these topicsPablo PicassoFranceCharitiesEuropeAlzheimer'sHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

I also knew that by casting me … he was giving me the keys to the castle.”The actor posted some behind-the-scenes footage from the film, adding that he could not remember “a single day without laughter”.“The movie is about love, loyalty and sacrifice. Things that Rob held dear. Which is among the many reasons he was the perfect person to direct it.“And if I could make him laugh in return, I felt like I had won the lottery. His laugh was one of the greatest sounds I’ve ever known – so heartfelt it still rings in my ears.“This was a man who felt deeply,” wrote Elwes. “Whose heart was filled with love and compassion. He wasn’t impressed by how much money you had or if you had a privileged upbringing. He just wanted to know if you were a ‘good guy.’”View image in fullscreen‘Rob was the perfect person to direct it’ … Cary Elwes in The Princess Bride.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/RexThe Reiners’ son, Nick, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder after his parents bodies were discovered on 14 December in their Los Angeles home. He is being held without bail in a correctional facility in the city.Elwes also paid tribute to Reiner’s wife, saying: “To say that they were a great team would be an understatement … my heart still aches every time I think of you, I know the grief of losing you too soon will likely never go away.”He concluded with a quote from The Princess Bride: “Sure, death cannot stop true love but life is pain without you.”In an essay in the New York Times, Martin Scorsese also paid tribute to Reiner, who he first met in the 1970s, saying:“Right away, I loved hanging out with Rob. We had a natural affinity for each other. He was hilarious and sometimes bitingly funny, but he was never the kind of guy who would take over the room. He had a beautiful sense of uninhibited freedom, fully enjoying the life of the moment, and he had a great barrelling laugh.”Reiner had a supporting role in Scorsese’s 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street, in which he played the father of Leonardo DiCaprio’s character, Jordan Belfort.“He could improvise with the best”, wrote Scorsese, “he was a master at comedy, he worked beautifully with Leo and the rest of the guys, and he understood the human predicament of his character: The man loved his son, he was happy with his success, but he knew that he was destined for a fall.”This week, a Los Angeles superior court judge agreed to bar the release of the Reiners’ autopsy reports, at the request of the LAPD.A court order received by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner last week put a security hold on the cases to restrict the public release of “any investigative information, notes, reports or photos” related to the investigation.View image in fullscreen‘He was a master at comedy’ … Rob Reiner in The Wolf of Wall Street.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/AllstarThe medical examiner’s officehad previously confirmedtheir deaths were the result of homicide, with their public database listing the cause as “multiple sharp force injuries”.After the Reiners’ killing, President Donald Trump posted that Rob Reiner’s death was “due to the anger he caused others” from being outspokenly anti-Trump.Trump called Reiner “tortured and struggling” and attributed his death to “his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.”The president’s commentswere widely condemned, with Joe Rogan adding his voice to the critics last week.Speaking to comedian Shane Gillis, the hugely popular podcaster said of Trump: “If you say that privately that’s one thing, which is also crazy, but it’s so disappointing.”Rogan, who supported Trump in 2024 but has recently expressed disquiet over some of his policies, equated the president’s apparent lack of empathy with “people that were celebrating when Charlie Kirk got shot”.“Imagine if Obama tweeted something about someone after they died in this way. That this person was a deranged person that hated Obama”, Rogan continued. “It just shows you how crazy it is, the way Trump thinks and talks.”Rogan concluded by suggesting an adviser should have taken Trump’s “fucking phone” away when he decided to weigh in on Reiner’s death.Explore more on these topicsFilmRob ReinernewsShareReuse this content"

He told the Guardian he had “never seen anything comparable on a UK-established domestic broadcaster”.Ofcom officials have spent the last few weeks examining at least three detailed complaints co-signed by tens of thousands of people, but have not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation. The regulator is facing increasing accusations that it is reluctant to intervene over politically difficult issues of impartiality.The complaints point to rules stating broadcasters must not “materially mislead the audience” and rules around due impartiality.Acomplaint from Bob Ward, from the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, focused on Trump’s claims about human-induced climate change. Trump stated: “The whole thing is a hoax … but your country is one of the worst.”Trump also made disputed claims about the red tape and taxes related to drilling in the North Sea, as well as stating that wind power was “the most expensive energy you can get”. This is contradicted byrecent research.GB News urged to cut ties with contributor accused of racismRead moreWard said: “The GB News interview with President Trump was the most blatant example of a British media organisation collaborating with the Trump administration to undermine British democracy with this misinformation.”Complaints have also been made about Trump’s claim that London has areas “where the police don’t even want to go” and that “you have sharia law where they don’t even want to obey the laws of … your country”.There was no challenge from the comments from Turner. When Trump said people are “being stabbed in the ass or worse”, she stated: “It’s true … It’s awful, it is. And it feels much safer [in the US].”A complaint over a lack of impartiality from the 38 Degrees campaign group pointed to Turner “praising and endorsing Trump multiple times”. During the interview, she described a speech by Trump as “one of the greatest moments at the UN” and that she “loved it, it was brilliant”.GB News declined to comment on the complaints.GB News is emerging as aregular platform for Trump administration figuresto raise chosen talking points. Trump’s White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, hasrepeatedly promoted the broadcaster.Banatvala, who was Ofcom’s founding director of standards, said the regulator was under “intense pressure to act”.He said: “This case poses a real challenge for the regulator – not least because of the considerable leeway it has already given GB News and because it involves an interview with a sitting US president.“While this style of interview – with no challenge and a presenter effectively feeding lines – may be the norm for Newsmax and Fox News, I’ve never seen anything comparable on a UK-established domestic broadcaster. There is no doubt this programme warrants investigation for potential breaches of the due impartiality and misleading rules.“If Ofcom chooses not to investigate, it would effectively signal that the regulator has abandoned impartiality and broadcasters no longer need to comply with these rules.”An Ofcom spokesperson said: “We are assessing the complaints against our rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.”Explore more on these topicsGB NewsOfcomRegulatorsDonald TrumpTelevision industryUS televisionTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Overall, physical album sales were up by 1.4% to 17.6m.While Swifties piled into vinyl, sellout tours byOasisand Coldplay helped catapult both acts back into the overall album charts, which are weighted towards digital streaming.The 2010 Oasis compilation Time Flies … 1994-2009 returned to No 1 after the tour’s launch, hit the top spot again in August and finished the year in fourth, with the 1995 album (What’s The Story) Morning Glory in seventh.Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet was the second-biggest-selling album of the year behind The Life of a Showgirl, followed by Ed Sheeran’s +-=÷x (Tour Collection).Fleetwood Mac’s 50 Years – Don’t Stop, released in 2018, came in fifth. Their fan-favourite album Rumours, released half a century earlier in 1977 and one of the bestselling albums of all time, was seventh in the vinyl charts.The BPI also hailed breakthroughs by newer acts such as Olivia Dean, Lola Young, Sleep Token, PinkPantheress and Skye Newman,as well as the 2025 Mercury prize winner, Sam Fender.Jo Twist, the chief executive of the BPI, called on the government to ensure that the industry was protected by upholding copyright law, amid mountingconcern about the effect of AI on artists.Twist said the figures “should be a powerful reminder that British music is a global headline act, and one of the crown jewels of the UK’s creative industries. Ensuring its success should be high on the government’s agenda in 2026.“We need the commitment of policymakers, the continued protection of the UK’s gold-standard copyright framework, and a business environment which supports direct licensing between music and tech companies in order for labels to continue to discover, nurture and promote the global stars of tomorrow.”Explore more on these topicsMusic industryVinylTaylor SwiftOasisFleetwood MacCassette tapeUK chartsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sean Astin’s Mikey is the prime mover, dragging along the likes of Corey Feldman, Josh Brolin, Ke Huy Quan and Martha Plimpton on a quest that takes in bat-filled tunnels, booby traps and many skeletons.

Set in 1969, it follows two self-pitying, jobless actors (Paul McGann and Richard E Grant) on a break from their rat-infested London house to the Lake District. Sadly, this presumed idyll is mainly rain and mud, randy bulls and randy Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths). Grant’s Withnail is a tragicomic character for the ages, a Falstaffian fool witnessing the sad death of the swinging 60s.SWExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.American cinema-verite demigod Frederick Wiseman’s latest is a 6,000-course tasting menu of a documentary, like one of those supercuts with all the delicious food on offer in Studio Ghibli films. Most of the 95-year-old’s career has been dedicated to chronicling US institutions, but here he returns to the strain of Francophile work he has dipped into since the mid-90s (he lives in the country part-time). In this case, he infiltrates theMichelin triple-starred Le Bois sans Feuilles restaurantin Ouches in the Loire, and serves up four hours of hardcore gastronomy.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In long, eavesdroppy tableaux, Wiseman inventories every aspect of the business: recipe-brainstorming, market-stall recon, table-setting, meal preparation, supplier farms, clientele mouthgasms. This prandial haven is part of the Maison Troisgros business that has been run by the same family in nearby Roanne for four generations; Michel Troisgros is the current patriarch, but his son César is now head chef. Wiseman, eschewing narration as is his wont, lets us figure all this out while he follows his nose through the kitchens and dining spaces.There is no drama here; no Gordon Ramsay tantrums, noAnton Ego-type food criticskeeping everyone on their toes. Just monastic absorption in pure process in a workspace that the Troisgros keep studiously calm, all the better to create. The attention to detail is astonishing: servings begin with briefings on the personal circumstances and dietary particularities of the diners at each table. One discussion homes in on the implications of lighting and air movements for the texture of their creme brulee.At one point, Michel Troisgros insists that cuisine is not cinema, but real life. But Wiseman continually spotlights the importance of close observation in ingredients, taste, preparation and presentation that enables the elevation of the material world into art; from creme brulee forensics, to the staff finicking with the tableware until the setting is just-so. Adhering to the same principle, the director sets up shop with brisk fastidiousness, alternating the conversations with flushes of static countryside shots, or kitchen closeups.Ending the four-hour sitting with Michel ambivalent about ceding to the next generation, Wiseman seems to sympathise with a reluctance to let go. There is always another new flavour for the chef to try, another beautiful framing for the director to make – though possibly the film’s remit is over-extended once Wiseman starts drifting into the Troisgros’ adjacent hotel business. But the main frustration is that the only bite we get of the many marvels concocted here is with the eye.Menus-Plaisirs: Les Troisgros is in UK and Irish cinemas from 2 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsRestaurantsFranceMichelin GuideFrederick WisemanFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

The days feel as if they never quite get going here at this time of year, and it’s important, as the long nights of winter drag on, to have a hobby. Here in Lerwick, the capital of the archipelago, the locals have divined a unique way of passing the time, while honouring the deep-rooted Scandinavian influences on Shetland’s culture and history.A rattling and murmuring begins to grow, and round a corner emerges a marching horde of lusty Vikings in homemade costumes, brandishing axes and round shields, beards flowing over leather breastplates. They carry turquoise standards bearing the flag of Haraldr Óláfsson, the 13th-century king of Mann and the Isles, and sing battle songs of raven flags flying in distant lands, of blazing torches and Vikings ruling over oceans vast.View image in fullscreen‘A marching horde of lusty Vikings’ in Lerwick.Photograph: Daniel StablesAs the mob approaches, a shed door creaks open behind me, and a dragon-prowed, glacial blue longship emerges, pulled on ropes by a team dozens strong. This beautiful galley will be paraded through the streets of Lerwick today before being ritualistically set ablaze – the centrepiece ofUp Helly Aa, Shetland’s riotous fire festival. As an act of ritual destruction it evokes the sand mandala, the Tibetan Buddhist practice of creating ornate cosmological artworks only to sweep them away as a metaphor for non-attachment and impermanence. “It’s a symbol of renewal,” says Lyall Gair, who has led the Up Helly Aa procession in years past and retains an impressive, Viking-worthy beard. A man standing next to us in the crowd has an alternative explanation. “There’s fuck all else to do around here all winter,” he says, shivering against the morning breeze.Hogmanay is dying in Shetland – nobody makes an effort for that any more. Up Helly Aa is the biggest thing of the yearAfter Christmas, the hootenannies, paper hats and midnight countdowns of 31 December can feel a little lame. Thankfully, Shetland offers a second bite of the cherry when it comes to seeing in the new year, with Up Helly Aa’s series of fire festivals setting the archipelago alight between January and March – timed to mark the end of the pre-Christian winter festival of Yule (others includeScalloway fire festival, also on Shetland, andUyeasoundon Unst). There are11 festivalsspread across the islands, but by far the largest and best-known is held in late January here in Lerwick, which sits on Mainland, the largest Shetland island (on 27 January in 2026).View image in fullscreenPreparing the longship.Photograph: Daniel StablesThe procession, with the galley in its wake, disappears round another corner. There will now be a lull in proceedings for the watching public, though not for the Vikings in the main procession, known as the Jarl Squad, who spend the day attending to various civic duties – a boozy brunch with local luminaries, some visits to schools and hospitals, then a lush, louche luncheon, before more processions through the streets, chanting and rattling of swords and shields, and general merriment.I take advantage of the break in the schedule to swot up on the history of the event, meeting Jolene Garriock, a tour guide withIsland Vista, atFjarå, a cafe overlooking the ocean. “The Lerwick Up Helly Aa’s been going for over 100 years, and I’ve been going for 30,” says Jolene, who grew up on the west coast of Mainland, and now lives in the Tingwall valley, a short drive from Lerwick.View image in fullscreenThe torch procession.Photograph: Roger Cracknell/Classic/AlamyUp Helly Aa seems to have begun in the 19th century, after Shetland’s young men returned from the Napoleonic wars with frazzled minds, a low boredom threshold and a facility for pyrotechnics. They channelled their energy into tar barrelling, the practice of stuffing wooden barrels with straw and tar, setting them alight and parading them through the town. Rival “squads” of tar barrellers would often brawl in the streets, leading a wide-eyed missionary, visiting in 1824, to describe Lerwick as “in an uproar: from 12 o’clock last night until late this night blowing of horns, beating of drums, tinkling of old tin kettles, firing of guns, shouting, bawling, fiddling, fifeing, drinking, fighting”.Hundreds of men in fancy dress – nuns, Wombles, French maids – are the modern incarnation of the original tar-barrelling squadsThe chaos, Jolene says, proved too much for the authorities, who by the late 19th century had done away with the tar barrelling and replaced it with the building and burning of the galley, reshaping Up Helly Aa into a celebration of Shetland’s Nordic heritage, as well as a festival celebrating the new year and return of the light. “Hogmanay is dying in Shetland – nobody makes an effort for that any more,” she says. “Up Helly Aa is the biggest thing of the year.”By the time I bid Jolene goodbye, it has long since gone dark; Lerwick’s streetlights have been extinguished in advance of the burning of the galley, and the streets are thronging with thousands of people. The Jarl Squad are out again, redder-eyed and sloppier than this morning after the day’s libations, but still in strong voice, and now carrying blazing torches. They’re followed by hundreds of men in fancy dress: nuns, Wombles, French maids. These are the modern incarnation of the original tar-barrelling squads, who have nowadays swapped brawling in the streets for touring venues across Lerwick on Up Helly Aa night, staging comedy skits.The ‘wow’ factor: island hopping and otter spotting on a family break in ShetlandRead moreThe procession files into a play park in the centre of town, where the galley lies waiting, doused in paraffin. The Jarl Squad and their entourage throw their lit torches into the belly of the boat, and before long it is engulfed in flames, warming the watching crowd. As the fire dies down and the spectators file away into the warmth of the town’s afterparty venues, for a night of comedy skits and folk dancing, soup and sandwiches, and much taking of drink, I observe the smouldering wreckage. It’s almost painful to think of the energy and care that went into the galley’s creation, only for it to go up in flames – until I remember Lyall’s words to me that morning, on Up Helly Aa’s power as a vehicle for renewal. “We just build another one next year,” he had said. “We start anew.”Up Helly Aa 2026 will take place on 27 January in Lerwick, Shetland.

The thought of another roast dinner makes me yawn, so something with spice feels exciting. Biryani, with its layered complexity of flavour and texture, has always been the ultimate celebratory centrepiece for guests to congregate around, and it needs little accompaniment bar a bowl of cooling raita. This meat-free version made with tender paneer koftas is light and fresh, yet still warming and packed with flavour. End on a sweet note with an incredible, Indian inflected tiramisu, which is fragrant with saffron and rich with nuts. Happy 2026!Malai kofta biryani with apple (pictured top)For an even more opulent biryani, tuck a couple of raisins and chopped cashews into the centre of each kofta. The addition of apple to raita is unusual, but I love the fresh, sweet, sharpness that granny smiths bring to it.Prep25 minCook1 hr 15 minServes4For the koftas300gpaneer, grated2 medium potatoes, boiled until tender, then gratedSea salt and pepper1 handful fresh coriander, finely chopped1 green chilli, finely chopped½tsp ground cardamom¼tsp turmeric2tsp cornflour1tbsp plain flour3tbsp gheeFor the curry2tbsp ghee1 cinnamon stick, broken up2 green cardamom pods2 cloves1tbsp cumin seeds1 medium red onion, peeled and very finely chopped2cm piece ginger, peeled and finely grated2 fat garlic cloves,peeled and finely chopped1 green chilli, finely chopped1tbsp tomato puree2 medium tomatoes, skinned and pureed1tsp kashmiri red chilli powder, or mild chilli powder15 cashews, soaked in hot water for 30 minutes, then blended to a paste125g yoghurt, beaten with 50ml waterFor the rice500g basmati rice1 cinnamon stick½tspblack peppercorns4 cardamom pods, bruised1tsp cumin seeds1tsp saltTo garnish1 generous pinchsaffron, soaked in 50ml warm milk2tbsp melted gheeA few mint leaves1 handful toasted cashew nutsCrispy onions, or shallots (optional)Mix all the kofta ingredients bar the ghee, then roll into ping-pong-ball-sized koftas (you should get about 24 in all ), making sure the surface is smooth and there are no cracks. Melt the ghee in a large, heavy-based pan, then fry the koftas in batches until golden brown all over. Drain on kitchen paper.In the same pan, melt the ghee for the curry and fry the whole spices until they sizzle and turn fragrant. Add the onion, saute on a low heat for 15 minutes, until dark and caramelised, then add the ginger, garlic and chilli, and fry for a minute until aromatic.Add the tomato puree, fry for two minutes until it starts to release its oil, then tip in the pureed tomatoes and kashmiri red chilli powder and leave to bubble for five to eight minutes, until thickened. Off the heat, stir in the cashews and yoghurt, then return to a low heat, add the koftas and cook slowly for five minutes, making sure not to boil the curry otherwise it will split. Season to taste, then transfer half the curry to a bowl.Put the rice, spices, salt and two litres of water in a second saucepan, bring to a boil and cook for five to six minutes, until the rice is 80% cooked – it should still have some bite when you break it between your fingers – then drain.Spoon half the rice over the curry in the pan, drizzle half the saffron milk and melted ghee over the top, then spoon on the reserved curry and cover with the remaining rice. Finish with the remaining saffron milk and ghee, cover tightly with foil, pop on the lid and cook on a low heat for 10 minutes.Take off the heat, leave the biryani to stand for 15 minutes, then sprinkle over the torn mint leaves, cashews and crispy onions, if using, and serve with apple and raisin raita below.Apple and raisin raitaView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s apple and raisin raita.The addition of apple to raita is unusual, but I love the fresh, sweet, sharpness that granny smiths bring to it.Prep15 minServes6500g Greek yoghurt100ml whole milk2 granny smith apples,peeled and, grated and dressed with a few drops of lemon juice (to stop browning)40g raisins,soaked in hot water for 20 minutes and drained15g mint,picked and finely chopped1 green chilli,finely chopped (pith and seeds out of youremoved, if you don’t like the heat)1 teaspoontsp cumin,rtoasted and roughly crushedSea salt and pepper to tasteWhisk the yoghurt in a bowl with the milk to loosen and, then add all the otherremaining ingredients and mix well.

It is rich, creamy and delicious, yet also light as a feather. Simply put, it’s tiramisu with an Indian accent.Prep10 minInfuse1 hr+Cook30 minChill4 hr+Serves8For the soaking milk300ml milk4 cardamom pods, lightly crushed30g caster sugar1 pinch saffron threadsFor the zabaione2 egg yolks50g caster sugarFor the tiramisu500g mascarpone250g double cream1tbsp rosewater2 egg whites200g packet savoiardi biscuits, or sponge fingersTo garnish1 handfultoasted flaked almonds1 handfulchopped pistachiosGently warm the milk, cardamom and sugar until the sugar dissolves, then let it come to a simmer (but do not let it boil), take off the heat and stir in the saffron. Leave to infuse for at least an hour, or overnight, then set aside three tablespoons of it.To make the zabaione, whisk the egg yolks, sugar and a tablespoon of water in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a saucepan of simmering water, until pale and thick. In a second bowl, whisk the mascarpone, cream and rosewater, then fold them through the zabaione. In a third bowl, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then fold through the zabaione mixture.Briefly dip half the sponge fingers in the saffron milk, then lay them in the base of a 25cm serving dish. Spoon over half the zabaione mixture and top with half the nuts. Repeat with the remaining sponge fingers dipped in soaking milk, then dollop on the rest of the zabaione mixture and smooth the top.Refrigerate for four to six hours, then serve sprinkled with the remaining nuts and saffron milk.Explore more on these topicsFoodMain courseCheeseIndian food and drinkCurryRiceDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"

Food styling: Loic Parisot.Felicity Cloake's masterclassBreadHow to make garlic bread – recipeYou may think you know how to make garlic bread. But have you madethisgarlic bread?Felicity CloakeWed 31 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareOnce upon a time, an ex and I used to throw an annual party – a non-chic affair with a recycling bin full of ice and bottles – where the star, and the thing that everyone really came for, was the garlic bread: 10 or 15 loaves of the stuff, always demolished while still dangerously hot from the oven. I believe the original recipe was Nigel Slater’s; this is my tweaked version.Prep15 minCook25 minMakes1 loaf1 ciabatta loaf, or baguette – a slightly stale one, ideally80g room-temperature butter, salted or unsalted4 garlic cloves1 small bunch parsley, or another herb of your choice (see step 6)40g parmesan, or similar hard cheese, finely grated, plus a little extra for toppingA squeeze of lemon juice, to finishSalt, to taste (if using unsalted butter)1 Make ahead, if need beYou can prepare this ahead of time (and you should, too, if you want to get the smell of garlic off your hands before the festivities begin) – the day before, or even up to a month in advance (in which case, wrap, freeze and bake straight from frozen, though, if you do so, add five to 10 minutes to the cooking time). In both cases, wrap it well in foil before storing.2 A note on the breadWhile day-old bread is easier to butter, it must still be soft enough to absorb large quantities of butter (anything too dense or crisp will repel it) and robust enough to maintain its structural integrity once soaked. Brioche, for example, is usually too soft and focaccia too oily.Nigel’s baguetteis good for big parties, butIna Garten’s softer ciabattais my favourite.3 Slice the breadCut deep, thick slits into the loaf – about 2cm apart is ideal – but do not cut right through it. To this end, I find it helpful to put a chopstick on each side of the loaf while cutting it, so the knife is unable to get all the way down to the board.View image in fullscreen4 Beat the butterPut the butter (salted or unsalted, up to you, but remember to season if using the latter) in a bowl, anchor it to a work surface using a damp tea towel, then beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until softened. Alternatively, use electric beaters or the paddle attachment on a food mixer, but it’s not hard by hand.5 Crush the garlicView image in fullscreenPeel and crush the garlic to a paste using a garlic crusher, a pestle and mortar or the flat of a large knife – if you’re sensitive to raw garlic, you may wish to reduce the quantity, but avoid using the jarred ready-chopped sort, or indeed tubes of garlic paste, because they won’t taste right. For alternative flavourings, see step 9.6 Finely chop the parsleyTrim the dry ends off the parsley stalks (it doesn’t matter if it’s flat-leaf or curly, because it’ll all look green in the end), then wash the rest of the bunch and shake dry. Finely chop the leaves and soft stems. I often use chives instead, or a mixture of finely chopped thyme and rosemary leaves (be a little less generous with the latter, because they have a much stronger flavour).View image in fullscreen7 Flavour the butterStir the garlic and herbs into the softened butter, then mix in the cheese – any strong hard cheese will do here, or use something milder, if you prefer (mozzarella or medium cheddar, for example), as long as it melts. If catering to strict vegetarians, check the label. Add a squeeze of lemon and, if you’re using unsalted butter, a pinch of salt.8 Pack into the loaf and bakeDivide the butter between the slits cut into the bread, being careful not to tear them apart – I use my fingers to spread it in – then wrap the loaf in foil and store in the fridge or freezer, depending on how far ahead you’re working. When you’re ready to cook, bake the wrapped loaf at 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 for about 20 minutes, then unwrap, sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake unwrapped for five minutes more (keep an eye on it at this stage, because dryer bread will colour more quickly).View image in fullscreen9 Alternative flavouringsInstead of fresh garlic, you may prefer the mellower flavour of roast garlic, or the black variety, or to substitute finely chopped fresh chilli, or jarred chipotle chilli, coriander and a spritz of lime. Crunchy crumbled bacon bits work, too, as do finely chopped semi-dried tomatoes and olives, anchovies or even Marmite. Basically, if it goes well with cheese, it should work here.Explore more on these topicsBreadFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodNew yearSnacksCheeseHerbs and spicesfeaturesShareReuse this content"
