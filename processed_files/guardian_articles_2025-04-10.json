As many as 3,000 women every year could benefit fromcapivasertibfor hormone receptor (HR)-positive HER2-negative breast cancer that has certain genetic mutations and has spread.The drug, also known as Truqap and made by AstraZeneca, blocks an abnormal protein molecule AKT that drives cancer cells to multiply – helping to slow or stop the spread of the disease.Claire Rowney, the chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Now, welcomed the green light from the National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence (Nice) but said its initial rejection of the pill had led to treatment delays.She said: “This happens too often and urgent action must be taken to ensure the quick approval of breast cancer drugs so they can be made available promptly to those who need them.“NHSEnglandmust now put in place prompt genetic testing to ensure those eligible receive capivasertib without further delay. The Scottish Medicines Consortium must also consider this treatment at pace now, so that we see it made available to all who need it across the UK.”View image in fullscreenTruqap, made by AstraZeneca, has been shown to help slow or stop the spread of advanced breast cancer.Photograph: AstraZenecaResults from trials show that capivasertib plus the hormone therapy fulvestrant increased the time before cancer got worse by about 4.2 months compared with placebo plus fulvestrant – from 3.1 months to 7.3 months.The Institute ofCancerResearch (ICR) in London welcomed the approval for a “gamechanging” drug after decades of research by its scientists.The drug is suitable for patients’ tumours with mutations or alterations in the PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN genes. These are found in about half of patients with this form of breast cancer.Prof Nicholas Turner, from the ICR and the Royal MarsdenNHSFoundation Trust, led a key trial into the drug.He said the Nice approval meant “thousands of NHS patients with advanced breast cancer with these specific biomarkers can now receive this innovative targeted treatment to keep their cancer from progressing for longer”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A crane could also be seen on a floating platform in the river, presumably trying to raise the sunken helicopter. Meanwhile on shore, fire and police personnel stopped the public and press from reaching the end of a long concrete pier on the river from downtown Manhattan, as scuba teams emerged from the water.View image in fullscreenA New York fire department boat responds to the crash on Thursday.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesThe New York mayor, Eric Adams, confirmed six people had been pronounced dead, including three children and three adults.Speaking at a news conference on Thursday evening, Adams said his thoughts were with the crash victims and their families. An investigation into the cause of the accident was ongoing, he said.Three adults and three children were on board the Bell 206 helicopter that had left from downtown Skyport, Adams said. The victims were a pilot and a family believed to be visiting from Spain, he said.1:14New York City mayor Eric Adams confirms six killed in helicopter crash – videoJessica Tisch, the NYPD commissioner, said most of the passengers were already dead when they were removed from the water, but two passengers were taken to a nearby hospital, where they died soon after.Witness Bruce Wall told the Associated Press he saw the helicopter “falling apart” in midair, with the tail and propeller coming off. The propeller was still spinning without the aircraft as it fell, he said.Lesly Camacho, a hostess at a restaurant along the river in Hoboken, New Jersey, told the AP she saw the helicopter spinning uncontrollably before it slammed into the water.The rescue operations took place near a site close to the Manhattan waterfront, near the end of a long maintenance pier for one of the ventilation towers for the Holland tunnel, a busy under-river road tunnel connecting the city with New Jersey.Over the years, there have been multiple crashes in the skies over Manhattan, which are routinely filled with both planes and helicopters, including private recreational aircraft and commercial and tourist flights.Prior incidents include a collision in 2009 when a tour helicopter and a small private airplane collided over the Hudson River, killing nine people. In 2018, a sightseeing helicopter offering “open door” flights went down into the East River, killing five people. New York Citybannedopen-door helicopter flights following the crash.The spot where the helicopter crashed is less than three miles (4.8km) south of where US Airways Capt Chesley Sullenberger expertly landed the passenger plane he was piloting, on the water, with no lives lost, after the engines were put out in a bird strike after takeoff from LaGuardia airport. The rare successful emergency landing on water became known as the “miracle on the Hudson”.View image in fullscreenFirst responders from New Jersey and New York at the scene where a helicopter crashed in the Hudson River on Thursday.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APThe crash site is close to the southern end of the island of Manhattan, within sight of the Statue of Liberty and the One World Trade skyscraper at the site of the September 11 terrorist attack.New Yorkers were jogging and walking along the sidewalk near the Hudson as normal on Thursday evening, overlooking the scene of the crash with emergency boats still visible across the water on the New Jersey side, blue lights flashing.Software engineers and friends Mike Jones, 37, and Omar Mohamed, 21, said they were out for a walk during a break and they had heard the news of the crash.“It seems that helicopters crash a lot. And I’m afraid of heights anyway so helicopters are a no-go for me,” Jones said.Mohamed said: “There was just another helicopter crash, right?” recalling the helicopter crash in Washington DC at the end of January, when a military flight collided midair with a passenger plane coming in to land.

Onana’s opening mistake was even poorer, a Thiago Almada free-kick skipping straight past him – surely to the glee of Matic, an unused substitute.View image in fullscreenJoshua Zirkzee celebrates after putting Manchester United in front late in the game.Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersLeny Yoro made it 1-1 before Joshua Zirkzee looked to have sealed a classic smash-and-grab victory when rising to head home Bruno Fernandes’s pinpoint cross with 87 minutes on the clock. But after Cherki’s equaliser the final whistle blew to leave Onana despairing and United contemplating what might have been.As Yoro said: “It’s the worst moment to concede a goal. Two-one would have been a good result away from home but now we have to win it at home. They’re a good team with a good striker and we need to be ready for everything. We defended really well, we were compact, and we’ll need that again at home. We need to keep our heads up – we didn’t lose tonight and we can win at Old ­Trafford, of course we can.”Of his flicked, headed goal, the defender said: “I didn’t even think about it, I just reacted and tried to put my head there.” The breathless denouement means the tie is poised nicely for next week’s ­second leg but given how erratic United are, who will wager they can knockLyonout and progress to the semi-final?Porro’s touch of class for Tottenham earns draw after Frankfurt’s fast startRead moreThe Onana-Matic spat fuelled a crowd who let off flares and ­firecrackers in the sun, then entered a bouncing stadium to barrack the keeper whenever they could.The same number were close to jeering Tolisso – their captain – when he jabbed a boot at Fernandes’s free-kick: he went close to beating his own keeper, Lucas Perri, but the ball went to safety.Lyon targeted Diogo Dalot as a weakness. Twice diagonals caught him flatfooted. The second allowed Georges Mikautadze to aim a header towards Tolisso, but Dalot, ­recovering, cleared. Mikautadze’s next move was burning away from Dalot and dinking in a cross – again, the forward was thwarted and, again, United’s right-wing-back vulnerable.United were often arranged with six or seven in the backline, a result of the pressure Lyon applied. On a rare foray down their left Patrick Dorgu pulled the ball back for Rasmus Højlund, but an embarrassing scuff ensued and Lyon had a goal-kick.Fernandes was far more accomplished when Dalot and Alejandro Garnacho combined along the right and the latter found his captain in the area: the Portuguese pulled the ­trigger, Perri palmed over.How Onana must have wished he had such safe hands because now came the first moment to forget. From the left, Almada floated over a free-kick into the corridor of uncertainty that tests whether a goalkeeper should come to claim or not.View image in fullscreenAndré Onana is beaten for Lyon’s first goal after misjudging a free-kick.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersOnana decided against doing so; the ball bounced in front of him and skidded and, despairing, he flung a glove – but this only tipped the ball into the net, as if giving catching ­practice off the thick edge of a bat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lazio registered just one shot on target as the hosts attacked time and time again.Aiming to become the first Norwegian team ever to reach a European semi-final, Bodø/Glimt took the lead two minutes after half-time when Saltnes finished at close range following a precise  pass from Ole Didrik Blomberg. The hosts made more opportunities and scored their second goal in the 69th minute.Saltnes was played through and he lofted the ball over Christos Mandas. Although Alessio Romagnoli managed to clear his shot, the ball had already crossed the line. Saltnes came close to scoring a hat-trick in the final minutes but Mandas made a crucial save to keep Lazio in touch before next week's return leg.In the Conference League,Real Betistook a step towards the semi-finals with a 2-0 home win over Polish side Jagiellonia Bialystok. Cédric Bakambu broke the deadlock after running on to Pablo Fornals' pass, with youngster Jesús Rodríguez curling home the hosts' second goal just before half-time.Fiorentina, losing finalists in 2023 and 2024, are on track to face Betis in the final four after earning a 2-1 over Celje in Slovenia. Luca Ranieri struck from a tight angle to put La Viola ahead, with Rolando Mandragora adding a second from the spot before Logan Delaurier-Chaubet scored a penalty for the hosts.Rapid Viennaedged to a 1-0 away win over Djurgården, with Hampus Finndell's own goal the difference in Sweden. The Austrian side are favourites to book a semi-final againstChelsea, who eased to a 3-0 win at Legia Warsaw.Photograph: Lise Åserud/NTBWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The visitors needed calm but at their next attack Garnacho’s shot was snatched. Yet when they wandered off at the break the score was level: Fernandes’s free-kick was punched by Perri straight to Manuel Ugarte, whose volley was nodded in by Yoro.Openings such as this had to be taken as they were scant and because each time Lyon came at United they looked like they could crumble. Once more Mikautadze zipped down the left and turned the ball in for ­Alexandre Lacazette. Just on as a replacement for Paul Akouokou, he skewed the volley and United escaped.Ruben Amorim ‘really confident’ in André Onana despite errors in Lyon drawRead moreThe crowd remained lively despite witnessing the attritional fare more typical of the journeyman, not the elite footballer.Yoro, hoping to follow up his first United goal, launched a mazy run that took him infield from the left but ended with an attempt firmly in the file marked “speculative”.On 62 minutes, Ruben Amorim ended another lost night for Højlund by replacing him with Zirkzee.Perhaps Tolisso had caught the American’s bluntness because after slick footwork opened up United, he popped a shot tamely into Onana’s hands. But then came the dramatic finish.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueLyonManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Gringo Hunters was set up in 2002 to cooperate with US authorities, and have since arrested more than 1,600 fugitives.These have included formerPlayboy models, Catholic priests and professional athletes, among fraudsters, murderers and paedophiles. The Gringo Hunters learn to spot the telltale signs of an American in Mexico, from stilted Spanish to a prediction for flip flops.This time members of the unit were trying to arrest a suspect in the border city of Tijuana on Wednesday when the man opened fire, hitting Abigail Esparza Reyes, the 33-year-old leader of the unit in the state of Baja California.Local media have reportedly identified the suspect as César Hernández, 34, who in December escaped from state prison in US, where he was serving a life sentence for murder.Hernández’s escape made news at the time withvideo footageshowing him sprinting across a field in an orange jump suit with an officer in pursuit.Months later, the Gringo Hunters allegedly tracked him down to the Colonia Barcelona neighbourhood, about 30 miles from the border, and carried out an operation on Wednesday to arrest him but were met with bullets.Esparza Reyes was hit and pronounced dead at a hospital.Dozens of Mexican security forces from all three levels government, backed up with drones and a helicopter, then pursued the suspect to a house.Nonetheless, Hernández managed to escape their cordon and flee the scene.Local mediareportedthat he managed to do so while running almost naked through the streets, before ducking under a tarp over a car and emerging dressed in a fluorescent green uniform, similar to ones used by transport police, before walking away.The suspect is at large and the manhunt continues.The state governor, Marina del Pilar, posted on social media to express her regret over the death of Esparza Reyes, who had led more than 400 operations to arrest US fugitives in Mexico.“Abigail’s life will be honoured and her death will not go unpunished,” wrote del Pilar.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Ten shops have been shut, with further closures expected as investigations continue.The NCA secured freezing orders over bank accounts containing funds worth more than £1m combined.“Operation Machinize targeted barbershops and other high street businesses being used as cover for a whole range of criminality, all across the country,” said Rachael Hebert, the deputy director of the national economic crime centre at the NCA.“We have seen links to drug trafficking and distribution, organised immigration crime, modern slavery and human trafficking, firearms, and the sale of illicit tobacco and vapes.“We know cash-intensive businesses are used as fronts for money laundering, facilitating some of the highest harm and highest-impact offending in the UK.”The security minister, Dan Jarvis, said the raids highlighted “the scale and complexity of the criminality our towns and cities face”.“High street crime undermines our security, our borders, and the confidence of our communities, and I am determined to take the decisive action necessary to bring those responsible to justice.”More than £12bn of criminal cash is generated in the UK each year, according to NCA estimates. The agency said the money was typically smuggled out of the country or integrated into the legitimate financial system using a variety of laundering techniques.“Cash-intensive businesses such as barbershops, vape shops, nail bars, American-themed sweet shops and car washes are often used by criminals to conceal the origins of illicit cash,” the NCA said.“Crime gangs … are known to buy such businesses using the proceeds of crime, which provides them with a legitimate income and opportunities for money laundering.In its general election manifesto, Labour vowed to crack down on “dodgy” US candy shops, amid investigations into tax evasion and the sale of counterfeit goods.Operation Machinize involved 19 different police forces and regional organised crime units, as well as national agencies including HMRC, Trading Standards and Home Office Immigration Enforcement.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Some are slickly produced Russian propaganda about being “tough” men; some sound more like influencer advertisements for a working holiday. Others are cobbled-together screenshots by regular citizens about to leave China. But they all have one thing in common: selling the benefits of becoming a Chinese mercenary forRussia.On Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, announced thattwo Chinese nationals had been capturedin the eastern Donetsk region and accused Moscow of trying to involve China “directly or indirectly” in the conflict. A day later, he said the men were amongat least 155 other Chinese membersof Russia’s armed forces. Then again, on Thursday, he accused Russia of conducting “systemic work” in China to recruit fighters.China says it is a neutral party to the conflict, although its leader, Xi Jinping, and Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, are public allies, with a “no limits” partnership between their two nations.Zelenskyy demanded answers from Beijing,accusing it of turning a blind eyeto Russia’s recruitment of its citizens. Russia is known to have used or attempted torecruit foreign mercenariesor soldiers – includingfrom North Korea,Syria and Libya– during the conflict. He said Russia was recruiting Chinese fighters through ads on Chinese social media platforms such as Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, and that Beijing was aware of it.Numerous recruitment clips are easily found on Chinese social media. All of them emphasise the pay on offer, ranging from 60,000 to 200,000 RMB (£6,000 to £21,000) as a sign-on bonus and monthly salaries of about 18,000 RMB (£1,900).One video, which has had hundreds of thousands of views across different platforms, appears to be a Russian recruitment ad with Chinese subtitles overlaid. It shows Caucasian men leaving their day jobs to fight and asks viewers: “Do you want to show strength here? Is this the path that you long for? You are a tough man, be like them!”View image in fullscreenNumerous Russian recruitment videos can be found on Chinese social media.Photograph: https://bbs.hupu.com/59728093.htmlAnother popular video is by someone claiming to have already been recruited. “Due to the ongoing conflict between Russia andUkraine, I’m heading there after the new year,” he said in December, over screenshots with information about how to sign up.In another clip, a Russian influencer speaks to her more than 300,000 followers in Mandarin, advertising the financial benefits of joining Russia’s army, with sign-on bonuses and monthly payments from the Russian government and military as well as housing benefits and medical and childcare.“Trained by experienced coaches, equipped with the best professional equipment,” she says. “In Moscow, anyone under 60 years old can sign up, regardless of whether they have served in foreign military service. Foreign and Russian citizens can sign up voluntarily.”Responses varied, especially to the posts by Chinese people saying they were signing up. Some asked how they could be involved, or if not speaking Russian was a barrier. “Is there a team in Shanxi? Count me in. I have a passport ready and can leave at any time,” said one user.Many noted higher wages being offered than what they earned in China. Comments that people were signing up to be “cannon fodder” are common.Three weeks ago, the Chinese journalist and author Chai Jinginterviewed a Chinese citizenwho joined Russian forces in November 2023 by flying to Russia on a tourist visa.The soldier told her he was in Bakhmut as part of an “assault team” near the frontlines. He said “money played a part” in his decision to join, but he was driven mainly by never having experienced war despite being a member of China’s military.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he wanted to show people at home what the “brutal” reality was like.“I realised I might die here one day, so I decided to share some real experiences since China’s people haven’t been through a war for a long time,” he said, adding that he hoped China would plan a stable role and “refrain from starting or joining wars”.Last week, Chai interviewed Chinese soldiers on Ukraine’s side, saying there were far fewer of them than in Russia. Ukraine denies it recruits mercenaries but allows foreign volunteers to become part of its armed forces.Comments from Chinese officials on Wednesday suggested people were joining up on their own initiative, though officials in Beijing said the idea that significant numbers were involved in the war was “totally unfounded”.“Let me stress that the Chinese government always asks Chinese nationals to stay away from areas of armed conflict, avoid any form of involvement in armed conflict, and in particular avoid participation in any party’s military operations,” the foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, told a regular press briefing in Beijing.On Thursday, when asked about Zelenskyy’s claims about Chinese fighters, Lin called for “relevant parties” to “refrain from expressing irresponsible remarks”.But the fact that recruitment posts are online – and have remained there for up to several months despite being shared hundreds of thousands of times – suggests that at best there has not been a concerted effort by authorities to address them. China’s social media are strictly monitored and controlled, with fast and effective censorship of sensitive or critical terms and topics.Explore more on these topicsUkraineChinaRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

But, she says, something has to be done about the chaos and injusticeThu 10 Apr 2025 07.16 EDTShareOne of the migrants who sticks most in Nicola Kelly’s mind is Parwen, an Iraqi Kurdish mother she met in a camp near Dunkirk. Kelly played with Parwen’s seven-year-old daughter and heard about how, before one attempt to cross the Channel, French police had fired teargas and nearly hit her four-year-old son. Kelly drove away from the camp, and made the crossing – easy for her, with her British passport – that so many people were risking their lives to make. “I was about to go home to my husband and son, warm and safe in a house, knowing that probably their tents were going to be ripped away from them that night, and they’d have to sleep out in the rain and the mud,” she says. “There’s a guilt attached to that. It’s like, I wish I could do more, help in some way, other than just writing, which never really feels like enough.”Kelly’s book,Anywhere But Here, brings such a human and humane perspective to an issue that is politicised and toxic. At the camp, Parwen wished her a safe journey home and, as she was driving away, Kelly spotted some graffiti on a wall which she took for her book’s title – something an asylum seeker might think as they decide to flee, or while forced to survive in a makeshift camp thousands of miles away, but just as easily something people might think about migrants arriving on these shores, or some politicians who wish the issue would go away.A journalist, Kelly has written about immigration for many years, includingfor this newspaper. It has always been a politicised issue, she says, but in recent years, the problem of the small boats has become particularly explosive. Last year, nearly 37,000 people crossed the Channel in boats and at least 78 people died, making it the deadliest year on record; so far this year, at least 10 have died attempting to cross. We hear a lot about what people have been through to get here, she says, but not about what happens once they arrive. “I wanted to tell stories from on the ground of the people who are making the system work,” she says. Or rather, those who are trying to, within a system that is sprawling and broken. Kelly meets volunteers and activists, solicitors and caseworkers, and a coastguard who carried an unconscious and hypothermic toddler from a dinghy, and was trying to do his job in an overstretched and underfunded service, while dodging abuse from people who think people in flimsy dinghies shouldn’t be helped ashore.Kelly quotes a statistic that seems impossible to believe now: in 1997, only about3% of people in Britain considered immigration a major issue. By the time of the 2016 Brexit referendum, it was nearly half. “Now it’s one of the top issues across Europe. That’s how politicised it has become – this tinderbox of an issue that doesn’t need to be,” says Kelly.In 2014, the era of the Conservatives’ “hostile environment” policy, Kelly was working as a press officer at the Home Office. The issue of immigration, she says when we meet at her home in London, was “huge”. The year before, vans had been driving around multicultural areas with billboards telling people who were in the UK illegally to “go home or face arrest”. Kelly had worked for the Foreign Office for the previous five years, in Brussels and Istanbul, then during the Arab spring she worked as a media adviser for the Syrian National Coalition, the opposition organisation. Back in London, the Home Office felt like a culture shock.“It was much more hierarchical. I found it really competitive, brash and macho, and I felt that everyone was talking over each other to try to get their voices heard.” One of the biggest issues at the time was British fighters travelling to join Islamic State, and Kelly was at a meeting when a colleague made a dismissive joke about the difference between Sunnis and Shias. “Just a total lack of interest in the world around them,” she says. “I look back on it and think I should have said something.” But she says it never felt the sort of place where she could challenge senior colleagues. There were constantly policies she would have to defend to journalists, hating herself for it. “There is a sense that you’re morally compromised on a day-to-day basis.” Kelly left and became a journalist herself, covering immigration from the start – some former colleagues, she writes, see her as a “traitor”.View image in fullscreenNicola Kelly reporting in Dover in April 2023.Photograph: Courtesy of Nicola KellyThe first time she watched a dinghy arrive was in 2021, at Dover. For years she had interviewed asylum seekers who had made the crossing, or were waiting to, and she spent time at the camps by the French coast, but nothing could have prepared her for seeing a dinghy hauled in, its 50 or so occupants transferred on to a Border Force boat and wrapped, shivering, in foil blankets. “It was quite a visceral reaction.” She was standing near a group of far-right protesters, “and they were shouting: ‘Go back to where you came from.’ I was hearing all of this, and looking at this boat being tugged in, watching these people coming up and seeing a dad carrying his little kid.”She felt angry with the protesters, but still writes with empathy about the people with whom she doesn’t agree – the group who find a kind of camaraderie up there on the Dover clifftops, watching for “invaders”, in a town where jobs are scarce and poverty is rife; the communities angry that asylum seekers were housed in former miners’ homes in villages around Doncaster that had never recovered from mine closures. “Everyone I spoke to was utterly despairing about the lack of opportunities, the housing crisis, unemployment levels, austerity that has decimated the community. Huge social issues.” But she is scathing of politicians who inflame the issue for political gain, or don’t seem to care about the inhumane and sluggish system – a system in which a backlog of tens of thousands of people were waiting for months or years for their claims to be processed, with potential life or death decisions in the hands of low-paid, low-trained staff virtually straight out of school. And she is scathing about the private sector companies making huge profits – in 2023, Kelly wrote about allegations that there wasa culture of “institutional abuse”at hotels in and around Liverpool run by Serco, which was awarded a £1.9bn contract to run asylum accommodation. (Serco described the claims as “without foundation”.)It is not that Kelly favours open borders. “I would advocate more for a better-managed system, rather than the chaos we’ve got at the moment, which is beneficial to nobody. There are such a broad range of reasons why people flee, and they should be taken on individual merit rather than, ‘Economic migrants, bad; people fleeing conflict, OK, we’ll consider it.’ It’s too broad-brush to do that. It needs to be on an individual case-by-case basis.” She says that, compared with other European countries: “We take a fraction of people who are fleeing. We’re one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and we play a really minor role in international refugee protection.” The support for Ukrainians fleeing the war showed, she says, “how easily we can set up these schemes”, even if, longer term, many Ukrainians are now facing homelessness. “One hundred and twenty thousand people can be brought over, people can open their doors, give them their spare rooms, teach them English, fly Ukrainian flags. But we can’t do that for Palestinians, or people from Sudan.” At about the same time that Ukrainians were being welcomed: “We couldn’t do it for Afghans. We could completely leave them to their deaths. The double standards are infuriating. In very recent memory, we intervened in that country. Afghans are now the top nationality crossing by small boat, and dying in greater numbers than any other nationality. We have a direct link, a direct reason to be responsible for these people because of what we’ve done in their country.”Kelly has heard numerous accounts of racist abuse. The night before we meet, an Iraqi Kurdish man she knows got in touch to say at that he was experiencing a racist online pile-on. “He was saying, ‘I didn’t think the UK would be like this.’ That’s the sort of thing I hear all the time, and I don’t want people to lose hope, because they are safer than they were in their home countries, than they were on the migration trail, than they were in northern France. Although it’s really hostile and a completely broken system which is going to leave them likely languishing for many years, they are safe. So I don’t want them to give up hope entirely.”It is hard, though. One man she met, Arian, an Iranian Kurd who had been an engineering student in Iran, was staying with other asylum seekers at a hotel in Knowsley, near Liverpool; two weeks earlier, a mob whipped up by fascist groups had rioted outside the hotel. When Kelly met him, they got the bus into Liverpool but had to get off when a group of teenagers started abusing him. In 2020, a man turned up with a knife and a Nazi flag at the offices of her friend, the leading immigration solicitor Toufique Hossain, with the intention of killing him. She too has been threatened – including, online, by someone who said they knew which nursery her son went to – and has had to think more about it in the run-up to publication of the book. “They’re trying to intimidate people working in the sector.”View image in fullscreenOrphaned refugee children at the Calais refugee camp in 2015.Photograph: Chris Radburn/PAThe far right are loud, and parties such as Reform have other political parties nervous, but that is not the whole story. Kelly points to polls that showbroad public support for asylum seekers, including allowing them to work while their claim is decided. It would be great if that narrative could prevail, she says: that immigration “would benefit the economy, and does benefit us culturally and socially”. She had hoped Labour would be different. “The Rwanda plan was scrapped, there were positive noises early on and it seemed as if they had a bit of a grip on where the system is broken – they know that they need to restart processing, and that’s the only way to get people out of hotels, which is politically toxic.” But the rise of Reform, and the racist riots last summer, have meant the “issue becoming even more politicised. [Labour have] moved further and further to the right, or that’s the way it seems.” One recent announcement is thatanyone arriving on small boats will be refused citizenship.This week, Labour confirmed that thousands ofpeople who were due to be sent to Rwanda will have their claims processed in the UK. “It’s great to hear that people who had been kept in limbo will now have their claims processed,” says Kelly. However, Labour “should commit to scrapping all externalisation plans including returns hubs. That would give asylum seekers an added level of certainty.”There is very little about the system that Kelly says she doesn’t feel incensed about: from the unwieldy and inefficient bureaucracy to the brutality of dawn raids and detention centres, to the lone children who go missing from adult accommodation, the migrants forced into modern-day slavery, and the trafficked women giving birth alone in hostels so as not to alert immigration authorities. Most enraging is “the politics, because the politics informs the way in which the system runs. Instead of it being chaotic, they could choose to manage the system well or better, and the change in rhetoric is part of that. But I don’t think it will ever be a system that’s invested in because, politically, it’s not beneficial for them to do it.”View image in fullscreenNicola Kelly with William Hague in 2013, when she was working for the Foreign Office in Brussels.Photograph: Courtesy of Nicola KellyThe migrants she meets are present throughout the book – brave, resourceful and resilient people who have endured unimaginable suffering in their home countries and during their journeys to the UK, and, for some, in this country too. They bring real value to this country, such as those working in care, but we miss out when we don’t allow asylum seekers to work legitimately – I am thinking of the young Ethiopian medical student desperate to finish her training, but forced to take underground work as a food delivery driver.If the aggression towards migrants and racism which Kelly has seen has made her despair and question what she thought this country really stands for, she says: “It definitely helps meeting lovely people, volunteers, asylum seekers themselves.” I love Kelly’s account of the retired GP who runs a mobile clinic for asylum seekers around Doncaster, or the woman in her 80s who visits immigration removal centres and offers support and friendship to desperate detainees. “This is part of the reason why I wanted to write the book,” says Kelly. “To tell the stories of the people who are making it work, to show that it isn’t just Reform and the far right and the people capitalising on the politics of it – that there are people giving up their time and being offered nothing in return, who are just kind-hearted, and there are many people within communities, even hostile communities, who are doing this work. It’s not all bad.”Anywhere But Here: How Britain’s Broken Asylum System Fails Us All by Nicola Kelly is publishedby Elliott & Thompson(£20).

Originally based on James Leo Herlihy’s novel, it is a bromance of suffering, of sorts, between a small-time con-artist nicknamed Ratso, and a former Texan dishwasher who re-invents himself as a sex worker. Neither makes it big in the Big Apple and it ends bleakly, although the multi Oscar-winning film starring Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman has the patina of a buddy movie.Paul Jacob French, as Joe, captures the same wide-eyed optimism as Voight’s self-made cowboy who heads east to make his fortune. Max Bowden, as Ratso, is less characterful and the friendship here does not fully come to life, although you feel the desperation as Ratso sinks into ill health and Joe scratches around for the money that might save them both.The production, directed by Nick Winston with a book by Bryony Lavery, has a polished, hallucinatory look and Andrew Exeter’s expressionistic set shines. It is monochrome and imaginative, taking the story out of its period setting, and re-configuring it in a psychological space. Winston’s choreography is jittery which adds to the dream-like mix.View image in fullscreenOut of the gutter … Max Bowden and French in Midnight Cowboy.Photograph: Pamela RaithWhat is less effective is the score by Francis “Eg” White, a three-times Ivor Novello award-winning composer who has written songs for the likes of Adele, Sam Smith and Florence + the Machine. A few songs fly, such as Don’t Give Up on Me Now and Blue Is the Colour, but most feel wordy and generic.Not every voice is strong enough either; some numbers sound thin or dissonant, and it is hard to pinpoint whether this is the song itself or the voice singing it. At least there is Tori Allen-Martin, who is a highlight as multiple characters, including Cass – a rich New Yorker who becomes Joe’s first, unsuccessful, customer. The sexualised humour of the film is queasily caught in her song, Whatever It Is You’re Doing, sung while in the throes of sex.‘I was too busy to sleep with millions of people’: ex-boybander Eg White on penning bangers for Adele, Duffy – and a builderRead moreThe film, released in 1969, earned an X-rating for its portrait of furtive male homosexuality.

It’s unlikely that we’ll have many more chances to visit her, so my husband, daughters and I visited thePhilippinesto celebrate – my first trip since February 2020.Despite being born in the US and having lived here since, I still consider thePhilippineshome. I’ve made the journey at least a dozen times, and it always feels like I’m visiting another version of me only accessible in these islands. This iteration of me is always surrounded by babies and cousins, eats all the green and yellow mangoes she wants and understands more of her native language with each passing day. I am overjoyed to be there, filled with so much emotion that it leaks out of my eyeballs constantly.Growing up, I was painfully aware of how different I was from everyone else – my brothers’ only sister, my family’s overly sensitive crier, the only Filipina in my elementary school class. By contrast, when I went to the Philippines, I felt absorbed into the larger body of the family, disappearing blissfully into a bigger picture. There were tender first meetings, tearful reunions, awkward reintroductions. It was wholeness and pleasure to blend into a sea of cousins, almost indistinguishable from one another: playing card games, swimming for hours, drinking soda that street vendors decanted into plastic bags.View image in fullscreen‘My dad is young, handsome and happy – only a few gray hairs, his cheeks full and round, no evidence of gravity.’Photograph: Courtesy Angela GarbesAs for my grandmother, I grew up equally loving and being intimidated by her. She was sharp-tongued and funny, generous with gifts and kisses. Her physical presence conveyed authority, as did her hugs. Seven days a week, she sat behind her desk at the supermarket she and my grandfather opened 53 years ago, which she ran solo for three decades after his death. But now that formidable woman is gone, her mind captive to dementia. Her life is more like a child’s, dependent on caregivers and family.Writing my will sent me into an existential spiralRead moreThe morning we arrived, we had breakfast together. She had slept poorly the night before; between tiny servings of rice spooned into her mouth, she would close her eyes and doze off. Now, she has no place to rush off to, and I am happy to sit with her for hours, watching her fall asleep. She looms large in my life, but because of the distance, I have spent so little time with her. And we have so little time left.Much had changed in five years since my last trip. I am now 47, mybrain and body rewiredby hormones and age, the physical and psychic reckonings of years of isolation, an inability to outrun seismic events that shaped my life: traumatic childhood experiences, coping mechanisms honed at a young age, mental health crises. In 2020, my children were babies, unable to retain any memories. Now 10 and seven, they will remember everything.At my grandmother’s birthday party, my girls met about 50 relatives in under an hour. They were overwhelmed and dubious that these people were all family. But then both were consumed into the teeming, amorphous ecosystem, becoming part of the filial landscape just like I had. My 10-year-old ran off with cousins and ignored us for hours, then days.More from Angela Garbes’s Halfway there:No sex drive and a ‘tanking libido’: how I redefined intimacy in midlifeFirst my left knee, then my right: my middle-aged body’s betrayalPerimenopause has brought chaos to my life – but also peaceskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My skin is as dark as it gets, my hair unwashed, wild and wavy. I remember wanting nothing more than to sit in his lap, while also itching to squirm out of his grasp, back to my cousins. My dad is young, handsome and happy – only a few gray hairs, his cheeks full and round, no evidence of gravity.Growing up between two countries, I was plagued by diasporic longing, forever wondering what life would be like – whatIwould be like – if my parents had never emigrated to the US. My life was determined by being born in one place, not the other.I had expected to cry every day I was on this trip. I had tissues at the ready in my purse. But to my surprise, I didn’t need them. Instead I felt an existential calm. Midlife has pushed me to grow and learn in ways that allow me to be a better, more fully realized version of myself – a person I didn’t realize I had become until I met her in the Philippines. The tension between my two selves has softened. I am whole, finally able to accept the life I was born into.Seeing my children go through the same experiences that I did helped. Now, on my phone there’s a picture of my daughters, my cousin and me – all wearing matching friendship bracelets to help us remember our time together. One child is beaming, thrilled to be part of the shot; the other is pouting, wanting to get it over with and run back to the beach. I recognize that push and pull in them, and I see my father’s ease in myself. Somehow I have become the adult in the photograph.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHalfway there: a column about midlifeAgeingPhilippinesParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the shoot ended back in March last year, there must have been points during the post-production process when those involved wondered if their film – a rousing story of a Black female president taking charge – would coincide with a similar, albeit less schlocky, real-world victory.Sinners review – Ryan Coogler’s deep-south gonzo horror down at the crossroadsRead moreIt wasn’t to be, and instead the film has landed on Amazon at a far less inspiring time for the US, when a president has decided to destroy rather than save his country. Any links to be made from fiction to fact push Trump’s agenda closer to that of the bad guys, who aim to tank the global economy and stop a perceived US overspend of foreign aid. While there are moments that might unintentionally insist we make the connection (lead villain expressing glee at a horribly familiar red stock market arrow), G20 isn’t trying to be The Political Film We Need Right Now, its makers smartly picking brawn over brain.One might be fooled into thinking that might not be the case, however, with a glance toward the film’s choice of lead, the EGOT-winning actorViola Davis. Since she graduated from bit-part player to Oscar winner, Davis has had the odd flirtation with genre (supporting roles in the DC and Hunger Games franchises) but has mostly stuck with drama, a decorated stage actor who gives a stirring monologue like no other. Yet in G20, she’s letting her fists do the talking, a fun diversion for an actor who often hasn’t had the meaty roles many of us believe she has deserved (this is only her third lead since winning an Oscar for Fences in 2017).She’s a smart choice to play Danielle Sutton, a president with military experience, as she has both the commanding regality of a leader (she did, after all, play one in The Woman King) and the imposing physicality of a fighter (she has retained her well-trained physique from that movie). She’s forced to rely more on the latter after a G20 summit in South Africa descends into chaos when terrorists take over. She’d hoped to use the conference to help further her noble agenda to help many in the poorer regions of Africa gain better access to digital banking capabilities, but her antagonist, played by The Boys baddie Antony Starr, has a different idea. He hopes to stoke fear by hijacking her plan using deepfake tech to convince people across the world that this is in fact a cover for world leaders to gain control over the finances of less capable countries.He hopes to use this distrust to destroy existing currencies and persuade others to use crypto instead (very easy to root against a guy who is super into blockchain!), which will divert all of the money to him. With her heels replaced by flats and a gun in hand, Sutton is determined to save her family, the economy and the world – order to be determined.Contemporary buzzwords aside, G20 works off a blueprint perfected in the 80s and popular in the 90s, a decade that saw its own president-v-terrorists actioner in Air Force One. There’s nothing quite as sleekly entertaining here but there are low-grade pleasures to be had in the moment before they’re forgotten about soon after. Davis provides Jack Ryan director Patricia Riggen with safer hands than we’re used to in a streaming mockbuster such as this, although sometimes the film could benefit from more talk and less action. There are moments in the last act where she’s allowed to verbally spar with Starr, as they bark their agendas at each other, that have a crackle that’s missing from much of the more mechanical film. It’s pacey but also a little rushed, especially in the development of her integral relationship with a rebellious daughter, a payoff that loses some of its power at the end. The script, credited to four people including White Boy Rick scribes Logan and Noah Miller, isn’t funny or smart enough to elevate this in the way that Davis easily can and it’s hard not to wonder what a sharper writer could have done with this setup.The action is serviceable enough, enjoyment based less on deftly staged choreography and more on the catharsis offered to Davis, as president and actor (she has spoken in recent press about the pleasure and freedom the role has provided). The thrill it offers to her doesn’t always make its way to us but there are worse ways to spend a Sunday afternoon, watching a hyper-competent president save the economy and bring down a tech bro.

Something of the prickly, confrontational outsider clung to them even at the zenith of their success – 1995’s quadruple-platinum Different Class is an album packed with waspish, witty ruminations on the British class system – while 1998’s This Is Hardcore offered a paranoid and occasionally harrowing examination of their era as celebrities, something its dense, doomy sound also helped to draw to a close.Accordingly, Spike Island seems to use the Stone Roses’ famous 1990 gig where 30,000 people crammed into a Widnes field surrounded by chemical factories as a metaphor for disappointment and the way nostalgia tends to burnish memories: the fact that Spike Island was famously badly organised, musically underwhelming and plagued by terrible sound hasn’t stopped it subsequently developing a legendary status as a kind of baggy-era Woodstock. Perhaps Cocker is looking back on Pulp’s own supposed glory days with greater perspective: Spike Island references his discomfort with fame (“I was conforming to a cosmic design, I was playing to type”), and the indifference Pulp’s disbanding was greeted with in the early 00s, when a theoretically valedictory greatest hits album barely scraped the Top 75: “The universe shrugged and moved on”.But Cocker seems emboldened at the prospect of his own second coming. He suggests that “this time I’ll get it right” and that he has “walked back to the garden of earthly delights”. He sings happily: “I was born to perform, it’s a calling / I exist to do this – shouting and pointing”.Students of rock history might recognise the last three words as the title of an ignored 1976 album by Mott, the dogged but doomed attempt by members of Mott the Hoople to soldier on without lead singer Ian Hunter. References to 1970s pop-culture arcana are, of course, very Pulp – and so are a lot of other things about Spike Island: the disco-influenced rhythm (decorated with the distinctive sound of syndrums), the brief spoken-word section, and the sense that complicated emotions lurk behind its anthemic chorus.For all the conflicted feelings at its centre, Spike Island is a noticeably stronger song than After You, the solitary new track spawned by Pulp’s previous reformation, in the early 2010s. Had Spike Island been released in their heyday – or instead of the strikingly downbeat Help the Aged in 1997 – it would doubtless have been a hit.Equally, you could see some of its reflections on the past as not dissimilar to those offered by Damon Albarn on Blur’s 2023 comeback single The Narcissist. Whether Pulp’s forthcoming album More goes on to attain the same degree of acclaim as Blur’s The Ballad of Darren remains to be seen, but, for now, as attested by the excited texts pouring in after Spike Island was premiered on BBC Radio 6 Music, fans are likely to be delighted.Explore more on these topicsPulpPop and rockIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty ImagesAs a new compilation with unheard material is released, we assess the Cardiff legend’s diamonds and deep cutsByAlexis PetridisThu 10 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 11.04 EDTShare20. Moonraker (End Title) (1979)Shirley Bassey apparently hated this Bond theme, protesting that the lyrics were nonsensical. She never performed it live. It’s certainly not up to previous standards, but the disco version that accompanies the film’s end credits is worth hearing – better than her attempt to rejig This Is My Life for the 70s dancefloor.19. You, You Romeo (1957)Classic early Shirley in that it’s both sexy and powerful, a combination that the writer Bob Stanley once brilliantly suggested evoked “the hardest girl in the school taking a shine to you and repeatedly slamming you against her locker door”. That’sexactlywhat the chorus of You, You Romeo sounds like.18. Slave to the Rhythm (1996/2007)Another should-have-been-a-hit culled from Bassey’s stock of latterday covers: Slave to the Rhythm’s commanding tone suits her voice perfectly. She first recorded it in the mid-90s, but the 2007 version is the one, its production far less indebted to Trevor Horn’s original, its breakbeat pilfered from Primal Scream’s Loaded.17. Let’s Fall in Love (1962)View image in fullscreenBassey with (from left) Danny Williams, Alvin Stardust and Jess Conrad in 1962.Photograph: PAAnyone who felt Bassey was underserved working with British bandleaders and orchestras had their prayers answered by her sixth album, Let’s Face the Music, recorded with New Jersey arranger Nelson Riddle and his orchestra while they were touring the UK. As Long As He Needs Me was the big hit, but this is the killer cut: luscious and pillow-soft.16. (Where Do I Begin?) Love Story (1971)It was bested in the UK singles chart by Andy Williams’ original soundtrack recording, but Bassey’s take on the theme from the film Love Story may be the definitive version. She is certainly more intense in her approach to the song than Williams was, cutting against the super-slick easy listening arrangement.15. History Repeating (1997)It was inevitable that the 90s easy listening revival would burnish Bassey’s career: it resulted in her biggest hit single in decades, a collaboration with big beat duo Propellerheads. Big beat wasn’t a subgenre noted for subtlety, but History Repeating is impressively respectful in its updating of Bassey’s sound. It’s a strong song that fits her perfectly.14. Burn My Candle (1956)View image in fullscreenBassey just before her 19th birthday, in 1956.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesBassey’s debut single was asuccès de scandale, banned by the BBC. Its hymning of “straight and simple sex” was remarkably frank for the mid-50s, and amplified by the 19-year-old singer’s innocent delivery. She later claimed, not entirely convincingly, that she simply hadn’t understood the lyrics.13. The Girl from Tiger Bay (2009)Of all Bassey’s recent(ish) attempts to tap into modern pop culture, her 2009 album The Performance is the best. Written by James Dean Bradfield and Nicky Wire ofManic Street Preachers, The Girl from Tiger Bay is a particularly majestic song, worth it just to hear her confidently essay a lyric about situationism as if that were the most normal thing in the world.12. Spinning Wheel (1970)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesThe album Something, big on rock covers, was a concerted effort to make Bassey more contemporary. Rediscovered during the 90s easy listening revival, her version of Blood Sweat and Tears’ 1969 hit is great: funky and commanding enough to make you wish she’d tried this approach more often.11. For All We Know (1971)One of Bassey’s weirder hits: a version of the Carpenters’ song clearly influenced by the string-bedecked reggae singles that populated the British charts in the early 70s. Whether Shirl was a quiet admirer of the skinheads’ soundtrack of choice remains unknown, but she sails through it with aplomb.10. Morning in Your Eyes (1974)View image in fullscreenPerforming for the BBC, 1979.Photograph: David Redfern/RedfernsBassey apparently wasn’t keen on Nobody Does It Like Me, an album she recorded in LA. But this is a wonderful, overlooked track, a kind of MOR/soft soul crossover that sets her voice against Motown stalwart James Jamerson’s incredible bass playing and a sumptuous arrangement by Barry White collaborator Gene Page.9. The Rhythm Divine (1987)A collaboration with Swiss electronic duo Yello, co-written by the Associates’ Billy MacKenzie, The Rhythm Divine appeared at a commercial low point in Bassey’s recording career. It’s a wonderful song that sets her voice amid moody electronics to glamorous effect – a reminder of what she could do, given the right partners.8. Light My Fire (1970)Her cover of the George Harrison-penned Something was a hit, but the best example of Bassey tackling contemporary rock was her CinemaScope rendition of the Doors’ breakthrough single. Rediscovered by DJs in the 90s, it’s just fantastic, drenched in strings that aid her transformation of the song from slow burn into high drama.7. Never, Never, Never (1973)View image in fullscreenOn stage in 1975.Photograph: United Archives/Getty ImagesBassey had a line in repurposing Italian-language ballads for an anglophone audience, as on the show-stopping This Is My Life. Never, Never, Never, meanwhile, began life as Grande, Grande, Grande. You can see why it pricked her interest: the melody is beautiful, the key changes dramatic, and she sings the hell out of it.6. Jezahel (1972)The great Shirley Bassey deep cut. Goodness knows how she came across Jezahel – it was a single by an Italian prog band called Delirium – but her version is incredible, her voice soaring over a subtly funky backing, punctuated by thrilling blasts of brass. It was sampled on Public Enemy’s Harder Than You Think.5. Till (1961)Restrained isn’t the first adjective that springs to mind when considering Bassey’s voice – one critic approvingly compared her to a flamethrower – but her version of Till, a ballad originally recorded by Percy Faith, is all about restraint. There’s an affecting tenderness to her delivery, and the results are beautiful.4. This Is My Life (1968)More so than any of her Bond themes, This Is My Life is the archetypical Bassey belter: lavishly orchestrated musical melodrama, with a lyric so filled with defiance – “and I don’tgive a damnfor lost emotions!” – it requires a voice that communicates believable passion without slipping into histrionics. It’s hard to imagine anyone singing it better.3. Big Spender (1967)In the musical Sweet Charity, Big Spender is slow, almost creepy, sung by blank-eyed “dance hostesses”. Bassey sped it up, making its come-ons more straightforward and forthright. There’s ice in her voice – this is still a transactional proposition – but when she offers you a “good time”, you know you’re going to get one.2. Goldfinger (1964)Co-lyricist Anthony Newley was supposed to sing Goldfinger, but declined because the song was “weird”. Enter Bassey, whose performance was so full-throttle she was forced to remove her bra midway through the recording session. Her vocal has power, conviction and a faint but detectable sense of camp: no wonder it became her signature song.1. Diamonds Are Forever (1971)By 1971, the shine was starting to tarnish on the Bond franchise, and employing Bassey for the theme song was a deliberate attempt to hark back to its heyday – but Diamonds Are Forever caught John Barry and Don Black at the peak of their powers. Barry’s melody is stunning, with an arrangement that is atmospheric to the point of being almost eerie, and Black’s lyrics are a fabulously cynical melding of eroticism and materialism. Always good with songs that suggested wealth had more value than love, Bassey was the perfect fit: she sounds utterly authoritative, as if bitter experience has led her to mean every word.A new compilation, Dame Shirley Bassey: The Singer (Classic and Undiscovered Gems from the EMI/UA Years 1962-79), is released 18 April on StrawberryExplore more on these topicsRankedShirley BasseyPop and rockJames BondManic Street PreachersDance musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The roles I’ve played in the US have bigger distinctions from my lived experiences than some of my other roles. But it can be rewarding and fulfilling to do something that’s very different, so it works both ways.’71 wasone hell of a white-knuckle ridearound the backstreets of Belfast. Did you get that sense of urban claustrophobia when filming it?Aubrey26We didn’t actually film any of it in Belfast. I think it would be quite insensitive to shoot that type of story on the streets where, not so long ago, that ferocious, urban conflict was getting lived out for real. There’s no way you can pull that off without upsetting people. We shot a lot of it on the Derbyshire-Yorkshire border.Didthe ’71 screenwriter, Gregory Burke,draft the screenplay to fit your background,for example the line about Derby and Nottingham folk not getting on?InverclydediasporaYeah, dead on.

I had to spit in his face, which was massively daunting. I think it was doing that that caused him to come out with that. I’ve not forgotten it. It was totally mind-blowing for a 19-year-old to be working with someone like Michael Caine, a hugely important actor for young, working-class actors.We were doing prep for Unbroken. I had to lose quite a bit of weight [to play the Olympic runner Louis Zamperini], so I was hunkering down in a hotel in Ascot, dieting and learning my lines. Before we went off to shoot in Australia, Angelina wanted to meet my family, my nearest and dearest. We got together somewhere on the outskirts of Derby that was rural enough to land a helicopter. Everyone just buzzed off each other. My nana picked a moment during the meal to stand up to say a few words, in that way old-school nanas would, and I think that really stuck with her [Jolie].How did you prepare for your role inStarred Up?ExileCuChulainnJonathan Asser [the writer] was generous enough, once we’d been cast and rehearsed a few times, to step back and give us licence to invent stuff and bring new things to the fold. We filmed sequentially, so it was very organic. We shot it at this empty, crumbling Victorian jail in Belfast and had free rein there, apart from the odd guided tour. It can certainly be challenging when the subject matter is dark, because you’re dealing within trauma. It helps to equip yourself with as much information as possible to do justice to what you’re trying to portray.View image in fullscreenUnder starter’s orders … O’Connell as the Olympian Louis Zamperini in Unbroken.Photograph: Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarWhois your favourite character you’ve played?jessputnamI couldn’t possibly say. I’ve been very fortunate. I think it’s obvious what character people associate me with [Cook from Skins], but I don’t mind that – it’s a massive compliment.

Tom Cruise’s final Mission: Impossible movie is showing out of competition; Robert De Niro is getting an honorary Palme d’Or – and probably treating audiences to a characteristically tightlipped onstage interview – and Bono arrives at the red carpet for Andrew Dominik’s documentary Bono: Stories of Surrender. Actor turned director Scarlett Johansson comes to Cannes with her Eleanor the Great, a quirky New York tale starring veteran player June Squibb.Scarlett Johansson, Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor set for Cannes 2025 as lineup announcedRead moreThere is also, of course, an appearance from the Belgian social-realist masters and Cannes icons the Dardenne brothers, whose appearance here with The Young Mother’s Home coincides with a mood of sadness, rememberingthe recent death of their totemic actor Émilie Dequenne, who starred as a teen in their film Rosetta, which won the Palme d’Or and best actress award.As far as the British go … nothing in competition, but Harris Dickinson, recently announced as John Lennon in Sam Mendes’ Beatles tetraology, is presenting his own feature directorial debut, Urchin, in the Un Certain Regard sidebar. And writer-director Harry Lighton has his own film in the same section: Pillion, a homoerotic biker tale, based on the novel Box Hill by Adam Mars-Jones.The mood in the world’s pre-eminent film festival could hardly be more bullish and upbeat. Mutterings some years ago that Cannes’s opposition to the streamers’ non-theatrical content would render it irrelevant have been swept aside. So too have comments that it’s Venice and Toronto which set the pace for the award-winners. With the huge Oscar success of last year’s Anora, The Substance and the much-disputed Emilia Pérez, Cannes films are at the heart of the conversation – though they can’t hope to match the huge box office firepower of films such as The Super Mario Bros Movie and A Minecraft Movie.The festival is presenting us with its keynote themes and approaches. As so often, it tackles Iranian cinema and Iranian dissident politics by including the new, secretly filmed movie by Iranian auteurJafar Panahi: A Simple Accident – as ever, testing the attitude of the Iranian authorities who detest Panahi’s campaigning but are aware of his huge international prestige. Cannes is again challenging Vladimir Putin with a new film from Russia’s prominent dissident film and theatre director Kirill Serebrennikov (he had a film in Cannes just last year). This new one is called The Disappearance of Josef Mengele with August Diehl as Mengele. Ukrainian auteur Sergei Loznitsa comes to Cannes too with his anti-Soviet period drama Two Prosecutors.View image in fullscreenInternational prestige … Iranian film director Jafar Panahi in 2022.Photograph: Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty ImagesAs far as the gender issue goes, Cannes is not to be cowed. It has a female director on its opening night gala, Amélie Bonnin’s Leave One Day – a gender-switched version of her short film about someone returning to their home town – and out of competition there is Rebecca Zlotowski’s drama Private Life, about a psychiatrist, played by Jodie Foster, investigating the death of one of her patients.In competition, there is the hugely admired Reichardt who intriguingly is giving us The Mastermind, an old-school 70s crime drama with Josh O’Connor, John Magaro and Alana Haim; Palme laureate Ducournau is there with Alpha, a meditation on the Aids crisis; Hafsia Herzi presents The Last One about the Algerian immigrant experience in France and the widely admired Japanese auteur Chie Hayakawa directs Renoir, about an 11-year-old girl negotiating a bewildering adult world. The superb Spanish film-maker Simón,a Golden Bear winner in Berlin, comes to Cannes with Romería about a young woman’s quest to discover her family identity. German auteur Mascha Schilinski is in competition with her much-anticipated title Sound of Falling.I sense some of the male big hitters might divide opinion.Aster will be a hot ticket with his contemporary western black comedy Eddington starring Joaquin Phoenix. But I was not a fan of his previous film, the clunkingly phantasmagoric freakoutBeau Is Afraid. This could be more of the same, but Aster always commands attention. Richard Linklater comes to Cannes with his Nouvelle Vague, about the making of Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless. It wasn’t all that long ago that Michel Hazanavicius was in Cannes with his Redoubtable, a slightly underwhelming film about the making of Godard’s La Chinoise which Godard himself denounced as a “stupid idea” – I wonder if his new film could be the same kind of quirky/ironised ancestor-worship.Anderson is back with his comedyThe Phoenician Schemeand it is almost by the way to complain or even notice that his style is unvarying – for fans, that is the point, and it is arguably no more unvarying than those of other bland directors whose work all resembles everyone else’s. But Anderson is always in danger of reaching saturation point.Danish-Norwegian film-maker Trier blew us all away in Cannes a few years ago with his romantic comedy-drama The Worst Person in the World with its wonderful lead and Cannes best-actress-winning performance from Renate Reinsve – now he is back with Sentimental Value (also starring Reinsve), an emotional family drama.French veteran Dominik Moll is there with Dossier 137, a tough cop procedural – Moll is always good value, although Cannes has a habit of including solid but unexciting French titles in competition to ensure its own industry is represented. South African film-maker Oliver Hermanus is in competition with The History of Sound, a queer drama about two lovers in early 20th-century New England played by Paul Mescal and O’Connor.Brazil’s critic turned auteur Kleber Mendonça Filho returns us to the grim world of the military dictatorship of the 70s with The Secret Agent. Óliver Laxe is a visually driven director (who has worked with British film-maker Ben Rivers) and his Sirat, a mystery about a music festival in north Africa, looks intriguing. Mario Martone’s Fuori is a movie from the Italian director who made Nostalgia and this is about post-prison life and Tarik Saleh’s Eagles of the Republic is the last of his Cairo trilogy about post-Arab spring Egypt.As ever, it’s a mouthwatering lineup of auteur-led cinema.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalscommentShareReuse this content"

These pocket-sized cuboids plug into compatible devices and charge them, often via assorted connections, including USB-C and USB-A. Most power banks are made for charging smartphones and smaller gadgets, such as fitness trackers and earbuds, but some models can also charge power-hungrier laptops and large portable speakers.More capable still (and pocketable only in the realms of fairytale), portable power stations can charge various high-voltage appliances – perfect for camping, garden parties and power cuts.To find you the best power bank for your electrical exigencies, I put 10 top models through their paces, including options from Belkin, Anker, Cuktech, Bluetti, Acer, EcoFlow and Juice.Bear in mind that any particular power bank will only be suitable for charging compatible devices, based on its power output and connectivity. Before you buy one, check the specs against your smartphone or other devices.At a glanceBest power bank overall:Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-port 20k£79.99 at ArgosBestpower bank for portability:Anker Nano£29.99 at AnkerBest budget power bank:Belkin BoostCharge 10k with integrated cable£24.99 at BelkinBest power bank forspeed and power:Cuktech 15 Ultra£89.99 at AmazonBesthigh-storage power bank:Anker 165W£89.99 at AnkerWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing tech products since the mid-2010s. When I’m not actually trying out gadgets, I’m often writing about them using my laptop, or discussing them with editors and PR contacts on my smartphone. As a result, I spend a lot of my time using portable, battery-powered electronic devices.You might say I’m just the sort of person who needs a good power bank. I used all of the models featured in this article – even the powerhat– while working on the go at libraries, cafes and on public transport. Not once did my laptop or smartphone run out of battery!How I testedView image in fullscreenI timed how long each power bank took to charge my devices by 30%.Photograph: Pete WiseI tested these power banks by using them to charge various devices with different requirements, including:Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (battery: 6,600mAh)Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (battery: 5,270mAh)Acer Aspire Vero 16 laptop (65W ​three-cell li-ion battery)I timed how long it took for each power bank to charge these devices by 30%. I only charged the laptop with suitably powerful power banks.Thanks to Honor and Acer for loaning us the smartphones and laptop for testing. The huge batteries on these devices meant there was a lot of waiting around between test charges. These days, flagship smartphones have a battery capacity of about 3,000-5,000mAh. If you have an older or less flashy model, you may find its battery has a capacity as low as 2,500mAh.Some of the power banks had additional features, such as digital displays, integrated cables and control buttons. I tested these extras where present and also considered the portability and aesthetics of each model.Some brands didn’t want their power banks back after testing. Those models will be donated for fundraising toCat Action Trust 1977, a small national charity dedicated to the welfare of feral cats.The best power banks and portable chargers in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Charging didn’t slow down much when I plugged in two devices at once’: the Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-port 20k.Best power bank overall:Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-port 20kView image in fullscreen£79.99 at Argos£79.99 at BelkinIf you need a highly capable power bank that can recharge your laptop as well as your smartphone, this model would be a fine choice. Across three charging ports (one USB-A and two USB-C), there’s a combined power output of up to 65W – more than sufficient to charge two smartphones at once.Why we love itDuring my testing, the BoostCharge Pro topped up an Acer laptop at the sort of speeds I’d normally expect from a mains-powered charger. And it was no slouch when it came to charging smartphones. I was impressed to note that charging didn’t slow down much when I plugged in two devices at once.The power bank is a stout, minimalistic device that will make a subtle addition to your tabletop. Considering that it can store up to 20,000mAh of charge, it’s impressively lightweight – a suitable choice for a purse or bumbag.The bank’s digital display activates at the press of a button to give you a read on its storage level and outputs. The metrics are slightly less detailed than what you’d see with certain competing laptop power banks, but the information is presented clearly and includes a useful timer that indicates how soon the power bank will run out of power.It’s a shame that …the on-screen metrics are slightly less detailed than what you’d see with certain competing laptop power banks. However, the information is presented clearly and includes a useful timer that indicates how soon the power bank will run out of power.Weight:378gConnections:USB-C (x 2); USB-AOutput wattage:up to 65W (total)Capacity:20,000mAh (5.15 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25)Time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):45minsTime to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):31mins 30secsTime to charge Acer Aspire Vero 16 laptop (30%):25mins 30secsBest power bank forportability:Anker NanoView image in fullscreen£29.99 at Anker£29.84 at AmazonQuick, convenient and small enough to carry in a trouser pocket, the Nano is ideal for lightly recharging a smartphone or earbuds. For me, no other power bank strikes the same balance between impressive charging speed and portability. It’s the perfect fallback for the person whose phone never quite manages to stay powered through the day.Why we love itThe Nano is minimalistic, but the features it offers are well realised. I’m a big fan of its fold-out USB-C connector, which you can use to plug the power bank directly into your phone. Not only is this a neat charging solution but also it rules out the risk of charging being impaired by a faulty or below-spec cable (each one has a maximum current and voltage). That said, if you’re attached (pun intended) to your cable, there’s also a regular USB-C port on the side of the power bank.There are a few limitations that come with using a teeny-tiny power bank like the Nano. Its 5,000mAh storage capacity is sufficient for giving most smartphones a good top-up, but it might not be enough to fully charge the device.It’s a shame that …you’d need something more powerful to charge your laptop.Weight:102gConnections:foldable USB-C connector; USB-C portOutput wattage:up to 22.5WCapacity:5,000mAh (1.29 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25)Time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):24minsTime to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):23mins 15secsBest budget power bank:Belkin BoostCharge 10k with integrated cableView image in fullscreen£24.99 at Belkin£24.99 at AmazonIt’s hard to believe this is acheapoption. The BoostCharge Power Bank 10k has a premium-feel soft finish and speedily charges smartphones, earbuds and other lower-powered devices via its USB-C outlets.Why we love itNeatly proportioned and impressively light by comparison with some of its rivals, this is one of those rare power banks that you could blithely carry in a jacket pocket, without much fear of stretching the material. Thanks to the integrated USB-C connector, you don’t even need to remember a cable.It’s a shame that …charging two devices at once reduces the maximum total output from 20W to 15W, so single-device charging is considerably quicker.Weight:218gConnections:integrated USB-C cable; USB-C portOutput wattage:up to 20WCapacity:10,000mAh (2.57 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25)Time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):42mins 45secsTime to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):36mins 45secsBest power bank for speed and power:Cuktech 15 UltraView image in fullscreen£89.99 AmazonThis power bank was difficult to test – it charged devices so exceptionally quickly that I struggled to get to my stopwatch in time.Why we love itThe Cuketch 15 Ultra is light years ahead of the competition in terms of charging speeds, and with three ports (two USB-C, one USB-A) delivering up to 210W, there’s incredible potential to charge multiple high-energy devices. Its 20,000mAh capacity is enough to charge the average smartphone at least thrice – or give your laptop battery a significant top-up.With great power comes somewhat lower portability. This is undeniably a weighty power bank – the heaviest of its calibre that I tested. For users who prefer to pack light, that may be a deal-breaker. Still, the 15 Ultra is a well-made, smart-looking device. The TFT display gives you lots of detail on the power bank’s battery level and charging status, and you can use it with the control button to configure each port to act as a power input, output or both. You get nice accessories, too: a 3.2ft charging cable, plus a soft carry case to keep the power bank safe.It’s a shame that …the characters on the TFT display are small, which won’t be ideal for users with impaired vision.Weight:595gConnections:USB-C (x 2); USB-AOutput wattage:up to 210WCapacity:20,000mAh (5.15 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25)Time to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):10mins 30secsTime to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):15minsTime to charge Acer Aspire Vero 16 laptop (30%):26mins 15secsBesthigh-storage power bank:Anker 165WView image in fullscreen£89.99 at Anker£89.99 at AmazonA power bank for true tech lovers, the Anker 165W is capable of keeping your smartphone, laptop and other gadgets going through the day, thanks in no small part to its incredible 25,000mAh storage capacity. It’s a pleasing piece of tech in itself, with a nicely styled integrated display that tells you how much power is being drawn from each of its ports, and how much charge is still in the bank.Why we love itThis model has superb connectivity, with three USB-C inputs/outputs (two of them are connectors, one is a port) and another outlet for USB-A charging. With a 165W total output to play with, you can charge several devices rapidly at the same time.In terms of features, it goes above and beyond. Pressing the power button twice initiates trickle charging, which keeps a charged device at a stable battery level. The digital display indicates the power bank’s temperature and condition, as well as its charge level.It’s a shame that …this bulky model may be too cumbersome for some. However, a bit of heft is to be expected in a 25,000mAh power bank. A premium-looking, soft-edged enclosure and cleverly integrated loop handle make the device feel less imposing than it might.Weight:593gConnections:USB-C connector (x 2); USB-C port; USB-AOutput wattage:up to 165WCapacity:25,000mAh (6.44 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25)Time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):31mins 30secsTime to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):24minsTime to charge Acer Aspire Vero 16 laptop (30%):45mins 45secsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Two USB-C outputs and a USB-A output cater for your lower-powered devices, and there are DC and AC power outlets, too; the latter accepting a regular three-pronged UK power plug. With a total maximum power output of 700W (rising to 1,000W when using the AC50B’s power lifting mode, which is useful, briefly, for power-intensive applications, such as boiling a kettle) and a 448Wh storage capacity, there’s plenty of provision to power garden parties, camping trips or even renovation work in an off-grid home.I was thoroughly impressed with the AC50B during testing. It charges devices rapidly; the interface is simple with just three buttons to master; and the “cut-out” moulded handle makes it easy to carry the 6.7kg power station to its destination.It didn’t make the final cut because …most buyers won’t need something so powerful or feature-rich.Weight:6.7kg;connections:700W AC outlet, USB-C port (x 2), USB-A port, 120W “cigarette lighter” port;output wattage:up to 1,000W (lifting) or 700W (continuous);capacity:448Wh (equivalent to 89,600mAh when charging one device at 5V; 23.07 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25;time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):24mins 45secs;time to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):24mins;time to charge Acer Aspire Vero 16 laptop (30%):30minsAcer 600W portable power stationView image in fullscreen£499.99 at B&Q£499.99 at Mountain WarehouseBest for:powering devices in the gardenSimple, user-friendly and equipped with enough storage and connectivity to run or recharge numerous energy-intensive devices, the Acer 600W is a great pick to power your picnics and camping trips. Relative to other products of its type, this model is reasonably light, and the fold-down carry handle distributes its weight nicely.The integrated strip LED at the top of the front panel is a nice touch – perfect for outdoor entertaining after dark, or for visibility during a power cut (the sort of moment where you’ll appreciate having a power station charged up). Two DC5521 sockets are provided so you can charge the power station via solar panel.It didn’t make the final cut because …its price is too high for a lot of users.Weight:7.35kg;connections:AC outlet (x2); USB-A (x 2); USB-C (x 2); “cigarette lighter” port; DC5521 DC socket (x 2);output wattage:up to 600WCapacity:512Wh (equivalent to 102,400 mAh when charging one device at 5V; 26.36 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25);time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):45mins 45secs;time to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):47mins 15secs;time to charge Acer Aspire Vero 16 laptop (30%):30minsEcoFlow Power HatView image in fullscreen£99 at EcoFlow£99 at AmazonBest for:charging devices at a festivalStop charging your smartphone with mains electricity, and start topping it up with your headwear instead. The delightfully eccentric Power Hat from EcoFlow conceals an array of solar panels within its brim, and these power a USB-C and USB-A charger underneath. When the sun is shining, you can plug in your smartphone and give it a top-up.I waited for a mild spring day to test the hat’s charging capabilities. Compared with a conventional power bank, charging was slow – but when you’re relaxing outdoors, that may not matter much. Using solar means you’ll save money on electricity, and the hat’s UPF 50+ sun and UV protective material will help keep you safe while you’re at it.It didn’t make the final cut because …its charging performance is highly weather-dependent – and this is a UK publication.Weight:370g;connections:USB-C; USB-A;output wattage:STC12W (+/-1W);capacity:no storage;time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):2hrs 51mins;time to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):1hr 47mins 45secsJuice 3 ChargesView image in fullscreen£14.99 at Argos£19.99 at AmazonBest for:simple, low-cost charging capabilityThis is a simple, reliable and inexpensive power bank that you can sling into your bag and forget about until you need to charge your phone or headphones.There are no bells and whistles here, but the Juice 3 does everything that counts. It can charge up to three devices at once using its single USB-C and two USB-A ports, and a tiny USB-A to USB-C cable is included to help you out in a pinch. This power bank’s 10,000mAh storage is great for the price you pay.It didn’t make the final cut because …though affordable it’s understandably not the quickest at charging devices – especially not when you’re using the USB-A ports.Weight:193g;connections:USB-A (x2); USB-C;output wattage:up to 15W;capacity:10,000mAh (2.57 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25);time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone:(30%): 25mins 30secs;time to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone:(30%): 21minsEcoFlow Rapid Magnetic 10,000mAhView image in fullscreen£89.99 at EcoFlow£89.99 at CurrysBest for:eye-catching designThis chic new power bank from EcoFlow is the perfect partner for a much-loved phone, with a USB-C output and magnetic charging via the speedy Qi2 protocol. It charged smartphones quickly during my testing, and it also proved capable of giving a laptop an emergency top-up (which soon drained its battery).Power banks are generally practical items rather than pleasing objects – but the Rapid is both. I enjoyed its mirror-finish display, which pairs in retro-futuristic fashion with pixellated read-outs on the power bank’s charge status, input and output. There’s also a fold-out “kickstand” that keeps your phone upright during charging, which could come in handy for watching films on the train.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not as versatile as some similar-spec models.Weight:258g;connections:Qi2 magnetic; USB-C connector;output wattage:up to 30W;capacity:10,000mAh (2.57 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25);time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):25mins 30secs;time to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):21minsWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenGood usage habits can extend the lifespan of power banks.Photograph: Pete WiseWhich power bank specifications really matter?There are a few crucial specs to look into when you’re choosing a power bank. Thewattagetells you the power bank’s power output.Laptops, smartphones and other gadgets all require a certain wattage, so you need to get a power bank with a port that’s powerful enough to charge the device. The same goes forvoltage. If a power bank has multiple ports for charging devices simultaneously, then maximum power outputs will be given for the ports, individually and in total. High-wattage power banks are usually heavier, bulkier and more expensive than lower-powered models, as they require more storage and cooling capability.A power bank’sinputs and outputsare also crucial. Most power banks feature ports that connect to devices (or to a mains outlet to receive charge) via USB-C or USB-A. Some models can also charge compatible devices – especially smartphones – wirelessly. And for Apple device users, certain power banks feature a Lightning cable and port.Capacity(mAh) tells you how much electrical charge the power bank can hold in its onboard lithium-ion battery. If a smartphone has a 6,000mAh battery and your power bank holds 20,000mAh, then you should be able to charge the phone fully at least three times without running out of power.How long should a power bank last?As with all devices that rely on a lithium-ion battery, power banks gradually become less effective until they can no longer be used. When a battery is fully charged and then fully discharged, this is called acycle. The number of charging cycles a power bank can supply varies greatly between models, but you’ll get somewhere in the range of 300 to 1,000 in most cases. Depending on how much you use your power bank, that could keep you charged up for a year, or perhaps several years. It’s instructive that power bank warranties typically top out at about two years.Good usage habits can preserve the condition of your power bank’s lithium-ion battery, therefore extending the lifespan of the power bank itself. Very-low or very-high charge levels put the most stress on these batteries, so try to keep your power bank moderately charged most of the time. It’s also best to avoid storing your power bank in very hot, cold or humid places.Pete Wise is a freelance journalist with more than a decade’s experience covering everything from global development and social causes to technology and music. He has written extensively on portable tech, including laptops, smart speakers and drones – one of which he misplaced in the skies over a West Yorkshire village.

With Reform nipping at his heels, Starmer must offer protection to the British peopleThu 10 Apr 2025 12.58 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 14.08 EDTShareIf it’s brown, lie down. If it’s black, fight back. If it’s white, say goodnight.The rhyme we learned hiking as a family through Yellowstone national park last summer is meant as a cheery reminder of how not to get eaten, if you meet a bear. Brown bears are best appeased by playing dead; black bears need to know this will hurt them more than it hurts you; and luckily there aren’t any polar bears in Yellowstone, because nothing deters them.Until this week the world remained unsure what kind of bear Donald Trump was. Keir Starmer treated him like a brown bear, dropping to the floor when threatened with tariffs and offering up a trade deal. China saw a black bear, to bemet with maximum aggression. Though one day we may have to contemplate the prospect of a polar bear president – one who actually means what he said about invading his neighbours – for now what we actually seem to be facing is a crazy bear. There’s no discernible strategy or pattern here: just untrammelled ego, dragging the global financial system to the brink of meltdown and vaporising his own supporters’ retirement savings for no obvious reason beyond the pleasure of seeing impoverished alliesdesperately “kissing my ass”. And though this bear has lumbered back into the woods for now, seemingly spooked by aconcerted revolt in the bond markets, the damage is done.What is still for the cheerfully news-avoidant just a faintly incomprehensible story about rising and plummeting stock markets will, in coming weeks, start shaping everyday lives for the worse. British businesses who have barely been able to work out if they’re coming or going for the last few weeks will pause big decisions while they try to calculate their losses. Our car and steel industries still face job-destroying higher tariffs, while Trump has talked ominously of new tariffs on pharmaceuticals to come (British drug companies rely heavily on US export markets). Along with all countries that did not retaliate against Trump, we remain saddled with a random 10% tariff on all exports, which could presumably still change on a whim. And if the US keeps up its self-harming tariff on China–now an eye-watering 145%, according to the White House, which is adding Wednesday’s 125% to the pre-existing 20% – then before long it won’t just be a case of prices rising for American shoppers but of trade between them breaking down completely, leaving American shelves empty. All this makes nervous consumers worldwide less inclined to spend and employers less likely to hire or invest, raising the risk of recessions – one reason that on Thursday, the markets fell again. There’s no security for working people in any of this, and vanishingly little prospect of growth. For aLabourgovernment elected to deliver both, that is an existential challenge.There are opportunities for Keir Starmer in Trump’s trade chaos. Here’s how he can seize them | Martin KettleRead moreYou can either be thedisrupter or the disrupted, Starmer warned his cabinet in February, rather startlingly for someone whose watchword was caution. His chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, has however concluded that the new political divide isn’t left v right but “smash the system” v “look like the system and get smashed”. The obvious disruptive influence then was Nigel Farage’s resurgent Reform UK party, not a trade war, but one may now feed the other.Farage has gone very quiet lately about his now toxic friendship with Trump, but his local election message to England’s post-industrial heartlands is a blatantly Trumpian one about the glory days of manufacturing. This weekhe went to the pubwith workers from British Steel’s endangered Scunthorpe plant – though it wasLabour ministerswho put in the unsung hours on a deal to save jobs there – beforevisiting a long-closed collieryto explain that he always thought the miners were betrayed. (Let’s just say that must have been an unusual view in the City, where at the time of the miners’ strike, Farage was working as a commodities trader.) It’s preposterous – Reform’s blend oftax cuts for the richand dead-end nostalgia for everyone else would do nothing to revive former coal and steel communities – but Trump posing as the rust belt’s saviour seemed preposterous once, too. Farage knows where the electoral sweet spot is, in the seats where Reform is nipping at Labour heels: tacking right on issues such as immigration but left on economics. And while Starmer’s government is quick to compete with Reform on the former, it is more wary of the latter, even though ageing “red wall” voters now complain in focus groups of markets being rigged against them in ways that uncannily echo the disenchanted, Green-leaning southern young.But if Trump is really killing growth, meaning there will be no generous rising tide to lift public services and living standards, the only remaining options are either redistribution or accepting inexorable decline. Time, in short, to pick some enemies; to disrupt something before getting disrupted.Which markets genuinelyarestacked against consumers? Who is making profits that can’t be justified? If Trump really has broken the old model, could it be built back better? This can’t mean uncosted, utopian leftwing populism but serious-minded, rigorous reforms that demonstrably put money back in ordinary pockets.What voters seem to want, the American data scientist David Shor and the writer Ezra Kleinargued recentlyin a podcast on the confused desires underpinning American politics, is an “angry moderate”: someone who sounds as furious as they are about the state of things without seeming too frighteningly radical. There is plenty a British angry moderate could attack: from theongoing debacleof Thames Water to the bafflingly opaque“surge pricing”now operated by everyone from concert-ticket vendors to pubs and hotels; from inequities in the tax system, or the waylinking electricity prices to gaskeeps them frustratingly high, to the outsourcing of social services that has leftprivate equity firmsrunning children’s homes and nursing homes for profit. (Not entirely alien territory to Rachel Reeves,who once told methat investigating the collapse of the outsourcing company Carillion as a backbencher changed her politics, and who has long embraced the idea of an activist state working to make life less precarious.) But whatever form it takes, offering people“shelter … from the storm”, as Starmer rightly has this week, should mean more than corporate bailouts. If not, anger with Trump could easily morph into anger with domestic governments’ inability to protect their own people from the fallout.He won’t be president for ever. But the mess he’ll leave behind, the jobs lost, the dreams smashed, the neighbourhoods spiralling downwards? That’s the polar bear, the thing that really eats governments.

No, but behind the hype was a genuine breakthroughHelen PilcherThe pups are cute – and great for PR – but they’re modified grey wolves. The real work is being done with their red cousinsThu 10 Apr 2025 10.50 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 11.31 EDTShareI’ve been waiting for this. Ever since researchersalmostbrought a wild goat speciesback from extinctionin 2003, it was only a matter of time until someone came forward and said they had successfully “de-extincted” a species. Now,it has happened.This week, American biotech companyColossal Biosciencesannounced it had resurrected the dire wolf, an animal that went extinct at the end of the last ice age. Colossal released a video that invited viewers to “experience thefirst dire wolf howlsheard in over 10,000 years”.But these are not dire wolf howls, and these are not dire wolves. To make the pups, scientists edited the DNA inside grey wolf cells to make it more dire wolf-like. Twenty changes were made to 14 different genes involved in coat colour, body size and skull shape. Then the cells were used for cloning.The result is that the vast majority of the animals’ DNA is still that of the grey wolf. I’m not the firstto point this out, but this means that what Colossal has actually created is a genetically modified grey wolf.So, why the insistence on calling it a dire wolf?Pop “dire wolf” into a search engine, and the evidence of a PR coup is everywhere. Exhibit A: the exclusive access given to media big hitters, such as Timemagazine and ABC News. Exhibit B: the wolf howl video, which racked up more than a million views in 24 hours. Exhibits C to I: seven more films, all by Colossal, released to time with its announcement. This includes one –more pop video than documentary– that attempts to explain the complicated science of de-extinction to the soundtrack of Thomas Dolby’s She Blinded Me With Science. Oh, the irony.If the idea was to generate interest, or hype, the dire wolf announcement worked, but in the midst of it all, there is a conspicuous absence of peer-reviewed, publicly accessible science. Colossal hasn’t released its methods or analysis of results for scientific or public scrutiny. This isn’t science as most researchers do it. This is a carefully orchestrated PR campaign, by a private company valued atmore than $10bn.Dire wolves are cool. Genetically modified wolves, less so. “We’ve slightly changed the DNA of a wolf,” is less newsworthy than, “we’ve made a dire wolf … you know them, they’ve been in Game of Thrones,and World of Warcraft” (George RR Martin – a Colossal investor and adviser – reportedly met the “dire wolves” and was moved to tears). Colossal knows this and uses it to its advantage.I’veinterviewedresearchers from Colossal Biosciences. Their technology is impressive, but there is what they do, and there is how they share this. When it comes to publicity, Colossal is a master of the art.Only last month, it announced its creation of the mammoth-esque “woolly mouse”. Before that, it has dominated headlines with its plans to de-extinct thethylacine, thedodoand thewoolly mammoth. Oh, and did I mention that it has the financial and PR backing ofChris Hemsworth,Peter Jackson, andTiger Woods? I didn’t, but it has.It is a showboating, clickbaiting approach to science that prioritises media attention over accessible data. If regular science is the quiet kid, calmly eating their dinner, then Colossal Bioscience is the fidgety kid, who wants to show you how many peas he can fit in his mouth.This is science by press release, and it’s a problem. Fragments of data are scattered among glossy PR products, which makes it almost impossible for the rest of the scientific community to interrogate the quality of Colossal’s work.So what’s the point of making a dire wolf that isn’t really a dire wolf?Colossal saysit is because the wolves can improve the diversity and health of their ecosystems.This much would be true, yet the three individuals, Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi, will spend the rest of their lives in their 800-hectare (2,000- acre) reserve. Any plans to release future not-dire wolves into the wild are unclear.A second reason, Colossal says, is because the project is helping to save endangered species. Alongside its “dire wolf” pups, Colossal also announced the birth of four cloned red wolves.Red wolves are a critically endangered species, native to the US. Fewer than 20 wild animals remain, all descended from 14 founder individuals. By carefully choosing the cells that they used for cloning, Colossal has effectively produced three new founders. If the animals are allowed to breed when they are older, this could improve the genetic diversity and resilience of the red wolf population.This is a potentially valuable contribution to conservation science, but it’s a shame that this is being drowned out by the noise created by the dubious dire wolves.In the meantime, the child is being applauded for shovelling peas into their face. Colossal is playing a PR blinder, with the column inches it generates a reward for its hype. “Meh” projects are being spun in a way that is unlikely to be good for the public perception of science. How many people, I wonder, will view these headlines and think that de-extinction is happeningright now? To make informed decisions, people need to be able to discern reality from hyperbole.Colossal says that technology it developed for the dire wolf project helped it to complete the actually important red wolf project. Only, did itreallyneed to make a big, white, muscly, genetically modified wolf in order to make copies of the red wolf? I think not. But I do think it knew how much publicity it would generate.Helen Pilcher is a science writer and the author of Bring Back the King: The New Science of De-Extinction and Life Changing: How Humans are Altering Life on EarthExplore more on these topicsWildlifeOpinionBiotechnology industryCloningAnimalscommentShareReuse this content"

It does need changing,” Lee, a bin worker and union rep, told me. But the council’scurrent offerto end the strike isn’t good enough, he said. If it cuts wages the way it wants to, “people will lose their homes”.We’ve been here before. In 2017, duringseven hot and smelly summer weeks, similar interviews were conducted in the same spot and images of sky-high mounds of uncollected rubbish were beamed out of Birmingham. That dispute was almost the same as the one we’re living through now: the council wants to get rid of a role that poses a hefty equal pay risk. Essentially, workers in other parts of the council on a similar grade don’t get the same pay or perks, which means they can make costly claims for compensation via unions or no-win, no-fee lawyers. Although the problem reared its head eight years ago, it wasn’t properly addressed – those strikes ended with essentially the same role in place but under a different name, allowing expensive claims to mount.The failure of Birmingham’s leaders to get to grips with the situation is a symptom of the council’s deeper disarray. As far as dysfunctional families go,BirminghamLabour is up there with the House of Windsor. Consumed by infighting and intermittent grabs for power from within its ranks, the group often seems so focused on internal strife that the business of running the city comes second. You don’t need to take my word for it. In May 2023, a Labour council improvement board (CIB) report found the group was “divided” with “briefing against colleagues” commonplace.But it’s not just Labour. Historically, relationships between councillors and local government officers have been fraught. A 2014 government review into Birmingham found that members’ and officers’ roles were “blurred”, and the more recent CIB report highlighted a potential imbalance of power, with many members believing the council was “officer-led”. It was the most senior officer, then chief executive Deborah Cadman, who revealed in June 2023 that the council had a financial crisis on its hands. She informed councillors that the estimated potential bill the council owed in equal pay claimswas between £650m and £760m.Three months later, the council’s inability to pay for these claims was the number one reason for Birmingham issuing a section 114 notice, declaring effective bankruptcy. As if that news wasn’t dramatic enough, council leader John Cotton reportedly first learned of the decision to issue the notice whilewaiting to board a flightto New York for a family holiday, apparently blissfully unaware the authority was about to be plunged into chaos. Even the then local government secretary, Michael Gove, I am told, was bewildered by this move, given how unstable it made the council appear.Gove’s diagnosis was swift: he quickly installed a team of austerity-obsessed commissioners in Birmingham who have overseen theworst cuts in local government history. To take just one example: by 2027, £48.1m will have been axed from children’s social care, with the cabinet member for children and families saying there is the “potential”for children to die.And yet, last week, the real figure the council owes to workers making equal pay claims wasrevealed to be, not £760m after all, but £250m. True, Birmingham’s issues run deeper than that sum (it also has to pay for a disastrous new IT system that messed up its bookkeeping abilities, and has an existing budget gap of £300m), but to anyone watching the rolling news coverage that bleak autumn, the near-£800m bill for equal pay was the cause of our downfall – so why was the figure ever floated in the first place? Had it not been, the section 114 notice – the precursor to those brutal cuts – might never have been issued. As for Cadman, she unexpectedly resigned last March after beingaccused of misleading the councilover the decision to publicise the equal pay sum.‘We’re not a third world country, we’re England’: anger rises as Birmingham’s bin strike takes toll on localsRead moreMeanwhile, the Labour government in Westminster hardly seems interested in Birmingham, and its opponents are rubbing their hands with glee at the chance to make an example of the city. The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, got in early in February, with a dispatch on fly-tipping from Handsworth for GB News. Strolling around one of the city’s more deprived neighbourhoods, he pointed enthusiastically at the “hoards of filth” and discarded “soiled underwear”.Last week, Nigel Farage held a rally in Birmingham featuring a theatrical set complete with overflowing bins, potholed roads and the message: “Your council is broken. Reform will fix it” illuminated on a screen. The Conservative shadow local government secretary, Kevin Hollinrake, appeared on Jeremy Kyle’s TalkTV show a few days ago after a visit to Birmingham, which he likened to a “third world country”. Even those of us frustrated with Labour will find little solace in such opportunism.We are used to being ridiculed in Birmingham, to opening social media and seeing countless memes declaring our city is a “shithole”. I don’t know anyone who cares too much about that on a personal level – the Brummie disposition is typically light and self-deprecating. What we want,with increasing desperation,is a functioning city that is a pleasure to live in, not politicians falling over themselves to use us as their football. Birmingham’s motto, adopted in the mid 19th century when we were regarded as a municipal powerhouse and “the best-governed city in the world”, is “forward”. Today, it feels as if we are going round and round in circles.Kate Knowles is editor of the Birmingham DispatchExplore more on these topicsBirminghamOpinionIndustrial actionLocal governmentTrade unionsWasteEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

We must defend itThu 10 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 07.02 EDTShareKnight of the realm and business tycoonPhilip Greenspends a lot of money on expensive lawyers.First, he took out an injunction in 2018 toblock the mediafrom mentioning him overcomplaints from his employeesat Arcadia Group, overwhelmingly women, about bullying and abusive conduct, behaviour which he categorically denied.But that failedwhen I named himas the person making the injunction on 25 October 2018 in the House of Lords, under a form of legal immunity known as parliamentary privilege – whereupon his lawyerstried to get mesanctioned by the parliamentary standards commissioner. That failed too when his complaint wasroundly dismissed.Green’s latest action was to instruct lawyers to appeal to the European court of human rights to overturn the concept ofparliamentary privilege in Britain, claiming that my comments had circumvented court orders around the injunction, violated his privacy and violated his right to fair trial. That also failed when the Strasbourg court this week sensibly ruled it was not a matter for them. (This was a chamber decision, so there are still three months during which he could ask for the case to be referred to the grand chamber of the court for a final ruling.)If hewere to succeed in overriding parliamentary privilegein this case, that would be seismic for human rights and freedom of speech.It dates back at least to parliament’s finest historic moment in January 1642, when King Charles I and his soldiers invaded theHouse of Commonsto arrest five MPs for treason after their speeches criticising his rule.The Speaker courageously defied him while MPs chanted “Privilege! Privilege!” – a cry taken up in the streets by the people of London. In 1689, the right to free speech in parliament wasentrenchedin the English Bill of Rights.It means that MPs or peers when speaking in parliament cannot be sued and what they say can be reported in the media without the rich or powerful being able to suppress it with legal injunctions or asset seizures.Despite outrage from the legal establishment, it was used in 1955 to name for example, the notorious spy Kim Philby. It was vindicated again in 1978 when MPs used it to expose the bogus secrecy of “Colonel B”, wrongly (as judges later found) given anonymity by a court to bolster an oppressive official secrets case against journalists.When the director of public prosecutions immediately threatened the press with prosecution, newspapers, led by the Times,defied him.That said, parliamentary privilege should be used very responsibly and sparingly. In my 34 years as a parliamentarian, I had used it just twice before naming Green.In January 2000, as a Foreign Office minister, and using British intelligence, I named traffickers selling arms for “blood diamonds” fuelling wars in Africa. They went out of business. Their chief “merchant of death”, Putin cronyVictor Boutwas subsequently imprisoned.In 2017 in the Lords,I namedBritish-based global corporations alleged to becomplicit in former president Jacob Zuma’s corrupt activities in South Africa.These examples are living proof of parliamentary sovereignty – irrespective of the wishes of the executive, the powerful, and the wealthy, and even rulings by the legal establishment when it prevents the publication of allegations of misconduct – as the courts did initially over the Green case.I acted for moral reasons and was not second-guessing or criticising the judiciary when I further used parliamentary privilegeto name Greenand share details of allegations against him in the House of Lords on 23 May 2019 - Green repeated that “to the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations”.I did this partly becauseGreen’semployees had signednon-disclosure agreements, when such NDAs are meant to ensure the sanctity of confidential commercial matters, not to hideallegations of abuse.Film tycoonHarvey Weinsteinused NDAs to silence his sexual harassment victims, as did organisers of thePresidents Clubdinner in London inJanuary 2018, when 130 women were required to sign agreements in a bid to stop any details of harassment, groping and propositioning going public.Former Conservative cabinet minister Maria Miller, when chair of the women and equalities committee, said that the case had “thrown a spotlight on the way NDAs can be used repeatedly to cover up alleged wrongdoing”.Because of Charles I’s attacks, the monarch is still barred from entering the House of Commons. Parliamentary privilege is an absolute free speech right entrenched in the law, a fundamental part of Britain’s constitution and a part of the rule of law itself.It should not be whittled away by allowing judges, at the behest of the powerful or wealthy, to override the sovereignty of parliament.Peter Hain was the Labour MP for Neath from 1991 to 2015 and secretary of state for Northern Ireland from 2005 to 2007Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now we have an answer: it is when selling spills into the US government bond market and there is intense talk of negative feedback loops and financial Armageddon.“The bond market is very tricky, I was watching it … people were getting a little queasy,”said Trump on Wednesday, understating matters wildly as he explained his tariff “pause”.The reality was thatbond markets were in revoltbecause the world’s richest economy seemingly no longer cared about credibility in policy making or about being the anchor of the world’s financial system. It was prepared to risk recession by declaring a trade war on the rest of the world, including its political allies, on the basis ofdodgy formulas and made-up definitions of reciprocity. Technical selling by hedge funds in need of cash probably added to the pressure, but the root cause was political unpredictability.Attempts by Trump allies to present the chaos as part of a pre-determined artful strategy to bring countries to the negotiating table are absurd. You don’t display negotiating strength by changing your tariffs about twice a day, having your advisers quarrel in public and being forced to partly U-turn because your long-term cost of borrowing has risen.Relief in financial marketsflows from the fact that the bond markets’ enduring ability to intimidate anybody is intact. Some old rules still apply, at least. Worst-case scenarios are off the table after the “pause”.But let’s not overstate the degree of the U-turn. This was not of the full,Liz Truss-style screeching variety. Baseline universal tariffs of 10% still apply. So do 25% tariffs on automotive imports, we assume. There was no mention of whether the “major tariff” on pharmaceutical imports is still coming. The tariff on Chinese imports has been lifted toa demand-crushing level of at least 145%. And the reduced “reciprocal” tariffs only apply for 90 days, so we could do it all again in July if the wondrous trade deals do not appear. If it proves impossible – which is the way to bet – to complete trade deals with 75-odd countries in 90 days, will the “pause” be extended? We don’t know.Put yourself in the position of an average multinational company and ask how these events will feed into decisions on where and when to invest capital. There will be a default to delay until the terms of trade between the US and rest of the world are settled and then seen to be able to endure. Members of the method-in-the-madness school of Trumpian thought claim the real end goal is lower tariffs with dealmaking, free-trading allies. “We’ll believe that when we see it,” any chief executive in any multinational boardroom would surely respond.Here’s George Saravelos, the head of foreign exchange research at Deutsche Bank: “Even if the tariffs are permanently suspended, damage has been done to the economy via a permanent sense of unpredictability in policy. More structurally, the events of the last few weeks will resonate among global economic partners during the future negotiations on trade and indeed for many years to come. The desire to build greater strategic independence from the US across all fronts will be here to stay.” That sounds spot on: events of the past week will not be forgotten in a hurry.Meanwhile, there is an enormous uncertainty over where the escalation with China goes next, and how it may affect growth this year. UBS strategist Bhanu Baweja calculates even the impact of a 10% universal tariff and a 50% Chinese one would mean a hit to GDP and domestic demand “large enough that earnings growth needs to be brought down to low single digits, potentially even flat”.This is not over.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsNils Pratley on financeInternational tradeTariffsGlobal economycommentShareReuse this content"

By working together, we can protect jobs and living standardsThis is the first in a two part series on the global response to Donald Trump’s tariffsThu 10 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 08.16 EDTShareNo more than a narrow window of opportunity remains if we are to prevent an unnecessary global recession. As China and the US decouple,disruptive trade warsare intensifying and threaten to descend into currency wars; import, export, investment and technology bans; and financial fire sales that will destroy millions of jobs worldwide. It seems barely credible that the world is being brought to its knees by one economy, outside of which live 96% of the population, who produce 84% of the world’s manufactured goods. But even though US officials have previously talked of a tariff policy of “escalate to de-escalate”, Donald Trump’s aim is to force manufacturing back to the US, and his 90-day relaxation of some tariffs does not mean he intends to defuse the crisis.On Monday, Keir Starmer warned that the world will never be the same again, andreminded usthat “attempting to manage crises without fundamental change just leads to managed decline”. He is right. As I learned in the financial crisis of 2008, global problems require globally coordinated solutions. We need a bold, international response that measures up to the scale of the emergency. In the same way that, to his great credit, the prime minister has been buildinga coalition in defence of Ukraine, we need an economic coalition of the willing: like-minded global leaders who believe that, in an interdependent world, we have to coordinate economic policies across continents if we are to safeguard jobs and living standards.The immediate challenge is to mitigate the supply-side shocks caused by theTrump tariff wall. AsRachel Reeves is proposing, we need to keep world trade moving. No two crises are ever the same, but offering extended credit to exporting and importing firms was central to theglobal responseas trade collapsed in 2009. We also have to remind China that if it is to present itself as a champion of free trade, it is in its interests to focus more on expanding domestic consumption than flooding the world’s markets with cut-price goods it cannot now sell in the US.Yet the global challenges go well beyond managing the tariff shock. Resuscitating trade will not be easy without coordinating macroeconomic and financial policies across continents. Global inflation will rise, even after taking into account the deflationary impact of low-priced Asian exports. But this shock is outweighed by a bigger problem: collapsing consumer confidence and declining business investment. That means we may need a synchronised reduction in interest rates – an initiative the US might well join – backed by fiscal activism in the countries where there is space to expand.Our international economic institutions were built on a belief that if prosperity is to be sustained it has to be shared, and that you cannot have economic success everywhere unless you are prepared to act anywhere where there is need. With or without the US’s help, we must immediately mobilise the$150bn grant and loan-making capacity of the World Bankand the$1tn financial power of the International Monetary Fund, not least to help the most vulnerable, tariff-hit developing economies. In 2009, it was the combination of trade credits and multilateral bank money that underpinned the world economy by$1.1tnand prevented recession descending into depression.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump sets out his tariffs at the White House, 2 April 2025.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersA coordinated approach offers us the chance not just to stabilise the world economy but – to use a phrase from 2020 – “build back better”. For the UK, that means working ever-more closely with the EU. Indeed, the changes under way inEuropemake possible a collaboration that is even more extensive than removing post-Brexit trade barriers. There has always been a tension between Europe’s desire to lead, which makes it bold, and its desire to stay united, which makes it timid, but today Europe has lower inflation than the US, and it can reduce interest rates faster.US deficit spending since 2010 has been many multiples of the euro area, leaving Germany in particular with proportionately far lower debt than the US. With the fiscal flexibility that the incoming German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the EU have created, new resources can be injected into the global economy. This can be done by implementing theDraghi report on European competitivenessand would complement China’s spending boost. At the same time, theUK-EU defence cooperationagreement should be extended to enable joint and more cost-effective weapons procurement. And, to release resources elsewhere, we should advance discussions on a Europe-wide, off-balance-sheet, special-purpose defence and security fund.Europe may be required to lead in another respect if the US’s willingness to act as a lender of last resort to the world is ever in doubt. The globalFinancial Stability Boardshould be asked to report immediately on what risks to stability may need to be addressed within the bank and non-banking sectors. If it became necessary, the European Central Bank could also be asked to fill a gap left by the US (and which China has been trying to occupy) by extending currency swaps to a wider group of countries in need of liquidity support.The Guardian view on Starmer’s choices: time to be bold | EditorialRead moreCoordinated multilateral action is essential if Britain is to secure the export-led growth we need. That growth will be turbocharged by refocusing industrial policy on boosting internationally competitive sectors – from life sciences and AI, to the energy transition and the creative industries. Promoting such world-beating clusters requires us, asthe chancellor has said, to invest more heavily in research and development and high-level skills. But it also demands that we champion a pro-competition regime that does not favour the tech giants at the expense of their smaller UK competitors, or dilute copyright and intellectual property laws so vital to creative talent.It is not only the multilateral economic system that is under assault, but every single pillar of the rules-based order, from respect for the law to the self-determination of nations and historic commitments to humanitarian aid. Indeed, we are seeing a simultaneous breakdown in economic and geopolitical orders. In a follow-up article, I will suggest how we might build a new order out of what are fast becoming the ruins of the old. But first, we need to show that the world can act together to support people’s living standards. Doing so will demonstrate the fundamental principles at stake: that international cooperation is in our collective interests, and that a zero-sum world of competing nationalisms leaves us all poorer and less secure.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

IfMahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk, Yunseo Chung, Badar Khan Suri and other recent Ice detainees are considered threats to national security, then so am I.I have committed the same acts they have committed, including publishingan articlethat calls the war inGazaa genocide, participating in aprotestagainst the genocide in Gaza, speaking and protestingin favor of BDS(boycott, divestment, sanctions against Israel), participating in asit-inat UC Davis about 10 years ago, and being vocal in general about the atrocities committed by Israel against the people of Gaza and Palestinians.The US government is effectively kidnapping people for opposing genocide | Moira DoneganRead moreLet me tell you a little more about myself and all the additional reasons you might want to investigate and perhaps arrest me. I was born inIsraeland became a naturalized US citizen through my American mother. Given the administration’s recent challenges to the 14th amendment, which provides birthright citizenship, you might proceed from detaining legal residents to revoking the rights of naturalized citizens. Like other fascist regimes before you, you’ve been testing how much resistance you face in your effort to turn the United States into a fascist country. You start with the most marginalized, sending incarcerated trans women to men’s prisons, Venezuelans accused of gang affiliation to El Salvador, and detaining Arab and Muslim legal residents. But if the past is any indication, your next target might well be children of undocumented immigrants or naturalized citizens. Of course, as every student of fascism well knows, the ultimate goal is to apprehend all the supposed enemies of this administration, regardless of their legal status.Furthermore, I must confess to using academic concepts that have come under scrutiny as antisemitic by the Department of Justice taskforce for antisemitism. As a former member of the Israel Defense Forces, I have come a long way. It took me many years of soul-searching to realize that I was complicit in a settler-colonial occupation force and that my best recourse to make amends for that was to be outspoken about my country’s atrocities. As I tried to better understand the terrible tragedy of Zionism – a nationalist ideology that sought to free Jews from oppression only to end up as oppressors in Palestine – I confess to describing concepts such as apartheid, settler colonialism, ethno-nationalism and more. Perhaps even more disturbing from your perspective, I recently employed such concepts as genocide, settler colonialism and ethnic cleansing in abook I wroteabout early American history.The similarities between the actions of this administration and what my grandparents have lived through are unmistakableI also confess that in the past I have targeted white supremacist allies of this administration in my community of Chico, California. Clearly employing extralegal militias is part of this administration’s fascist playbook, as Trump already proved during the events of 6 January 2021. For instance, when my house was a target of antisemitic leafleting, I sought the help of a colleague and a local investigative journalist to make this very real form of antisemitism known to authorities. In the processthe journalist uncoveredtroubling information that there is an armed white supremacist in our community who holds deep antisemitic convictions and now knows where I work. Had you really been interested in investigating antisemitism, you might have looked into the whereabouts of that individual. But since you want people like him around so that they can be activated when needed, and since all you really want is to cynically weaponize antisemitism, you might want to arrest me instead. After all, according to your standards, I – a Jew targeted by white supremacists – was all along the biggest threat to Jews in my own community.I have long heard stories about the rise of fascism in Europe from my grandparents, all of whom fled Europe and were refugees from antisemitism. The similarities between the actions of this administration and what my grandparents have lived through are unmistakable. I tell them here so that before you choose to arrest me, you will have one more opportunity to decide whether you will go down in history as aiding and abetting the rise of a fascist regime or as someone who refused to be part of another dark episode in this country’s history. Be forewarned: even if you yourself never directly suffer for your crimes, history will judge you.My dear grandfather, Otto, may his memory be a blessing, escaped Austria by the skin of his teeth when he was only 13 after the Nazi takeover of the country. Having witnessed the horrors of Kristallnacht in November of 1938 – the night when local mobs violently rioted against Jewish homes, synagogues and businesses across much of Germany and Austria and arrested 30,000 citizens just for being Jewish – his parents made the decision to flee to Shanghai, the only port that would accept them. Clearly, our current president’s rhetoric regarding enemies of the American nation from within and without, against immigrants, trans people and people deemed un-American in their political commitments (like myself), are eerily reminiscent of the stories my grandfather told me about the scapegoating of Jews.As I consider the memory of dear grandmother Rachel, may her memory be a blessing, who grew up in Poland and survived theHolocaust, including enduring a harrowing year in Auschwitz and the death march to Germany, I cannot shake the sense of another parallel. As Hitler and the Nazi party were consolidating power, they appointed sycophants like yourself and so many others to positions of power in the Nazi administration. The most important criterion for Hitler was not that the people in positions of power were competent or even knowledgeable, but that they would be spineless and loyal to him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Knowing Hitler’s hatred for Jews, they constantly tried to curry favor by suggesting the most radical and far-reaching policy ideas towards Jews. This dynamic, which Kershaw called“working toward the Führer”, ultimately led Hitler and the people surrounding him to decide on the “Final Solution”, the plan to exterminate all the Jews in the world on an industrial scale in death camps. This idea of working toward the leader is upon us today, as we see institutions and even some in the Democratic party bowing before the great leader and his will. Instead of standing up to the administration at every turn, institutions, businesses and politicians across the country prefer to anticipate the administration’s wrath and eliminate any behavior or materials that might come under scrutiny. Meanwhile, Republicans rush to outdo each other in flattering the great leader, as American society seems frozen with fear in face of the rising tides of fascism.So, Kash Patel, do you want to arrest me and help bring about fascism?Eran Zelnik grew up in Israel and came to the US 15 years ago to complete his PhD in history.

The threat to the global economy remains real.Thu 10 Apr 2025 14.08 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 19.39 EDTShareIt was Donald Trump who blinked first. Never forget that.Chinais unlikely to overlook its importance. A week after launching an all-out global trade war, the US president paused significant parts of it for 90 days. Having insisted that he would stick with therandom tariffshe imposed on most trading nations, Mr Trump suddenly decreed that he would reduce most of them to 10%. It was a major humiliation.Yet 10% is still a significant tariff to bear for nations exporting to the US. This is alsoonly a pauseuntil July, not a withdrawal, so the uncertainty remains. And huge tariffs still remain on China (now hiked to 145%), Canada and Mexico (both25%), as well as on all US imports of steel, aluminium and cars (also 25%). Mr Trump is now substituting a US-world conflict with a US-China one. The two largest economies in the world – which between them have generated around half of global economic growth in the 21st century – are, in effect, no longer doing business with each other.Even so, this was a necessary step back from the cliff edge. It wasenoughto trigger a temporary bounceback on stock markets around the globe, though prices slipped back on Thursday and remain much lower than at the start of April. In the week since Mr Trump’s absurd “liberation day”, more than $6tn dollars of value was wiped from stocks on the S&P 500 index. It is a shameful outcome.Mr Trump claims he made the move because more than 75 nations had been willing to negotiate or “kiss my ass”. This is nonsense. He has got nothing out of the tariff war. He has not won. No one has negotiated. Mr Trump is making his usual efforts to claim yet another triumph. The plain truth is that he backed down because he was forced to.That Mr Trump can retreat is good news, as far as it goes. Overall, however, the past week has been an indictment of the president, his policies, his instincts and his behaviour. The pause should on no account be seen as proof that rational business can be done with him. For one thing, this week’s mayhem may easily kick off again as July nears. The White House has merely given itself more time to make some very big calls.Two things appear pivotal inthe decisionannounced on Wednesday. The first was the overheating of the US bond market, subverting the established assumption that dollar bonds will always be a safe asset, and drawing the Federal Reserve to the threshold of intervention. Asimilar crisisdoomed Liz Truss’s economic strategy in the UK in 2022, but the destructive potential of a US bond crisis is far greater. Mr Trump’s tariffs were threatening all-out recession.The second factor was some limited elite domestic pushback. Anxious senators appeared on Fox News (which the president watches) and pressed the case for dialling down. The head of JPMorgan Chase warned about recession. So did a handful of world leaders and some Trump cabinet members in telephone calls.These realities were a brake on Mr Trump this time. It is possible the trauma has left its mark and there will now be no repeat. But there isno case for confidence, let alone for accepting that this outcome had been schemed all along. Even Mr Trump admitted that Americans were “getting yippy”. They had every right to be. So did the markets, along with the rest of the world. Trust disappeared long ago, replaced now by uncertainty. There is no way that this is over.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His lyric must be ringing in ministers’ ears this week. The UK’s last two blast furnaces – the final embers of a 160-year industrial legacy – may go cold within weeks. British Steel, which is owned by China’s Jingye, hasreportedlycancelled raw material orders while seeking more government cash. The Scunthorpe site, which supplies 95% of Britain’s rail tracks and supports thousands of jobs, is now running on fumes.The UK government has astrategy. A consultation. A council. And £2.5bn – eventually. But this crisis demands more than paralysis by analysis. With a global trade war brewing, this is no time to lose industrial sovereignty. The government ought to take the advice of the business select committee chair,Liam Byrne, and nationalise British Steel – because it offers a clear way forward. Keep the furnaces hot. Buy time. Launch a green steel transition – with public oversight, investment in new technologies and workforce planning.This isn’t about ideology, it’s about economic security. It is about whether Britain wants to retain the ability to make the steel that underpins its national infrastructure. Or whether it prefers to outsource part of its sovereignty in exchange for a cleaner conscience and some polite consultation. The government prefers a “commercial solution” with private investment and public support. Of course it does. Who wouldn’t prefer a solution where someone else pays, invests and takes the risk. But that’s not how it works.British Steel lost money under Jingye’s stewardship, which the parent company covered by loading the UK subsidiary with debt – and charginginterest. A rushed state takeover could force the Treasury to repay British Steel’s £700m loan – a windfall for Jingye as it paid less than a tenth of thatamountfor the company in 2020. That’s privatising the gains and socialising the risk. A better option might be to let British Steel go bankrupt and repay Jingye a reasonable fraction of what it is owed.The potential nationalisation of British Steel isn’t just about saving jobs, though that’s important. If the UK lets its blast furnaces close without replacement, it will be the only G7 country without avirgin steelindustry. That might be a bold step to take, although the government has commissioned areportto tell it whether it needs that capability or not. The fact is that making virgin steel by smelting iron ore is carbon-intensive. Moving to useelectric arc furnaces(EAFs), with lower greenhouse gas emissions, seems imperative.The UK steel industry faces a structural crisis, not just a climate one. Scunthorpe’s1970s-erablast furnaces are obsolete. The global shift to EAFs reflects not just lower emissions but far higher productivity – some US plants match Port Talbot’s output with afifth of the workforce. But EAFs aren’t a direct substitute for blast furnaces – they use scrap to make steel, while blast furnaces produce the virgin iron that EAFs can’t.High-quality steel still needs virgin iron, sourced from either blast furnaces ordirect reduced iron. DRI isn’t widely traded and ismainly produced in Russia, making domestic production strategically vital. The UK also lacks enough “scrap” to scale beyond the UK’s historic 7m tonnes of output. Without investment in DRI and modern EAFs, Britain risks losing competitiveness and industrial sovereignty. A genuine green transition means rethinking steelmaking from the ground up – not simply shutting furnaces.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The associated carbon emissions from maritime and air transport are considerable, particularly given the volume of low-cost, frequently low-durability goods entering developed markets.Restricting free trade to essential imports – goods that cannot be manufactured or grown locally – would materially reduce transport-related emissions. Additional benefits might include enhanced food system resilience, improved biosecurity and increased regulatory autonomy over quality and safety standards.Thus, albeit unintentionally, President Trump’s trade policies could contribute to environmental objectives that are traditionally pursued by other means.Patrick CosgroveChapel Lawn, ShropshireDonald Trump’s tariffs – why the fuss? As an ordinary UK citizen I see only upsides. First, it’s the Americans paying the tariffs, not us. The resulting fall in the price of oil and the value of the dollar should reduce the cost of my petrol. As Americans switch to bourbon and Californian wine, the price of my scotch whisky and French wine should come down. If other countries send more of their goods to the UK to avoid the tariffs, this will force UK producers to become more competitive to the benefit of ordinary people like me.I believe that US citizens rich enough to buy Range Rovers and the like will not balk at paying a bit more, especially as the US equivalents are so clunky. If the steel tariff forces us to nationalise British Steel, good. As for the global economic system, this is structured for the benefit of big corporations and shareholders. Perhaps it is overdue for a change.Christopher WoodageCamberley, SurreyI have long believed that the way we choose to spend our money is a political act. With an overcautiousLabourgovernment in power, spending power remains an important act of resistance. Now more than ever, I urge readers to think carefully about what they purchase and, in particular, to boycott American goods. I have lived happily without an Amazon product for over 15 years, for instance, and with the added pleasure of knowing that my spending in local shops is benefiting the local economy. If we can’t rely on our government to stand firm, let’s do it for ourselves.Prof Mark DoelSheffield“I am telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass,”Trump said during a speechat the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner in Washington on Tuesday evening. Please let the UK not be one of the countries. Surely we have more self-respect than that.Ann ClewerCanterburyLooking at recent events, it seems Donald Trump is the most successful anti-capitalist since Lenin.Keith FlettTottenham, LondonDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

This has been found by both Amnesty International in ourAutomated Racismreport and byStatewatch in its findingson the “murder prediction” tool.For many years, successive governments have invested in data-driven and data-based systems, stating they will increase public safety – yet individual police forces and Home Office evaluations have found no compelling evidence that these systems have had any impact on reducing crime.Feedback loops are created by training these systems using historically discriminatory data, which leads to the same areas being targeted once again. These systems are neither revelatory nor objective. They merely subject already marginalised communities to compounded discrimination. They aren’t predictive at all, they are predictable – and dangerous.Ilyas NagdeeAmnesty International UKThe 2002 movie Minority Report was about a police unit that arrested people before they could commit crimes. Science fiction may be coming true. The unit’s head, played by Tom Cruise, was accused of “future murder” and had to go on the run.

Just when maybe, just maybe, his followers were daring to dream of Masters glory, Augusta National bit back at the 35-year-old.Plusça change.This was box office; the problem being that forMcIlroy himselfand all those desperate to see him sample Masters success, the reasons were all wrong. Nobody could have predicted this stumble, such was his earlier touch. He was four under par and within three of the leaderboard-topping Justin Rose. The finding of water with a chip from behind the 15th green cost McIlroy an ugly, double-bogey seven. It is precisely the kind of number that can fatally undermine a Masters bid.Spanish amateur golfer urinates into creek during opening Masters roundRead moreMcIlroy was to err again, at the penultimate hole. Again, an approach went long. Again, a double bogey ensued. Three holes, four shots back to the course. The grisliest of stuff. A 72 felt like scant reward for so much fine work. That is, however, the nature of this beast. McIlroy has only delivered two sub-70 opening Masters rounds, the last arriving in 2018. He now hopes he can take out understandable frustrations on Friday morning. His response to such a bruising denouement will be fascinating. McIlroy remains a factor in this major, of course, but blows to the guts in Georgia keep on coming. It would hardly improve McIlroy’s mood that his playing partner, Ludvig Åberg, quietly pieced together a 68. Ignore the Swede at your peril; he is the real deal.McIlroy seemed to play perfectly within himself for 14 and a half holes. There were no moments of drama, no cause for panic. The Northern Irishman’s driving was at its imperious best. He missed a decent opportunity on the opening hole but was one under after three. Further birdies arrived at the 8th and 9th, the latter after a wondrous approach. McIlroy collected another shot at the 13th before missing a chance from 8ft at the next. He had a four iron in hand from the middle of the fairway for his second to the 15th. The ball went long and so much good work was partly undone. McIlroy shook his head as his playing partners holed out. He knows, better than anybody, about the impact of numbers such as seven here.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy can only smirk after after chipping into the water on the 15th hole to ruin a very promising round.Photograph: David J Phillip/APThere are of course 54 holes and hard yards still to cover in this, the 89th Masters edition. Azaleas were not the only flower in full bloom on day one. McIlroy and others will have to topple a resurgent Rose, who signed for a 65. Rose has led or co-led the Masters after 18, 36, 54 and 72 holes yet never donned a Green Jacket. The statistical quirk there relates to his playoff defeat to Sergio García in 2017. The intervening Augusta years have delivered a mixed bag for Rose.At a venue where experience is key, Rose is worthy of huge respect. His only blemish came at the last after he was unable to scramble a par. Rose had found trees to the right from the tee. Still, he had cause to reflect on an overwhelmingly positive day at the office. At 44, it is perfectly reasonable to believe Rose can still feature in major conversations. He was three under inside three holes.“Golf is not going to get easier for me in the next five, 10 years, whatever it’s going to be,” he admitted. “So your opportunity is less going forward, so you have to make the most of it.“I enjoy the work still, which is a good sign, right. And I think the other measure I have is if I go and play golf by myself in the evening and still enjoy that experience, I know that I still love the game enough to make the sacrifices that are required to play well at it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The world No 1 and defending champion did not drop a shot. Birdie putts were holed from 60ft on the 4th and 42ft on the 16th. In between, this looked a normal Augusta day for Scheffler. He continues to hide in plain sight. Corey Conners, who has three Masters top-10 finishes, sits alongside Scheffler at four under. Bryson DeChambeau suggested he has finally cracked the Masters code courtesy of a 69.Tyrrell Hatton infamously branded Augusta National “unfair” on a previous visit. His 69 suggested an attitude shift. “I don’t know if I have worked on my patience,” Hatton said with a smile. “I think it just depends what side of the bed I get out of, if I have a little bit or none.“Obviously today was a good day. I drove the ball pretty well, which in years gone by is something that I’ve struggled with. It’s just so hard. You love being here and it’s very special but at any moment you can just hit a shot and it just does your head in. I just need to keep hitting perfect shots.”Poor Nick Dunlap slumped to a 90, including a back nine of 47. Fred Couples rolled back the years – again – with a 71. Patrick Reed branded his performance “piss poor” despite equalling Couples’s perfectly decent score. Ángel Cabrera’s major return, post prison, included 75 shots. This was an afternoon in which the Spanish amateur José Luis Ballester delivered Augusta’s very own watergate scandal. None of this should mask what is already a star-studded leaderboard. By close of play, it suddenly felt unsatisfactory that McIlroy does not feature prominently on it. It is the hope that kills us. And him.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersRory McIlroyJustin RosePGA TourEuropean TourGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, she led them to the finals in Málaga withtwo-high quality victories against Franceon clay. She ended 2024 with five wins and no defeats in the competition.Australia on brink of Billie Jean King Cup exit after defeat to KazakhstanRead moreRaducanu’s absence is even more significant considering recent events. Two weeks ago, the 22-year-old made her first real breakthrough on the WTA tour since her US Open title run by reachingthe quarter-finals of the Miami Open. Her team cited the need to prioritise her fitness as the main reasoning behind her decision to withdraw. The GB captain, Anne Keothavong, said on Thursday that she was empathetic of the decision.“Naturally disappointed,” she said. “But I understand where she’s coming from. She gave a lot to this team last year and was a huge part of the reason why we achieved the success that we did. I’ve got five players here who are highly motivated, who are excited to be here and are well prepped. I really hope Emma will be part of this again in the future.”Keothavong still boasts a solid team picked from the deepest pool of players Great Britain has had in many years. Few are as conscious of the improvement as Keothavong, whose success on the WTA tour ended a grim barren period for British women.“I do feel in a really privileged position that we have the strength and depth,” she said. “Women’s tennis in Britain has come a long way. The flipside of that provides a lot of sleepless nights and headaches for me in trying to make a decision, but you’d much rather have it that way and have a pool of players to choose from and rely on.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others are not so far away. Harriet Dart, who has spent the past few years inside the top 100, sits at No 108. Jodie Burrage, a late replacement for Raducanu, was a top-100 player until significant injury problems sidelined her for much of the year. Olivia Nicholls has established herself as a solid doubles player and is ranked No 31 after an impressive run to the final of Indian Wells. All are present in the Netherlands.Germany, who Britain defeated in Málaga last year, boast three top-100 players in Eva Lys, Tatjana Maria and Laura Siegemund, who is also a top doubles player. Despite that, it was the Netherlands who won the opening round-robin match, with Eva Vedder – ranked 265th in the world – upsetting world No 120 Jule Niemeier in the opening rubber, winning 6-3, 6-1. Suzan Lamens, the host team’s only top-100 singles player, then defeated Maria 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 to secure an unassailable 2-0 lead.The doubles match saw Lamens and Demi Schuurs defeat Siegemund and Anna-Lena Friedsam 7-6 (5), 7-5 to complete a 3-0 victory for the hosts. Boulter and Kartal, if chosen, will enter all of their singles matches as the higher-ranked player, but Thursday’s result suggests that the indoor clay courts will be a great leveller.After the termination of the planned 25-year, multi-billion-dollar Davis Cup agreement between Gerard Piqué’s Kosmos and the International Tennis Federation, and the subsequent separate transformation of theBillie Jean King Cupin line with the men’s competition, this year the ITF has reorganised both competitions.Eight teams will contest the Billie Jean King Cup finals, down from 12 in recent years.

Despite Bergvall’s best efforts, as the 19-year-old covered every blade of grass for the cause in a performance that belied his age, they could not build on Pedro Porro’s improvised back-heeled equaliser asEintracht Frankfurtheld on for a draw that will probably make them favourites to progress to the semi-finals.Yet after all the bitterness of recent weeks, at least this was a positive performance from Tottenham that maintains their manager’s hopes of ending the season with silverware and perhaps keeping his job.Onana’s errors cost Manchester United chance to gain advantage over LyonRead morePostecoglou had bristled beforehand at suggestions that he could be sacked even if Spurs end up winning this competition for the third time in their history. Other than a lapse of concentration at the start that made their task even harder against a Frankfurt side who came to frustrate, only the woodwork denied Tottenham the victory they probably deserved as Micky van de Ven came close to finding a winner in injury time.“I’m resigned to the fact that the football Gods have got their eyes elsewhere this year – they’re obviously busy with other clubs and other managers so whatever we get we’re going to have to do it without them,” said Postecoglou. “If we can perform like that over there then we will give ourselves a good chance.”View image in fullscreenFrankfurt’s Hugo Ekitiké beats Pedro Porro to slot in the opening goal.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThere had not been much optimism to be found at kick-off among a fanbase that has become so used to disappointment in recent years. While Tottenham’s successes in 1972 and 1984 date back to its predecessor the Uefa Cup, Dino Toppmöller’s side also have serious pedigree at this level having triumphed under Oliver Glasner – the Crystal Palace manager who was linked to a potential move across London to replace Postecoglou this week – in 2022.Their vociferous travelling support did not have to wait long for something to celebrate. Much has been made of Tottenham’s injuries at the back this season but with their first-choice defence available again and Rodrigo Bentancur back after suspension, it was all too easy for Frankfurt to cut through in the sixth minute when Ellyes Skhiri won the ball from James Maddison.Ekitiké scored a brilliant hat-trick for France Under 21s against England last month and is expected to attract interest from Arsenal and Liverpool among others in the summer. On this evidence, the 22-year-old former Paris Saint-Germain striker could be a shrewd investment as he cut in from the left flank and shrugged off challenges from Porro and Cristian Romero before shooting into the corner.View image in fullscreenEintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kaua Santos watches as the ball clatters against the crossbar.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMaddison made up for his early discretion by supplying the pass that set up Porro for his equaliser after Spurs had initially struggled to mount a response. The Spaniard’s brilliant back-heel after good work from Dominic Solanke in the buildup finally brought the home fans to life. But Ekitiké could easily have scored his second of the night had he capitalised on a slip from Porro on the stroke of half-time, only to shoot straight at Guglielmo Vicario.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thank goodness for Spurs that Bergvall – 13 years his junior – sprinted back to clear the danger just in time. The Swedish teenager had been by far Tottenham’s most creative player and he was desperately unlucky not to give his side the lead when he let fly from 30 yards out after beating two players with a sublime touch, only for a swerving shot to cannon off the angle of post and crossbar.Quick GuideRoundup: Lazio freeze at Bodø/GlimtShowTwo goals from Ulrik Saltnes [pictured] spurredBodø/Glimtto a 2-0 home victory over Serie A giantsLazioin the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday, with the one-sided encounter played out in freezing conditions.Snow had blanked the artificial pitch overnight in northern Norway, and although it was cleared in time for kick-off, the Italians struggled to adapt to zero-degree conditions, spending much of the match on the defensive. Lazio registered just one shot on target as the hosts attacked time and time again.Aiming to become the first Norwegian team ever to reach a European semi-final, Bodø/Glimt took the lead two minutes after half-time when Saltnes finished at close range following a precise  pass from Ole Didrik Blomberg. The hosts made more opportunities and scored their second goal in the 69th minute.Saltnes was played through and he lofted the ball over Christos Mandas. Although Alessio Romagnoli managed to clear his shot, the ball had already crossed the line. Saltnes came close to scoring a hat-trick in the final minutes but Mandas made a crucial save to keep Lazio in touch before next week's return leg.In the Conference League,Real Betistook a step towards the semi-finals with a 2-0 home win over Polish side Jagiellonia Bialystok. Cédric Bakambu broke the deadlock after running on to Pablo Fornals' pass, with youngster Jesús Rodríguez curling home the hosts' second goal just before half-time.Fiorentina, losing finalists in 2023 and 2024, are on track to face Betis in the final four after earning a 2-1 over Celje in Slovenia. Luca Ranieri struck from a tight angle to put La Viola ahead, with Rolando Mandragora adding a second from the spot before Logan Delaurier-Chaubet scored a penalty for the hosts.Rapid Viennaedged to a 1-0 away win over Djurgården, with Hampus Finndell's own goal the difference in Sweden.

The Frankfurt goalkeeper then did well to keep out Maddison’s effort following a swivel inside the area.Postecoglou prowled his technical area as Tottenham went in search of a winner, although it was a surprise to see him wait until the 79th minute before making a triple substitution. A combination of Mathys Tel and Djed Spence set up Brennan Johnson but his effort was way off target and Postecoglou reacted by burying his head in his hands.

The former Boston, York and Crawley midfielder oversaw aCarabao Cup defeat to Liverpooland a goalless draw at Craven Cottage afterRussell Martin lost his jobin December. The main headline to come out of another sorry club statement this week was theappointment of Adam Lallanaas Rusk’s assistant – the 36-year-old has made 14 Premier League appearances since rejoining the Saints last summer after four years at Brighton. Rusk and Lallana’s primary objective is to pick up the two points that will ensure they avoid Derby’s notorious 11-point nadir, starting with the visit of Aston Villa.Billy MundaySouthampton v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenAdam Lallana at a Southampton training session at St Mary's this week.Photograph: Matt Watson/Southampton FC/Getty Images3Ndiaye faces tough defence at City GroundThe relief in David Moyes’ voice was clear as he spoke about the return of Iliman Ndiaye to his starting lineup last weekend. The Senegal international, who had not started since mid-February because of a knee injury, converted a second-half penaltyto earn Everton a point at Goodison Park. “We’ve missed Ili, we really have,” Moyes said. “He’s one of our major talents in the frontline.” Ndiaye, who spent time with Boreham Wood at youth level and made his professional debut while on loan at seventh-tier Hyde United, has scored in four of the six games he has started under Moyes since the Scot’s return in January. That said, he may find it tough against a Nottingham Forest side who have not conceded at home in the league for almost three months.BMNottingham Forest v Everton, Saturday 3pm4Dunk running out of time at BrightonNext month marks the 15th anniversary of Lewis Dunk’s Brighton debut in a 0-0 draw against MK Dons when they were still in the backwaters of League One. The defender has been instrumental in his boyhood club’s rise up the pyramid, which culminated in him leading them into the Europa League last season. But having lost his place with England after being an unused member of the Euro 2024 squad, the years appear to be catching up with him. Injuries and a loss of form have restricted the 33-year-old to just 19Premier Leaguestarts so far this campaign, compared to more than 30 in all but one of Brighton’s campaigns since they were promoted in 2017. With only one year remaining on Dunk’s contract, PSV Eindhoven’s Olivier Boscagli is among the potential replacements being considered this summer. Dunk is expected to start on Saturday, against a Leicester side who seem to have forgotten how to score a goal, as Brighton try to get their European push back on track.Ed AaronsBrighton v Leicester, Saturday 3pm5Kiwior comes to the fore for Arsenal“We lost maybe our best defender for four months, then Jakub Kiwior comes in and delivers the performances he’s delivering,” enthused Mikel Arteta after Tuesday’s sensational win over Real Madrid. “It’s not a coincidence.” The Poland centre-back has been a bit-part player season and was almost allowed to leave Arsenal last summer amid strong interest from several Italian clubs. But despite a few jitters at the start against Madrid, the 25-year-old, who filled in out of position at left-back last season, showed he is capable of playing at the very highest level with an assured performance against Kylian Mbappé and co. Arsenal are yet to be defeated in the eight games he and William Saliba have started together in central defence, and it will be interesting to see if either is rested againstBrentfordon Saturday with the second leg at the Bernabéu to come in midweek.EAArsenal v Brentford, Saturday 5.30pm6Chelsea to take closer look at DelapLiam Delap has an audition on Sunday: Chelsea are targeting the striker and have a chance to assess him when they host Ipswich Town. They will be wary of the 22-year-old, whose release clause drops to £30m if Ipswich go down, given he has already terrorised them once this season. He was in bulldozing form when Kieran McKenna’s side earned their only home league win of the campaign bybeating Chelsea 2-0 in December, Chelsea were unable to cope with his strength and speed, and Delap, who has scored twice in his last two appearances, will hope to make a similar impact at Stamford Bridge.Jacob Steinbergskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Vítor Pereira faces a selection headache before hosting Ange Postecoglou’s side on Sunday: the reintegration of his star attacker, Matheus Cunha. While the Brazilian’s talent and match-winning ability are undeniable, Wolves have flown during his suspension, stringing together three consecutive league wins for the first time since 2023. In recent matches, they have accrued more points per game without Cunha than with, albeit against teams lower in the table, the current attacking unit finding a rhythm and confidence that Pereira will not want to disrupt. Can he balance the desire to unleash his most potent attacking weapon without upsetting the team’s hard-earned momentum?Yara El-ShabouryWolves v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm8Liverpool seek a relaxing run-inIt is not a question of who will win the Premier League title but how it will be won: at a canter or with Liverpool testing the anxiety levels of their supporters once again? The answer should become clearer following West Ham’s visit. A catalogue of individual errors resulted in the end of Liverpool’s 26-game unbeaten league run at Fulham last weekend and left Arne Slot’s team still needing 11 points to secure the club’s 20th league championship, although the total will be fewer should Arsenal drop any more points. West Ham, Leicester and Tottenham, Liverpool’s next three opponents, present the more straightforward route to victory than trying to get over the line against Chelsea, Arsenal, Brighton andCrystal Palacein the final four games of the season. Anfield could be an apprehensive place on Sunday and will be looking to the team’s experienced leaders to get the job almost done.Andy HunterLiverpool v West Ham, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenCody Gakpo and Curtis Jones in Liverpool training this week.Photograph: Nikki Dyer/LFC/Getty Images9Howe’s success a reminder for RatcliffeIt is fair to say that throwing Eddie Howe’s name into the hat as a potential successor to Erik ten Hag did not endear Dan Ashworth to Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Manchester United’s owner was reportedly underwhelmed, telling his then-sporting director that he wanted someone with more charisma. Ultimately, Ratcliffe recruited Ruben Amorim and Howe stayed put at Newcastle but Ashworth, who has now moved on from Old Trafford, remains a highly regarded judge of coaching character and capability. During an earlier executive stint at Newcastle, Ashworth did not always see eye-to-eye with Howe, yet fully appreciated his tactical acumen and capacity to improve players. Comparisons are often invidious but was Amorim really a better appointment? Although only time will tell, Sunday’s clash of the two Uniteds on Tyneside may offer Ratcliffe pause for thought. Not to mention a reminder that assumptions can be dangerous.Louise TaylorNewcastle v Manchester United, Sunday 4.30pm10Scott ready to give Cherries fresh impetusThe consistent brilliance of exciting young talents like Illia Zabarnyi, Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen has been the mainstay of Bournemouth’s success this season. But Andoni Iraola’s side are running out of steam and it might be time to inject fresh impetus. They are winless in their last six league games, their longest such run since February last year, and have dropped seven points from winning positions in their last four matches, which is as many as they dropped in their first 27 this season. Enter Alex Scott. Having arrived with a stellar Championship reputation, Scott’s progress has been frustratingly punctured by a meniscus tear which kept him out for four months. He is fit now, though, and offers versatility in central midfield, capable of deep playmaking and driving forward. With Ryan Christie sidelined owing to a groin injury for Monday’s match against Fulham, the 21-year-old’s dynamic edge could reignite Bournemouth’s spark.YE-SBournemouth vFulham, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3142732Arsenal3130623Nottm Forest3114574Chelsea3117535Newcastle3013536Man City3117527Aston Villa310518Fulham315489Brighton3124710AFC Bournemouth31114511Crystal Palace3044312Brentford3144213Man Utd31-43814Tottenham Hotspur31133715Everton31-53516West Ham31-173517Wolverhampton31-163218Ipswich31-342019Leicester31-451720Southampton31-5110Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolArsenalNottingham ForestChelseaManchester CityNewcastle UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Humphries defeatedLuke Littlerin his semi-final, after the world champion overcame a stunning nine-darter from Gerwyn Price in his opener.The million-pound dart: PDC doubles prize money for world championshipRead morePrice has proved to be Littler’s bogey player, winning their last six games, but Littler eased into a 5-1 lead in their quarter-final. Price thrilled the crowd with the fourth nine-darter of this season’s Premier League, checking out 141 with a treble 19, treble 20 and double 12 to claim his set of 18-carat gold darts – but Littler won 6-3.That set up a semi-final against world No 1 Humphries, who thrashed Stephen Bunting 6-1 with an average of 118.43, the third-highest in Premier League history. Littler missed double 10 three times to blow the opening leg as Humphries took a 2-0 lead.Littler almost hit a nine-darter of his own in the third leg, missing badly on double 12, and went 3-2 up before another costly error opened the door for his rival to advance to the final, winning 6-3 despite a lower average than Littler (93.80 to 96.63).On the other side of the draw, Aspinall saw off Rob Cross 6-2 in his opening match before winning by the same scoreline against Michael van Gerwen, who was still feeling the effects of a bizarre shoulder injury he gave himself when trying on shirts last week.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler and Gerwyn Price congratulate each other after Littler’s win and Price’s nine-darter.Photograph: Matt McNulty/Getty ImagesCome the final, Humphries raced into a 3-0 lead but Aspinall reeled off the next five before a ragged end to the contest. “The Asp” began the 10th leg with six perfect darts, but then missed five match doubles – and watched in agony as Humphries almost took out 170 to level the game again.Aspinall finally nailed double four to win the night in front of an adoring home crowd. “I had a feeling I was going to make the final a couple of days ago,” Aspinall said. “To come out on top is an amazing feeling.“I’ve never felt that nervous at the end. It was the most nervous six or seven darts I’ve ever thrown. I just wanted to win so much for this crowd, the support they’ve given me the last few years has been amazing and they came out in their thousands to support me, I wanted to win for them.“Luckily he missed a 170 and I won,” the 33-year-old added. “It was the perfect final for me to win wasn’t it? It wasn’t comfortable. I went 3-0 down and I came back to win 6-4. That’s my career isn’t it?”Littler stays top of the standings with 28 points after 10 rounds, five points clear of Humphries, while the win lifts Aspinall into the top four, level with Price on 15 points.Explore more on these topicsDartsLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

Things seem to be continuously going in an unstable direction. I’ve got to be honest, we are getting to a point now where our actions are having little impact with those guys.”Reid’s resignation follows only a day after the chair of Motorsport UK, David Richards, published an open letter expressing a growing number of people had legitimate concerns that: “The governance and constitutional organisation of the FIA is becoming ever more opaque and concentrating power in the hands of the president alone”. He added damningly: “We cannot allow a shift of the moral compass of our leadership to simply dismiss any request for transparency and open discourse.”Shortly after Reid’s resignation, the former FIA chief executive Natalie Robyn, who was reportedly forced to step down in May 2024 after disagreements with Ben Sulayem, referred to Reid’s decision as indicating that the FIA had “serious ongoing structural challenges”.“When professional processes are not adhered to and stakeholders are excluded from decision-making, it undermines the foundation of a strong organisation,” she told the BBC. “I am saddened to see these developments, as they threaten both the credibility and the long-term effectiveness of an important institution.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Russell, in the paddock in Bahrain, has questioned why the FIA is so unstable.Photograph: Paddocker/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe pointed and sustained criticism puts Ben Sulayem under pressure as his first term as president is set to conclude in December, when he will face re-election. As things stand he remains unopposed.His time in charge at the FIA has been marked by discord and controversy. Drivers have been repeatedly angered by the FIA’s adherence to the letter of the rules, including clampdowns on wearing jewelleryand swearing, both understood to have come directly from the president and to changes regarding their public behaviour including speaking out on issues not relating to the sport.His attitude towards women has been called into question due to sexist comments made on his former website, which the FIA said were historic and did not “reflect his current beliefs”. Under his watch the FIA is now being sued by Susie Wolff, the director of the all-female series the F1 Academy, after the body launched a conflict of interest enquiry into Wolff and her husband Toto, the team principal of Mercedes, which was then dropped after only two days.He has angered F1’s owner by making remarks about the value of the sport and been accused of interfering in grands prix by a whistleblower, claims which were subsequently dismissed after an investigation by the FIA’s own ethics committee. The officer in charge of the investigation, Paolo Basarri, was subsequently sacked.Reid is the latest in a long line of senior personnel to have left since Ben Sulayem took over. When Robyn left it followed the resignations of single-seater technical director, Tim Goss, the sporting director Steve Nielsen and Deborah Mayer, the president of the FIA’s Women in Motorsport Commission.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can no longer, in good faith, remain part of a system that does not reflect those values.”The FIA issued a response to Reid’s resignation. “The FIA is grateful for Robert Reid’s contribution to the FIA and to motor sport more widely,” it read. “The FIA has exceptionally robust corporate governance policies which guide our operations and ensure our rules, practices and processes are adhered to.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Given the way England operate these days, taming the 7th hole at Minehead may have impressed Brendon McCullum more. It isMastersweek, after all.Either way, Banton is on the rise, his cross-format form glowing and culminating in that epic at home to Worcestershire. Having never before faced 200 balls in a first-class match, the 26-year-old stitched together 403 at the crease, slotting 56 fours and two sixes, and marching past Graeme Smith (311), Jimmy Cook (313no), Viv Richards (322) and Justin Langer (315 and 342) to sit top of the leaderboard at Taunton.“I’m not sure I will ever have a week like it,” says Banton, on the team bus en route to Hove for round two against Sussex on Friday. “I joked with our captain, Lewis Gregory, the day before saying: ‘I don’t understand how people can bat for so long.’ But something kind of clicked and I just kept reminding myself to keep going, to not throw it away.ECB set to retain control over domestic TV rights in Hundred trade-off dealRead more“When I was on 329, Alfie Ogborne ran out and told me about [Langer’s] record. There were three overs to go in the day. I thought: ‘Right, I’m going for it.’ To hear the crowd cheer was just a ‘wow’ moment and I was pretty emotional in the dressing room afterwards. There were a few tears and the boys were absolutely buzzing.”The albatross probably comes second, hearing this, but even that shot – reward for risk and aggression that had him haring around the links like a maniac – underlines the sweet spot Banton finds himself in. Over the past 12 months, he has made five centuries in all formats, averaging 50 at a strike rate of 98. The catalyst – ditching the side-arm ball-thrower that has become ubiquitous in modern coaching – is fascinating.“I picked it up from watching Harry Brook,” he says. “I saw him just having standard throwdowns out of the hand a while back and I decided to go with that. I now do small drills that get me into a good headspace and I have stuck with it. The sidearm, for me, just feels too different to a bowler, the point of release and the angle. I would walk out of nets in a worse place than I went in. Bad habits were creeping in.“I also used to get so worried about getting out in red-ball cricket, how it looked, but now I’m trying to emulate how I feel in T20; to make the formats as close as possible when I am out there. You’re probably going to get out whatever happens so for me it’s trying to put pressure back on the ball and scoring as quickly as possible.”View image in fullscreenTom Banton’s 371 for Somerset against Worcestershire was a club record.Photograph: Harry Trump/Getty ImagesTalk of Brook,England’s new white-ball captain, and the desire to put pressure back on bowlers brings us inevitably on to international cricket. Banton ended the winter in the setup – an unused reserve during the Champions Trophy after one outing in India – and on current form looks a good bet to break back into the white‑ball XIs at least. Given McCullum’s general approach, a first Test cap could very much be in the offing.The question that follows is where? England’s established Test middle order of Joe Root, Brook and Ben Stokes means any possible vacancies are likely to appear higher up. Banton says he would naturally take any opportunity but is enjoying life at No 5. “I have tried opening forSomerset,” he says. “It did not go well.” Thoughts of Dan Lawrence’s tortured stab at opening last summer spring to mind here.But then, by his own admission, Banton is a different beast to his younger self. Having drawn early comparisons with Kevin Pietersen because of their height and dominance down the ground, and winning the first of 21 white-ball caps in late 2019, he did not quite put up the numbers and has since admitted to briefly falling out of love with the sport.It all came a bit too quickly, with Banton beamed up to franchise cricket, in parallel with England, before he truly knew his own game. As well as that notable tweak in training, his revival this past year has been down to re-embracing theCounty Championshipand a club that have spent 134 years trying to win their first title.“I would love to play Test cricket but there are a lot of great players pushing their case,” he says. “I do not want to get ahead of myself, I just want to keep doing well for Somerset. Winning our first County Championship, that is the main goal for me.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Coming after such a huge score in the opening round – but also what was an agonising draw, with Worcestershire nine down – the question is asked whether Banton would have swapped that triple century for a win.“I want to win,” he says, without a pause. “Coming back into the changing room after, having not won, everyone was pretty broken to be honest. It was a tough one to take but we have to forget about it and focus on what is ahead.“The triple century was amazing. I don’t think it will probably ever sink in or feel real, to be honest. I never believed it would be possible. It is crazy what you can do if you put your mind to something and it’s quite weird when it actually happens.”Having learned a few things about himself this past week – and got the albatross off his back on the links at Minehead – a season of possibilities has opened up for Banton.Explore more on these topicsSomersetCricketCounty ChampionshipinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Of the 400m tonnes of plastic produced over the course of 2022, just under 38m tonnes (9.5%) was produced from recycled plastic, 98% of the remaining 362m tonnes was produced from fossil fuels, predominantly coal and oil.The research,published in Communications Earth & Environment, shows a significant increase in the amount of plastic being disposed of by incineration rather than recycling, with just 27.9% of plastic waste disposed of in 2022 actually being recycled.Graphic of plastic waste generated by country, and methods of disposalWhile China is the biggest producer and consumer of plastic, Americans consume the most plastic per head, the equivalent of 216kg per person a year. The US produces 40.1 megatonnes (Mt) of plastic waste – most of it from plastic packaging.The 28 countries of the EU and Japan also register high per capita plastic consumption, at 86.6kg and 129kg respectively.Globally, landfill remains the main destination of plastic waste, accounting for 103.37 Mt or 40%.Attempts continue to agree a global plastic waste treaty to tackle the environmental and public health scourge of plastic waste.Talks in Busan, South Korea,ended in failurelast December after fossil fuel producing nations, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, resisted attempts to include production caps in the treaty.More than 100 countries supported a draft text that included legally binding global reductions in plastic production and the phasing out of certain chemicals and single-use plastic products.Talks are due to resume in Geneva in August.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsWasteRecyclingManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Polling suggests several councils are likely to end up in no overall control on 1 May.TheConservativesand Reform have ruled out making a pact at national level, despite pressure from some MPs to unite the right.But Badenoch said it was up to local councils to “make the choice about what is right for their councils” as long as they “stick to Conservative principles”.In response, the Labour party chair, Ellie Reeves, said: “Now it’s crystal clear: if you vote Reform or Conservative, you’re opening the door to more of the Tory chaos that held our country back over the past 14 years.”Daisy Cooper, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said “you couldn’t put a cigarette paper between Badenoch and Farage when it comes to their policies” and that “the Conservatives and Reform have merged in all but name under her leadership”.Badenoch admitted on Thursday that the elections would be “challenging” after the party’s “historic defeat” nationally last summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those whose symptoms have eased or who have already used private healthcare to undergo surgery, for example, will also be removed.Hospitals will receive an “incentive payment” for each patient they remove, and a payment cap of 5% of a trust’s waiting list is being scrapped, according to documents seen by the Guardian. It means there is no limit to the payments NHS trusts could receive for taking patients off their lists.NHS analysis suggests about 300,000 people on the waiting list do not require elective care or treatment.The strategy is likely to raise concerns among patient charities that some people may be wrongly removed. NHS sources said patients would not be removed until they had spoken to a member of the hospital team and a clinician had reviewed their case. Any patient removed would receive a letter and their GP be notified.The overall waiting list comprised an estimated 7.40m treatments relating to 6.24 million patients at the end of February – down from 7.43m treatments and 6.25 million patients at the end of January, figures showed.Of patients urgently referred for suspected cancer, 80.2% were diagnosed or had it ruled out within 28 days in February. This was up from 73.4% the previous month and was the highest since the target was introduced in April 2021.However, the proportion of patients who waited no longer than 62 days from an urgent suspected cancer referral, or consultant upgrade, to their first definitive treatment for cancer was 67.0%, down slightly from 67.3%. The government and NHSEnglandhave set a target of March 2026 to get this figure up to 75%.Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive ofCancerResearch UK, said: “Although progress is being made to diagnose patients sooner, today’s data shows that people still face unacceptable delays to access vital cancer care in England.”Pat Price, an oncologist and the chair of Radiotherapy UK, said patients continued to suffer “the devastating – and avoidable – consequences of delayed or denied access to life-saving treatment”.In emergency departments, 75% of patients were seen within four hours last month, up from 73.4% in February. However, the number waiting at least four hours from the decision to admit to admission rose slightly, to 133,957 in March, up from 131,237 in February.Dr Tim Cooksley, the immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said of 12-hour waits that the significant rise in the number of patients experiencingcorridor carein hospitals was a national scandal.“The figure is up 8.8% on last year at 46,766 and we must hit home the reality of the fact these patients will be vulnerable, often older people, who are facing the dangers and indignity of this degrading situation.”Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the national medical director at NHS England, said the figures showed “signs of genuine progress across a range of services”. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said “we are starting to see a real difference” but warned that fixing the health service was a long road.Explore more on these topicsNHSEnglandHospitalsA&EHealth policyHealthCancernewsShareReuse this content"

Together, a group of unions plan to launch a campaign warning that online populists and far-right organisations are distorting the truth about immigration and race.“People with far-right views are becoming more brazen in what they do on social media, and I’ve witnessed it with my own union around disciplinary cases and the rhetoric of some of our own members,” Wright said.“On social media, some of our members and sometimes our reps have openly made comments which are racist and bigoted. In my time in the fire service, that has gone up. You’d like to think we’re getting better, and we’re not.“So we have been talking to other unions and they have seen exactly the same problems. We are pushing for new policies within our union which will recognise that this is happening and address issues of racism and bigotry within the union. We also want the TUC to address this too.”At the FBU’s annual conference in Blackpool next month, Wright will launch a statement calling for unions to counter far-right organisations and warn that they are distorting the truth about immigration and race.He blamed social media and the rise of far right and populist movements for emboldening some union members with anti-immigrant views to make racist comments online.“It feels like an itch that we’ve got to scratch,” he said. “I think it’s born out of last year’s riots, because our members are representative of society. We have seen the rise of Trump and the politics of Farage and it is hugely damaging. But it has resonated with some of our members.”The FBU, usually regarded as one of Labour’s most leftwing affiliated unions, barred a former member of its governing body in November for allegedly making racist posts online.An X account using the name of the former official reposted and expressed approval for tweets by Britain First, its leader, Paul Golding, and the far-right activist Tommy Robinson. The account reposted a post saying “vile Muslim scum” were “infecting” Britain.In another post it said: “Thankfully most of us don’t have to endure this nonsense,” in response to a post by Golding that referred to the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, turning on lights to mark Ramadan and which included the far-right conspiracy theory “the great replacement” as a hashtag.Incidents of racism and misogyny at the London fire service were exposed more than two years ago by an inquiry into the culture of the UK’s largest rescue organisation.In one incident logged in a report, a black firefighter had a noose put over his locker and in another, a Muslim colleague had bacon and sausages stuffed in his pockets and a terrorist hotline sign posted on his locker.Wright, 42, who has been a firefighter since he was 18, was elected general secretary in January, deposing Matt Wrack, who was attempting to win a fifth term.He warned that the union could strike if there were any attempts to cut frontline services after comments from ministers claiming that departments will be expected to make cuts. “The government cannot cut public services any more. Our members would move to industrial action if there are any more cuts right to the frontline service,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrade unionsSocial mediaFirefightersThe far rightOnline abusenewsShareReuse this content"

The union says the removal of the WRCO role means pay cuts of thousands for those affected and that it was “the first step in a broader campaign of attacks against pay and terms and conditions” for bin workers.Rayner, who is also the communities secretary, said she wanted to see “a fair resolution to this” and added: “I would urge Unite to suspend the action and accept the improved deal.” She said the council had “moved significantly to meet the demands of the workers so we can see an end to this dispute”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Indeed, there is another ballot happening by close of play on Monday. Unite backs these workers 100%.”She added: “Rather than vilifying their low-paid employees, the council should look seriously at the KC-approved offer that Unite has put forward, which deals with the issues and gives these workers and their families dignity and security.“A notable point was made by one of our members, which Unite believes sums up where we are with this council and could be with others: ‘The council are saying that we should share the pain but not one councillor, including the leader of the council, has been asked to give up a quarter of their pay. We thought whenLabourcame in they would stop what was happening, we were wrong.’”Graham said there was only a partial deal on pay protection for a few, which still leaves workers worrying about how they are going to pay their mortgages and rent payments in a few months’ time. “For the drivers, they are still unaware what their drop in pay will be but the council have mooted that this could also be around £8,000,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBirminghamIndustrial actionUniteTrade unionsAngela RaynerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

British TV executives are now hoping it can bring some of that lustre across the Atlantic in a deal to bring the show to the UK for the first time.After numerous failed attempts to recreate the late-night comedy format that has proved so successful in the US,Skyhas announced it is making a British version of the show to premiere next year. Crucially, the show’s original creator and champion, Lorne Michaels, will be an executive producer.Saturday Night Live: Jack Black returns for a stellar episodeRead moreThe broadcaster is already promising a “star-studded lineup of hosts”, adding that it will be filmed in London. It is also promising to stay true to the US show’s “live, fast-paced style” – which has included comedy sketches, a roster of comic presenters and musical guests – with a cast list of “the funniest British comedians around”.It will no doubt be a draw for leading comedians in the UK, as the US original has launched the careers of comedy royalty including Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell and Mike Myers.Sky’s chief content officer, Cécile Frot-Coutaz, said: “For over 50 years Saturday Night Live has held a unique position in TV and in our collective culture, reflecting and creating the global conversation all under the masterful comedic guidance of Lorne Michaels. The show has discovered and nurtured countless comedy and musical talents over the years and we are thrilled to be partnering with Lorne and the SNL team to bring an all-British version of the show.”The move is also a gamble by Sky, given the number of previous attempts to recreate a live, late-night comedy show concentrating on topical issues. While the UK has had a number of hit comedy panel shows, such as Have I Got News for You, the live sketch-style programme has not endured in the same way.In the 1980s, Saturday Live was launched and similarly featured rising and established talent, including Ben Elton, Harry Enfield, Stephen Fry, Tracey Ullman, Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall. It was moved to Friday nights for its third series before being cancelled. It was briefly revived in 1996, hosted by Lee Hurst.Channel 4 launched Saturday Zoo in the early 1990s, featuring comedy and celebrity interviews. It ran for just 13 episodes. Channel 4’s The 11 O’Clock Show also worked with up-and-coming comedians and boosted the careers of Ricky Gervais, Sacha Baron Cohen and Jimmy Carr.Brian Logan, the Guardian’s comedy critic, said there was a “strange alchemy” in the early successes of SNL in the US that had made it self-sustaining. “They’re quite different comedy cultures,” he said. “It’s not just SNL that has been tried here, but also late-night talkshows and comedy shows.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So there is clearly something going on whereby these things don’t always transfer. But if the SNL team are involved in this one, it stands a better chance than some.”Others in the TV industry say the format’s mixed success in the UK comes down to money. In the US, the show’s backers are able to pay and retain top comedy talent. But shows in the UK, made on far lower budgets, often lose their star performers to more lucrative ventures.Explore more on these topicsSaturday Night LiveSkyTelevision industryTV comedyUS television industryUS televisionComedynewsShareReuse this content"

In the meantime his cousin offered to show him around Huddersfield town centre, including a new supermarket that sells Asian and Arabic food, and the market.“He was trying to make a friend, because he didn’t have friends here. I said to him, you have to go out into the town centre to know [where everything is], to know where you can go shopping … plus, you’re going to make friends,” said his uncle who asked to remain anonymous.He had spent Ramadan and Eid with his uncle’s family, laughing and joking with his younger cousins. Photos taken at the time show a happy, smiling boy surrounded by loved ones.“He’d only spent a few days with my kids but they loved him so much because he was a very nice boy, very lovely and kindly with the kids. He played with them and gave them a lot of time,” he said, adding that he had still not had the courage to tell his children, who are all under 10, that Ahmad had died. They had been writing letters to him in hospital.His uncle, who is Ahmad’s father’s brother, said he had been upset to see false and malicious rumours being spread online that his nephew was a drug dealer. “He was only 16,” he said tearfully. “He was a good boy. He went from a nice family [in Syria] to a nice family [in the UK].“We’ve been eight years here – we’ve not had trouble, not had a problem. We go from work to home, school, that’s it,” said his uncle, who works in a factory having rebuilt his life after fleeing the war in Syria.“And that’s what Ahmad did as well,” he said, adding that Ahmad had left behind his father, who works as a taxi driver, his mother, and three sisters in his home town of Homs.Ahmad was loved by his schoolmates and teachers back home and had achieved the top maths grades in his class. He loved school, the uncle said, “that’s why he came here. He wished to be a doctor, to save people.”The teenager had been living in a refugee centre in Swansea where he was well liked, his uncle said, from his arrival in the UK in October last year until 20 March, when he moved to Huddersfield.The staff at the centre and Ahmad’s social worker had contacted the uncle saying they were heartbroken Ahmad had been killed. “They were crying for Ahmad, they said they loved him.”He said staff had previously told him how they had “never seen him happy like this” when they called at Eid.His family had been left feeling frightened, afraid of knocks on the door. “I’ve been [in Huddersfield] eight years. I thought it was a safe place. I didn’t worry before, like now.”However, he praised the community for rallying round for a child they had never met, raising money and leaving flowers at the scene.A fundraising page to help pay for Ahmad’s body to be repatriated to Syria has raised more than £10,000. It was set up by Maneer Siddique, who owns a tailoring business in the town.Like many who have donated and offered other support, he said he did not know Ahmad or his family. Siddique said: “You would want help if you were in a dire situation, so why shouldn’t you help somebody else in a dire situation?”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He claims his relationships with the women were consensual and that there was no violence or coercive control involved.His lawyers further claim that the allegations for personal injury are barred as they relate to a period between 2013 and 2015 and are subject to a three-year limitation period.It is claimed that emails, texts and other potential evidence in his defence will have been lost.The claims by the four women have been filed at the high court where a preliminary hearing is scheduled for 15 April. Three of the women involved had reported Tate to Hertfordshire police in 2019 but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring criminal charges.According to the claims, two of the women worked for Tate’s webcam business in 2015 and the other two were in relationships with him in 2013 and 2014.One of the women who allegedly had a relationship with Tate in 2013 said she told him she did not want to rush into full sexual intercourse but that he raped her at his flat after a training session before a kickboxing fight.He is alleged to have told her: “I’m just debating whether to rape you or not.”According to the claim, she “did not believe what she was hearing and asked him if he was joking”. Tate’s “face turned angry, and he proceeded to put one hand around her neck and, with the other, tried to remove her underwear”, it is claimed.The claim goes on: “The … claimant was saying ‘no Andrew, you said you wouldn’t’ and “no, no, no”. His grip was tight but at that point it was not so tight that she could not speak.“His response was to tell the … claimant to ‘shut the fuck up’. When she was quiet, he told her she was a ‘good girl’,and the … claimant thought if she was quiet he would partially release the stranglehold on her neck.”Tate is alleged to have then raped the woman and to have repeatedly asked her: “Who do you belong to?”In Tate’s filed defence, he claims the sexual intercourse was consensual and that the woman went on to visit him “on a number of occasions thereafter”. The defence adds: “They had sex several times. This is not the behaviour of someone in fear.”All four women claim to have developed long-term mental health problems as a result of their alleged experiences.Tate is under criminal investigation in three countries, including in Romania where he and his brother, Tristan, are accused ofhuman trafficking, trafficking of minors and money laundering. He also faces allegations of rape.Bedfordshire police are seeking to arrest the Tate brothers in relation to allegations of rape and trafficking dating back to between 2012 and 2015. The two men, who deny all accusations against them, are believed to currently be in Dubai.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

But data from the Resolution Foundation on Wednesday revealed worryingly low uptake of heat pumps. Last year,installation of gas boilers outnumbered heat pump installations by 15:1, according to the Resolution Foundation report, and only one in eight new homes were equipped with the low-carbon option, despite the government’s clean energy targets.According to government data, 62,031 vouchers have been issued to households in England and WAles to install heat pumps under the boiler upgrade grant scheme since it began in April 2022, suggesting the government is way off its target. The scheme provides grants of £7,500 to householders who switch from gas boilers to heat pumps.The grants are specific to heat pumps and do not apply to other forms of low-carbon heating. A cross-party group of MPs has called for subsidies to bespread to other low-carbon technologies, including heat batteries.Miatta Fahnbulleh, the minister for energy consumers, visited a home with energy from a heat battery last month and met two leading British suppliers of the batteries, Sunamp and Tepeo.Heat batteries, or zero-emission boilers, can be installed in homes that have central heating radiators, and it is hoped they could be used in the 20% of domestic properties where heat pumps are not suitable. They are not eligible for the £7,500 grant in the boiler upgrade scheme or for VAT exemption, which heat pumps get.Johan du Plessis, the founder and chief executive of Tepeo, said: “Heat batteries offer a practical, flexible and cost-effective solution, particularly for homes where heat pumps may not be viable. We welcome the minister’s engagement and look forward to working with the government to ensure that all homes have access to clean, affordable heating by extending the boiler upgrade scheme and VAT relief to heat batteries as part of the warm homes plan.”Heat batteries are about the size of a washing machine. The boiler is filled with iron ore and takes in electricity to heat the ore and blow air across it. The air then heats the plumbing pipes running through and the ore stays hot for days, which allows the boiler to function as a heat battery, dispensing hot water when it is needed.A computer programme tells the boiler to take in electricity when it is cheap and green, and also takes account of the weather and household heating demand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He was sentenced in October afterbeing found guilty of violating Russia’s “foreign agent” law.Vinatier, who works for a Swiss conflict-mediation NGO, was arrested last summer as tensions withFranceand other western countries soared over Ukraine.According to a message from his family to AFP, Vinatier’s lawyer informed them that he was transferred from Moscow to Tula – about 120 miles (190km) south of the capital – to a transit penal colony.He is to spend 15 days of quarantine in the prison. His family do not know where he will be transferred after that. Prisoner transfers in Russia’s huge penitentiary system can take weeks.Vinatier, who speaks Russian, is a veteran researcher on Russia and post-Soviet countries.As he lost his appeal in February, he said in court that his work always tried to “present Russia’s interests in international relations”.France has demanded Vinatier’s release, condemning the sentence as “arbitrary”.

A representative for Way hadpreviously calledthe case “nonsense”.According to the 36-year-old woman, who filed her complaint anonymously, Way regularly raped her and beat her and sometimes kept her as a prisoner. During her three-day testimony, the woman said when she started working for Way, she weighed approximately 150lbs pounds, Courthouse Newsreports.“I was about 86lbs when I managed to get away from him,” she said, adding: “I didn’t even feel human any more. I felt like an animal.”The woman also testified that while she worked for Way, she did not have a car and her phone “went missing” along with her driver’s license. At one point, she said Way told her: “Bitch, I have your license.”The woman testified that despite Way’s mistreatment of her, at one point the two fell in love and were in something like a consensual relationship, Courthouse News reports. According to text messages shown in court which the outlet reviewed, both the woman and Way expressed love for each other at certain times.Other times, Way would apologize to the woman and say: “Babe come back let’s talk seriously” and “Are u ok … I’m sorry I love u please call.” One text message from the woman read: “You think you can keep hitting on me you are crazy.”After the three-week-long trial, Way was also found liable on claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, sexual harassment and nonpayment of wages. He was cleared on claims of false imprisonment and constructive discharge, Courthouse News reports.In astatementreported by USA Today, the woman’s attorney, Ron Zambrano, said: “We’re happy our client was vindicated and the jury believed her claims of physical and sexual assault … We’re looking forward to moving on to the punitive damages phase of the case.”Meanwhile, Way’s attorney, Rickey Ivie, said that the woman made up her story and was instead motivated by greed. “She wanted to be paid … which is what this case is all about because it’s not about the truth,” Ivie said.Explore more on these topicsSoulja BoyUS crimeHip-hopCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The male individual, who lived at least 10,000 years ago, had a strong jaw and very large, powerful molars.“From a tooth or a small bone fragment, there’s the mystery of their appearance,” said Prof Enrico Cappellini, of the University of Copenhagen, a co-senior author on the paper. A Denisovanjaw discovered in Tibethad begun to fill in this picture, and the latest discovery adds to the evidence of a prominent jaw with huge teeth.“Now we have a richer image,” Cappellini said. “Of course it would be good to have a skull and the rest of the skeleton, but it’s a step forward.”The fossil has been dated to one of two glacial periods when the channel is known to have been above sea level, either between 10,000 and 70,000 years ago or between 130,000 and 190,000 years ago.View image in fullscreenAn artist’s impression of a Denisovan male.Photograph: Cheng-Han SunThe scientists were not able to obtain DNA from the sample but managed to extract proteins, which could be sequenced and used to place the fossil confidently on the Denisovan branch of the evolutionary tree.The discovery reveals an impressive geographic range for the ancient species, which lived at the same time as – and interbred with – modern humans and Neanderthals.The first Denisovan fossils, identified through analysis of ancient DNA, came from a cave in Siberia and comprised just a finger fragment and a few teeth. Since then, further discoveries show Denisovans also weathered the incredibly harsh conditions of the high-altitude Tibetan plateau, where temperatures can plunge to -30C. By contrast, in south-east Asia they would have lived alongside water buffaloes in a balmy climate.“These are climate and environmental conditions that are quite different,” Cappellini said. “The cold environment in Siberia, high altitude in Tibet. We cannot infer anything of their cognitive abilities … but they had an ability to adapt to environments that are quite diverse.”View image in fullscreenThe fossil was discovered in the Penghu Channel off Taiwan.Photograph: Chun-Hsiang ChangProf Chris Stringer, a leader in human origins research at the Natural History Museum in London, who was not involved in the latest research, said the latest discovery alsostrengthened the casethat Denisovans belong to a group calledHomo longi, or dragon man, a complete skull of which was unearthed in Harbin in north-east China.“It’s now apparent that the Denisovans must have had a wider environmental range than the Neanderthals, from cold, open environments in northern Asia to subtropical woodlands in south-east Asia,” he said. “A question for the future will be whether we end up callingHomo longiDenisovan or we end up calling DenisovansHomo longi.”The findings are published in the journalScience.Explore more on these topicsScienceAnthropologyPalaeontologynewsShareReuse this content"

He was determined to stay ahead of the demand surge he saw coming and eager to help his clients begin to rebuild their lives.The firm broke ground in the Pacific Palisades on Saturday – one of the first companies to do so.But by that time, Singer had a new crisis to contend with: tariffs.Singer, whose firm is currently working on 10 homes in the Palisades, is in talks with clients to place shipping containers on their burned lots and store construction materials there, allowing him to order and stockpile materials in bulk before tariff price increases hit the market.“I’m definitely nervous,” he said.The Trump administration announced, walked back, and continually modified tariff policies in recent weeks, throwing the global stock market into chaos. The tariffs are widely expected to substantially increase construction costs inCaliforniaand across the country.Singer is already dealing with tariff-related price hikes. One of his tile vendors placed a tariff surcharge on an order on 2 April, the same day the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs, even though the materials had already been imported. Singer is especially worried about materials like plumbing, tiles and fixtures, which are often imported from China, and he is advising clients to factor in a 10% contingency to their budgets in anticipation of the costs.“If you don’t spend it, great,” he said, “but at least mentally prepare.”Three months after the worst wildfires in Los Angeles’s recent history flattened miles of city blocks and killed 30 people, signs of life are emerging. Insurance payouts have begun arriving. Contractors have plastered streets in Altadena and the Palisades with flyers and signs advertising their services. The Army Corps of Engineers is slowly clearing and flattening lots, replacing the charred and toxic mess of cars, washing machines and chimneys with the blank canvases of empty lots.View image in fullscreenBarbara Shay (left), owner of Little Red Hen Coffee Shop, and her daughter, Annisa Faquir, in front of the ruins of their business after it was destroyed by the Eaton fire, in Altadena, California, on 28 March 2025.Photograph: Jae C Hong/APBut homeowners, contractors, architects and developers across fire-ravaged Los Angeles are girding themselves for the tariffs. For homeowners seeking to rebuild, the tariffs add a new layer of stress to the uncertainties of navigating insurance, mortgages, short-term housing and piecing together plans for the future.The Trump administration is currently levying a 10% tariff on most countries, a 25% tariff on steel, aluminum and cars and car parts, and a massive 125% tariff on Chinese goods. The administration on Wednesday retreated on further planned global hikes after news of the tariffs prompted trillions in stock market losses worldwide, but Angelenos remain uncertain about what this means for their homes and plans.In Altadena, a middle-class neighborhood with fewer resources than the wealthy Palisades, the strain is especially acute. Homeowners worry tariffs will hinder their ability to afford rebuilding and exacerbate already widespread issues with underinsurance.“It’s really scary,” said Ken Yapkowitz, a longtime Altadena resident who lost his home and two rental income properties in the Eaton fire.Yapkowitz is waiting to see what his final insurance payouts will be and starting to map out how to rebuild his properties. He had already been factoring in a 25% bump in materials costs before the tariffs were announced, he said, and figured there would be a surge in demand for materials and labor. He expects tariffs to add substantial costs, and wonders if he will be able to rebuild on his lots as planned.Jose Flores, owner of JV Builders & Development, a small business in Pasadena, said many of his Altadena clients want to rebuild. But he worries that tariffs, paired with a painfully slow permitting process and other skyrocketing costs, will cause them to change their minds. He has three clients in the process of drawing up plans with architects, but many others have called him for estimates only to disappear.“By the time people are ready to start construction, I believe the prices are going to be higher,” he said. Flores has noticed the prices of lumber, copper and roofing tick up in recent months. But he can’t afford to stockpile materials, he said, and has no place to store them even if he could. He has no choice but to wait and see what happens.“I think that’s the case for most of us contractors in the area,” Flores said.Following the tariffs’ announcement, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, asked his administration to pursue independent trade relationships with other countries and to explore ways to protect access to construction materials in the wake of theCalifornia wildfires. But he did not specify what measures the state could deploy to do that.Flores, the contractor, said he doubted that the governor’s office could actually rein in prices.Newsom’s office did not respond to a request for comment.‘We just don’t know right now’Some residents and business owners are already seeing the tariffs affect wildfire response. Brett Taylor, an Altadena resident who owns a local window and door supplier and who lost his home in the Eaton fire, said his suppliers mostly manufacture domestically, but that many of them source parts from abroad. In late March, he reached out to approximately 10 window vendors to ask whether they would be open to providing package discounts to fire victims. Almost all of them said yes.But before the deals could be finalized, the administration announced tariffs. At least one of Taylor’s vendors walked back their commitment, citing price uncertainty, and Taylor anticipates others will do the same in coming days.View image in fullscreenChris Larson surveys the ruins of his business, the Rancho Bar, destroyed by the Eaton fire, in Altadena on 9 January 2025.Photograph: Zoe Meyers/AFP/Getty ImagesOthers are tapping personal connections and devising makeshift plans to try to defray costs. James Peddie, an Altadena realtor who lost his home, has been helping develop plans for a group of homeowners hoping to rebuild collectively. He knows from his years in construction that a substantial portion of southern California’s lumber is imported from Canada, and when tariffs were announced, he understood that meant increased costs.Peddie went to high school in Montana, and has friends in the lumber industry there. He also knows a builder who personally went to Oregon to source lumber when prices soared during the rebuilding of Paradise, California, after the devastating 2018 Camp fire.So he called up his high school friends with a question: can you help me source lumber for LA?They were eager to help. They promised to keep their commissions low and to keep him updated on price fluctuations. “They’re people I can trust,” he said. “We can probably get the lumber for a really good deal.”This shift – from purchasing overseas to domestically – is exactly what the administration hopes the tariffs will prompt.But with the rebuilding process still in its earliest phases, and plans and permits far from finalized and approved, it felt premature to put a deposit down and commit to the lumber, Peddie said. Doing so would mean needing to find and pay for long-term storage, as well as betting that the cost of lumber was only going to increase.“Where is it going to be stored? Is it going to be more expensive to ship it in?” he said. “We just don’t know right now.”He estimated it would be seven months before he would be ready to order. It’s anyone’s guess what the tariff landscape – and market – would look like by then.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsCalifornia wildfiresUS politicsCaliforniaWest CoastLos AngelesTariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They owed large sums to Swedish and Danish tax authorities. They have since set up a business inGuatemala.The story behind their disappearance and the abandoned human waste was revealed this week after an investigation by the newspapers Politiken and Dagens Nyheter. It also found that the couple had allowed wastewater to run into the forest and alleged that animals had died as a result of being left outside and that others were abandoned.Couple who ran Swedish eco-retreat fled leaving behind barrels of human wasteRead moreHansen and Helbæk’s actions were described by local authorities as “environmental crime”. However, on Thursday, the couple claimed they were acting lawfully.Commenting on the barrels left behind from their compost toilets, they said in a post on social media: “For people in ruralSwedenit’s a very normal thing.”They added: “It’s also a very important part of the permaculture principles that you deal with your own shit.”View image in fullscreenThe barrels of human waste left behind.Photograph: www.dn.seThe property’s new owner is aware of the barrels and they can be used for compost, they said. “Half of them are ready to use this spring, the other half is ready in 1 year, following the guidelines of Swedish law.”But Daniel Helsing, the head of building and environment at the local authority, Hylte council, said the couple did not follow the necessary requirements for composting waste.“There are a number of requirements that you have to follow and they have not,” he said. “Normal practice, if you do not have a water closet solution, is that you have a collecting service for your barrels that the local authorities in basically every county in Sweden provide. That would be the most common solution to handling toilet waste if you are not using water closets.”It is possible to compost toilet waste but it has to be done according to local authority instructions, he said. “You would have to report that you are going to compost toilet waste and that gives us as the local authority a chance to set out rules and guidelines for how to do it.”The Swedish Tourist Association said it was unfamiliar with the methods used at Stedsans. A spokesperson said: “I have never heard anything like that.”Hansen and Helbæk accused the journalists behind the investigation of lying and of causing “our life’s biggest (literal!) shitstorm”.They added: “The article claims that we have been damaging the local environment with our procedures at our permaculture resort and that we have left animals to die. All these claims and several others are false.”Accusing the local authorities of being cowards, Hansen and Helbæk said that Hylte council was aware of their toilets. They had, the couple said, shown the toilets and procedures to authority representatives “several times”. “Either the municipality lies, or they have not done the work we have paid them to do, which is to make sure that all rules are followed.”Hylte council said they had not been paid to deal with waste and that they were assessing whether it would be reported to police.Hansen and Helbæk said their company had gone bankrupt and that they had tax debt inDenmarkthat had “multiplied tenfold” because of interest and fees over a decade. To prevent the debt from growing, they said, they would have to pay Danish tax authorities – which they accused of being “cold-hearted” and “narcissistic” – more than 50,000 DKK a month (£5,800), which they suggest they are unable to.Hansen previously said they owed the Swedish tax agency “over 7m” SEK (more than £550,000).Among the reasons they fled to Guatemala, they said, was “to give our family a second chance”. Describing it as their birthright, they added: “If you see us as villains for making this choice, we are sorry.”Explore more on these topicsSwedenDenmarkEuropeGuatemalanewsShareReuse this content"

Four other activists were also arrested near the embassy on suspicion of criminal damage and conspiracy to cause criminal damage.View image in fullscreenGreenpeace activists pouring 300 litres of blood-red dye into the US embassy pond in London.Photograph: Greenpeace/PAAccording to the campaign group, 12 activists tipped non-toxic, biodegradable dye from containers emblazoned with the words Stop Arming Israel into the pond in Nine Elms, south-west London. The containers were delivered to the embassy on bicycles with trailers disguised as delivery bikes.Areeba Hamid, the co-executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: “These arrests are further proof that the right to protest is under attack in the UK. This protest used biodegradable pond dye that is designed to disperse and wash away naturally.“We took this action because US weapons continue to fuel an indiscriminate war that’s seen bombs dropped on schools and hospitals, entire neighbourhoods blasted to rubble, and tens of thousands of Palestinian lives obliterated. As the biggest supplier of weapons to the Israeli military, the US government bears a heavy responsibility for the horrors unfolding in Gaza.”Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, in which it has killed more than 50,000 people, was in response to Hamas’s 7 October attack, in which more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and a further 250 taken hostage.Greenpeace UK is campaigning for the UK and US governments to announce a total arms embargo on Israel.A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “Five people have so far been arrested nearby on suspicion of criminal damage and conspiracy to cause criminal damage.

But the same court convicted him of backing LeT to provide material support to a plot to commit murder in Denmark.Rana was sentenced to 14 years for his involvement in a conspiracy to attack the offices of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper, which had published cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad.In February, Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes the megacity Mumbai, said that “finally, the long wait is over and justice will be done”.Explore more on these topicsMumbai terror attacksIndiaCanadaPakistanAmericasMumbaiSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Leitch began his career as a stuntman for stars such as Brad Pitt before transitioning to making stunt-heavy films like John Wick. He and stuntman turned stunt coordinator Chris O’Hara of Stunts Unlimited made presentations to the Academy advocating for the addition of a new award.“Stunts are essential to every genre of film and rooted deep in our industry’s history –from the groundbreaking work of early pioneers like Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin, to the inspiring artistry of today’s stunt designers, coordinators, performers and choreographers,” Leitch said in a statement to Variety.“This has been a long journey for so many of us. Chris O’Hara and I have spent years working to bring this moment to life, standing on the shoulders of the stunt professionals who’ve fought tirelessly for recognition over the decades. We are incredibly grateful. Thank you, Academy.”Stunt performers have called for their own category for decades, but stunt coordinators – those who plan and choreograph stunts – is a relatively new profession.View image in fullscreenA stunt crew films a scene for Spider-Man 3 in midtown Manhattan in 2006.Photograph: Bobby Bank/WireImageChad Stahelski, who directed John Wick 4 and did stunts for Keanu Reeves in The Matrix, said there is still work to be done.“The idea of giving an Academy Award for stunt design is awesome – don’t get me wrong,” he said. “Now I would like to know who’s going to decide who gets it, and who actually gets the award? It’s not like it was 100 years ago when there was one person designing it. It’s a collaborative effort.”“Stunts is such a collaborative and complicated department. How are we going to determine who this goes to? We’ve spent 100 years getting the award; let’s just make sure it goes to the right people,” he added.Some actors have also called for their stunt doubles to be recognised at the Oscars. Last yearactor Chris Hemsworth told IGNhe was “shocked it’s even still a conversation”, calling stunt performers “the unsung heroes”.Jason Statham has called it the Oscars’ “overlooked category”, scorning “poncy actors” who were eligible for awards for “standing in front of a fucking green screen screwing his face up pretending like he’s doing the stunt … It’s a total injustice. [Stunt performers] are the ones getting busy.”Category rules around eligibility and voting for the stunt design award will be announced in 2027.The Academy’s production and technology branch has more than 100 stunt performers among its ranks.The Oscars are late to recognising excellence in stunts: the Emmys have awards for stunt coordination and stunt performance, while the Screen Actors Guild awards recognise stunt ensembles in TV and film.The Oscars also recently added a prize for achievement in casting, starting with films released in 2025.Associated Press contributed to this reportThis article’s headline was changed on 11 April 2025 to reflect the year the first award will be given at the Oscars, rather than the first year for eligible films.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

But, ahead of a new show, the ‘future of portraiture’ reveals how he originally wanted to be a tennis playerThu 10 Apr 2025 09.41 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 11.16 EDTShareNot every artist who skyrockets to fame makes it all the way into space. But that was the case for Amoako Boafo who, three years after his big break, painted three panels on the top of Jeff Bezos’s rocket ship. “I’ll be honest, I just did it for the experience,” says the Ghanaian artist, whose triptych blasted off in August 2021 and returned (intact) after an 11-minute round trip. If the opportunity should arise, would he ever be interested in taking a tour himself? “No, I like it here,” he replies, tapping the ground with his green Dior trainers.Boafo’s artistic breakthrough came when his effervescent portraits celebrating Black life caught the eye of Kehinde Wiley on Instagram in 2018. Wiley, the African American artist best-known for painting Barack Obama, tipped off his galleries, and before long Boafo’s canvases, which he began exhibiting in hotel lobbies back home in Accra, were appearing at international art fairs and fetching up to seven figures at auction. A spring/summer collection in collaboration with Dior designer Kim Jones followed in 2021, and in 2022 he was picked up by mega-dealer Larry Gagosian, who has referred to him as “the future of portraiture”. His first solo UK show has just opened at Gagosian’s largest London outpost.View image in fullscreen‘This exhibition is a gentle reminder of what I want to do when I step away’ … Amoako Boafo.Photograph: Gus Sarkodee“For me, this exhibition is a gentle reminder of what I want to do when I step away,” says Boafo in the gallery, over the whirr of nearby construction work. The opening is three days away when we speak, and yet it’s still very much a work-in-progress, with paintings leaning against the walls and the courtyard of Boafo’s childhood home mid-recreation next door. Returning our gaze are the artist’s friends and family, as well as five of Boafo’s self-portraits – pedalling on an exercise bike, lounging in bed, embracing his young son. These are more self-portraits than he’s ever included in a single show. “I want to remind myself that I don’t always have to be out there, rushing around.”Born in 1984, Boafo grew up in Accra. His father was a fisher, and his mother cooked and cleaned. From a young age, he found art to be a respite: “Whenever I would sit and draw, I wouldn’t think about anything else; it was as if there were no problems.” He was as nifty with a racket as he was with a pencil, and believing that he might have a better shot at earning a living as a tennis player, he threw himself into the sport while studying art on the side. “I managed to convince myself that I was going to make money from tennis and that when I retired I could paint,” he says. But after four years at the Ghanatta College ofArtand Design he found he enjoyed painting more. I ask him if he still plays tennis, and he inches up the hem of his trousers to reveal a pair of Nike socks. “I don’t see anyone who’s 40 years old in this world beating me.”In 2014, Boafo moved with his partner to Vienna, where he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts. “At first I had all this space and time, and I didn’t know what do with it,” he says, comparing it with the more supervised teaching he was used to at home. Surrounded by white faces, he decided to focus solely on Black subjects. Poised between figuration and abstraction, his expressive portraits are at once rooted in tradition and wholly contemporary, borrowing from Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele as much as Toyin Ojih Odutola and Amy Sherald. What sets them apart is the technique that has become synonymous with his name: modelling the skin of his sitters with his fingertips.0View image in fullscreen‘It’s not like I paint one way and then have a different character’ … Amidst Tulips by Amoako Boafo, 2025.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates Ltd/© Amoako Boafo, Courtesy Gagosian“I mean, it’s not as beautiful as painting with a brush, but it allows me to be more playful,” he says, as we stand up and stroll around the room. “With fingerpainting you have no control, and I like the challenge. You can’t go over it – if you do, it’s kaput.” Up close the effect is mesmerising: ripples of bright blue and brown appear to pulse, blood-like, along his sitters’ limbs, lending them a sense of vitality that’s hard to shake. The poses are static, but contained within the smears and swirls of a single hand – even an ear – is a rhythmic movement, a fizzing energy.Some backdrops are plain, others patterned with the same wrapping-paper designs that appear on the sitters’ clothes. At first, Boafo used African fabrics, but the majority here came from Vienna. “I love fashion,” he says, in case I couldn’t tell from the cream-coloured baseball cap (also Dior), “and after a while I realised I could just make my own prints and dress someone the way I want them to look or according to how I feel and what I want to say.” Unusually for Boafo, he isn’t wearing anything patterned today, but his green overshirt and trainers echo the zingy palette of a large self-portrait featuring lush potted plants. “I like to look like my paintings,” he says. “It’s not like I paint one way and then have a different character. The way I live is the way I paint.”By now, the drilling has stopped, so we head next door to see how his childhood courtyard is coming along. Soon it will be hung with paintings, but at present it’s bare, an abstracted artefact made from charred wood – a nod to the fire on which Boafo’s mother cooked their meals growing up. Located at the heart of most traditional residences in Accra, the courtyard is a communal space where family and friends come together. “For me, it’s a space of knowledge and learning,” says Boafo, “a space where you get to see how people live.” Like his paintings, it’s a celebration of community.View image in fullscreenVitality that’s hard to shake … Shoulder Stand by Amoako Boafo, 2023.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates Ltd/© Amoako Boafo, Courtesy GagosianThe courtyard has been recreated by architect and designer Glenn DeRoché, who worked with Boafo on dot.ateliers | Ogbojo, the writers’ and curators’ residency programme he established on the edge of Accra in 2024. As the appreciation for African art continues to grow in the west, Boafo believes that what’s needed is more education back home. “There’s a lot of talent, but we still depend on the west to collect and to maintain it,” he says. “I think there should be more education on collecting, because once we have home-based collectors, careers can be more sustainable.”More residencies are cropping up, among them one Boafo and DeRoche are working on specifically for sculptors. Boafo also has plans for an art club – “a proper creative space where you come and just be inspired” – as well as a tennis academy and a football academy. But first, DeRoché needs to finish the court he’s building for Boafo, who wants to play more tennis. “I’m not stopping painting – I can’t,” he says. “I paint when I’m on holiday, I paint when I’m sick.Paintingis part of me.”Is he feeling the pressure that comes with being the so-called future of portraiture? He says it’s inevitable, but that to be in the position he’s in is a dream come true.“So, yeah, I will complain about the stress, but I can take it, I’m good.”Amoako Boafo: I Do Not Come to You by Chance is at Gagosian Grosvenor Hill, London, until 24 MayExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtinterviewsShareReuse this content"

However, Thursday’s measure comes as a significant blow to western studios, with Bloomberg reporting shares of Walt Disney Co, Paramount Global, and Warner Bros Discovery Inc all suffering an immediate decline.Last week, the newly releasedA Minecraft Moviefrom Warner Bros topped the Chinese box office with ticket sales of $14.5m – around 10% of the global total. In 2024, the highest-grossing US film released in China was Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which took $132m in that territory, towards a global total of $572m.The first US film was approved for Chinese release 31 years ago, with the number peaking at more than 60 in 2018. Since then it has declined, according to data from the Chinese ticketing service Maoyan Entertainment, thanks to escalating tensions and the increased popularity of homegrown movies.Animated fantasy filmNe Zha 2, about a child battling monsters from Chinese mythology, was released in late January and has now taken $1.8bn in China, and $20m in the US.Its huge domestic success made it the highest-grossing film both of 2025 so far and in a singlebox office territory, as well as the highest-grossing animated film in history and the first animated film in history to cross $2bn globally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

PicturesMoviesReviewSinners review – Ryan Coogler’s deep-south gonzo horror down at the crossroadsMichael B Jordan plays a double role in Coogler’s intriguing period tale of anti-heroic brothers making their way into much wilder countryPeter BradshawThu 10 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 11.31 EDTShareRyan Coogler is the film-maker and hit-maker who started in social realism with his debutFruitvale Station, became the Wakandan emperor of super heroism withBlack Pantherand put some punch back into the Rocky franchise withCreed. Now he dials up the machismo and the craziness with this gonzo horror-thriller mashup, a spectacular if more-than-faintly hubristic movie appropriately named Sinners – though there are one or two saints dotted around – set in the prewar deep south.It’s a freaky tale of supernatural evil and the blues that indirectly takes its inspiration from the legend ofMississippi bluesman Robert Johnsonselling his soul to the devil at a remote crossroads in return for fame and fortune. And it’s also, in its forthright way, a riff on the idea of blues as a kind of music that is avidly consumed by its producers’ enemies. As Delroy Lindo’s character says: “White folks like the blues just fine; just not the people who make it.”R&B singer-songwriter Miles Caton makes his acting debut as Sammie, a preternaturally gifted teen blues guitarist and singer who is also, in the immortal words sung by Dusty Springfield, the son of a preacher man. Sammie is the cousin to two twin scoundrels and sharp-dressing dandies, Elijah and Elias Smoke, both played with some presence by Michael B Jordan. These two have been mixed up in gang warfare in Chicago where they were apparently been working for Al Capone and are now returned to their home turf with a ton of money which they hope to invest in their own juke joint, with young Sammie bringing in the crowds with his amazing music. But then one of the twins’ ex-lovers shows up – Mary, played byHailee Steinfeld– who is admitted to the joint on sufferance, along with a sinister country singer called Remmick, gurningly played by Jack O’Connell, with a fondness for Irish tunes. And as night falls, the forces of darkness and the undead close in and that juke joint finds itself under siege until the sun comes back up.In some ways, this is a black version of Robert Rodriguez’s 90s head-trip From Dusk Till Dawn, scripted by Quentin Tarantino, with George Clooney and Tarantino as the two brothers holed up in a grisly saloon down Mexico way, under threat from satanic bandits. Tarantino and Rodriguez responded to the premise with irony and anarchy, but that isn’t exactly how Coogler plays this film tonally. For the first half, it is pretty much a realistic period adventure in which the twins’ outlaw anti-heroism functions in a believable world. They are the bad guys, and yet we can’t help but notice the good in them, or least the understandable survival instinct – and then the real demons show up, which makes these real-world issues irrelevant.For many, the movie could as well do without the supernatural element, and I admit I’m one of them; I’d prefer to see a real story with real jeopardy work itself out. But there is energy and comic-book brashness – and a notable real-world cameo in the post-credits sting.Sinners is out on 17 April in Australia, and 18 April in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersHorror filmsPeriod and historical filmsRyan CooglerMichael B JordanBluesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The question has increased in frequency and urgency over the past month, asmore and more people got hookedon weekly episodes that simulate the adrenaline cascade that is emergency medicine, one hour at a time. Friends, acquaintances, strangers at the coffee shop – everyone was watching The Pitt. Or, more accurately, reliving it, because to watch The Pitt is to be absorbed by The Pitt. Such is the nature of binging, but also the show’s design: a long season – 15 episodes, or nearly twice the length of a standard streaming drama, with the finale released tonight – plus a single episodic conceit, self-contained set, mixture of long and short story arcs, and archetypical characters with tight, shrewdly deployed backstories.The Pitt review – real-time medical drama puts Noah Wyle back in ERRead moreIn other words, it’s a good procedural, in the lane of some of the best network television; a medical drama with a charismatic lead is not breaking the wheel. In fact, by starring Noah Wyle as Dr Michael “Robby”Robinavitch, a haunted yet persistently cool and competent attending physician, it specifically invokes ER, the grandaddy of all medical dramas. (As well as a copyright dispute: though they share executive producers, Warner Bros would like you to know thatThe Pitt isnotan ER spinoff.)And yet the Pitt feels fresh – simple, sleek, competently made and relevant to a country whose healthcare system is notoriously inequitable and actively under attack from the administration. A mix of quick adrenaline hits and longer, nuanced story arcs, of formal gimmicks (like 24, each episode covers roughly an hour in real time) and tried and true staples (Patrick Ball’s hot doctor with an attitude, cases that are always more complicated than they initially seem). A symphony of stress that does not relent has a deft handle on the basics of camerawork, pacing, set and tone down. Good, compelling television shouldn’t be a rarity in the streaming age, and yet …This is the type of show that streaming companies should have mastered long ago but have struggled to produce, opting instead for experiments in theme and structure, such as the recent Netflix hit Adolescence, or cheaply made, disposable fluff. The Pitt still has some of the flourishes and freedom of the streaming model – nudity, swearing, flexible runtimes, the ability to show graphic detail of, say, a degloved foot (?!) or post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (and those are two of the less traumatic injuries). But it is, at its core, a show of old-school TV rhythm and blues. That it took so long to arrive is a testament to the fact that even procedural television is an art form that cannot be cracked by business logic alone, and that doing a simple formula well still requires some special sauce.For The Pitt, that’s in part its grittiness, so at odds with the prevailing logic for 2010s medical dramas like Grey’s Anatomy – that familiar glossy sheen, intra-hospital entanglements and operatic drama, usually accompanied by swelling music and long, steady shots. The Pit, as Robby calls this financially neglected and strained segment of a larger hospital, is a chaotic place. The overflowing waiting room constantly simmers with crises about to boil over. The hallways are cluttered with overflow beds, the fluorescent lighting harsh, the doctors sweaty, peaked, raccoon-eyed.The tight choreography of cacophony, roving shots of an ever-evolving environment, mirrors the real strain of an emergency room better than most medical dramas; The Pitt hasdrawn the attention of real healthcare professionalsfor its unusual accuracy (having fielded my physician mother’s many critiques of Grey’s Anatomy and House over the years, that’s no small feat). Though it is a capital-d Drama that still ludicrously pushes the limits of how much topical crisis a single ER unit can face in a single shift, The Pitt is primarily attuned to process, the type of mundane procedure other dramas would skip over for time. If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to follow the camera down the throat for intubation or how to transfer a patient to an ECMO machine, well, now you know.But The Pitt’s greatest strength is its propulsive sense of immediacy, its emphasis on the now on both a formal and thematic level. Containing the first season to a single shift in real time inherently precludes the possibility for much character development or transformation, and forces some obvious breaks from reason – why does the hospital’s chief business administrator need to return to the floor several times over one day? (Answer: exposition and a polite layer of “healthcare is a business” complication.) But it magnetically conveys one of the show’s central points: healthcare is a job, done by real, fallible humans enduring a constant ebb and flow of stress. The at times gimmicky conceit adds an extra dimension to viewership, experiencing critical minutes along with the characters, stressing for the same duration of time.View image in fullscreenNoah Wyle in The Pitt.Photograph: Max/Warrick PageThe Pitt is by no means a perfect show – the acting occasionally underwhelming, the dialogue obvious, the level of action bordering on absurd. It surpasses the believable number of hot-button crises that present in a single ER in a single day. Still, the fact that it weaves in about every conceivable knot of health and social issue – inherent racial bias in not recognizing sickle cell crisis, fat-shaming dressed up as medical advice, language barriers, state abortion restrictions – meets a national moment of overlapping crises, particularly in healthcare. The most recent episodes have pivoted from (spoiler alert) mass shooting to a measles outbreak, at a time when theprominently anti-vax health and human services secretaryis supposed to manage a measles crisis in Texas that has alreadykilled two children.In The Pitt, at least, every staff member has good intentions and a big heart, even if the demands of the job require stoicism in the face of unimaginable trauma. It’s a type of fantasy based in reality – the vast majority of healthcare professionals are sincerely invested in patient health, sometimes to the detriment of theirs – though of course reality is always more complicated. The show borders on 15-hour agitprop for healthcare as a practice; you wouldn’t think you’d need a television shown to advocate for science-based healthcare as a concept, but we’re in the age of Covid truthers.Whether for cope or catharsis, it’s working. I’m watching The Pitt, along with thousands of others joining the train as it builds momentum each week (take note, Netflix). Max has already renewed the show for a second season, said to take place over the Fourth of July – a harrowing prospect, if an exciting one, proving once again why some classics never go out of style.Explore more on these topicsMedical dramaUS televisionDramaTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After an$8.5bn attempt by Tapestry– the American group that owns Coach and Kate Spade – to acquire Capri was blocked last year by the US Federal Trade Commission, Capri has been under pressure to sell off Versace to reduce its debt. According to those close to the deal, Prada was one of the earliest bidders.In a statement confirming the news, Prada’s group chair and executive director Patrizio Bertelli said the group was “ready and well positioned to write a new page in Versace’s history”. Bertelli added that both companies “share a strong commitment to creativity, craftsmanship and heritage”.While Capri failed to create an American luxury group to rival fashion companies such as LVMH and Kering, the acquisition hints at an attempt by Prada to strengthen its position as an Italian powerhouse. Versace will join the fashion brands Prada and Miu Miu, the footwear brands Church’s, Car Shoe and Luna Rossa, the America’s Cup sailing team Luna Rossa and the pastry brand Marchesi.It is not the first endeavour by Prada to add to its portfolio. In 1999, it acquired Jil Sander and Helmut Lang and, in 2000, it added Alaia to its lineup. However, by 2007, after a series of disputes and financial challenges, it had parted ways with all three brands. Now, the Versace acquisition offers them another opportunity to intensify the global reach of the Made inItalygroup.While the luxury fashion market has been facing a significant slowdown, the Prada Group has enjoyed rare success. It reported revenues of €5.4bn in 2024, 17% higher than the previous year. This increase was partly driven by Miu Miu – the brand behind those viral micro-miniskirts and satin ballet shoes – which has almost doubled its profits this year, hitting close to £1bn in sales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, Versace will take up the role of chief brand ambassador, overseeing the house’s red-carpet dressing and philanthropic work.Prada and Versace are often pitted against each other as Italian fashion rivals, but their designs are diametrically opposed. Versace champions the traditional tropes of femininity with unabashed enthusiasm – see high hemlines, high heels, big hair. Miuccia Prada, who holds a doctorate in political science and, prior to joining the family business in 1970 was a Communist, is often referred to as “fashion’s intellectual”. She has previously described her work as ugly clothes in hideous fabrics.However, the two women have a perhaps unlikely friendship.Speaking to The Telegraph in 2012, Versace said: “We just talk, talk, talk. She’s so inspiring. We make fun of each other and teach each other. She says, ‘I could never make sexy clothes, but I love them.’ And I say, ‘Well, I love what you do’.”Explore more on these topicsPradaVersaceItalyFashion industryEuropeMergers and acquisitionsRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Vows. Champagne. Dancing. But, recently, one crucial element is becoming harder to predict: the dress. Instead of choosing traditional white, many brides are opting for something with a bit more of an impact. The anti-trad bridal dress is on the rise. Searches on Pinterest are up 240% for “unique wedding dresses”, while blush pink wedding dresses are up 60% and black 50%.On Wednesday, the fashion designer Ashish Gupta, whose dazzling sequined pieces are loved by fans including Beyoncé and Rihanna, launched his firstbridal range. Instead of trad white gowns, you’ll find a sheer trapeze-shaped dress adorned with delicate hand-embroidered organza flowers in yellow and lilac that look as if they have been plucked from Martha Stewart’s cutting garden, and a halterneck mini-dress smothered in multicoloured glass bead fringing, inspired by Holi, the Hindu festival of colour. Even the customary veil has been reimagined. Ashish’s “confetti” version features shimmering, multicoloured sequins and beads.Gupta describes his typical bridal customer as non-traditional: “She doesn’t care much for rules and possibly has no idea what ‘something blue’ is supposed to be. She’s fun, a bit irreverent, and loves colour and sparkle. It’s less fairytale, but more magic.”The wedding dress retailer David’s Bridal has also got the colour memo. This week, it launched a collaboration with Marchesa, the New York womenswear brand co-founded by Georgina Chapman. The designer has been working to reposition her brand as a red carpet staple, following her divorce from the disgraced Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein. Featuring more than 40 dresses, the collaboration’s colour chart spans everything from zesty limes and hot crimsons to grey and charcoal. A style oftulle gown embellished with black petal embroiderythat Chapman wore to accompany her boyfriend, the actor Adrien Brody, to this year’s Golden Globes will also be available to buy for brides to be.David’s Bridal CEO, Kelly Cook, speaking to the Wall Street Journal, said the collection was inspired by brides increasingly searching for unique dresses. “They’re wearing cowboy boots with couture.”Kate Halfpenny, whose Halfpenny London bridalwear brand is celebrating 20 years, has also seen a shift towards more distinctive styles. Among her made-to-order customers, blush has become a favourite while she has also dressed several brides in black-and-white separates.View image in fullscreenHot hot pink… Harriet Hall in her wedding dress.Photograph: Lisa Jane Photography/lisajanephotoWhen Harriet Hall, features director of Cosmopolitan UK, got married in 2020, she did so in a hot pink tulle dress by the British designer Molly Goddard. Five years later and she has no regrets describing it as her “favourite dress in the world.” Hall says she chose the “electric pink Brillo pad” style as she wanted something fun. But it was also a push back against patriarchal traditions.Writing in British Vogue,Hall describedit as not a wedding gown but a showstopper. “It was a dress so in-your-face that it rejected any suggestion of the virginal purity, wifely subservience or impassivity that white dresses can come to symbolise. Yes, it was pink, but I’m not talking blush, peach, candy, nor the problematic ‘nude’. No, this was a hue so electric the frock appeared to emit its own glow, a colour Elsa Schiaparelli referred to in the 1940s as ‘shocking pink’; so loud it was subversive.”Goddard’s mostrecent collectionfeatured a range of colourful millefeuille-esque dresses spanning everything from azure blue to apricot. While not being bridal specific, they would work for any bride with a similar brief.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As TikTok’sliterary fans recently pointed out, a photo showing Margot Robbie on the set of Emerald Fennell’s forthcoming film Wuthering Heights in a white wedding dress is historically incorrect. The book is set in the Georgian era, a time where red, pink, blue and black wedding dresses were standard. It was only in 1840 when Queen Victoria married Prince Albert that white wedding gowns became the norm.Elizabeth Taylor wore a canary yellow dress for her nuptials in 1964. Sarah Jessica Parker got married in a black dress in 1997, as did Chloë Sevigny in 2020. In India and China, it’s red that is the tradition. Gupta says that even a white dress doesn’t have “to take itself so seriously”, pointing to a mini slip dress enveloped in sequins. “I don’t think one has to follow the rulebook any more,” he says. “It’s more important to be fabulous and have fun on your big day.”To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletternewslettersShareReuse this content"

It’s a major cultural moment that marks the end of the harvest season, and some key customs include everyone cleaning their home to prepare for the festivities (and to clear away bad luck!), the lighting of oil lamps and, of course, food. That can take the form of special sweets, celebratory treats such askavum(cakes made with coconut oil),kiri-bath(milk rice),kokis(a crisp fried dough), and everyday favourites such as today’s two dishes.Egg curry (pictured top)This hearty vegetarian dish is a hug in a bowl, and is especially welcome on gloomy days. Serve with steamed rice or shop-bought parathas.Prep10 minCook30 minServes2-46 eggsSalt and black pepperAbout 250ml coconut oil, for deep-frying, plus 2-3 tbsp extra for the onions1 tsp cumin seeds¼ tsp dill seeds1 sprig curry leaves, picked2 small green chillies, finely chopped1 onion, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped3cm piece cinnamon stick½ tsp fenugreek seeds1 tsp chilli powder350ml thick coconutmilk½ tspturmeric powderJuice of ½ lime, to finishCoriander leaves, to garnishBring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, carefully drop in the eggs and cook for five minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggs to a bowl of iced water. Once cold, peel the eggs, then prick the whites all over with a toothpick or fork. Lightly salt the eggs and put them to one side.Put two to three tablespoons of coconut oil in a deep-sided frying pan on a medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds, dill seeds, curry leaves and chillies, and after a couple of minutes, when the spices start to pop, add the onion and garlic, and fry, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until the onions start to brown.Stir in the cinnamon, fenugreek seeds and chilli powder, cook for another two or three minutes, then add the coconut milk and turmeric. Cover the pan and leave to cook gently for 15 minutes.While the curry is cooking, put the remaining 250ml coconut oil in a medium, deep-sided saucepan and heat to about 180C/350F. Once it’s at temperature, deep-fry the eggs for a minute or two, until the whites turn a light yellow,then lift out with a slotted spoon and put on a plate or tray lined with kitchen towel to drain.Gently drop the deep-fried eggs into the curry sauce, simmer on a low heat for three to four minutes, then season to taste. Add the lime juice for a bit of acidity, and serve garnished with a scattering of coriander leaves.Mackerel pattiesView image in fullscreenDom Fernando’s mackerel patties.Nothing reminds me more of my grandmother than fish patties. She used to make them regularly whenever she came down to visit us in London. They resemble empañadas, and are one of my go-to snacks.Prep10 minChill1 hrCook1 hr 10 minMakes6For the filling250g potatoesSalt and black pepper500mlsunflower oil, plus a little extra for shallow frying1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced1tsp turmeric powder½ tsp ground cumin¼ tsp ground cinnamon¼ tsp ground cloves300gtinned mackerel, or tuna, in oil or spring water, drainedA few sprigs of fresh dill(optional)½ limeFor the pastry300gplain flour½ tspsalt100g cold unsalted butter, diced1 egg, separated80ml coconut milkWash the potatoes, then put them in a pan of salted water, bring to a boil and cook for 10-15 minutes, until cooked through. Drain, leave to cool a little, then peel and finely chop.Heat a little oil in a medium saucepan, then fry the onion, garlic and ginger for about 10 minutes, stirring until everything turns golden. Add the turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, cloves and a teaspoon of crushed black pepper, cook, stirring, for a minute, then add the tinned fish and fresh dill, if using, and cook, still stirring, for two to three minutes more.Stir in the chopped potatoes and two teaspoons of salt, cook for another couple of minutes, then take off the heat, squeeze in the lime juice and leave to cool.To make the pastry, mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub into the flour with your fingertips until the mix turns to crumbs. Beat the egg yolk in a small bowl, work it into the flour mix, then incorporate the coconut milk bit by bit, kneading it in well before adding any more, until you have a smooth dough. Don’t worry if you don’t achieve the right consistency automatically; add a little extra flour or some water to firm up or loosen, as required. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and chill for an hour.Divide the chilled dough in half and, on a floured surface, roll out each piece to roughly 3mm thick. Use a pastry cutter to cut out three 4-6cm-diameter circles from each piece of dough.Put a tablespoon of the fish mix in the centre of each pastry circle. Beat the egg white in a small bowl, then brush this all around the edge of each pastry circle. Fold over the circle to make a half-moon shape, then press all around the edges to seal.Put the 500ml oil in a large, deep-sided saucepan to fill it by no more than two-thirds, and heat to about 180C. Working in batches, carefully drop in the patties and deep-fry for two to four minutes, turning occasionally, until they turn crisp and golden. Lift out with a slotted spoon and put on a plate or tray lined with kitchen towel to drain while you fry the remaining patties. Serve warm with chilli sauce or tomato ketchup.Dom Fernando is chef/patron ofParadisein LondonExplore more on these topicsSri Lankan food and drinkSnacksMain courseFoodCurryEggsVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Apple’s much-loved MacBook Air gets even more power, a much better webcam and an unexpected price cut for 2025, making one of the very best consumer laptops even more tempting.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The company’s thinnest and lightest laptop currently starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,699) – £100 less than last year’s model – and has Apple’s top M4 chip with a minimum of 16GB of memory, making the cheapest model much more capable.Nothing has changedsince 2022 on the outsideother than a fetching new light blue colour that replaces the longstanding “space grey”. The aluminium body is just as well made, thin and light. The keyboard is excellent, the Touch ID fingerprint reader in the power button is fast and the generous trackpad is best in class.The 13.6in LCD screen is crisp and good, although limited to 60Hz, unlike the faster and smoother screen on the MacBook Pro line and some rivals. New for this year is an upgraded webcam, which is now 12 megapixels and sports Apple’s Centre Stage tech for automatic panning and scanning, plus support forDesk Viewfor demonstrating things remotely, similar to theM4 MacBook Pro.View image in fullscreenThe Centre Stage camera at the top of the screen is a significant upgrade for those who spend time on video calls.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianTwo meaningful changes have been made on the inside. The new M4 chip makes the Air essentially as fast as the MacBook Pro, which is to say very fast and snappy indeed. In tests it is only marginally slower than the Pro despite not having a fan to keep it cool for prolonged periods, and faster than theiPad Pro with M4 chip. There is little the Air will not be able to manage outside workstation-class workloads. Note the cheapest model has two fewer graphics cores on its chip, which will make it slightly less powerful for certain apps and games.All Airs now also come with at least 16GB of memory, which is the recommended minimum amount for modern laptops. Theprevious modelstarted with only 8GB of memory, which cost £200 to double.Along with powerful chips, the Air’s main selling point – very long battery life – remains. For general light workloads using browsers, notes apps, word processing, image editing, chats and emails, the Air regularly lasts more than 16 hours between charges, which is roughly two full work days on battery. Pushed a bit harder, such as developing and editing photos, the Air still managed more than 10 hours’ work on battery.View image in fullscreenA full charge using a 70W or greater power adaptor and the included MagSafe cable took about 105 minutes, hitting 50% in 28 minutes.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:13.6in LCD (2560x1600; 224 ppi) True ToneProcessor:Apple M4 with eight or 10-core GPURAM:16, 24 or 32GBStorage:256GB, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB SSDOperating system:macOS 15 SequoiaCamera:12MP Centre StageConnectivity:wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, 2x Thunderbolt/USB 4, headphonesDimensions:215 x 304.1 x 11.3mmWeight:1.24kgSustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe recycled aluminium lid of the MacBook Air in sky blue looks grey in some lights and blue in others.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe MacBook Air is made with 55% recycled materials including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare-earth elements, steel and tin. Apple breaks down the computer’s environmental impact inits report.The computer isgenerally repairable, and the battery can be replaced for £159 by Apple. The repair specialists iFixit gave the machinefive out of 10 for repairability. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.macOS Sequoia 15.4View image in fullscreenMacOS continues to be one of the best operating systems for laptops available, with plenty of customisation options and very useful new window tiling tools.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Air runs the same macOS Sequoia software as the rest of the Mac lineup, recently updated to version 15.4, which brings with it a few more Apple Intelligence features.The Mac Mail app has been redesigned to more closely resemble the app on an iPhone with AI email categorisation, such as promotional emails, receipts and others. AI notification summaries are useful, as isiPhone mirroringif you also use an Apple smartphone. The new snapping and window tiling tools are very handy, allowing you to quickly arrange your windows with either mouseor keyboard shortcuts, something that previously required third-party tools.PriceThe Apple 13in MacBook Air starts at£999(€1,199/$999/A$1,699) with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. 15in versions start at£1,199(€1,499/$1,199/A$2,099).For comparison, theM4 MacBook Prostarts at£1,599, theSamsung Galaxy Book 4 Edgecosts£1,399and the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 starts at£1,049.VerdictThe MacBook Air is the consumer laptop to beat unless you specifically need Windows. It simply offers a better combination of performance, battery life, speakers, keyboard and trackpad than rivals.The M4 chip upgrade keeps it ahead of the pack while being fanless and therefore silent at all times. The new Centre Stage webcam is a huge improvement, too, for anyone who lives on video calls for work. The screen is still great, although this is one area where better displays can be found on competitors at higher cost. It only has two USB-C ports but at least it can be charged via the MagSafe port to keep them available for connections.A price cut to about £1,000 or equivalent for the 13in model is very welcome, as is the minimum of 16GB of memory, which makes the 2025 MacBook Air surprisingly good value for a premium notebook.Pros:super-fast M4 chip, silent and cool running, extremely long battery life, good 13.6in screen, great keyboard, best-in-class trackpad, MagSafe, good speakers, Centre Stage webcam, Touch ID.Cons:only two USB-C ports and no USB-A or SD card slot, no Face ID, RAM and SSD upgrades are expensive and cannot be changed after purchase, no wifi 7.View image in fullscreenThe Touch ID power button still works great for logging into the laptop, storing up to three fingerprints.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsAppleLaptopsComputingreviewsShareReuse this content"

We all have our strengths and our weaknesses, and sometimes a weakness can become our biggest strength.Marsha de Cordova, MPFollow your dreams and pursue your passions, even if you’re afraid. Don’t let your disability – or anyone’s opinion – hold you back. Find yourself a good mentor and have a plan.Emma Barnett, broadcasterLearn a set routine of coping and take the energy when you have it to always ensure you have what you need to hand. Advocate for yourself, or find someone who can, to push doctors for diagnosis and then as much care as possible.Jameela Jamil, actorYou are smarter, more emotionally adept and stronger for what you have endured. You have empathy and perspective, and therefore you have substance and a more interesting outlook. Just block out the nonsense, avoid magazines that avoid people like you and your experience. Avoid anyone who makes you feel lesser online. Fill your brain with what will nourish you rather than starve you of the self-respect you deserve. We are superior to those who do not have to endure the same things we do. Never forget this. You’re great and I’m extremely proud of you.Jenny Sealey OBE, theatre directorFind out about, and get, proper access. Hold your nerve. Don’t be scared to get it wrong. Be curious always.Fearne Cotton, broadcaster and authorMy advice might sound a little cheesy, but bear with me. I went to a Coldplay concert recently and these words appeared on a big lit-up screen: “If you want to be loved, be love.” I stopped and stared. Isn’t that what we all want? To be loved and seen? It’s about trying to remember that we won’t feel better if other people approve of us, or even love us – we have to feel that inside. That’s where you can find peace. It doesn’t mean you have to stand there shouting “I love myself!”, but it does mean if you can tap into that well of love that lives within you, then you in turn will be loved, and for all the right reasons. I wish I had known that growing up.View image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: Tanni Grey-Thompson, Jameela Jamil, Sophie Morgan, Jillian Mercado and Nadia Whittome.Composite: Guardian Design;  David Levene; Fabio De Paola for the Guardian; Dave Benett; Simon Hofmann; Roy Rochlin/Getty ImagesSinéad Burke,disability consultantYou are a work in progress; your opinions, beliefs, thoughts, ambitions and the language you use to describe yourself and the world around you will evolve and change. We need to create space to not be continuously tied to what we once wanted, and to be open to an evolved perception of who we are, and what we want to become.Natasha Devon MBE, broadcasterAdvocate for yourself and trust your instincts.Hannah Jane Parkinson, journalistI’ve noted that there’s a movement of people being “proud” of conditions. That is wonderful, but I would also say that it’s fine to be … well, pissed off. It’s OK to be low-key furious some of the time. But there will be times when you feel much better – whether it’s a mental or physical condition – and things will be good. And during the bad times, there will be friends and family who are rooting for you. So, keep on keeping on, even when it’s a total pain in the arse.Sarah Gordy MBE, actorLife is about finding something you are interested in and enjoying it. It can be your job or something you do in your own time. Believe in yourself, take care of yourself and care for others. Smile a lot. Share happiness.Kelly Knox, modelNo matter what society or an individual may say, remember how unique, beautiful, valid and worthy you are to receive all the good this world has to offer. Don’t let anyone strip you of your beauty, whatever your goals, dreams and ambitions are – you can achieve them. Being disabled is a gift! The way we do things on a daily basis makes us brilliant problem-solvers: adaptable, naturally creative and courageous. You’ve got to be pretty special to be in our club.Nadia Whittome, MPI think there’s a lot of shame and guilt that can come with having health conditions. If you’ve been let down by services or other institutions, know that that isn’t your fault. How you feel or your inability to do certain things is also not your fault. You are dealing with a society that is not set up for your needs. You deserve to live a full and happy life, and the support to get there.View image in fullscreenRuth Madeley.Photograph: Jonathan Jacob/Channel 4Ruth Madeley, actorYou have no idea of the power you bring to the table. What you have to offer is unique and it’s needed more than you know.Alice Wong, activist and writerTry not to feel the need to keep up or be as good as your non-disabled peers. Focus on doing what you love and knowing who you are and what kind of person you want to be in the world. Life can be messy and shitty and it’s totally OK to be full of rage and pain. Don’t do something because it’s what others expect – please yourself first and take your time. You don’t have to follow the typical path. You can find freedom when you let go of what you think success, perfection or happiness is supposed to look like. Asking for help and needing help doesn’t mean you are a failure. You have power, whether you realise it or not.Anne Begg DBE,former MPNever doubt yourself. Making yourself heard as both a woman and someone with a disability will not be easy. Discrimination is sadly all too apparent. But everyone in society has a duty to both educate and help campaign for equality for all.Tanni Grey-Thompson DBE, independent peer and former ParalympianBe proud of who you are. There will be people who want to change you, people who have a view of what your life will be like. You have more choice in what you do than you realise.Jillian Mercado,actor and modelYou are not alone. There’s going to be ups and downs and things in between that will hurt you and make you believe that there is no one going through the same things as you are. But I am here to tell you that we are here, that you are loved, and that we will stand behind you in any way possible. Being a woman who is disabled is an extra layer of being a woman. It definitely won’t be easy, but I can assure you that you are resilient and you are so strong. You just have to know that you are, and I can tell you for a fact that it will be all be OK.View image in fullscreenCherylee Houston.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianCherylee Houston MBE, actorDo not take on board what society thinks of you. As I’ve got older, I know that there’s nothing wrong with being disabled. I now see it as a gift. I love being disabled and I believe it’s given me a much richer life than one I would have had without it. The hardest thing about it is other people’s opinions. But the more vocal you are, the more they get over it.Josie George, writer and artistI want you to know that you can find a way to be happy and thrive in this body you’re in. You don’t have to try to be like anyone else; you can just be you. It will take time to figure out, but learning who you really are and how you want to express yourself can be really fun. Your story, your goals and your dreams might not play out how you think they will – and that’s part of the adventure! – but just keep being your own best friend and know that your body is not your enemy. Be yourself all the way to your edges and good things will happen.Sophie Morgan, broadcasterYour disability can be your greatest opportunity to learn about the world, and, although it’s scary and tough at times, try to focus on what you can do instead of what you can’t. The world around you will try to tell you that your life isn’t worth as much as others – don’t believe them. Determine your own worth and live by your own beliefs. Ask for help when you need it.How chronic illness radically changed my view of womanhoodRead moreIone Gamble,journalistDo not fight your body, no matter how tempting it may be. Do not psychologically beat yourself up because you don’t look the same, or can’t do the same things as your peers.

You are working in the only way you are able, and it is more than enough.Katie Piper OBE, writer, activist, TV presenter and modelBe seen. I like that quote: “I am not what I’ve done or been through; I am what I’ve conquered and overcome.” The fact is, pain builds resilience, patience and empathy in all of us. Worry is a total waste of time. It doesn’t change anything. All it does is steal your joy and keep you very busy doing nothing.Stefanie Reid MBE,former Paralympian and presenterYou will always stand out with a disability. People may stare, people may think you are different to them, and people may be uncomfortable with you. And the best thing I’ve found is to own it! There is power in “otherness”. I have experience and a perspective that no one else has and there is value in that. But only if I see it, and only if I believe it.Nikki Fox, broadcasterDo not ever limit yourself. The world isn’t perfect by any stretch. A lot of things need to improve for disability, from the built environment to attitudes. But don’t think too much about that shit. When I grew up, I was naive. I thought I could do anything. And actually, that helped me. Fake it until you make it. If I wanted a job, I didn’t worry about how I’d do it; I just applied. At the same time, as I’ve got older, I’ve learned we have limits. Don’t feel the pressure to be this unbelievable go-getter disabled person. That you have to try extra hard just because you’re disabled. You don’t have to.

It has prompted volunteers to question how many more “bad years” the species can survive.A freshwater species that breathes by absorbing oxygen through gill-like structures in its tail, the Mary River turtle is endemic to south-east Queensland. Its population has fallen by more than 80% since the 1960s and its conservation status was upgraded from endangeredto critically endangered last year.Volunteers have worked for more than two decades at Tiaro, about 200km north of Brisbane, to save the species. The Mary River typically flows low at the start of summer – about 2 metres deep.But when Guardian Australia visited in December, it had surged above 10 metres after unusually heavy rain.A video loop of a turtle painting that vanishes slowlyScientists consider the turtle one rung away from extinction. Illustration: Meeri AnneliThe result was the number of nests on the riverbanks – and the number of hatchlings that survived – was one of the lowest in the conservation program’s 24-year history. Seventeen nests, known as clutches, were laid during the season. Usually 30 to 40 are expected during the turtle’s breeding months of October, November and December.Get Guardian Australia environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as an emailEggs in nine clutches hatched successfully but eight were lost to flood waters. The head of the conservation effort and Tiaro Landcare project leader, Marilyn Connell, said the Mary River turtle already had “lots of things going against it, making it difficult to recover”.“You sort of can’t believe it,” she said. “We felt despondent.”View image in fullscreen‘How many of these bad years can a species that has already declined this much deal with?’Photograph: Chris Van Wyk/ZSL/PAThe volunteers made the difficult decision to intervene and move two nests higher up the riverbanks. One of these survived the flood waters.The river eventually peaked at 11.5 metres at Tiaro in December, one of only six times it has been recorded at that height at that time of year in the past 100 years, according to Connell.‘Endearing and fascinating’ yellow-bellied glider faces ‘inexorable slide’ into extinctionRead moreThe Mary River turtle’s formal listing of critically endangered means scientists consider it one rung away from extinction. The remaining wild population is estimated to be about 10,000. They face threats from foxes and other nest predators, invasive species and developments that disturb the flow of the river, including dams and weirs.“Every year matters, that’s how we feel,” Connell said. “You just have to ask: how many of these bad years can a species that has already declined this much deal with?”Community volunteers protect nests and hatchlings on the riverbanks from predators but even after successful breeding seasons the population has not recovered. The turtle is a long-lived species and can bounce back from a poor breeding season. But too few turtles are reaching maturity, which occurs after about 25 to 30 years.The volunteers are now working with researchers from Charles Darwin University to investigate why many juvenile turtles are not surviving to adulthood and what can be done to address this. Results are expected later this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said sea temperatures off the southernQueenslandcoast had been at record levels before the floods. Scientists say this leads to more intense rain as the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere increases. “You think to yourself, is more of this what we’ve got to look forward to?” Connell said.Massive swarms of bogong moths once resembled rain clouds – then their numbers crashed to earthRead moreShe said despite the turtle’s critically endangered status, volunteers have had to rely on fundraising drives, selling chocolate turtles and chasing financial support from overseas to continue their conservation work.She was shocked in 2010 when the Landcare group received a conservation grant from the United Arab Emirates. The same fund gave them further grants in 2011 and 2018.After a 2022 flood in Queensland and New South Wales, volunteers also received a $300,000 grant through a state government disaster fund. Connell said this was typical of her experience – that “you have to have a disaster, or the species has to be on its last legs, to get funds”.“It is ironic but that’s the way conservation works in Australia,” she said.She said while community projects like hers could “chip away” at environmental work they ultimately needed serious government and philanthropic support. “We can’t be doing it all off our own backs,” she said.Explore more on these topicsEndangered speciesLast chanceWildlifeConservationReptilesFloodingQueenslandVolunteeringnewsShareReuse this content"

Forty years on, he wants to build a fleet of them to clean up the oceansBySteve Rosein Cape Cod, MassachusettsSeascape: the state of our oceans is supported byAbout this contentThu 10 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 10.58 EDTShareJohn Todd remembers the moment he knew he was really on to something: “There was no question that it was at the Harwich dump in 1986,” he recalls. This was in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, close to where Todd still lives. Hidden away from the picturesque beaches was the town landfill, including lagoons of toxic waste from septic tanks, which was being left to seep into the groundwater below. So Todd, then a 45-year-old biologist, decided to design a solution. What he was “on to”, he came to realise, was not just a natural way of removing pollution from water, it was a holistic approach to environmental restoration that was way ahead of its time, and possibly still is.View image in fullscreenAn early eco-machine purifying toxic waste on Cape Cod in 1986. Photograph: John ToddTodd’s solution to the Harwich pollution problem was both beautifully simple and unfathomably complex. Next to the lagoons, he assembled a line of 15 clear-sided fiberglass tanks, each about the height of a person, and filled them with water containing all the different life forms he could find from local ponds, marshes and streams – plants, bugs, bacteria, fungi, general gunk. The water could be pumped from one tank to the next, and the living matter inside them soon organised itself into a series of different ecosystems. Todd found that he could put in polluted water from the lagoons at one end of the line of tanks and by the time it came out the other end, 10 days later, it was clean enough to drink.“To see that water, and to see all the organisms in the tanks, including fishes, looking and being so healthy, I was just amazed,” he says.Todd didn’t know exactly what was going on in those tanks – he would later discover that various microorganisms were finding uses for the toxins and heavy metals – but he didn’t need to, he says. “All I really knew going into it was all the kingdoms of life had to be in there. Nobody knew which ones could cope with what we had, but there’s probably no problem they haven’t solved in one way or another over the last three or four billion years.” Todd calls it “biological intelligence”.“The thing that separates myself and my colleagues is that we really do celebrate the living world for what it’s beginning to show us it can do,” he says.There’s just so many positive directions that are possible and economically feasibleJohn ToddTodd christened his invention the “eco-machine”, and spent the next four decades understanding and refining it, applying it to everything from treating wastewater to growing food to repairing damaged ecosystems. Now aged 85, he is still at work, inventing new solutions to a set of environmental problems that has only deepened.Todd’s latest proposal is his most ambitious yet, something he calls “the Fleet”. The idea is very simple, he says: a fleet of sailing vessels, each containing one of his eco-machines. These could be deployed to clean up coastal environmental disasters on site, wherever they are needed. Each sailing eco-machine, Todd says, is “an incubator of beneficial organisms into the environment surrounding it”. Each vessel would take polluted sea water and not only clean it but add helpful organisms and nutrients to it, such as diatoms, which he calls the “baby milk” of the marine food chain.View image in fullscreenA test sailing vessel with eco-machinesView image in fullscreenHow one of Todd’s sailing vessels containing an eco-machine might look. Illustration: John ToddIt sounds romantic, challenging, far-fetched even, but between his knowledge of ecological design and naval architecture, Todd seems to have figured it all out: the design of the sailing vessels (inspired by 19th-century Thames barges); how to keep the tanks full of liquid stable on board; energy and lighting; how much water these relatively small vessels could treat. Powered by wind and sun, the entire operation would be fossil fuel-free, he says, “and the fact that they’re going to be so beautiful, they’re going to be the sort of technology neighbourhoods are going to want to have in their back yards”.Maybe I should just slow down and let them catch up before I go galloping off with sailing eco-machines. But I can’t, I’m not young enoughJohn ToddTodd estimates a fleet of 30 such vessels could clean up maritime pollution for about a quarter of the cost of conventional processes. He would love to get two 40ft prototype vessels built and put them to work on nearby Waquoit Bay, which would cost about $20m (£15.5m), he says. Like many coastal areas, Cape Cod’s inshore waters are dying, largely as a result of pollution from domestic sewage. The sea-run brook trout, the shellfish and the eelgrass he saw in the 1960s are hardly to be found any more. Every summer, scores of Massachusettsbeaches closeafter heavy rains because of sewage pollution.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTodd – and some of the books that inspire him – at his home in Falmouth. He says his machines are cheaper and more effective than industrial alternatives. Photographs: Simon Simard/the GuardianTodd knows how to fix it, and much more besides, he believes, but, as has been the case since the 1970s, his ideas are still too wide-ranging for the compartmentalised scientific world to fully understand, he says. Despite having won numerous awards and accolades, he has always been something of an outsider scientist. “Maybe I should just slow down, and let them catch up before I go galloping off with sailing eco-machines,” he says. “But I can’t, I’m not young enough.”Born in Ontario, Canada, Todd has always loved the water and boats. His father designed and built yachts as a hobby, and he has done the same. He studied agriculture and marine biology, but by the time he came to Cape Cod in 1969 and took a post at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, he was beginning to chafe against the strictures and compartmentalisation of academia. He was also becoming increasingly worried about the environment.View image in fullscreenA meeting at the New Alchemy Institute, with Todd sitting at the table on the far right. Photograph: New Alchemy staffView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTwo covers of the Journal of the New Alchemists, published by the New Alchemy InstituteIn 1969, Todd co-founded the New Alchemy Institute with his wife, Nancy, and a colleague, Bill McClarney – not quite a hippy commune, an alternative research institute (associates included visionary architect Richard Buckminster Fuller, economist EF Schumacher and Lynn Margulis, co-creator of the Gaia hypothesis). “I decided I wasn’t a doomwatch ecologist,” Todd says. “Doomwatch can be left to other people, I was more interested in solutions.”The 13-acre (five-hectare) New Alchemy site is a few minutes’ drive from where he and Nancy still live. Its mission was to explore joined-up, sustainable ways of living: energy, food, shelter, waste. They planted organic crops, farmed fish and built wind turbines and experimental architecture – all underpinned by a belief that the more systems they had working together, the stronger the whole would be, just like the organisms in one of his eco-machines.View image in fullscreenAn illustration of a geodesic dome from the Journal of the New AlchemistsThat first eco-machine, in Harwich, ought to have gained Todd national attention; instead it earned him a lawsuit from the state regulators. Apparently nobody was permitted to treat waste without a civil engineering degree. “I appeared on the front page of the Boston Globe, described with a word I’d never heard before, ‘scofflaw’,” he says, chuckling. “The head of the Environmental Protection Agency heard about my fight and sent one of his scientists up to review the data and what I was doing. He went back and he said, ‘He’s legitimate.’” The EPA subsequently honoured him with an award (indeed, anEPA study in 2002found Todd’s technology to be “typically cost competitive with more conventional wastewater treatment systems”).After the New Alchemy Institute wound down, Todd founded his own ecological consultancy,Ocean Arks International. It has designed and built more than 100 eco-machine systems to treat problems of pollution, wastewater and food production around the world, from the US to China, Australia, Brazil and Scotland. He has drawn up proposals for islands owned by Richard Branson, Marlon Brando and Leonardo DiCaprio (only Branson actually implemented them).Todd’s eco-machines are cheaper and more effective than industrial alternatives, he says, and are even capable of treating chemicals that have been impossible to break down using conventional methods, such as grades of crude oil and mining waste. They are also far more sustainable – powered almost entirely by sunlight.All of which begs the question: why aren’t they more widely used? One reason is prevailing attitudes, Todd suggests. “Civil engineering schools tend to eschew innovation and invention. Hardware is tinkered with and new components are added at a pretty slow pace. A 100-year-old waste water treatment plant looks pretty similar to a contemporary one.”At the same time, for all his scientific skills, Todd is the first to admit he has never been much of a businessman. His career is strewn with startups and partnerships that fell by the wayside for various reasons.However, many of his ideas have seeped into the mainstream and some of his ideas have been developed in a more commerical way, including by his son, Jonathan.View image in fullscreenThe Weather Makers’ eco-machine containing 12 water tanks under a geodesic dome. Photograph: Weather MakersView image in fullscreenFish in the Weather Makers’ eco-machine in the Netherlands. Photograph: Weather MakersIt is not just Todd who can vouch for their efficacy. Three years ago, under Todd’s guidance, the Dutch environmental restoration company the Weather Makers built their own eco-machine in Den Bosch, in the Netherlands, with 12 water tanks housed under a 50ft-diameter geodesic dome. They were seeking to process local water polluted by intensive farming into fertile, nutrient-rich water, and to desalinate marine sediments to use in their ecosystem regeneration projects in places such as the Sinai desert.Just as Todd did in Harwich, the Weather Makers’ co-founder Ties van der Hoeven found the results were “amazing”. “Everything he said was just spot on, and certain things really overtook our expectations,” says van der Hoeven. “Everything is growing like crazy.” Tomato plants growing inside the dome with the treated water are 20-30% bigger than ones grown with groundwater, he says.Like many others, he did not really understand Todd’s approach until he put it into practice. “Hopefully now, with this planetary craziness we’re entering into, we’re starting to recognise these kinds of holistic solutions better,” he says. He likens Todd to Yoda from the Star Wars movies – the keeper of an ecological wisdom born in the 1960s and 70s but forgotten, “a bit like the Renaissance being forgotten in the middle ages, and then now people are picking it up again”.View image in fullscreenThe first New Alchemy experiment in 1971, with the Todd’s youngest daughter, Susannah. Photograph: Todd EcologicalAs ever, Todd remains an optimist. “I feel we know how to fix the ocean, I feel we know how to fix the deserts, I feel we know how to fix the urban environment, and so we’ve just got to get the story moving,” he says. “There’s just so many positive directions that are possible and economically feasible. If we could get the larger public really excited about how nature can be made to clean up, then people would say, ‘we can do it. We’ve got a future.’”Explore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansPollutionOceansMarine lifeWildlifeEthical and green livingWaterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has2.1 million followerson X and wasreportedas one of the fastest-rising stars on Musk’s X platform in 2023 by NBC News.Loathe thy neighbor: Elon Musk and the Christian right are waging war on empathyRead moreIn recent months, Nawfal has conducted interviews with Putin allies including the Serbian president,Aleksandar Vučić; the Russian minister of foreign affairs,Sergey Lavrov; theBelarusian president, Aleksandr Lukashenko; far-right Russian philosopherAleksandr Dugin, who isreferredto as “Putin’s brain” due to his influence on Russian politics; the Slovakian prime minister,Robert Fico, who hasclaimedthe west has demonized Putin; and the Romanian pro-Russia presidential candidate Cǎlin Georgescu.“Musk has cultivated, attracts and also welcomes people in all various media who support his views and Nawfal is an example of that,” said Paul Levinson, a professor of communication and media studies at Fordham University.In Nawfal’s interview with Lukashenko, the Belarusian president praised Trump and blamed the war in Ukraine on the west. Lukashenko has been in power forthree decades, winning anelectionin January 2025 with nearly 88% of the vote. The election has been characterized as a sham by western governments as he has jailed or exiled all opposition dissident leaders.“He does not just talk about peace. He genuinely wants it. It is almost personal. The most important thing is he wants peace,” Nawfal said at apress conferencewith state media in Belarus about the interview with Lukashenko, in which they discussed relations between Belarus and the west. “You can trust your president who has been in office for 30 years pursuing a consistent policy.”Belarusian and Russian governmentspromotedthe interviews with Lavrov and Lukashenko, claiming they were done with a “US blogger”.Nawfal said this characterization was “factually incorrect and misleading” as he is Australian and lives in Dubai, but did not comment on the Belarusian and Russian governments characterizing and promoting the interviews with the error.Paul Goode, a Russian studies professor at Carleton University, said it is highly improbable what Lukashenko said was not vetted by the Kremlin, given the country’sclose tieswith Russia and Putin.“Russian propaganda frequently uses figures that it claims to represent authentic sentiment in the US in support of its foreign policy claims”, Goode said about Nawfal. “For Russia’s purposes, these kinds of interviews not only provide a platform for recirculating propaganda claims aboutRussiaas a defender of normal states, against western imperialism, globalists in Washington, Nazis in Ukraine, etc … but also provide access to wider audiences in the US and elsewhere through their social media channels.”Russia will ‘undoubtedly’ discuss future Mars flights with Musk, Putin envoy saysRead moreIan Garner, an assistant professor of Russia, war and propaganda at the Pilecki Institute in Warsaw, Poland, noted the level of access these figures give Nawfal.“They don’t tend to typically give interviews to anyone but friendly media,” he said.Garner said the blogger sphere that Nawfal inhabits is “very convenient for somebody that is trying to spread propaganda” and to show support between the US right and Russia.“Ultimately, what all of this is about is propaganda, and it is using a very large online audience that somebody like Nawfal has to be able to speak directly to people all over the world, and in particular, to speak to people in America,” Garner added. “They’re trying to suggest that there is a new sort of spiritual and ideological alignment between the rightwing crowds that are watching Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, listening to Nawfal, and the Russian media sphere.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It reflects a broader and dangerous pattern of attempting to discredit independent journalism through baseless insinuation. My work involves publishing direct, unedited conversations with global figures, with the aim of promoting transparency and dialogue across ideological divides. Viewers are free to form their own conclusions.”Other recent interviews by Nawfal raise similar concerns about propaganda.On 2 April, Nawfal published an interview with Serbian president Vučić, who claimed recent corruptionprotestsin Serbia were “a mutiny and unrest organized by wealthy and mainly rich people. There are no poor people in the streets.”How Elon Musk’s X became the global right’s supercharged front pageRead moreIn February, NawfalinterviewedGeorgescu, Romania’s pro-Russian presidential candidate, touting it as his first interview since Georgescu was detained. Georgescu wasbannedfrom participating in a May 2025 rerun election in Romania following evidence of Russian interference in the first round of last year’s presidential election.Nawfal has previouslyclaimedGeorgescu should have been president.Manuela Caiani, an associate professor of political science at the Scuola Normale Superiore who studies international far-right movements, said Musk and Nawfal play an important role in “an increasing international network of radical right forces not only inEurope, but also all around the globe”.“The radical right is increasingly becoming connected in terms of ideas, norms, values, initiatives and networking,” Caiani added. “Internalization and mainstreaming go hand in hand, the more they become normalized. It’s about legitimatization.”Explore more on these topicsFar right (US)Digital mediaRussiaSocial mediaElon MuskVladimir PutinAlexander LukashenkonewsShareReuse this content"

But last month, the monumental 13-panel 1954 paintingUntitled (Gram Yatra)– one of the most significant pieces of modern south Asian art – sold for a record-breaking $13.7m in New York.The auction of the painting sent ripples through the art world. It was not only the highest price ever paid for a painting by Maqbool Fida Husain, one of India’s most celebrated modern artists, but it was the highest ever paid for any piece of modern Indian art at auction – going for four times the estimated price. It also happened to be the most expensive artwork auctioned so far in 2025.View image in fullscreenA painting by artist Amrita Sher-Gil at an Osian’s auction of Indian art at the Imperial hotel in New Delhi.Photograph: The India Today Group/Getty ImagesIndian, and more broadly south Asian artists, have long failed to receive the same recognition as their western counterparts. Few were displayed in the world’s great galleries and collections, international exhibitions celebrating their work have been scarce and their presence at the world’s biggest art fairs – the powerful drivers of today’s art market – has been minimal.‘I spent six years just repeating dots and lines’: the great painter Arpita Singh on a lifetime in artRead moreYet recently there are signs that things are changing and Indian art – both modern and contemporary – is having what many in the field described as a “major moment”. Auction prices for prominent 20th century Indian artists have consistently broken records over the past few years, while according to international online art broker Artsy, the demand for Indian artists increased more than for any other nationality in 2024.For Nishad Avari, head of South Asian Modern and Contemporary Art at Christie’s in New York, the record-breaking sale of the Husain painting in March – which took him over a decade to orchestrate – was reflective of a wider shift in the recognition and momentum around Indian artists, that he credited with originating from within India.“Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen the ecosystem for the arts in India really expanding,” said Avari. “There are lots of new participants and a newfound confidence that’s driving demand and many new conversations are taking place, both in India and internationally. It’s all long overdue to be honest.”‘The world never took us seriously’India experienced an art boom once before, in the early to late 2000s, when contemporary Indian art began to be seen as investments and prices skyrocketed. Yet many viewed it as a speculative bubble driven by a few figures distorting prices as they quickly bought and sold works, and it all came crashing down after the 2008 global financial crisis.Artists, curators and gallerists were all in agreement that the current environment was markedly different. Aparajita Jain, co-founder of Nature Morte, one of India’s most prominent private galleries, said that this time there was a recognition both of the value of India’s modern artists as well as the contemporary, and that works were being bought to be hung on people’s walls, not to be “speculatively flipped”.View image in fullscreenMaqbool Fida Husain’s Untitled (Gram Yatra), 1954. Oil on canvas. 35½ x 166⅜ in (90.2 x 422.6 cm).Photograph: Christie’sFor decades, arts in the India have suffered by a severe lack of state funding, ensuring that museums and galleries are often uninspiring, celebrating just a select few artists.But as wealth in India has grown, so too has the number of Indian arts patrons and collectors, both within India and in the wider diaspora. “The main struggle we used to have is that no-one would fund Indian shows,” said Jain. “But as Indians are becoming richer, they want their say in the larger world and they want to see their culture represented, not just through a western lens.”There has been a recent surge in privately run galleries and museums opening across the country, championing both India’s 20th century modern masters but also the next generation of contemporary artists. India also has its own flourishing art fair held annually in Delhi and a younger generation of Indian art collectors have emerged with a newfound interest in contemporary art.A new Museum of Art and Photography opened in Bengaluru in 2023 and Kiran Nadar, India’s biggest private patron and collector of modern and contemporary art, will open a major museum in Delhi next year. Some of the country’s biggest billionaire industrialists have recently bankrolled cultural centres in Mumbai and Hampi and the Jaipur royal family has just opened a centre for the arts in the City Palace.Nonetheless, added Jain, “I still feel that for the quantum of amazing art that’s produced in our country, we still haven’t begun to see the amount of shows that our artists deserve”.View image in fullscreenUndercurrents and The Golden Womb, a stainless steel work by Tarini Sethi on display at India Art FairPhotograph: Courtesy of the artist/Tarini SethiContemporary Indian artists described it as one of the most exciting moments for the country’s art scene. “Up until three or four years ago, the art market in India, the people in power, the institutions, the galleries and the collectors just didn’t take Indian artists as seriously as they did international artists – and that meant the world never took us seriously,” said Tarini Sethi, a multi-disciplinary artist who works out of Delhi.“But that’s changed so much. Now there is a huge push to invest in and highlight our own artists, whether that’s with gallery shows in India or abroad. For the first time, collectors and galleries want to take a chance on newer voices.”More than just ‘paintings of cows and Gandhi’Sethi’s own sculptures and paintings take what she described as a “maximalist, in-your-face approach” to depictions of sex, unity and women’s bodies, directly addressing their continued taboo in India. However, she recalled when studying art in the US that professors would routinely critique her work for not being “Indian enough”.But as more contemporary Indian artists have been championed by patrons and showcased by domestic galleries, and as a result increasingly seen at international galleries and art fairs, Sethi said it was challenging cliched perceptions that all the country had to offer was “folk art and paintings of cows and Gandhi”.Sethi acknowledged there was “still a long way to go” – she recently showed her work at an art fair around Art Basel in Miami, one of the art world’s most prominent fairs, and was shocked to realise only two Indian galleries were present. “But at least finally we are being seen as contenders,” she added.View image in fullscreenContemporary Indian artist Tarini Sethi with her sculptures that challenge taboos around sex and women’s bodies in IndiaPhotograph: Courtesy of the artist/Tarini SethiThis momentum has also been reflected internationally. In the past year,the Barbican Centreand the Serpentine Gallery in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Pompidou in Paris have all held prominent exhibitions of Indian artists, with many featuring works seen outside India for the first time. At the 2023 Frieze Art Fair, Experimenter, a contemporary gallery that began in the Indian city of Kolkata, won the prestigious best stand award for its presentation of seven intergenerational female artists.In the US, it was a frustration at “seeing all this incredible work coming out of India that was not being celebrated in the west as I felt it should be” that led gallerist Rajiv Menon to open a space in Los Angeles almost primarily dedicated to south Asian artists.Menon’s focus has been on giving western viewers and collectors an opportunity to see South Asian artists in a wider context; his current show is by a Pakistani artist Noormah Jamal whose works reflect on her childhood growing up in Peshawar. He described the response to his other exhibitions, which have included works by Sethi, as “phenomenal”, with six pieces acquired by museums in a matter of months.“So many of the themes that the works in the shows have dealt with – climate, migration, political precariousness – are very specific to the South Asia but they also speak deeply to the human condition everywhere,” says Menon.“It’s really affirmed my hypothesis that as soon as these artists are given an opportunity to show in the west, they will immediately find an audience. This is just the beginning.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaArtSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Deni Chamberlin/FERNAfter seeing the farmer mental health crisis up close, Kaila Anderson developed new treatment techniques based on growers’ deep connection to the landByDean Kuipers in Sabetha, KansasSupported byAbout this contentThu 10 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 12.58 EDTShareKaila Anderson stands in front of some photos in the farmhouse where she grew up, near the tiny town of Sabetha, in the north-east corner ofKansas. Outside, frozen February fields of wheat, hay and corn stubble repeat across the rolling hills. This agrarian landscape inspired a breakthrough she made four years ago that now promises to help farmers struggling with their mental health.A licensed social worker, Anderson knows first-hand that farmers have a high propensity for depression and one of the highest rates of suicide of any occupation, often attributed to the demanding and precarious nature of the job. Yet she has found that crisis-line staffers, doctors and therapists in farm country often don’t have the cultural training to recognize the signs of emotional stress unique to farmers.She wanted to explore an emerging idea in psychology that farmer stress is deeply intertwined with the land. But, as a therapist, she needed a tool that could make this connection clear to farmers themselves. And then she saw it, right here on the wall of her childhood home: an aerial photograph of her own family’s farm – the house, the old barn, the windbreak of red cedar trees and these same fields in summer green. Almost every farmhouse in the US has a photo like this hanging on its walls – just another member of the family, as it were.“I walked by these images, and they’ve been there in various forms for my whole childhood, it was like,whoa,” said Anderson, 40.Farmers don’t typically talk about their emotional lives, but these photos, or a hand-drawn map of their operation, can become an unthreatening tool that therapists or family doctors use to start a discussion that eventually reveals a farmer’s underlying emotional struggle. A cattle feedlot, for instance, might be the locus of intense stress when there isn’t enough money to feed the cattle. Or a reliable field of alfalfa could be a solace.She used this idea to create theLandLogic Model, a new way to train healthcare providers that uses farmers’ relationship to their land to identify and treat depression, anxiety and other emotional issues within a notoriously hard-to-reach population. Operating in areas that typically don’t have enough mental health professionals, she’s trying to get family doctors, crisis hotline staffers, county health workers, pharmacists and others to recognize what it can mean when a farmer says “I can’t afford to feed my cows,” or “The sorghum crop just failed” – statements that are often about much more than financial stress.View image in fullscreenKaila Anderson, creator of LandLogic with her father, Galen Ackerman, discuss how the buildings on the farm have changed over time.Photograph: Deni Chamberlin/FERNOver the last three years, Anderson has kicked off most of her LandLogic training sessions and presentations across Kansas,Coloradoand elsewhere in the western US with these aerial photos, and watched farmers’ eyes light up as if to say,somebody understands me.“The common denominator,” she said of farmers, whether they grow corn or soy or run a dairy operation, “is the land.”Anderson has an intimate understanding of this relationship to the land and of the potential emotional consequences when it starts to break down. As we stand in front of the photos in the family farmhouse, her mother, Linda Ackerman, pointed at one and said to Kaila’s father, Galen: “Weren’t you out in the silo shed when you thought about doing yourself some self-harm?”“Yeah,” Galen said, pointing. “See that little white building there?”Forty years ago, Galen himself had been struggling with depression. In that little white shed, a spinning auger pulled stored cattle feed out of the silo. “I thought about sticking my hand in the auger,” he said. “That’s just completely illogical. But also I thought: ‘Well, we have insurance.’ It was probably a $50,000 policy or something, but I thought: ‘Oh, Linda would be so much better off if I was gone and she had that money.’”It was the height of the farm crisis of the 1980s, when agriculture collapsed nationwide. Crop prices plummeted and interest rates on operating loans – which farmers take in the spring to pay for inputs like seed and fertilizer, then pay back after harvest – were over 20%. By the end of the decade, an estimated 250,000 American farms would be sold or lost to foreclosure and more than 1,000 farmers had died by suicide.Galen and Linda had been under tremendous stress since they took over the 160-acre (65-hectare) family farm. They had initially arranged to split responsibilities with Galen’s high school-aged brother, but the plan fell apart only months later when he was killed in a tractor accident. And like other farmers, their incomes dropped in the mid-80s – while he and Linda had two kids, and Kaila on the way.Galen became obsessed with the thought that he would lose the family farm. He thought he would rather die than lose that legacy. He stopped sleeping, then stopped eating, saying he was “gloomy”. Finally, Linda called the pastor of their church for help. She didn’t call a mental health professional, she said, because that was for “crazy” people.View image in fullscreenLinda and Galen Ackerman recall the period during the farm crisis in the 80s when he was struggling with depression.Photograph: Deni Chamberlin/FERNThe pastor gave Galen Bible verses to memorize: “Do not be anxious about anything”, the “peace of God … will guard your hearts and your minds.” He recited them out loud whenever the bad feelings arose – in the silo shed, in the feedlot, hammering nails on the new house he was trying to build.He got through the winter and started to improve.The fear and uncertainty that made the farm crisis of the 1980s so deadly, however, still plagues the rural US today, as farm stress is rising to another crisis point. Agricultural producers have endured several years of very low commodity prices, inflation on things like fertilizer and pesticides, rising consolidation in the marketplace, avian flu and the mounting effects of climate change.And if that weren’t enough, now the Trump administration is imposing on-again, off-again tariffs (which did serious damage to farms during his first term), cancelling food aid programs and energy project payouts, targeting immigrant farm workers and firing federal employees who deliver critical services, from pest research to weather information. The situation is primed for another rash of mental health emergencies in the rural US.Anderson’s work is built on that of Dr Michael Rosmann, a psychologist and Iowa farmer. Considered one of the creators of an emerging field of medicine and wellness called agrarian behavioral health, he launched outreach programs, hotlines and rural treatment centers during the farm crisis in the 1980s. He later helped federal lawmakers draft the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network, a national suicide prevention network, developed a set of best practices for farmer suicide prevention and counseled hundreds of rural people.At the core of agrarian behavioral health is understanding why farmers farm and why they despair when they cannot. Studies starting in the early 1980s found that while most people ranked personal events, such as divorce or the death of a family member, as leading causes of stress, for farmers, it was the loss of their farm. Rosmann’s own surveys found that farmers considered the loss of the ability to farm, or even the threat of such a loss, equal to the loss of a child.Rosmann believes this connection goes beyond the fact that the land is how farmers make their living. In 2010, he came up with a theoretical explanation that he calls the agrarian imperative: humans are genetically inclined to protect and nurture a piece of land that produces food, wood or needed products for life. Writing in the Journal of Agromedicine, he suggests that this genetic tendency is in everyone, and that it is activated by contact with the land, animals or the environment. Farmers, foresters and commercial fishers are good at their jobs because they get deeply attached but are at risk when that role is threatened.View image in fullscreenDr Michael Rosmann while visiting a farm of a friend just south of Pella, Iowa.Photograph: Deni Chamberlin/FERNFor farmers and ranchers, Anderson notes, it can be a source of relief to know that genetic drives partly shape our behavior. Through LandLogic, she’s advancing the agrarian imperative by doing what Rosmann says he himself did not: using the land in treatment.LandLogic draws heavily on cognitive behavioral therapy. Developed in the 1960s, CBT attempts to identify the relationship between a person’s thoughts and behaviors, and redirect negative thought patterns to something more positive. Today, it’s one of the most common and best-studied forms of psychotherapy. In training sessions, Anderson describes LandLogic as “a cultural adaptation of cognitive behavioral therapy designed for the agricultural community”.Kirsten Wulfsberg, a licensed counselor in Chaffee county in central Colorado who has taken the LandLogic training, shows how a therapist can create interventions using the farm itself as a tool. In her job with the Colorado AgrAbility Project, part of a nationwide network helping farmers overcome physical and mental issues, she had one client who repeatedly told her that he was stuck in a rut.“So I told him to go sit in a rut,” Wulfsberg said. She told him to find a ravine on his farm and sit there. As he sat there, he watched birds and other animals go in and out of it. Some of them climbed straight up the sides of the ravine, and others found routes that were less steep. He eventually recognized that he tended to take the harder routes in his life. This intervention showed him that he actually had options – that maybe he wasn’t so stuck.“Ranchers and farmers don’t spend a whole lot of time talking about their emotions,” Wulfsberg said. “[This approach] gives them a language that’s non-threatening, a form of communication that they didn’t have before.”Chad Reznicek, a clinical therapist who is co-developing LandLogic with Anderson, says the key to LandLogic’s acceptance among the farming community is its “ecological validity”, meaning it fits the world of the agricultural producers it is meant to treat.“How can we move the work in therapy from an abstract exercise in an office that’s detached from someone’s experience and instead do something that gets them to reconnect in a different way with their day-to-day experience on their land and in their operation?” said Reznicek, also a behavioral health specialist with the Colorado AgrAbility Project.Farmers are problem-solvers, both Wulfsberg and Reznicek point out. Give them an opportunity to change their behavior, in a way that they can do themselves, and they have a path forward.This emphasis on the practical is also the key to getting farmers and ranchers in the door with a therapist in the first place. “You don’t have to be a producer,” Anderson said. “You just have to think like one.”View image in fullscreenKaila Anderson, creator of LandLogic, on her parents’ farm near Sabetha, Kansas. She has fond memories of her childhood adventures on a working farm.Photograph: Deni Chamberlin/FERNFor Maddie Caldwell, who grew up on her family farm in Elmwood, Illinois, this approach is critical. If she had had this kind of help earlier in life, she says, she might not have attempted suicide. As a freshman in high school, she started a business with her father selling show cattle, prize animals that win awards at stock shows. She started seeing therapists in college, when she realized that stress had taken over her life. Since then, she’s seen about 15 counselors, and even though she’s sure the providers want to help her, they just didn’t relate to her farm experience.“The first therapist that I went to, he’s like: ‘So, do you have two hours every day to go sit by a lake or a pond and just reflect on things?’” Caldwell said, chuckling. “I barely have 10 minutes to eat food on the farm. I cannot imagine if I told my dad, like: ‘Hey, I know we need to tour cows today, but I need to take hours to just look at the sky.’ My dad would have a high-speed come-apart.”By the time she was a senior in college, she had attempted suicide twice and nearly died. The second time, she was sitting at one of her favorite spots on the farm, a trough for livestock feed that she used to visit with her grandfather. She says the urge to go there was just “instinctual”.Caldwell says she likes LandLogic because it encourages crisis counselors and doctors to ask questions about places like that feed trough.“One of the main things that I talked to Kaila about was, I don’t think it’s much about the knowledge that [care providers] have about ag,” she said. “It’s obvious that for someone from the middle of nowhere in Illinois, I can’t find a therapist that specializes in ag. It’s more so just being willing to learn through their experience.”Some of LandLogic’s training is simply about recognizing bad times for farming – like the current moment. A large new body of research, begun during the farm crisis of the 1980s, has shown that anxiety, depression, substance abuse and suicide go up and down as weather, farm prices and government actions get better or worse.But other aspects are more specific. Therapists, for instance, will learn to identify 10 so-called cognitive distortions, or negative patterns of thinking, that are common to agricultural people – what Anderson calls “barbed-wire thinking”. These include catastrophizing, and what’s known as the “heaven’s reward fallacy”, in which one expects self-sacrifice to always pay off just because that would be fair. Another is “toxic grit”, in which a producer refuses to acknowledge that they’re struggling and keeps toiling away at a task – showing “grit” – even if it won’t work or will cause pain. (LandLogic offers different training tailored to medical doctors, hotline staffers and other professionals.)In early 2023, Jared Auten had just become the director of a 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline forKansas, when a friend told him about the LandLogic training. Auten had about 30 staffers and 60 volunteers at an office in Lawrence, a bustling college town not far from Kansas City. But crisis calls and texts come from all over, including the agricultural counties of western Kansas.“LandLogic jumped out to me,” said Auten, who grew up in rural Osawatomie and recognized the urgent need to reach out to farm folks. “Someone’s thought of how to connect with this population in a creative way.” He got in touch with Anderson and had the whole staff trained.The behavioral health and suicide risks facing farm communities, he says, are many. The isolation is real, particularly in western Kansas where farmers work thousands of acres, with miles and miles between houses. They also have ready access to lethal means in the form of firearms and toxic farm chemicals. And there are very few therapists or even doctors working in farm counties. One of the community mental health centers that Auten’s group worked with covers 19 rural counties. “These communities feel like they’re forgotten about,” Auten said.View image in fullscreenJared Auten, director of crisis communications at HealthSource Integrated Solutions, at their Topeka office.Photograph: Deni Chamberlin/FERNIn 2022 and 2023, Kansas ranked near the bottom in annual state-by-state rankings of mental health resources. With few places to turn to, those in crisis are even more likely to end up dialing 988 – if they call at all.Auten and others point out that, despite progress, the stigma around discussing behavioral health issues is still significant in farm country, especially for men. “In 40 years, I can count on one hand the number of farmers who have come in and said to me: ‘I’m about to lose my ground and I’m depressed about that,’” said Max Meschberger, director of Compass Behavioral Health’s regional office in Scott City, Kansas, a rural town in the far west of the state.Sarah Gideon, executive director of Health Innovations Network of Kansas, a collaboration between 15 hospitals, says this is exactly why she had the medical staff trained in LandLogic. A few years back, she lost a cattle ranching friend to suicide and wondered if there could be a better safety net when there are not enough behavioral health professionals in the area.“We thought that if we could take a tool like LandLogic and bring it to our primary care providers, that they may be the ones that could have better knowledge of their patients,” she said.Anderson and Reznicek put the LandLogic Model online in 2024 and virtual training sessions in English are now available anywhere. They hope the model will be adopted even more broadly – by individuals, governments, agricultural organizations and medical groups – and to refine it with scientific study. The two have been gathering data and have started a collaboration with researchers at Colorado State University to determine how farmers can have the best long-term outcomes.They are aware that Black, Latino or Asian producers, among others, are underrepresented in the materials, just as they are in farm publications or agricultural medicine in general. But as understanding of the agrarian imperative spreads and deepens, this connection to the land is already capturing the imagination of diverse users.Dr Nancy Lucero, a member of the Mississippi Choctaw tribe, owns a 75-acre farm in south-east Colorado, where she grows feed crops like alfalfa, sorghum, oats and corn. A couple of years ago, her community in the Lower Arkansas valley was rocked when six people who were farmers or ranchers died by suicide in just one month. In the last five years, there have been 102 suicides in agriculture-related professions across the state, and they have so affected the community where Lucero lives, the remote town of Rocky Ford, that a local healthcare provider now runs a biweekly meetup program for producers.View image in fullscreenAn Iowa farmer surveys his field in early November after the fall corn harvest.Photograph: Deni Chamberlin/FERNLucero, who’s also a therapist and social work research professor at the University of Denver, decided to take the LandLogic training because she was curious about how a deep connection to the land could also become a risk factor.Too often, she says, farm-stress training focuses on the economics of farming. But people in farm country have feelings about the land, even if they do not own it. “As Native people, we understand the land wants to give to us, and then we have not a transactional relationship with the land – it’s a relationship of gratitude and reciprocity,” she said.Anderson has been thinking about this too. She and her sisters do not intend to take over the family farm, and she has cried some tears over this. It hurts that the legacy ends with her, but not for economic reasons. “I don’t really want to farm, but I’m emotionally connected to the land,” she said.That emotional connection, she says, is what drove her to develop LandLogic. “My story is not a stepchild to agriculture. I still am part of this group.”In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

Photograph: AFP/GettyAs China retaliates against tariffs, it is also making strategic manoeuvres on EU and Asia to maximise opportunitiesByPatrick WintourDiplomatic editorThu 10 Apr 2025 14.26 EDTFirst published on Thu 10 Apr 2025 09.50 EDTShareOn the basis of Napoleon’s dictum “never interrupt your enemy while they are making a mistake”, there was a large incentive for China to do precisely nothing asDonald Trumpdisplayed his determination to lose friends and induce market panic. Indeed, the Chinese advocates of passivity cited a social media meme attributed to President Xi Jinping: “Do nothing. Win.”Initially it was tempting forChinato sit back and watch the US’s former allies recoil at Trump’s disruptive war on globalisation and let them realise that, by comparison, China represented an oasis of stability, modernity and predictability.China instead decided to be far from idle. It foresaw and prepped for this trade war, probably more so than for Trump’s first term, and decided that if the US president imposed on China the kind of tariffs he had suggested on the campaign trail, it would have to mount a counterattack. China insisted its wider-than-expected and swiftly executed package of reprisals, initially set at 34% butincreased to 84%in response to Trump’s tariffs, was a justifiable retaliation.View image in fullscreenEmployees at a factory in Suqian, in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, working earlier this week on a production line of caps to be exported to the US.Photograph: AFP/GettyEven now, with lines of communication into Washington limited, China says it had no desire for this confrontation, but wasforced to reactafter the scale of Trump’s assault. And by making an appeal to the World Trade Organization (WTO), it seeks to project itself as a defender of rules-based trading order. Why, after all, would China favour such a trade war? Trump’s initial tariffs were predicted to cut as much as 2.4 percentage points off China’s growth.By Wednesday night, war was being waged by both sides with every weapon in the field in a crazed and self-destructive bidding war. China’s retaliatory tariffs on the US sat at 84%, with the US’s even higher at an oxygen-free 125%. At these figures there could be virtually no trade between the two world’s largest economies and a complete decoupling would begin.View image in fullscreenA worker installs parts at a power equipment assembly line at an Ariens factory in Brillion, Wisconsin.Photograph: Tim Aeppel/ReutersThe WTO warmed: “This tit-for-tat approach between the world’s two largest economies, which together account for roughly 3% of global trade, carries wider implications that could severely damage the global economic outlook.”China’s diplomatic goal of portraying itself as the innocent victim has been made more complex by Trump belatedly trying to reframe the trade war by suspending tariffs on most other countries to 10% for 90 days, leaving China exposed as the US’s prime target.What began as a generalised American assault on the trading system, an assault that seemed sure to crash the US bond market, infuriating American allies inEuropeand Asia and crushing developing economies, has become a more narrowly focused attack on China.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump talks to reporters about tariffs while in flight on Air Force One on 6 April.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/GettyTrump’s aides tried to cover the tracks of this retreat by saying the isolation of China was the plan all along and the suspension was due to many countries wanting to negotiate new trade deals that would prove advantageous to the US. Those negotiations will, in theory, also provide a chance to press third countries from being Chinese export platforms.But Trump undercut the theory of a well-executed master plan by admitting the bond markets had become a bit “yippy”. In pulling back under pressure, he has probably alighted on a more defensible position that he could have adopted at the outset.View image in fullscreenApple iPhones in a Washington DC store. The US is dependent on China for 73% of its smartphones.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/GettyTrump’s critics will not thank him, accusing him of recklessly endangering the world economy in pursuit of the mirage of a revival of a 19th-century US manufacturing economy. What investor is going to put serious funds into a US factory when its prospects are dependent on a president who apparently sees tariffs as a political weapon to be unloaded on social media at will?Moreover, an insurmountable tariff wall between the world’s two largest economies remains and is unsustainable. The US isdependent on Chinafor 73% of its smartphones, 78% of its laptops and 87% of its video game consoles.China, insisting it will fight to the end, will now have to judge whether it has the firepower to withstand a trade war or find a way to open talks. Since Trump’s first term, the US share of Chinese exports dropped from 19.2% to 14.7%, partly as it diversified through investments elsewhere into the “connector” economies of Asia. But the loss of 15% of China’s export market is still crippling.View image in fullscreenShipping containers at the Port Jersey container terminal in New Jersey, on 8 April.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/GettyChina has already launched a diplomatic charm offensive of sorts, with senior officials from the international department recently touring European and Asian capitals, reminding all those who will listen that China is an oasis of responsibility and a believer in genuine multilateralism.A slick Chinese ministry of foreign affairs video shows how the world faces two choices: the chaos represented by Trump, or the spirit of cooperation offered by China. Another video targets US Republicans by highlighting Ronald Reagan’s opposition to tariffs. And the description of the Chinese as peasants by the US vice-president, JD Vance, leaves even the most ardent China sceptics exasperated.For the moment, the Chinese script writes itself: China is the reliable partner, not the US, with the EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, urged on his visit to Beijing last week to make common cause to stop Trump’s unilateral bullying.There is now a question whether Europe and China can set aside their differences about Chinese trade practices and overcapacity and form an alliance against American disruption.It’s early days, but China, if it gets its messaging right, could find a receptive audience. What has been described as the great reshoring of American jobs and wealth by the White House adviser Stephen Miller, also risks being the great offshoring of American power.China’s charm offensive was first on view at the Munich Security Conference in February when its foreign minister, Wang Yi, called for “an equal and orderly multipolar world”, while JD Vanceunleashed his volleyagainst European elites.View image in fullscreenGermany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, at the Munich Security Conference in February.Photograph: Sven Hoppe/APGabrielius Landsbergis, the former Lithuanian foreign minister, recalls: “China was very active, very supportive and very understanding of European security needs. And later on, when Europe was not invited to Riyadh for the talks on Ukraine, the Chinese reaction was that it’s imperative for Europe to sit at the table.“So they are striking all the right notes, for at least the part of Europe that is really, really worried. I think they are playing the smart, subtle game, much like what Henry Kissinger played in the Soviet Union and China in the 70s. Whether they will be successful, I’m not sure.”In recent weeks, Spain and France have been beating a path towards Beijing’s door. The Spanish prime minister,Pedro Sánchez, is in Beijing on his third visit in two years, and has called for closer trade ties with China as part of an effort to diversify away from the US. He will try to seal lucrative Chinese investment in Spain’s electric car and battery industry.View image in fullscreenXi Jinping and Pedro Sánchez shake hands before a meeting in Beijing on 9 September.Photograph: China Daily/ReutersThe European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, for the first time this week since starting her second term in office in December. The pair defended free trade and agreed to host an EU-China summit in July, although it was not clear whetherXi Jinpingwill attend.There are strict limits on a new European-Chinese relationship, partly due to China’s inflexibility. China’s lenience towards Russia over Ukraine is a huge political barrier. The EU has long seen China’s handling of the Ukraine issue as a test of its credentials as a world power. The EU’s former external affairs minister Josep Borrell said: “China cannot pretend to be a great power but close its eyes or cover its ears when it comes to a conflict that obviously makes it uncomfortable.”A visit to Beijing by the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, on 29 March failed to budge China from its defence of Moscow. Chinese officials say they accept the sanctity of borders and the UN charter, but in practice will do nothing to stop Russia breaching those principles.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If anything, the chaos, including the collapse of the Taiwan stock market (Taiwan suffered its worst one-day fall this week since 1990), makes Taiwan look more vulnerable than ever.Šefčovič told EU trade ministers on Monday that there was no easy compromise between Brussels and Beijing on trade either. The risk of China, faced with huge US tariffs, flooding European markets with cheap goods is self-evident, and extra EU surveillance measures are in place.The problem is real.China’s exports to the EU exceeded imports from the bloc by more than €300bnin 2024, according to EU data, a gap that is roughly twice as large as when Trump first started imposing tariffs in 2018.In condemning the imposition of US tariffs, the commission also accepted Trump’s view that there were some countries that traded unfairly, a reference to China.China/US tradeResearch published this week by theRhodium groupshows a clear correlation between rising Chinese imports into Europe and declining European production. The mix of China’s high overcapacity – and falling prices – on the one hand, and Europe’s rising energy costs on the other is dangerous, the report warned.Collectively, the industries experiencing rising imports from China and falling production in the EU account for 25% of Europe’s manufacturing jobs.These high tariffs, combined with weakened US consumer demand, could lead Chinese exporters to further reduce their prices, incentivise Beijing to let the renminbi depreciate and drive a shift in trade as Chinese exports are redirected toward alternative markets. Other countries are also likely to tighten their own trade barriers in response, meaning if Europe is slow to act, it risks becoming the de facto dumping ground for surplus Chinese production.View image in fullscreenCars and other vehicles for export at a port in Yantai, in eastern China’s Shandong province.Photograph: AFP/GettyIn Asia, China may find it easier to locate allies. Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said: “The uncertain and erratic nature of US trade policy is forcing countries to consider de-risking, not from China, but from the US. In a strategic sense, China is a beneficiary of this bizarre trade policy.”Evan Feigenbaum, a former US assistant secretary of state, argues the three key pillars of US influence in Asia flowed from being a standard setter, security provider and by being an economic demand driver, but all three of these positives are eroding.He said: “A shrinking, relative demand profile, withdrawal from rule-setting pacts, zeroing out foreign aid, capricious visa policies and now a tariff wall erected against Japan, Laos,Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, the Republic of Korea and Cambodia all contribute.View image in fullscreenSouth Korea’s trade, industry and energy minister, Ahn Duk-geun (centre), with Japan’s economy, trade and industry minister, Yoji Muto (left), and China’s commerce minister, Wang Wentao, at the 13th trilateral economic and trade ministers’ meeting in Seoul on 30 March.Photograph: AFP/Getty“The region is filled with pragmatists who can and do navigate all kinds of crazy stuff from outside powers, but that depends greatly on those players being either principled or strategic, and Washington is now neither.”Japanese officials spoke of trying to lobby Trump being equivalent to trying to influence an opaque dictatorship. “No matter who I talk to in the US administration, none of them knows what Trump is thinking,” a senior Japanese government official said. “We don’t even know what Trump wants to negotiate on.”China sees an opportunity. Its commerce minister, Wang Wentao, last week met his Japanese and South Korean counterparts for the first time in five years “to strengthen supply chain cooperation, engage in more dialogue on export controls and deepen collaboration in the digital and green economies”, the Xinhua news agency reported.The three east Asian countries also agreed to resume negotiations on a trilateral free trade agreement that has been on hold since 2019.Xi will visit Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia later this month, three countries clobbered under Trump’s original tariffs. The message from Beijing will be that China is now not just geographically at the centre of Asia, but also a reliable trading partner.But the Chinese president will have to tread a careful path. Vietnam, for example, so dependent on exporting to the US, would resent being dragooned against its national interest into what it sees as a bilateral conflict between two superpowers: China and the US.View image in fullscreenThe Foxconn Technology Group factories at the Quang Chau industrial park in Bac Giang province, Vietnam.

Ryan Hass, from the Brookings Institute, speaking to the Sinicapodcast, said: “Some people see this as a giant opportunity for China, to expand its footprint round the world. Maybe.“They feel this is a structural issue that is not going to resolve itself anytime soon. Their view is to make a virtue of necessity – to use the pressure that President Trump is providing to advance and accelerate their own pre-existing plans, whether it is on self-reliance, more investment, diversifying trade relationships. They are trying to use the pressure from Trump to propel their own plans forward rather than fight him on every issue on every single day.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsChinaXi JinpingAsia PacificDonald TrumpInternational tradefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’ve got all the answersSarah PhillipsThu 10 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 05.43 EDTShareFor people with hay fever, sunny days lounging on the grass can be anything but pleasant. How can you manage the symptoms without forfeiting summer? As the Met Office issuesa “pollen bomb” warning in the UK, allergy doctors advise on the best ways to survive the season.Watch out for the onsetHay fever is not experienced from birth, but develops as we age, explains Prof Adam Fox, a specialist in paediatric allergy at the Evelina London Children’s hospital. In the UK, only 5% of those affected are five- to seven-year-olds and only 10% are 10- to 12-year-olds, he says: “You get to the bigger numbers as you get to later teenage years and early adulthood. There are lots of people who don’t get it until they are in their 20s and 30s.” Twenty-five per cent of UK adults are thought to have a pollen allergy.The condition appears to be growing more prevalent, too, says Dr Sophie Farooque, an allergy consultant at St Mary’s hospital in London and the author ofUnderstanding Allergy. “Climate change is described as Miracle-Gro for plants. They are producing more pollen, so hay fever season is starting earlier and lasting longer,” she adds.Recognise the symptoms“It ranges in severity from sneezing, itching and runny eyes to fatigue, rashes and facial swelling,” says Dr Helen Evans-Howells, a GP who runsan allergy clinic in Dorset. She experienced hay fever symptoms from the age of 10, but nothing was done about it. “It settled, partly I think because, as adults, we don’t tend to go outside as much,” she says. “Then I got dogs. I rememberbeing on a video call for an allergy conference and someone saying: ‘Are you having an allergic reaction?’ because my face was swelling. The dogs had carried the grass pollen in with them and were sitting with me.”Itchy? It’s probably not a coldView image in fullscreenIf in doubt, take an antihistamine and see if it helps.Photograph: CentralITAlliance/Getty Images“Colds don’t make you itch,” says Farooque. “If you’ve got itchy eyes, throat and inner ears, that should make you think it is an allergy.” The time of year should also be a clue, she says. “If in doubt, you could try taking an antihistamine and see if your symptoms settle down a bit.” If you are still unsure, you can take a test, as Evans-Howells did to confirm it was pollen to which she was allergic, rather than dogs.Understand what’s happening to your body“The technical name is seasonal allergic rhinitis, which means inflammation in the lining of the nose due to allergy,” says Fox. “You create allergic antibodies which recognise the specific pollen. They sit in the lining of your nose, lungs and eyes and circulate in your blood. When you start breathing that allergen in, those antibodies recognise that pollen, which triggers a reaction that leads to the release of histamine. When histamine is released in the lining of your nose, it will cause itchiness, sneezing and inflammation. That inflammationwill cause the nasal congestion and runny nose that are the hallmarks of hay fever.”Learn the calendarIn the UK, “if you are allergic to tree pollen, it will cause you trouble from late January through until about April”, says Fox. “If it is grass pollen, it will kick off in April, peak in May and June, then settle down. If it is weed pollen, it might happen a little bit later.” “There are some really unlucky people out there who are allergic to all three,” says Farooque.Be aware of the serious real‑world effects“If you are a child with significant hay fever, you are40% more likelyto drop a grade from your mocks, which are typically at Christmas time, to your summer exams, which are in the middle of the grass pollen season,” says Fox.This is mainly because it hampers the quality of your sleep. “That will affect your mood, your ability to concentrate, your learning and your school performance.”It also affects your reflexes, he says, “to the point that is broadly equivalent to being at the legal limit for drink-driving”.Manage lifestyle factorsView image in fullscreenShowering can remove lingering pollen.Photograph: Yana Iskayeva/Getty Images“Some people will advise closing windows and drying clothes indoors, otherwise you’re going to have pollen attached,” says Evans‑Howells. “Shower after a day out and change your pillowcases each day. People often find that they wake up in the morning quite swollen, probably because they’ve laid in the pollen in their hair all night.” Using an air filter in the bedroom may help a more extreme sufferer get better‑quality sleep, she adds.Evans‑Howells also recommends putting petroleum jelly around the nostrils, an approach with which Farooque agrees: “Put a little at the start of your nose, so it captures the pollen.”Find medication that works for you“The medicines are very safe, effective and let you get on with your life,” says Fox. Farooque explains how they work: “Imagine there is a party next door and the sound is coming through. Well, there are different ways that you could approach it. You could put earplugs in so that you don’t hear the sound. That’s what an antihistamine is – it blocks the effects of histamine. Or you could try to break up the party in the first place. That’s what a steroid nasal spray is. It is getting rid of the cause of the problem [by reducing inflammation], which is why they tend to be a bit more effective.”Dress accordinglyView image in fullscreenDo what you can to minimise direct contact with pollen.Photograph: Roberto Machado Noa/Getty ImagesWear wraparound sunglasses and wide-brimmed hats, advises Evans-Howells: “Anything to try to minimise direct contact with pollen.” Farooque says there is strong evidence for wearing an FFP3 mask: “It has been shown in studies that they will reduce your symptoms.”Use nasal sprays correctly“If you start about two weeks before the pollen season kicks in, it becomes far more effective,” says Farooque. “Rinse your nose out with a saltwater rinse. The spray works better if your nose is not snotty, as it allows the medication to be absorbed by the lining of the nose.“When you put the spray in, whichever hand you use to pick it up, go for the opposite nostril, because that way the nozzle is facing the side of the nose, rather than the bony bit in the middle. When you squirt the spray, do not sniff. If you sniff, you’ll eat the spray.“The other thing to bear in mind is that antihistamines will work within an hour or so, but if you want to break up that hay fever party, it takes at least a week for the nasal steroid to get going.” In other words, don’t quit before it has had the chance to take action and use it for the entire season, which there is no harm in doing, says Evans‑Howells. She says that her hay fever is “completely controlled” by using a combination nasal spray with steroids and antihistamines.Avoid drowsy antihistamines“Avoid the drowsy, first-generation ones such as chlorphenamine – Piriton is the brand name that often gets recommended,” says Fox.“Instead, go for second-generation, non-sedating, long-acting antihistamines such as cetirizine, loratadine or fexofenadine, all of which are available over the counter.” Evans‑Howells says: “If you are already feeling drowsy because of your hay fever, then you’re not going to be helping yourself if you take an antihistamine that is adding to that.”Bulk-buy generic medicationView image in fullscreenBranded and generic antihistamines contain the same active ingredient.Photograph: bymuratdeniz/Getty ImagesThe choice of antihistamines at the pharmacy can be overwhelming, says Farooque. “Patients will tell me: ‘I always buy brand X or brand Y,’ and there is a belief that since it costs more, it must be better. But the active ingredient, the drug, is the same. You’re not getting anything different from the product that’s not branded.” Stock up on cheaper generic medicines online.If over-the-counter options don’t work, see a GP“If you’ve already used the nasal spray and antihistamines and it is still affecting you, then, as perthe NHS guidelines, that would warrant a referral to an allergy team for further assessment for immunotherapy,” says Evans-Howells. “You just have to be a bit pushy and ask for it.”Fox adds: “For most people, antihistamine and nasal spray will do the job. But there are a group of people who, despite that, still really have a miserable time of it. There are fully licensed medications calledsublingual immunotherapythat will really help them. These are grass pollen or tree pollen tablets made of huge doses of the pollen that they are allergic to, which they can put under their tongue from a few months before the season starts. It will retrain their immune system so that they are less sensitive and less allergic to the pollen. Consequently, their symptoms will improve and they will be less reliant on suppressing medication.”For short-term relief, consider oral steroidsFox describes a scenario in which a family is worried about a teenager who has an important exam and is really suffering: “Then there’s nothing like a short course of oral steroids to just reset the system.” These can be prescribed by a GP for “severe, uncontrolled symptoms that are significantly affecting quality of life”, according toNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines.However, Evans-Howells cautions: “Please don’t get Kenalog [triamcinolone acetonide]. Yes, it works, but the risks from it are huge – cataracts, glaucoma, joint damage – which is whythe NHS doesn’t prescribe it. Unfortunately, there are some private GPs who still think it’s acceptable to do so. I would never have it – and I’ve suffered really badly in the past.”Monitor the pollen countView image in fullscreenWarm, windy conditions are likely to make your hay fever worse.Photograph: EThamPhoto/Getty Images“People like to know the pollen count so that they can feel prepared,” says Evans-Howells. “We’d like you to be in a position of symptom control so that it won’t matter to you whether the pollen count is high or low, because we have your symptoms better managed in the first place. But if you know the pollen count is going to be really high, maybe this isn’t the day that you’re going to take a walk in the long grass.”The perfect conditions for hay fever are warm and windy, says Fox. “The temperature causes trees and grass to release their pollen. If it is a bit breezy, it blows it around.” Hay fever symptoms can worsen when pollution is bad, he adds: “It gets further into airways when it is combined withparticulate pollution.”Eating local honey won’t helpPeople often suggest eating local honey. Is there anything in that? “There is no evidence that would help,” says Evans-Howells. “Honey is made from bees pollinating flowers; the problem we have is with tree and grass pollen. It doesn’t make sense.”Be wary of online algorithms offering solutions“They are very clever,” says Evans-Howells. “As soon as you start looking at hay fever, you will be shown the same advert time and time again, which plays on your psyche to think: ‘Oh, it must work.’ But do some research. I acknowledge that not everybody in society likes traditional medicine. Some people will go for quercetin, which is meant to be a more natural antihistamine, but the clinical trials don’t support its benefit, so it’s not something that I recommend. But some people report it helps them.”Don’t go out in thunderstorms“If you’re allergic to grass pollen, some thunderstorms can cause the pollen to fragment. When you breathe it in, it can then give asthma-type symptoms,” says Farooque. “Don’t go running, keep your windows closed and wear a mask if you need to go out during the storm or for an hour or so afterwards.”Be sympathetic“Be kind, because it is horrible,” says Evans-Howells. “It makes you really fearful of this time of year, which sounds ridiculous if you don’t have allergies, but nobody wants to be swollen and have itchy eyes. As more people are affected, the thing I hear is: ‘I had no idea this is how it felt. It is awful.” How it feels when you’re at the peak of a cold – congested, can’t breathe, can’t sleep – that’s how they are feeling, but for the whole of the time that is meant to be enjoyable in the year.”How can you help them? “Maybe cut your lawn before they come round; reducing the length of the grass might help. But I think mostly allergy sufferers would just love people to have some compassion.”Go to the coast“Think about how you are going to plan your days out, perhaps being by the seaside, rather than a picnic in a park”, says Evans-Howells. Farooque adds: “If I could prescribe holidays by the beach, I would. As a general rule, if you’re by the coast, especially if there’s an onshore wind and the pollen is blown out, you will be less symptomatic.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianFor the first time, the man the KGB codenamed ‘the Inheritor’ tells his storyByShaun WalkerThu 10 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 07.51 EDTShareRudi Herrmann took a deep breath and asked his son Peter to sit down. “I have a story to tell you,” he said. Rudi had been preparing for this conversation for several years, running over the words in his mind. He was about to tell his 16-year-old son that everything Peter thought he knew about their family was a lie.The pair sat on a bench, and Peter waited quietly for whatever it was his father wanted to say. He was an academically gifted and unfailingly polite child, but he had been struggling psychologically. He had few friends and felt overwhelmed at home. Rudi, an ambitious German-Canadian film-maker, was charming with colleagues and friends, but with his son he was something of a tyrant: not violent, but psychologically domineering. He was disdainful of American pop culture, insisting that Peter not waste his time on mind-rotting pursuits such as reading comics or listening to rock music. It was almost as if he was actively trying to sabotage Peter’s efforts to fit in.The endless upheavals in Peter’s childhood had not helped him to feel settled. First, the family had moved from Germany to Canada when he was four. Then, when he started feeling at home in Toronto, he was pulled out of his genteel school and transferred to New York, where his new classmates roughed him up for lunch money. His parents had no living relatives, and the six-year age gap between him and his younger brother made it difficult for them to connect.The only part of growing up in the Herrmann family that Peter did enjoy was the frequent travel: summer holidays in Europe and road trips across the US to accompany his dad on filming assignments. At home, his father gave orders; on the road, it felt to Peter that they were more like partners.In spring 1974, they took a trip to Chile. On the way back to New York, they stopped over in Peru. It was here in Lima that Rudi decided the time had come for his big reveal. As they walked through Miraflores, an upmarket neighbourhood of Lima perched on bluffs above the ocean, Rudi ordered his son to sit down on a bench overlooking the water.Rudi explained to Peter that what he was about to tell him had to stay secret. He could not discuss it with his friends, and certainly not with Michael, his younger brother. Peter nodded, and Rudi began: “I am not who you think I am. I am not a German, and I’m not called Rudi. I am a Czech man named Dalibor Valoušek, and I work for the Soviet Union, for the KGB.” His mission as a spy was to work to bring about world peace, he said.Two thoughts coursed through Peter’s mind. For years, he had felt unable to relate to the world and the people in it. Part of that, he was sure, was because he had no family beyond his parents and brother. As his father told him about grandparents, uncles and cousins behind the iron curtain, he wondered whether everything would now change. At the same time, his father’s admission was viscerally shocking. The Russians! The KGB! The thoughts hit him like lightning bolts.Peter had, with the discreet curation of his father, witnessed enough inequality and unfairness in American life to know it wasn’t the paradise that some made it out to be. He had read plenty about Watergate and Vietnam. Even so, he was certain that the Russians were the bad guys. But then, his dad wasn’t a bad guy, and his dad was working for the Russians. So perhaps they were not so bad after all?“Does Mother know?” he asked quietly.“She also is an agent of the KGB,” Rudi told his son.Rudi came to the most important part of the conversation. “Would you be willing to become an intelligence officer like me?” he asked. Peter’s head was spinning, and he didn’t know what to think or say. But he stayed outwardly calm, and nodded his assent.After the conversation, Rudi excitedly messaged his handlers that his son had agreed to sign up. From Moscow, a reply came: the family should travel to the Soviet Union that summer, to formalise Peter’s induction into the KGB and begin his training.More than 50 years later, the man who was once known as Peter Herrmann sat opposite me on a sofa at his house in the suburbs of Washington DC. In the half-century since the conversation in Lima, he had only told the full story of how he was dragged into the KGB twice: once to his wife, shortly before they got married, and once in a series of interviews with me over the past few years.“I was on autopilot,” he said, recalling the first months after his teenage recruitment. “It was really just like: ‘Show that you can do this. Because that’s what your dad wants you to do.’”Peter’s father was what the KGB called an “illegal”, part of Moscow’s most prestigious and secretive spy programme. The agency trained Soviet bloc citizens for years until they could convincingly impersonate westerners, then dispatched them abroad for missions that could last decades. The KGB recruited Rudi in 1955 when he was a 26-year-old student at Prague’s Charles University. They sent him to Halle in East Germany, to undergo intensive language training in preparation for a long mission abroad in which he would pose as a German.Rudi was given the identity of Rudolf Herrmann, a Nazi soldier who had, in reality, perished in the Soviet Union during the war. In Halle, he began a romance with his German teacher, Inge, and after evaluation by the KGB it was agreed the pair could be dispatched abroad as a couple. The KGB had recently started dispatching illegals in pairs, although it was always assumed that the man would be the lead operative. The thinking was that couples could keep a watchful eye on one another in the field, as well as provide mutual support to overcome psychological crises.In late 1957, “Rudi”, Inge and their newborn son, Peter, crossed into West Germany, where they posed as anti-communist East Germans determined to embark on a new life. Before long, they acquired West German passports, and in February 1962 the family left for Canada. They settled in a suburb of Toronto and bought a German deli on Yonge Street, close to the headquarters of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Inge got busy in the kitchen, cooking up large batches of potato salad and baking loaves of dark bread.The deli soon became a hit with Toronto’s German immigrant community, particularly those with rightwing views, who were regaled with tales of Rudi’s supposed wartime heroics. Sometimes, there were after-hours gatherings for regulars, and the men sang Nazi war songs. But there were also visitors from CBC headquarters, whom Rudi took care to befriend. He was an entertaining storyteller and made friends easily. Before long, he got a job as a sound technician at CBC, and studied film-making in his free time.View image in fullscreenRudi Herrmann in the 1970s.Photograph: Elliot HolarThe couple enrolled Peter in a local kindergarten, and in 1963 Inge gave birth to a second son, Michael. The Herrmanns had become a model Canadian family, and in February 1967 they became naturalised citizens, taking the oath of allegiance to the queen in a Toronto courthouse. Ten days later, a radio message from the KGB came with new orders: make all necessary preparations to move to the US.They settled in Hartsdale, an hour’s train ride north of New York City. Peter didn’t know his father had selected the house with specific criteria in mind: it was surrounded by tall trees on all sides except to the east, from where radio messages would arrive, and was set back from the road up a steep driveway, out of sight of curtain-twitching neighbours.After they moved, Rudi cultivated friendships with employees at IBM, whose headquarters at Armonk was not far from his new home. The company commissioned him to make training and sales films, as well as shorts that were meant for screening at conventions. He equipped his basement with cutting-edge darkroom equipment, and IBM colleagues who worked with him on the films came to the Hartsdale house to edit footage. The accoutrements of Rudi’s life as a spy were kept locked away in a desk upstairs, out of the sight of his guests and his two sons. Once a week, he took out his radio and decoded a message from Moscow.For illegals, in-person meetings with their KGB handlers were rare, and usually took place in third countries to lower the risk of the FBI catching the scent. At one of these meetings, in Paris, Rudi was informed that his tasks in the US would be to look out for progressives and to try to penetrate the Hudson Institute, a conservative thinktank the KGB believed was a front for the US government. Rudi pointed out what seemed like an obvious flaw in the plan: he had an excellent degree from Charles University in Prague, but under a different identity. Now, he was a freelance cameraman with no educational qualifications and little excuse to infiltrate a thinktank. The handler shrugged. Rudi should do his best.The awkward exchange reflected the changing nature of the KGB’s most prized spying programme. Back in the 1920s and 30s, illegals had been virtuoso operators, waltzing across borders and switching passports at will, frequently taking on new identities. But by the 1960s, the programme had become more regimented, and the missions much longer in duration. It had become harder to conjure up fake identities that could withstand scrutiny, and the cold war brought with it a vigilant counterintelligence environment, particularly in the US.Many illegals cracked under the pressure of their assignments: some defected, while others had nervous breakdowns or were withdrawn in disgrace. Rudi was one of the success stories, but he was frustrated with his handlers. He wondered if he would ever be able to penetrate government circles in the way they wanted, given his lack of genuine qualifications in the west.It was around this time that the contours of a plan began to form in Rudi’s mind. If he could not deliver what the KGB demanded, perhaps his son could.Children always created a dilemma for illegals. To tell the truth to them was to take an enormous operational risk. What if they blurted something out to friends or teachers? Often, illegals only revealed their identities to their children once they were travelling back to the Soviet Union at the end of their missions.But Rudi had a more radical idea. He wanted to reveal to Peter that his parents worked for the KGB, and to train him to continue their work. Rudi thought that turning his son into a second-generation illegal would kill two birds with one stone: it would save Peter from becoming an ordinary American capitalist and being ripped away from him in the process, and it would provide the KGB with a new kind of operative, who had a real American upbringing and could pass government security checks more easily.Rudi first floated his plan with the KGB two years before he told Peter about it. His handlers were intrigued by the idea of a second-generation illegal, but also wary of causing a potential security breach if it was handled the wrong way. Rudi was told to wait a few years before making his move.View image in fullscreenPeter Herrmann (second from left) with his mother Inge, father Rudi and brother Michael.Photograph: Elliot HolarIn 1974, he took Peter on a trip to Chile, telling his son they would be selling a short educational film to nursing institutions in the country. That, of course, was a cover story. A few months earlier, Gen Augusto Pinochet had launched a coup to topple the leftwing presidency of Salvador Allende, and diplomatic relations between Chile and the Soviet Union were swiftly severed. Rudi’s job was to spend time on the ground and send back a report on the general mood in the country, gauging whether the new regime was going to last.After a fortnight in Pinochet’s Chile, where the post-coup atmosphere was still combustible, the pair made stopovers in Bolivia and in Peru. In Lima, Rudi sat Peter down and made his recruitment pitch, gaining his son’s hesitant agreement. Back in New York, Rudi received detailed travel instructions for a family trip to Moscow in the summer of 1974, once school was finished for the year. Peter was relieved that he had pleased his father by agreeing to the scheme.Peter and Rudi took separate flights to Europe, having agreed to meet in Denmark a few days later. Inge flew with Peter’s younger brother, Michael, to Spain. She dropped him off at a summer camp there and told him she was going to West Germany and would see him in a few weeks. Then she headed to Moscow.A few days after their arrival in Copenhagen, Rudi woke Peter at dawn, and the pair sped to the port and crept aboard a small Soviet freighter docked there. A brusque man showed them to a tiny cabin below deck, sparsely furnished with a bunk bed and small toilet. A grimy half-light emanated from a small porthole. A few times a day, there was a knock at the door, and a tray of food was left for them. At Rudi’s request, the man who brought their meals rustled up some English-language pamphlets on Marxism-Leninism, which Peter leafed through without understanding much. It was his first introduction to the ideology he was now expected to spend his life serving. The journey stretched out for three long days before Peter spotted the docks of Leningrad through the cabin’s filthy window. When they disembarked, they were met by a pair of low-level functionaries, who took them on a tour of the city.Peter felt as if he had stepped on to an alien planet. There were no billboards, the streets were vast and the signs were incomprehensible. In South America, Rudi and Peter had explored on foot; here, they were whisked around by stern men in black Volga limousines. After a day in Leningrad, Rudi and Peter were driven to the railway station, where a private compartment in an overnight express train to Moscow awaited them. On arrival, they took a drive to one of the Stalin-era skyscrapers on the river embankment. To Peter, it looked like a vast castle from a fantasy comic. A safe-house apartment in the building was to be their home in Moscow. Inge was already there. A housekeeper cooked meals for the family, and that first evening the table was set for eight with plates of local delicacies and three glasses per person, for tangy Borjomi mineral water, wine and vodka. Several handlers from Directorate S, which ran the illegals programme, soon arrived for dinner.The handlers asked Peter questions about his life and his plans. He replied politely and with poise, and the Russians seemed impressed. The next morning, a Directorate S man named Andrei came to lambast Rudi about his supposed failures in the field. Rudi screamed back that Andrei was a “miserable peasant” who had no idea how things really worked in the west. Peter, waiting in the next room, could hear the shouting, but he couldn’t make out much of what anyone was saying. He sat quietly and waited for the noise to stop.During their week-long stay in Moscow, the family was discouraged from venturing out alone; the smallest chance that a visiting tourist could recognise them was too much for the handlers to risk. Still, they made occasional outings: the KGB procured tickets for a folk dance performance, which everyone found tedious, and for the circus, which they enjoyed. On another day, Rudi slipped out of the apartment with Peter to show him the Moscow metro. The boy was astounded by the long escalators that seemed to descend into the bowels of the Earth, to eventually reveal the palatial splendour of the platforms. After Moscow, the family flew to spend a couple of days each in Czechoslovakia and East Germany. Peter met the grandparents he never knew he had. Everyone seemed friendly and warm, but the whole experience was difficult for him to digest. He dealt with it by mostly staying quiet.View image in fullscreenOn the family’s first trip to Moscow, in the summer of 1974, Peter was astounded by the metro.Photograph: Angelo Andreas Zinna/AlamyWhen they returned to Moscow, the handlers took Peter out for a day to teach him the basics of evading surveillance. Another man came to the apartment to show him how to write using invisible ink. An old and bumbling technical whiz gave Rudi a new “burst” radio, which would shorten the time it took to transcribe the KGB’s coded messages. The man reminded Peter of a character in Get Smart, the Mel Brooks satire of James Bond, one of his favourite television programmes. In his mind, Peter had imagined attractive, uniformed female agents instructing him, but his teachers were all men.Over another big dinner, a trainer explained to Peter some of the risks and challenges of being an illegal, and asked if he was willing to be inducted into the programme. He explained how important Peter’s parents’ work was, and emphasised that their spying contributed to the preservation of global peace. Peter was told he could make his own decision, but it soon became clear that there was a catch. If the handlers sensed that Peter was not truly willing to become a second-generation illegal, it would be too dangerous for him to return to the US. He already knew too much for that. “You either have to be OK with this, and agree to help with your parents’ mission, or you have to stay here,” one of the men explained to Peter. If he said no, Rudi and Inge would return to the US without him and invent a tragic accident to explain the disappearance of their son.Peter did not want to be separated from his family, so he nodded that he was happy to begin training. His tasks for now would be minimal: to return home, and start his studies at McGill University in Montreal. He was to keep an eye out for left-leaning students and use his newly acquired skills to prepare reports on them, which his father could then forward to Moscow. He should never publicly espouse leftwing or pro-Soviet views publicly, nor should he socialise with communists or Russians. Peter’s training would begin in earnest the next summer, it was agreed, when he would be welcomed back to Moscow for a longer trip. At the end of the night, the men announced they had decided on the code name for Peter’s KGB file. He would be known as Erbe, German for “the Inheritor”.Afew weeks after the family returned home, Peter headed for college. He had completed his last two years of high school in one, partly because he was clever enough to do so and partly because Rudi and Inge hoped a change in environment would ease the loneliness he had felt at school. But by the time he arrived at McGill, Peter was struggling with numerous dilemmas. Would he be able to fulfil his father’s outsized expectations? Would he be able to make friends or meet a girlfriend? Was he really going to work for the KGB for the rest of his life, and would he succeed in not breathing a word of his secret? It was a lot to think about for someone who was still only 16.As always, Peter was outwardly calm. But something inside him was reaching breaking point. He read Freud and other books on psychoanalysis; he studied literature on neurotic disorders. A few months after starting university, he drew a picture of himself, neck in a noose, dangling lifeless from a hangman’s gallows. He gave it the caption “Shit”. He mailed it to his parents without any accompanying note. They did not reply.In May 1975, Peter returned home for the summer. Nobody brought up the cartoon. Peter did not know how to talk about emotions with his father, and Rudi had already forgotten about it, dismissing it to Inge with raised eyebrows as a “college phase”. Instead, Rudi got on with training his son in espionage. He took Peter to New Jersey to demonstrate how “dead drop” operations worked. They spent several hours driving in loops, checking for surveillance, and then made their way to the village of Towaco, about 30 miles west of New York City. Rudi told Peter to toss a line of radiator hose at the base of a large oak tree, and then leave an empty Coca-Cola bottle by another tree, a little further down the road, to indicate the drop had been made. They went to drink coffee and then drove past a third tree, where Rudi pointed out a piece of orange peel. It meant an agent had picked up the drop, he explained, and they could safely drive home. Later that week, he showed Peter how to decode radio messages. He was pleased at how well his son was taking it all in.That summer, Peter made his first solo trip to the Soviet Union. On Rudi’s instructions, he first flew to Vienna, where he met a man who handed him false papers identifying him as a German tourist, along with a ticket for the hydrofoil to Budapest the next day. When the boat arrived, he was met at the dock and driven to a villa in the Buda hills. “Wait here,” the driver told him, and left.Peter spent two days in the pleasant villa, where he was both VIP and prisoner. He was waited on by a housekeeper and gorged on cherries from a tree in the garden, but he could not explore the city. On his third day, the driver returned and took Peter to an airfield where he boarded a military transport plane, which took him to an airbase near Moscow. From there, he was driven back to the same apartment he had stayed in the previous year. He was greeted by someone he recognised as one of his father’s handlers and by a younger man who introduced himself as Viktor.View image in fullscreenPeter Herrmann in the 1970s.Photograph: Elliot HolarOver the next few days, Viktor tutored Peter in spy craft, but told him that most of his training would come on the job, from working with his father. The primary purpose of this visit was to show Peter some of the Soviet Union and inspire loyalty toward the socialist nation. Peter and Viktor first flew south to Volgograd, where they visited The Motherland Calls, a statue of a warrior woman – mouth agape, hair swept back, and brandishing a sword – that towered over the city. It was the tallest monument in the world, Peter was told. Tree-lined paths led up to the base of a complex, a cavernous hall bearing names of the dead.From Volgograd, they flew to Bratsk in the heart of Siberia, the site of a huge dam and hydroelectric plant. Afterwards, there was a fishing expedition on Lake Baikal. Peter and Viktor cast out on to the vast expanse of the lake in a small boat with a couple of locals to guide them. Nobody caught anything. In the end, they spotted another fishing boat nearby and swapped a few bottles of vodka for some freshly caught fish. Viktor cooked up a stew on the boat, which they ate under the stars.When Peter got home and described the trip to his parents, Rudi was furious at the handlers for not providing more explicit instruction in Marxism-Leninism. Perhaps the KGB felt perks and red-carpet treatment would be more effective incentives for a second-generation illegal, raised in the US, than earnest exhortations to Soviet ideology. But Rudi muttered angrily that it was more evidence of the incompetence of his handlers.In early 1976, the centre ordered Rudi to select a new set of dead drop sites, close to the atomic research centre at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He assumed the KGB had an agent on the inside and needed to find a spot to leave money or instructions for them. He took Peter along, to teach him the art of selecting suitable places. Peter soon got the hang of it, and Rudi was impressed when his son found a perfect spot at the back of a small church. Still, he could sense that Peter did not share his ideological affinity with the work.That summer, Peter was meant to travel to the Soviet Union again. But when he arrived in Vienna, a man named Max told him that the plans had fallen through: Peter would not be going to Moscow this time. The next day, over a drink, Peter told Max that he had applied to transfer from McGill to Georgetown, partly because he was not enjoying life in Canada and partly because the KGB had expressed a preference that he transfer to a US university, where he could make better contacts. Max was delighted at the news and told him he should look out for interesting students and write quarterly reports on them for the KGB: anyone with fathers in government, anyone who was strongly progressive, and anyone critical of US foreign policy. Max gave him an address in Mexico to memorise, the place where he was to post his reports. Max bade Peter farewell, leaving him to fill his weeks lounging around Vienna, visiting museums and going to the opera.Peter started at Georgetown in the autumn of 1976. Every now and then, he wrote a letter in invisible ink profiling various fellow students and sent it off to the address Max had given him. He took classes in Arabic, because the KGB felt the language might help him gain access to more interesting government jobs upon graduation. The next spring, Rudi came to visit, and Peter finally found the resolve to tell his father that something was wrong. He explained that the stress of his double life had become too much, and he planned to take a year off from university before his final year. He wanted to spend it somewhere in Europe.“I need a break, and I need to clear my head,” Peter told his father.Rudi was not happy, but agreed they would talk about it when Peter came to New York for the summer. A few weeks later, Peter took the train north, and as he was coming up the escalator at Penn station, he saw his father waiting for him at the top, flanked by two men in suits.“Peter, come with us,” said Rudi. “These men need to talk to you.”The FBI had followed Rudi for months before approaching him disguised as a group of clients who wanted to commission a film. Once they had him alone, they gave him a choice: either life in prison, or cooperate with them as a double agent. Rudi was a devoted communist, but for years he had been frustrated with the unrealistic demands and lack of gratitude from his handlers. For him, cooperating with the FBI offered a way to put one over on the men in Moscow, who he thought had failed to utilise his talents properly. He made his decision quickly, saying he was ready to work with the FBI as long as he was not expected to give up his Marxist beliefs or “kill for America”. The FBI told him to keep his normal communication schedule with the KGB so that Moscow would not suspect anything was wrong.As always, Inge and Peter were not consulted before Rudi made his decision. Although Inge was the quieter half of the couple, her ideological devotion to communism burned more brightly than Rudi’s. She was devastated, worried about the effects on the children and furious at the decision to cooperate with the enemy. Peter was briefly interrogated, but was mostly left to his own devices at Georgetown. Two handlers, one from the FBI and one from the CIA, met with him once a month to check in. The meetings were low-key and sometimes enjoyable; they took Peter to restaurants, a theme park and, on a couple of occasions, even a strip joint. When he graduated, they found him a job at a small lobbying firm in DC. Rudi, in his ongoing communications with Moscow, invented ever more reasons why Peter could not yet return to the Soviet Union for further training.In 1979, the FBI decided the game had gone on long enough. They told Rudi he should prepare to break off all contact with Moscow. Peter would have to get ready to disappear, too. He had been dating a woman in DC for the previous 18 months, but had not yet told her anything about his strange family background. Unwilling to start now, he deliberately escalated one of their arguments to the point that the relationship disintegrated in acrimony. Now, he would not be missed.View image in fullscreenElliot Holar in Washington DC, in March 2025.Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianThe FBI moved the family to an interim safe house in Annapolis, Maryland. In March 1980, they arranged a strange press conference, at which Rudi talked about his work as an illegal, from behind a cloudy screen and with his voice disguised. The aim was to cause maximum embarrassment to the KGB. The FBI men had a certain grudging respect for Rudi and his “scary” level of discipline, one of those involved in the case told me. They were sceptical that the time and expense required to create illegals was justified by the espionage returns, but they also realised that an undetected illegal was always one recruitment away from causing enormous damage.After the press conference, the FBI moved the family again, this time to the west coast. The Herrmanns became the Holars; Rudi chose the surname as it was the name of a Czech artist he liked. Peter wanted something “short but distinctive” for a first name, and decided on Elliot. Moving into witness protection was oddly similar to life as an illegal: starting afresh in a new city, with a new name and the need for a batch of invented but credible tales about childhood and youth should anyone become too curious.At the age of 22, Elliot Holar packed Peter Herrmann into a box, and planned to lock him away for good.Ifirst tracked down Elliot in 2019, having read about his case in leaked KGB documents and a 1980s book where his father had been interviewed after defection. I wrote him a letter asking to interview him for a book project I was just starting, about the history of the KGB illegals programme. A few months later, I received a polite rejection. He had no desire to relive these stories, he told me, but he was not opposed to meeting to hear more about the book. In that first meeting, at a coffee shop near his home in the suburbs of Washington DC, he laid out the broad details of his life since he moved into witness protection.After disappearing in 1980, he had found a job in IT for a company in San Diego and started life afresh. His younger brother, who had been barely a teenager when Rudi was apprehended by the FBI and knew nothing of his parents’ double life, struggled to adapt, however, and was constantly getting into trouble. Their parents remained devoted communists, and in 1986 tried to move the whole family back to Czechoslovakia, but they were denied visas. Instead, they all settled in the Washington DC area – Peter and Michael were both adults now, but Rudi still made the decisions for all four of them.Not long after the move, Elliot began a romance with a woman at work, who a few years later became his wife. They had two children, now grown up, and back when we first met in 2019, Elliot was coming to the end of a long and successful career in the IT sector. His mother died in 2004 and his brother in 2015, after a difficult life complicated by an Asperger’s diagnosis and a lack of understanding from his father, who dismissed his younger son’s developmental issues as laziness.Dalibor Valoušek, AKA Rudi Herrmann, AKA Boris Holar died in 2017, in his late 80s. In the final years, he suddenly began talking about the past, regaling meetings of his seniors book club with endless tales of espionage daring. It is not clear whether the other participants realised these revelations were all true or dismissed them as senile inventions. Elliot wondered whether, now that his father was telling anyone who’d listen about his KGB past, it would attract attention and journalists would come knocking, but none did until my letter.At our first meeting, Elliot told me that even his friends and most of his family did not know about his past, and he did not plan to change that. But gradually, in a series of long discussions over the next few years, he opened up. In the end, he even suggested that I should use his current name, rather than hiding him behind his long-abandoned Peter Herrmann identity. When I first contacted him he was still working, and did not want to draw undue attention to his unusual background in the office, he said. Now, retired, he feels freer. But I also sensed that talking through the events was a way to reclaim parts of his story, after so long feeling like a bit-part player in the shadow of his father.At a later meeting, I asked if he had been forced to invent a complicated web of lies to avoid talking about the past over the years. He told me that, in fact, he was able to rely on most people’s lack of curiosity. He recalled hints not followed up, or anomalies never questioned. “You know, it’s surprisingly easy to not have to tell stories that you don’t want to tell. I’ve only realised that recently, but it’s really amazing,” he said, with a wry smile. “It’s amazing what you can do or say and people won’t notice.”In our most recent meeting, in late February this year, we chatted on the sofas in the basement room of his current suburban home, a few miles from the house where the whole family had moved back in 1986. I asked him if, looking back at the whole story, he is angry with his parents, or with the KGB, for what they put him through.“I’m not angry at anybody,” he answered quickly. “If I was angry at anybody I’d be angry at a lot of people, and what good does that do me? We watch these murder mysteries, and there’s always all these serial killers who decide they’re angry and then they invest their whole lives and their intricate skills in these incredibly insane plots to do serial killings … I’m not like that,” he said.I suggested that there might be an intermediate response between no anger at all and serial killing, and he laughed. When it came to his father, he admitted, he was torn about what he should feel: “In some ways I’m very angry at him, but also I always admired and respected him and thought he was a caring father. And in a lot of ways he was, but not in all of them. Now that I’ve had kids, I just can’t imagine sending my kids off like he did when I was so young.”Operation Condor: the cold war conspiracy that terrorised South AmericaRead moreWhile Elliot’s case is unusual in the century-long history of Moscow’s illegals programme, I told him that all my research suggested that these long-term spying missions had almost always been incompatible with a healthy family life. Illegals could keep their children in the dark, or they could try to drag them into the work. Neither option was conducive to happy outcomes.“Fundamentally, that’s what it comes down to,” said Elliot, nodding in agreement. “I just don’t see why you thought being an illegal and having children was a good idea. I could fault both my parents for that, honestly, because it’s a slippery slope once you start.

The justices directed Xinis to clarify the directive “with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”.The administration, meanwhile, “should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps,” the court directed.Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was living inMarylandand has had a work permit since 2019, was stopped and detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He was deported on 15 March on one of three high-profile deportation flights to El Salvador that also included alleged Venezuelan gang members.Justice department lawyers in a supreme court brief had argued that the judge’s order, by requiring theTrump administrationto “effectuate” Abrego Garcia’s return, had impermissibly encroached on presidential authority on foreign relations in violation of the US constitution’s separation of powers between its judicial and executive branches.“The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge’s bidding,” justice department lawyers wrote.The supreme court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Its three liberal justices on Thursday issued a statement agreeing with the court’s decision, but said they would have denied the administration’s request outright.“To this day, the government has cited no basis in law for Abrego Garcia’s warrantless arrest, his removal to El Salvador, or his confinement in a Salvadoran prison. Nor could it,” liberal justiceSonia Sotomayorwrote in the statement.Sotomayor added that the administration had requested “an order from this court permitting it to leave Abrego Garcia, a husband and father without a criminal record, in a Salvadoran prison for no reason recognized by the law”.Abrego Garcia is married to a US citizen with whom he is raising a US citizen child in addition to his wife’s two children from a prior relationship. He had never been charged with or convicted of any crime, according to Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, who have denied the justice department’s allegation that he is a member of the criminal gang MS-13.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationEl SalvadorMarylandTrump administrationAmericasSonia SotomayorUS supreme courtnewsShareReuse this content"

The Gringo Hunters was set up in 2002 to cooperate with US authorities, and have since arrested more than 1,600 fugitives.These have included formerPlayboy models, Catholic priests and professional athletes, among fraudsters, murderers and paedophiles. The Gringo Hunters learn to spot the telltale signs of an American in Mexico, from stilted Spanish to a prediction for flip flops.This time members of the unit were trying to arrest a suspect in the border city of Tijuana on Wednesday when the man opened fire, hitting Abigail Esparza Reyes, the 33-year-old leader of the unit in the state of Baja California.Local media have reportedly identified the suspect as César Hernández, 34, who in December escaped from state prison in US, where he was serving a life sentence for murder.Hernández’s escape made news at the time withvideo footageshowing him sprinting across a field in an orange jump suit with an officer in pursuit.Months later, the Gringo Hunters allegedly tracked him down to the Colonia Barcelona neighbourhood, about 30 miles from the border, and carried out an operation on Wednesday to arrest him but were met with bullets.Esparza Reyes was hit and pronounced dead at a hospital.Dozens of Mexican security forces from all three levels government, backed up with drones and a helicopter, then pursued the suspect to a house.Nonetheless, Hernández managed to escape their cordon and flee the scene.Local mediareportedthat he managed to do so while running almost naked through the streets, before ducking under a tarp over a car and emerging dressed in a fluorescent green uniform, similar to ones used by transport police, before walking away.The suspect is at large and the manhunt continues.The state governor, Marina del Pilar, posted on social media to express her regret over the death of Esparza Reyes, who had led more than 400 operations to arrest US fugitives in Mexico.“Abigail’s life will be honoured and her death will not go unpunished,” wrote del Pilar.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Failure to register is considered a crime, and people will be required to carry registration documents with them or risk prison time and fines.Registration will be mandatory for everyone 14 and older without legal status. People registering have to provide their fingerprints and address, and parents and guardians of anyone under age 14 must ensure they registered.The registration process also applies to Canadians who are in the US for more than 30 days, such as so-called snowbirds who spend winter months in places like Florida.Federal immigration law has long required that people who aren’t US citizens and live in the US, including those here illegally, register with the government. Those laws can be traced back to the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which came amid growing fears of immigrants and political subversives in the early days of the second world war. The current requirements stem from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.But the requirement that noncitizens register has been enforced only in rare circumstances. In fact, advocates opposing the government say it hasn’t been universally used since it was first introduced in the mid 1940s.Ice director wants to run deportations like ‘Amazon Prime for human beings’Read moreIt was used in a limited way after September 11, when the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System required that all noncitizen males age 16 and older from 25 countries – all but one of them majority Arab or Muslim – register with the US government. The program led to no terrorism convictions but pulled more than 13,000 people into deportation proceedings. It was suspended in 2011 and dissolved in 2016.The Trump administration has argued that the registration requirement has always existed and that officials are simply enforcing it for everyone.The groups that sued say this registration process is expressly to facilitate Donald Trump’s aim of carrying out mass deportations of people in the country illegally.The plaintiffs also say the government should have gone through the more lengthy public notification process before bringing about the change.They argue that the registry puts people who work, contribute to the economy and have deep family ties in the US into a deep bind: do they come forward, register and essentially give up their location to a government intent on carrying out mass deportations, or do they stay in the shadows and risk being charged with the crime of not registering?The government has already asked people subject to the registration requirement to create an account on the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationCanadaDonald TrumpUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But the same court convicted him of backing LeT to provide material support to a plot to commit murder in Denmark.Rana was sentenced to 14 years for his involvement in a conspiracy to attack the offices of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper, which had published cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad.In February, Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes the megacity Mumbai, said that “finally, the long wait is over and justice will be done”.Explore more on these topicsMumbai terror attacksIndiaCanadaPakistanAmericasMumbaiSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

There is no evidence that Ciotta had any links to organised crime.Rome prosecutors will collaborate with counterparts in Colombia, with Italy expected to send a team of investigators to Santa Marta. According to reports in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, one line of inquiry is that Coatti could have been killed by mistake in the context of a “settling of scores” between organised crime groups.Lerber Dimas, a crime expert, told the Colombian news websiteEl Tiempothat the killing bore the hallmarks of the two armed groups operating in the area, Clan del Golfo and the Autodefensas Conquistadores de la Sierra.Norma Vera Salazar, a human rights expert, said there had been a spate of similar crimes. “There is a clear recurring pattern in these crimes: bodies are tortured, dismembered, stuffed into garbage or coffee sacks, and abandoned along rural roads,” she told El Tiempo. “These types of murders are used by self-defence groups to send warning messages, instil fear and mark territory.”Coatti was travelling alone in South America, visiting Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador before arriving on 3 April in Santa Marta, which is surrounded by beaches and mountains and is a gateway to some of Colombia’s most popular tourist destinations. His disappearance was reported the next day.Coatti was born in Italy’s northern Emilia-Romagna region, where his parents live in the town of Alfonsine, close to Ravenna. He was planning to return to Italy for Easter, his uncle Giovanni told the Italian press. “Alessandro was a good, happy person and a brilliant biologist,” he told the local news siteIl Resto del Carlino. “He loved to travel and discover the world.”He added: “We are shocked, what happened is surreal. We have entrusted ourselves to the Italian and Colombian authorities. We want the truth. Alessandro was only 38 years old, with a life ahead of him. We cannot understand why this happened to him, and in that way.”Explore more on these topicsItalyColombiaEuropeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Every inch of this continent has indigenous history and stories like this. Help me call out this ignorant and racist behaviour.”Kabloona said the matter had affected the community because many people who lived traditional nomadic lifestyles had died, raising concerns that cultural practices would gradually be lost to time.Maps“The article hit people really hard in a very sensitive spot because of our history and the difficulties we face every day in combatting western colonialism,”she told the BBC.“This woman is coming here from such a place of privilege and ignorance that it seems dangerous. It was almost like she was bringing back news of a new continent to Europe and saying: ‘There’s nobody here!’ We were and still are.”She added: “It’s such a clear example of how colonialism benefits from dispossessing Indigenous people of their land and writing us out of history.”Hempleman-Adams wrote on her expedition website before departure: “Parks Canada has confirmed there are no historical records of a female solo attempt from Qikiqtarjuaq to Pangnirtung.”Kabloona said this was because crossing the terrain was considered “a normal way of life for them”.Hempleman-Adams, a producer living in London and the youngest British woman to ski to the north pole aged 15, said: “It was never my intention to misrepresent any historical achievements or cause distress to local communities.“Before undertaking the expedition, I researched and verified the accuracy of my claim with Parks Canada and local outfitters in both towns who confirmed that there was no known female solo winter crossing from Qikiqtarjuaq to Pangnirtung.“However, if this information is incorrect, I apologise unreservedly for making an incorrect claim and for causing offence.”She added she was “truly saddened” that coverage of her trek “may have caused concern or upset … I remain committed to learning from this experience and engaging with the community with the utmost respect.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsCanadaIndigenous peoplesAmericasNational parksnewsShareReuse this content"

He is also due to visit Hainan and Hong Kong.Alexander’s trip, which does not appear to have been publicised anywhere by the UK or Chinese governments, coincided with an unannounced visit to China by Adm Sir Tony Radakin, the head of the British military, for the first time in a decade.Alexander held talks with Chinese counterparts at a time when Beijing’s trade dispute with the US was intensifying, and while ministers have been locked in talks with British Steel’s owner, Jingye.A government source said Alexander’s trip was pre-planned and unrelated to Donald Trump’s tariffs or the negotiations over the future of British Steel, with no talks planned with Jingye. The department said Alexander was promoting British exports and was due to give a speech at a Chinese consumer expo.China’s defence ministry said Radakin had discussed strengthening military cooperation with a country that the UK officially describes as posing a “systemic challenge”.Radakin met Gen Liu Zhenli, the chief of staff of China’s central military commission, on Wednesday, the defence ministry said in a short statement published on its website.“The two sides conducted in-depth exchanges on China-UK relations and [military-to-military] relations, international and regional situations and issues of common concern, and had communication on strengthening exchanges and cooperation between the two militaries,” the ministry said.British sources said it was in the country’s interest to maintain robust military communications with China – and to engage in “firm conversations” about the importance of peace in the Indo-Pacific.Radakin posteda statement on Xsaying he and his Chinese counterpart had “held talks on a range of security issues” and “agreed that in an unstable world we must play our part as responsible nations with global interests, and we reflected on the importance of military-to-military communications”.Some British politicians critical of China expressed surprise at Radakin’s visit. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said his jaw had dropped when he learned about it.“The Labour government is kowtowing to China, but they shouldn’t make the military follow them,” he said. “The most astonishing and alarming thing is to watch China being treated as an ally and friend, a country that trashed the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong and has arrested peaceful democracy campaigners.”View image in fullscreenTony Radakin had ‘in-depth exchanges on China-UK relations … international and regional situations and issues of common concern’, Beijing said.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/APAlistair Carmichael, a Liberal Democrat MP, said: “On any view this has got to be worrying because we know that China is not a trusted partner commercially and if you can’t trust them commercially then how can you trust them militarily?”Frances D’Souza, a cross-bench peer and member of the all-party parliamentary group on Taiwan, said: “I have to say that it does not bode well for a robust UK policy on supporting a democratic Taiwan … This drives a hole through any possibility of having a coherent policy.”It is the first time a UK chief of defence staff has visited China since 2015, when Britain was trying to foster a “golden era” of relations. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, made a state visit to the UK the same year.Relations have deteriorated since as China has aggressively asserted its control over Hong Kong, a former British colony. It has also been accused of spying on the UK and acting as a“decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraineby supplying components for munitions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two senior British ministers – the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves – have visited China in an effort to maintain positive economic relations despite the security concerns, with senior Chinese government figures paying visits to London as well. Reeves said a long-term relationship with China was “squarely in our national interest” on hertrip in January.Radakin is reported to have given a speech to students at the People’s Liberation Army National Defence University, which specialises in military education.The Timesreported that he had defended the post-second world war security order and emphasised the value of alliances.Trump introducedtariffs on China totalling 145% on importsto the US this week, prompting Beijing to retaliate with an 84% levy of its own. Beijing said on Thursday that a trade war would end in failure for the US after Trump had accused China of “ripping off the USA” with cheap imported goods.The UK defence secretary, John Healey, co-hosted a meeting of defence ministers from 30 countries at Nato headquarters in Brussels on Thursday to discuss increasing pressure on Russia over Ukraine.He told his counterparts: “We cannot jeopardise the peace by forgetting about the war. The daily reality for millions of Ukrainians continues, drone attacks, missile strikes, brutal fighting on the frontline, so we must put more pressure on President Putin to end his war and we must step up support for Ukraine.”The discussions focused on planning for a “reassurance force” that could be deployed in Ukraine in the event of a peace agreement. The prospect of a ceasefire seems distant after Russia effectively rejected a US-backed proposal for a 30-day pause in hostilities.The UK is to announce today that it will provide funding for a new £450m “surge” of military support for Ukraine as John Healey, the defence secretary, and his German counterpart host a meeting of 50 nations. Britain is providing £350m for drones and military repairs, while Norway will also contribute.Addressing the group, Healey will say it is “vital to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position and pile pressure on Putin to help force him to end this terrible war”.Reeves will travel to Poland on Friday for an informal meeting of European finance ministers to discuss defence spending. A Treasury source said: “A strong economy needs a strong national defence. That is why the chancellor will be travelling to Warsaw to make the case for deeper defence financing cooperation with our European allies so together we deliver greater economic and national security in a changed world.”Russia carried out airstrikes against Kyiv earlier in the week, while Ukraine claimed to havecaptured Chinese nationalsfighting for the Russian army. China’s foreign ministry said it was verifying the situation, but rejected Kyiv’s accusation that more Chinese citizens were involved in the fighting as groundless.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryDefence policyTrade policyChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Thetreaty principles bill– tabled by the minor libertarian Act Party – proposed abandoning a set of principles that courts and parliament have developed over decades to guide the relationship between the crown and Māori, in favour of its own.Act has argued that Māori have been afforded different political and legal rights and privileges compared with non-Māori, because of the way the treaty has been interpreted.National, the biggest party in the ruling coalition with Act and New Zealand First, promised it would support the bill through its first reading and the select committee process, but did not commit to supporting it further.Proceedings in parliament were briefly halted on Thursday afternoon, after a protester in the public gallery interrupted the speech of Act’s leader, David Seymour. After the man’s removal, Seymour said he would continue to “fight for the truth that all Kiwis are equal”.“I am proud that my party has had the bravery, the clarity and the patriotism to raise uneasy topics, and I challenge other parties to find those qualities in themselves and support this bill,” Seymour said.But Act cut a lonely figure as National and New Zealand First MPs made good on their promises to vote against the bill, alongside the opposition who stood and applauded after the vote. In the end, the vote was 11 in favour, with 112 against. Afterwards, members of the public gallery and politicians from across the political divide sang a Māori song.Prime minister Christopher Luxon was absent for the reading, leaving his justice minister Paul Goldsmith to speak on behalf of National, who said the bill was “a crude way to deal with a very sensitive topic”.But New Zealand was “not so fragile that we can’t withstand a debate about the role of the treaty”, Goldsmith said. “The critical thing is that we try our best to conduct that conversation with good grace … and I have every confidence that we can continue to find a way through.”Labour leader Chris Hipkins called it a “grubby little bill born from a grubby little deal”. “It has had a colossal impact on the fabric of our nation, and this bill will for ever be a stain on our country.”Hipkins said the bill was “based on a mythology” that Māori have special privilege. By nearly every metric, Māori fare worse that non-Māori, be it life expectancy, house ownership, health and education outcomes, or income.Hipkins criticised National and New Zealand First for failing to bin the bill earlier.“Not one National MP should walk out of this debating chamber today with their heads held high, because when it comes to this debate, they led nothing, they stopped nothing, and they stood for nothing.”Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, who led the viralhaka in parliamentagainst the bill, said the bill had been “annihilated” by the hundreds of thousands of voices who opposed it.“This ignited an emotion that echoed with all walks of life, all races, all ages and all genders.”Battle for rights far from overOver the past year, the billgenerated widespread criticismfrom lawyers, academics, politicians and the public who believed the new principles would weaken Māori rights, remove checks on the Crown and drive anti-Māori rhetoric. A Waitangi Tribunal report said if enacted, the bill would be “the worst, most comprehensive breach of the Treaty … in modern times”.The first reading of the bill in November, prompted Maipi-Clarke’s haka, during which she ripped up a copy of the bill. Three days later,the largest ever protest over Māori rightsdescended on parliament in opposition to the bill.Last week, a parliamentary committeerecommended the bill should not proceed, revealing 90% of a record-breaking 300,000 public submissions opposed it.The bill’s demise may end this particular debate over the treaty, but for many who opposed it such asEru Kapa-Kingi– the leader of the historic protest – the battle for Indigenous rights is far from over.Since taking office in November 2023, the coalition government’s broaderpolicy direction for Māori– including sweeping rollbacks to policies designed to improve Māori health and wellbeing, scaling back the use of Māori language in public services and defunding Māori initiatives – hasignited condemnation, protests,mass meetings of Māori leaders, and multiple claims to the Waitangi Tribunal – an institution the investigates the crown’s breaches of the treaty.Prime minister Christopher Luxon has said services should be provided on thebasis of need, not raceand the government intends to“deliver outcomes for everybody”.“There’s a whole catalogue of terrible policy and terrible law being pushed through by this government,” Kapa-Kingi said.Policies such as Act’s proposedregulatory standards billhave “fundamentally the same intentions” but were “more alarming because they are flying under the radar”, Kapa-Kingi said. The proposed bill is presented as method to improve the productivity and quality of regulation, but scholars and Māori leaders believe it will prioritise private property interests over the crown’s treaty obligations to Māori.In a statement to the Guardian, Seymour said he would be “happy to address” Kapa-Kingi’s concerns.“If he can provide a reason why he thinks that based on what the regulatory standards bill says I’d be happy to address it. Given the bill is still being drafted, and hasn’t been publicly released yet, it’s hard to know what he’s talking about.”Still, for Kapa-Kingi, the galvanising of Māori and non-Māori against the treaty bill represented hope for the future of Indigenous rights.“For the last year … the loudest voices have been those that have frankly been disparaging and racist towards [Māori] and diminishing towards our rights,” Kapa-Kingi said.“Now, we can confidently say that they’re simply a loud minority.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandMāoriAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They also questioned both on the US military presence inSouth Korea, and whether it should be shielded from personnel cuts.Both said the current US forces there and across the Indo-Pacific region are critical for both diplomacy in the region and US national security, as ties betweenRussiaand China grow. The US has 28,500 military personnel in South Korea.Paparo saidNorth Koreais sending “thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of artillery shells” and thousands of short-range missiles to Russia. The expectation, he said, is that Pyongyang will receive air-defense and surface-to-air missile support.“It’s a transactional symbiosis where each state fulfills the other state’s weakness to mutual benefit of each state,” Paparo said.Brunson said North Korea has shown the ability to send munitions and troops to Russia while advancing development of its own military capabilities, including hypersonic weapons. Pyongyang, he said, “boasts a Russian-equipped, augmented, modernized military force of over 1.3 million personnel”.North Korea’s efforts to develop advanced nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles “pose a direct threat to our homeland and our allies”, Paparo added.North Korea alsohas sent thousands of soldiers to fight with the Russians against Ukraine. And the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Wednesday that Russia is actively recruiting Chinese citizens to fight alongside its forces in the Ukraine war. He said more than 150 such mercenaries are already active in the battle with Beijing’s knowledge.China has called the accusation “irresponsible”.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryAsia PacificRussiaNorth KoreaChinaUkraineTaiwannewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: AFP/GettyAs China retaliates against tariffs, it is also making strategic manoeuvres on EU and Asia to maximise opportunitiesByPatrick WintourDiplomatic editorThu 10 Apr 2025 14.26 EDTFirst published on Thu 10 Apr 2025 09.50 EDTShareOn the basis of Napoleon’s dictum “never interrupt your enemy while they are making a mistake”, there was a large incentive for China to do precisely nothing asDonald Trumpdisplayed his determination to lose friends and induce market panic. Indeed, the Chinese advocates of passivity cited a social media meme attributed to President Xi Jinping: “Do nothing. Win.”Initially it was tempting forChinato sit back and watch the US’s former allies recoil at Trump’s disruptive war on globalisation and let them realise that, by comparison, China represented an oasis of stability, modernity and predictability.China instead decided to be far from idle. It foresaw and prepped for this trade war, probably more so than for Trump’s first term, and decided that if the US president imposed on China the kind of tariffs he had suggested on the campaign trail, it would have to mount a counterattack. China insisted its wider-than-expected and swiftly executed package of reprisals, initially set at 34% butincreased to 84%in response to Trump’s tariffs, was a justifiable retaliation.View image in fullscreenEmployees at a factory in Suqian, in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, working earlier this week on a production line of caps to be exported to the US.Photograph: AFP/GettyEven now, with lines of communication into Washington limited, China says it had no desire for this confrontation, but wasforced to reactafter the scale of Trump’s assault. And by making an appeal to the World Trade Organization (WTO), it seeks to project itself as a defender of rules-based trading order. Why, after all, would China favour such a trade war? Trump’s initial tariffs were predicted to cut as much as 2.4 percentage points off China’s growth.By Wednesday night, war was being waged by both sides with every weapon in the field in a crazed and self-destructive bidding war. China’s retaliatory tariffs on the US sat at 84%, with the US’s even higher at an oxygen-free 125%. At these figures there could be virtually no trade between the two world’s largest economies and a complete decoupling would begin.View image in fullscreenA worker installs parts at a power equipment assembly line at an Ariens factory in Brillion, Wisconsin.Photograph: Tim Aeppel/ReutersThe WTO warmed: “This tit-for-tat approach between the world’s two largest economies, which together account for roughly 3% of global trade, carries wider implications that could severely damage the global economic outlook.”China’s diplomatic goal of portraying itself as the innocent victim has been made more complex by Trump belatedly trying to reframe the trade war by suspending tariffs on most other countries to 10% for 90 days, leaving China exposed as the US’s prime target.What began as a generalised American assault on the trading system, an assault that seemed sure to crash the US bond market, infuriating American allies inEuropeand Asia and crushing developing economies, has become a more narrowly focused attack on China.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump talks to reporters about tariffs while in flight on Air Force One on 6 April.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/GettyTrump’s aides tried to cover the tracks of this retreat by saying the isolation of China was the plan all along and the suspension was due to many countries wanting to negotiate new trade deals that would prove advantageous to the US. Those negotiations will, in theory, also provide a chance to press third countries from being Chinese export platforms.But Trump undercut the theory of a well-executed master plan by admitting the bond markets had become a bit “yippy”. In pulling back under pressure, he has probably alighted on a more defensible position that he could have adopted at the outset.View image in fullscreenApple iPhones in a Washington DC store. The US is dependent on China for 73% of its smartphones.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/GettyTrump’s critics will not thank him, accusing him of recklessly endangering the world economy in pursuit of the mirage of a revival of a 19th-century US manufacturing economy. What investor is going to put serious funds into a US factory when its prospects are dependent on a president who apparently sees tariffs as a political weapon to be unloaded on social media at will?Moreover, an insurmountable tariff wall between the world’s two largest economies remains and is unsustainable. The US isdependent on Chinafor 73% of its smartphones, 78% of its laptops and 87% of its video game consoles.China, insisting it will fight to the end, will now have to judge whether it has the firepower to withstand a trade war or find a way to open talks. Since Trump’s first term, the US share of Chinese exports dropped from 19.2% to 14.7%, partly as it diversified through investments elsewhere into the “connector” economies of Asia. But the loss of 15% of China’s export market is still crippling.View image in fullscreenShipping containers at the Port Jersey container terminal in New Jersey, on 8 April.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/GettyChina has already launched a diplomatic charm offensive of sorts, with senior officials from the international department recently touring European and Asian capitals, reminding all those who will listen that China is an oasis of responsibility and a believer in genuine multilateralism.A slick Chinese ministry of foreign affairs video shows how the world faces two choices: the chaos represented by Trump, or the spirit of cooperation offered by China. Another video targets US Republicans by highlighting Ronald Reagan’s opposition to tariffs. And the description of the Chinese as peasants by the US vice-president, JD Vance, leaves even the most ardent China sceptics exasperated.For the moment, the Chinese script writes itself: China is the reliable partner, not the US, with the EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, urged on his visit to Beijing last week to make common cause to stop Trump’s unilateral bullying.There is now a question whether Europe and China can set aside their differences about Chinese trade practices and overcapacity and form an alliance against American disruption.It’s early days, but China, if it gets its messaging right, could find a receptive audience. What has been described as the great reshoring of American jobs and wealth by the White House adviser Stephen Miller, also risks being the great offshoring of American power.China’s charm offensive was first on view at the Munich Security Conference in February when its foreign minister, Wang Yi, called for “an equal and orderly multipolar world”, while JD Vanceunleashed his volleyagainst European elites.View image in fullscreenGermany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, at the Munich Security Conference in February.Photograph: Sven Hoppe/APGabrielius Landsbergis, the former Lithuanian foreign minister, recalls: “China was very active, very supportive and very understanding of European security needs. And later on, when Europe was not invited to Riyadh for the talks on Ukraine, the Chinese reaction was that it’s imperative for Europe to sit at the table.“So they are striking all the right notes, for at least the part of Europe that is really, really worried. I think they are playing the smart, subtle game, much like what Henry Kissinger played in the Soviet Union and China in the 70s. Whether they will be successful, I’m not sure.”In recent weeks, Spain and France have been beating a path towards Beijing’s door. The Spanish prime minister,Pedro Sánchez, is in Beijing on his third visit in two years, and has called for closer trade ties with China as part of an effort to diversify away from the US. He will try to seal lucrative Chinese investment in Spain’s electric car and battery industry.View image in fullscreenXi Jinping and Pedro Sánchez shake hands before a meeting in Beijing on 9 September.Photograph: China Daily/ReutersThe European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, for the first time this week since starting her second term in office in December. The pair defended free trade and agreed to host an EU-China summit in July, although it was not clear whetherXi Jinpingwill attend.There are strict limits on a new European-Chinese relationship, partly due to China’s inflexibility. China’s lenience towards Russia over Ukraine is a huge political barrier. The EU has long seen China’s handling of the Ukraine issue as a test of its credentials as a world power. The EU’s former external affairs minister Josep Borrell said: “China cannot pretend to be a great power but close its eyes or cover its ears when it comes to a conflict that obviously makes it uncomfortable.”A visit to Beijing by the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, on 29 March failed to budge China from its defence of Moscow. Chinese officials say they accept the sanctity of borders and the UN charter, but in practice will do nothing to stop Russia breaching those principles.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If anything, the chaos, including the collapse of the Taiwan stock market (Taiwan suffered its worst one-day fall this week since 1990), makes Taiwan look more vulnerable than ever.Šefčovič told EU trade ministers on Monday that there was no easy compromise between Brussels and Beijing on trade either. The risk of China, faced with huge US tariffs, flooding European markets with cheap goods is self-evident, and extra EU surveillance measures are in place.The problem is real.China’s exports to the EU exceeded imports from the bloc by more than €300bnin 2024, according to EU data, a gap that is roughly twice as large as when Trump first started imposing tariffs in 2018.In condemning the imposition of US tariffs, the commission also accepted Trump’s view that there were some countries that traded unfairly, a reference to China.China/US tradeResearch published this week by theRhodium groupshows a clear correlation between rising Chinese imports into Europe and declining European production. The mix of China’s high overcapacity – and falling prices – on the one hand, and Europe’s rising energy costs on the other is dangerous, the report warned.Collectively, the industries experiencing rising imports from China and falling production in the EU account for 25% of Europe’s manufacturing jobs.These high tariffs, combined with weakened US consumer demand, could lead Chinese exporters to further reduce their prices, incentivise Beijing to let the renminbi depreciate and drive a shift in trade as Chinese exports are redirected toward alternative markets. Other countries are also likely to tighten their own trade barriers in response, meaning if Europe is slow to act, it risks becoming the de facto dumping ground for surplus Chinese production.View image in fullscreenCars and other vehicles for export at a port in Yantai, in eastern China’s Shandong province.Photograph: AFP/GettyIn Asia, China may find it easier to locate allies. Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said: “The uncertain and erratic nature of US trade policy is forcing countries to consider de-risking, not from China, but from the US. In a strategic sense, China is a beneficiary of this bizarre trade policy.”Evan Feigenbaum, a former US assistant secretary of state, argues the three key pillars of US influence in Asia flowed from being a standard setter, security provider and by being an economic demand driver, but all three of these positives are eroding.He said: “A shrinking, relative demand profile, withdrawal from rule-setting pacts, zeroing out foreign aid, capricious visa policies and now a tariff wall erected against Japan, Laos,Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, the Republic of Korea and Cambodia all contribute.View image in fullscreenSouth Korea’s trade, industry and energy minister, Ahn Duk-geun (centre), with Japan’s economy, trade and industry minister, Yoji Muto (left), and China’s commerce minister, Wang Wentao, at the 13th trilateral economic and trade ministers’ meeting in Seoul on 30 March.Photograph: AFP/Getty“The region is filled with pragmatists who can and do navigate all kinds of crazy stuff from outside powers, but that depends greatly on those players being either principled or strategic, and Washington is now neither.”Japanese officials spoke of trying to lobby Trump being equivalent to trying to influence an opaque dictatorship. “No matter who I talk to in the US administration, none of them knows what Trump is thinking,” a senior Japanese government official said. “We don’t even know what Trump wants to negotiate on.”China sees an opportunity. Its commerce minister, Wang Wentao, last week met his Japanese and South Korean counterparts for the first time in five years “to strengthen supply chain cooperation, engage in more dialogue on export controls and deepen collaboration in the digital and green economies”, the Xinhua news agency reported.The three east Asian countries also agreed to resume negotiations on a trilateral free trade agreement that has been on hold since 2019.Xi will visit Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia later this month, three countries clobbered under Trump’s original tariffs. The message from Beijing will be that China is now not just geographically at the centre of Asia, but also a reliable trading partner.But the Chinese president will have to tread a careful path. Vietnam, for example, so dependent on exporting to the US, would resent being dragooned against its national interest into what it sees as a bilateral conflict between two superpowers: China and the US.View image in fullscreenThe Foxconn Technology Group factories at the Quang Chau industrial park in Bac Giang province, Vietnam.

Ryan Hass, from the Brookings Institute, speaking to the Sinicapodcast, said: “Some people see this as a giant opportunity for China, to expand its footprint round the world. Maybe.“They feel this is a structural issue that is not going to resolve itself anytime soon. Their view is to make a virtue of necessity – to use the pressure that President Trump is providing to advance and accelerate their own pre-existing plans, whether it is on self-reliance, more investment, diversifying trade relationships. They are trying to use the pressure from Trump to propel their own plans forward rather than fight him on every issue on every single day.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsChinaXi JinpingAsia PacificDonald TrumpInternational tradefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The commission does however have staff who respond to phone inquiries and visit facilities.Guardian Australia contacted the Coalition campaign for clarity on whether the commission would be exempt from a hiring freeze. No response was received before deadline.“This is the agency responsible for ensuring aged care is safe and accountable – slashing its staffing will leave it unable to do that critical job,” said Melissa Donnelly, the national secretary of the CPSU.“It also highlights how chaotic and poorly thought through Peter Dutton’s public service cuts are.

It enables us to be proactive.”Last year, Guardian Australia confirmed the federal government rejected some quality and safety audits conducted by four consultancy firms as they did not meet the standard required. The firms were paid more than $40m for the work.The same firms reported 520 real, potential or perceived conflicts of interest.In response, the commission established a specialist unit to improve the work of consultants and hired more public servants to slowly phase out their use.On Thursday, Coalition frontbencher and shadow minister for government efficiency, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, was asked which departments the federal government would source the 41,000 jobs from.“We are not sure as yet,” Jacinta Nampijinpa Price told the ABC. “We need to consider what happens after we have taken an audit of the situation.”Anthony Albanese said “you can’t cut 41,000 public servants without having a severe impact on what is delivered”.Explore more on these topicsAged careAustralian election 2025CoalitionAustralian politicsPeter DuttonnewsShareReuse this content"

But after widespread reports ofpeople being denied entryto the US and travellers beingdetained, Fraser sought advice from an immigration lawyer.“I asked [the lawyer] what I thought was a ridiculous question – that I do political satire and have a fair few jokes floating around on Elon Musk and Donald Trump, and whether that would be a risk,” Fraser told Guardian Australia.“I thought I was being paranoid, but she said it might [pose a risk] and they’d almost certainly Google me. She said while the vast majority of people will be able to travel in and out … they’re definitely doing increased scrutinising.“If I didn’t have two children, I might be more open to taking a risk, but the vision of me being there with a baby strapped to me and held up and hassled, or worse … I’m not up for that.”According toimmigration law group Reeves“the US government is relying on social media screening more and more during the vetting process to gather extensive information”, noting an online presence offers insights into “interests, associations and potential security concerns”.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterForeigners have had their devices searched at the US border and beendenied entry, including a French scientist who hadmessages on his phone critical of Donald Trump.Travellers have been incarcerated in Ice detention centres and held for weeks, including GermansLucas Sielaff,Fabian SchmidtandJessica Brösche; British graphic artistRebecca Burkeand Canadian businesswomanJasmine Mooney.Fraser has been a regular critic of Trump as a contributor to political podcasts and radio shows,telling the Sydney Morning Herald in 2020: “I wouldn’t take an IOU from Trump if he wrote it on the money he owed me.”She appeared at the Melbourne International comedy festival this week as part of the satirical political podcastA Rational Fear– billed as a “federal election special” or a “how to evade deportation” special.Fraser lived and worked in the US on an internship visa more than a decade ago. She said the planned May visit was a “real opportunity” to promote her book, but travellers now “don’t know what to expect”.“There’s a sense of unreality, this country which has presented itself as very stable, in terms of freedom of speech, is now behaving very unpredictably,” she said.“People who have always been OK will probably still be OK but people on the margins will be discouraged – and that’s disappointing.

After an$8.5bn attempt by Tapestry– the American group that owns Coach and Kate Spade – to acquire Capri was blocked last year by the US Federal Trade Commission, Capri has been under pressure to sell off Versace to reduce its debt. According to those close to the deal, Prada was one of the earliest bidders.In a statement confirming the news, Prada’s group chair and executive director Patrizio Bertelli said the group was “ready and well positioned to write a new page in Versace’s history”. Bertelli added that both companies “share a strong commitment to creativity, craftsmanship and heritage”.While Capri failed to create an American luxury group to rival fashion companies such as LVMH and Kering, the acquisition hints at an attempt by Prada to strengthen its position as an Italian powerhouse. Versace will join the fashion brands Prada and Miu Miu, the footwear brands Church’s, Car Shoe and Luna Rossa, the America’s Cup sailing team Luna Rossa and the pastry brand Marchesi.It is not the first endeavour by Prada to add to its portfolio. In 1999, it acquired Jil Sander and Helmut Lang and, in 2000, it added Alaia to its lineup. However, by 2007, after a series of disputes and financial challenges, it had parted ways with all three brands. Now, the Versace acquisition offers them another opportunity to intensify the global reach of the Made inItalygroup.While the luxury fashion market has been facing a significant slowdown, the Prada Group has enjoyed rare success. It reported revenues of €5.4bn in 2024, 17% higher than the previous year. This increase was partly driven by Miu Miu – the brand behind those viral micro-miniskirts and satin ballet shoes – which has almost doubled its profits this year, hitting close to £1bn in sales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, Versace will take up the role of chief brand ambassador, overseeing the house’s red-carpet dressing and philanthropic work.Prada and Versace are often pitted against each other as Italian fashion rivals, but their designs are diametrically opposed. Versace champions the traditional tropes of femininity with unabashed enthusiasm – see high hemlines, high heels, big hair. Miuccia Prada, who holds a doctorate in political science and, prior to joining the family business in 1970 was a Communist, is often referred to as “fashion’s intellectual”.

They owed large sums to Swedish and Danish tax authorities. They have since set up a business inGuatemala.The story behind their disappearance and the abandoned human waste was revealed this week after an investigation by the newspapers Politiken and Dagens Nyheter. It also found that the couple had allowed wastewater to run into the forest and alleged that animals had died as a result of being left outside and that others were abandoned.Couple who ran Swedish eco-retreat fled leaving behind barrels of human wasteRead moreHansen and Helbæk’s actions were described by local authorities as “environmental crime”. However, on Thursday, the couple claimed they were acting lawfully.Commenting on the barrels left behind from their compost toilets, they said in a post on social media: “For people in ruralSwedenit’s a very normal thing.”They added: “It’s also a very important part of the permaculture principles that you deal with your own shit.”View image in fullscreenThe barrels of human waste left behind.Photograph: www.dn.seThe property’s new owner is aware of the barrels and they can be used for compost, they said. “Half of them are ready to use this spring, the other half is ready in 1 year, following the guidelines of Swedish law.”But Daniel Helsing, the head of building and environment at the local authority, Hylte council, said the couple did not follow the necessary requirements for composting waste.“There are a number of requirements that you have to follow and they have not,” he said. “Normal practice, if you do not have a water closet solution, is that you have a collecting service for your barrels that the local authorities in basically every county in Sweden provide. That would be the most common solution to handling toilet waste if you are not using water closets.”It is possible to compost toilet waste but it has to be done according to local authority instructions, he said. “You would have to report that you are going to compost toilet waste and that gives us as the local authority a chance to set out rules and guidelines for how to do it.”The Swedish Tourist Association said it was unfamiliar with the methods used at Stedsans. A spokesperson said: “I have never heard anything like that.”Hansen and Helbæk accused the journalists behind the investigation of lying and of causing “our life’s biggest (literal!) shitstorm”.They added: “The article claims that we have been damaging the local environment with our procedures at our permaculture resort and that we have left animals to die. All these claims and several others are false.”Accusing the local authorities of being cowards, Hansen and Helbæk said that Hylte council was aware of their toilets. They had, the couple said, shown the toilets and procedures to authority representatives “several times”. “Either the municipality lies, or they have not done the work we have paid them to do, which is to make sure that all rules are followed.”Hylte council said they had not been paid to deal with waste and that they were assessing whether it would be reported to police.Hansen and Helbæk said their company had gone bankrupt and that they had tax debt inDenmarkthat had “multiplied tenfold” because of interest and fees over a decade. To prevent the debt from growing, they said, they would have to pay Danish tax authorities – which they accused of being “cold-hearted” and “narcissistic” – more than 50,000 DKK a month (£5,800), which they suggest they are unable to.Hansen previously said they owed the Swedish tax agency “over 7m” SEK (more than £550,000).Among the reasons they fled to Guatemala, they said, was “to give our family a second chance”. Describing it as their birthright, they added: “If you see us as villains for making this choice, we are sorry.”Explore more on these topicsSwedenDenmarkEuropeGuatemalanewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli military said the strike targeted a seniorHamasmilitant.The Palestinian Islamist groupHamashas submitted a legal filing saying it should be removed from the UK government’s list of proscribed terrorist groups.Hamas is arguing that it is not a terrorist group but “a Palestinian Islamic liberation and resistance movement whose goal is to liberate Palestine and confront the Zionist project”.Saudi Arabia’s top diplomat held talks in Washington on Wednesday, laying the groundwork for a visit by US President Donald Trump, which would be the first foreign trip of his second term.Foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan met US secretary of state Marco Rubio at the state department, and the two called on the Sudanese army and paramilitary forces to resume peace talks.Suspected US airstrikes in Yemen overnight into Thursday killed at least three people, while the death toll in an earlier attack rose to 13 dead, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels said.The rebels meanwhile aired footage they said showed the debris left after shooting down yet another American MQ-9 Reaper drone.Share"

It said recruiters “frequently mentioned that economic uncertainty, tighter recruitment budgets and reduced client activity” were slowing the level of hiring.“Permanent placements have now declined in each month for the past two-and-a-half years, with the pace of reduction broadly unchanged from February.”Jon Holt, a senior partner at KPMG, said: “At a time when global uncertainty is peaking and businesses are assessing the impact of market volatility alongside rising employment costs, the latest data demonstrates how the economic reality continues to weigh heavy on the labour market.“Recent global events have put pressure on any growth prospects in the UK, so it is unlikely that we will see an improvement in the data in the near term.”Employers also reported keeping pay rates low, and especially starting salaries, despite the need to attract skilled staff. Salary inflation was at a four-year low in February and a modest improvement in March did little to boost overall levels of pay, the REC said.Some retailers, including Tesco, have reacted by cutting prices to lure back cash-strapped shoppers. This week, the supermarket signalled it would be reducing prices of hundreds of items in competition with Asda, Aldi and Sainsbury.Asda promised in March toembark on the company’s biggest price cuts for 25 yearsto make it more competitive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A majority reported a decline in their disposable incomes and almost half (47%) of consumers said they had only been spending on essentials in the last three months.The number of people saying they only spent on essential items in the first quarter rose to its highest level since the Deloitte Consumer Tracker began in 2011.A spokesperson for Deloitte said the downbeat responses were a sign of persistent inflationary pressures.This month, employers have coped with higher national insurance payments and a rise in the minimum wage while households have been hit with a range of tax and price rises, from an average council tax rise of almost 5% to water bill increases that in the Thames area and south-west Englandhave risen by more than 30%.The cost of gas and electricity wentup by 6.4% – or £111 a year– at the beginning of the month.The government needs to find ways to boost consumer confidence and ensure retailers can invest in jobs and stores.

These are found in about half of patients with this form of breast cancer.Prof Nicholas Turner, from the ICR and the Royal MarsdenNHSFoundation Trust, led a key trial into the drug.He said the Nice approval meant “thousands of NHS patients with advanced breast cancer with these specific biomarkers can now receive this innovative targeted treatment to keep their cancer from progressing for longer”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ten shops have been shut, with further closures expected as investigations continue.The NCA secured freezing orders over bank accounts containing funds worth more than £1m combined.“Operation Machinize targeted barbershops and other high street businesses being used as cover for a whole range of criminality, all across the country,” said Rachael Hebert, the deputy director of the national economic crime centre at the NCA.“We have seen links to drug trafficking and distribution, organised immigration crime, modern slavery and human trafficking, firearms, and the sale of illicit tobacco and vapes.“We know cash-intensive businesses are used as fronts for money laundering, facilitating some of the highest harm and highest-impact offending in the UK.”The security minister, Dan Jarvis, said the raids highlighted “the scale and complexity of the criminality our towns and cities face”.“High street crime undermines our security, our borders, and the confidence of our communities, and I am determined to take the decisive action necessary to bring those responsible to justice.”More than £12bn of criminal cash is generated in the UK each year, according to NCA estimates. The agency said the money was typically smuggled out of the country or integrated into the legitimate financial system using a variety of laundering techniques.“Cash-intensive businesses such as barbershops, vape shops, nail bars, American-themed sweet shops and car washes are often used by criminals to conceal the origins of illicit cash,” the NCA said.“Crime gangs … are known to buy such businesses using the proceeds of crime, which provides them with a legitimate income and opportunities for money laundering.In its general election manifesto, Labour vowed to crack down on “dodgy” US candy shops, amid investigations into tax evasion and the sale of counterfeit goods.Operation Machinize involved 19 different police forces and regional organised crime units, as well as national agencies including HMRC, Trading Standards and Home Office Immigration Enforcement.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The union says the removal of the WRCO role means pay cuts of thousands for those affected and that it was “the first step in a broader campaign of attacks against pay and terms and conditions” for bin workers.Rayner, who is also the communities secretary, said she wanted to see “a fair resolution to this” and added: “I would urge Unite to suspend the action and accept the improved deal.” She said the council had “moved significantly to meet the demands of the workers so we can see an end to this dispute”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Indeed, there is another ballot happening by close of play on Monday. Unite backs these workers 100%.”She added: “Rather than vilifying their low-paid employees, the council should look seriously at the KC-approved offer that Unite has put forward, which deals with the issues and gives these workers and their families dignity and security.“A notable point was made by one of our members, which Unite believes sums up where we are with this council and could be with others: ‘The council are saying that we should share the pain but not one councillor, including the leader of the council, has been asked to give up a quarter of their pay. We thought whenLabourcame in they would stop what was happening, we were wrong.’”Graham said there was only a partial deal on pay protection for a few, which still leaves workers worrying about how they are going to pay their mortgages and rent payments in a few months’ time. “For the drivers, they are still unaware what their drop in pay will be but the council have mooted that this could also be around £8,000,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBirminghamIndustrial actionUniteTrade unionsAngela RaynerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

A crane could also be seen on a floating platform in the river, presumably trying to raise the sunken helicopter. Meanwhile on shore, fire and police personnel stopped the public and press from reaching the end of a long concrete pier on the river from downtown Manhattan, as scuba teams emerged from the water.View image in fullscreenA New York fire department boat responds to the crash on Thursday.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesThe New York mayor, Eric Adams, confirmed six people had been pronounced dead, including three children and three adults.Speaking at a news conference on Thursday evening, Adams said his thoughts were with the crash victims and their families. An investigation into the cause of the accident was ongoing, he said.Three adults and three children were on board the Bell 206 helicopter that had left from downtown Skyport, Adams said. The victims were a pilot and a family believed to be visiting from Spain, he said.1:14New York City mayor Eric Adams confirms six killed in helicopter crash – videoJessica Tisch, the NYPD commissioner, said most of the passengers were already dead when they were removed from the water, but two passengers were taken to a nearby hospital, where they died soon after.Witness Bruce Wall told the Associated Press he saw the helicopter “falling apart” in midair, with the tail and propeller coming off. The propeller was still spinning without the aircraft as it fell, he said.Lesly Camacho, a hostess at a restaurant along the river in Hoboken, New Jersey, told the AP she saw the helicopter spinning uncontrollably before it slammed into the water.The rescue operations took place near a site close to the Manhattan waterfront, near the end of a long maintenance pier for one of the ventilation towers for the Holland tunnel, a busy under-river road tunnel connecting the city with New Jersey.Over the years, there have been multiple crashes in the skies over Manhattan, which are routinely filled with both planes and helicopters, including private recreational aircraft and commercial and tourist flights.Prior incidents include a collision in 2009 when a tour helicopter and a small private airplane collided over the Hudson River, killing nine people. In 2018, a sightseeing helicopter offering “open door” flights went down into the East River, killing five people. New York Citybannedopen-door helicopter flights following the crash.The spot where the helicopter crashed is less than three miles (4.8km) south of where US Airways Capt Chesley Sullenberger expertly landed the passenger plane he was piloting, on the water, with no lives lost, after the engines were put out in a bird strike after takeoff from LaGuardia airport. The rare successful emergency landing on water became known as the “miracle on the Hudson”.View image in fullscreenFirst responders from New Jersey and New York at the scene where a helicopter crashed in the Hudson River on Thursday.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APThe crash site is close to the southern end of the island of Manhattan, within sight of the Statue of Liberty and the One World Trade skyscraper at the site of the September 11 terrorist attack.New Yorkers were jogging and walking along the sidewalk near the Hudson as normal on Thursday evening, overlooking the scene of the crash with emergency boats still visible across the water on the New Jersey side, blue lights flashing.Software engineers and friends Mike Jones, 37, and Omar Mohamed, 21, said they were out for a walk during a break and they had heard the news of the crash.“It seems that helicopters crash a lot. And I’m afraid of heights anyway so helicopters are a no-go for me,” Jones said.Mohamed said: “There was just another helicopter crash, right?” recalling the helicopter crash in Washington DC at the end of January, when a military flight collided midair with a passenger plane coming in to land.

Leitch began his career as a stuntman for stars such as Brad Pitt before transitioning to making stunt-heavy films like John Wick. He and stuntman turned stunt coordinator Chris O’Hara of Stunts Unlimited made presentations to the Academy advocating for the addition of a new award.“Stunts are essential to every genre of film and rooted deep in our industry’s history –from the groundbreaking work of early pioneers like Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin, to the inspiring artistry of today’s stunt designers, coordinators, performers and choreographers,” Leitch said in a statement to Variety.“This has been a long journey for so many of us. Chris O’Hara and I have spent years working to bring this moment to life, standing on the shoulders of the stunt professionals who’ve fought tirelessly for recognition over the decades. We are incredibly grateful. Thank you, Academy.”Stunt performers have called for their own category for decades, but stunt coordinators – those who plan and choreograph stunts – is a relatively new profession.View image in fullscreenA stunt crew films a scene for Spider-Man 3 in midtown Manhattan in 2006.Photograph: Bobby Bank/WireImageChad Stahelski, who directed John Wick 4 and did stunts for Keanu Reeves in The Matrix, said there is still work to be done.“The idea of giving an Academy Award for stunt design is awesome – don’t get me wrong,” he said. “Now I would like to know who’s going to decide who gets it, and who actually gets the award? It’s not like it was 100 years ago when there was one person designing it. It’s a collaborative effort.”“Stunts is such a collaborative and complicated department. How are we going to determine who this goes to? We’ve spent 100 years getting the award; let’s just make sure it goes to the right people,” he added.Some actors have also called for their stunt doubles to be recognised at the Oscars. Last yearactor Chris Hemsworth told IGNhe was “shocked it’s even still a conversation”, calling stunt performers “the unsung heroes”.Jason Statham has called it the Oscars’ “overlooked category”, scorning “poncy actors” who were eligible for awards for “standing in front of a fucking green screen screwing his face up pretending like he’s doing the stunt … It’s a total injustice. [Stunt performers] are the ones getting busy.”Category rules around eligibility and voting for the stunt design award will be announced in 2027.The Academy’s production and technology branch has more than 100 stunt performers among its ranks.The Oscars are late to recognising excellence in stunts: the Emmys have awards for stunt coordination and stunt performance, while the Screen Actors Guild awards recognise stunt ensembles in TV and film.The Oscars also recently added a prize for achievement in casting, starting with films released in 2025.Associated Press contributed to this reportThis article’s headline was changed on 11 April 2025 to reflect the year the first award will be given at the Oscars, rather than the first year for eligible films.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

We think we’re doing very well. Again there will be a transition cost, transition problems, but in the end it’s going to be a beautiful thing.”On CNN,former US treasury secretary Janet Yellen called Trump’s economic policies the “worst self-inflicted wound” an administration had ever imposed on a “well-functioning economy”.chart showing decline in S&P 500The sell-off comes as Democrats continue to react with anger over the sudden retreat that rattled markets, whileRepublicanspraised Trump’s “art of the deal” in action, referencing Trump’s 1987 book.By the end of Thursday, the Dow was down 2.5% after soaring on Wednesday afternoon. The Nasdaq Composite was down more than 4%, after posting its biggest gain in more than two decades on Wednesday, and the S&P 500 down 3.4%.The market seems to be in a state of fatigue after a rollercoaster week. Stocks were even unresponsive to news on Thursday morning that the European Unionannouncedit will suspend 25% retaliatory tariffs against US imports and new data showed inflation in the US cooled to 2.4% in March – both would typically be cause for optimism on Wall Street.Trump said in an abrupt announcement on Wednesday that he would be implementing a 90-day pause on his tariff plan, and that goods entering the US from most countries would now face a 10% blanket tariff until July, except for Chinese exports, which hesaidwould face tariffs totaling 145% effective immediately – 125% in “reciprocal” tariffs plus 20% already imposed for China’s alleged role in the fentanyl crisis.Why did Trump retreat on tariffs and is the market reaction justified?Read moreRepublican lawmakers praised the decision to pause the tariffs, with the House speaker, Mike Johnson,stating on social media: “Behold the ‘Art of the Deal.’ President Trump has created leverage, brought MANY countries to the table, and will deliver for American workers, American manufacturers, and America’s future!”Before the pause was announced, a small but growing number of Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters in the business world expressed concerns about the risks of the president’s tariff policy.By Wednesday afternoon, many were praising Trump for the rollback as part of a purported strategy.Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund manager and Trump supporter whoadvocated for Trump to pausehis trade war over the weekend, reacted to the announcement saying that “this was brilliantly executed by @realDonaldTrump. Textbook, Art of the Deal.”The benefit of Trump’s approach, Ackman claimed, “is that we now understand who are our preferred trading partners, and who the problems are. China has shown themselves to be a bad actor. Our counterparties also have a taste of what life is like if they don’t take down their trade barriers. This is the perfect set-up for trade negotiations over the next 90 days.”But some industry leaders criticized the administration’s back-and-forth and tariff decisions.On Thursday, Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, said the company was still waiting to see the impact of the tariffs but warned third-party sellers may “pass that cost on” to consumers.“The effective tariff rate is actually HIGHER with the pause than it was as announced on April 2, due to the tariffs on China,” Diane Swonk, the chief economist of the professional services firm KPMG,wroteon social media. “There will be some diversion through connector countries. However, the effective tariff rate now peaks at 30.5% during the pause. That is worse than our worst case scenarios.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House – the public has a right to know.”The New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezechoedsimilar concerns, urging any member of Congress who purchased stocks over the last two days to disclose that.“I’ve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor,” she said. “Disclosure deadline is May 15th. We’re about to learn a few things. It’s time to ban insider trading in Congress.”The Democratic House whip, Katherine Clark,wrote: “Two hours before announcing his tariff pause, Trump told his paid Truth Social subscribers it was ‘a great time to buy’ on the stock market. Corruption is the name of their game.”The Nevada representative Steven Horsford questioned the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, asking the representative during a committee hearing whether the climbdown was market manipulation.“How is this not market manipulation?” Horsfordasked, to which Greer responded: “No.”“If it was always a plan, how is this not market manipulation?” Horsford asked again.“Tariffs are a tool, they can be used in the appropriate way to protect US jobs and small businesses, but that’s not what this does,” Horsford said. “So if it’s not market manipulation, what is it?

It’s one of several products she created forBusy Baby, a company she runs with her brother. They are manufactured inChina.She expected and budgeted for about 20-30% tariffs this year. When the first round of tariffs came in at 10%, it was manageable. Then the rate on China crept up, then up again, to 54%. That was her “oh, shit moment”, but she thought she could weather it, she told the Guardian.It didn’t stop there, though. It climbed up to 104%. She filmed a video of herself “mid-meltdown” over the extreme tariff,postingit on her social media.‘Go Trump’: some Florida shoppers back tariffs – but others are worriedRead moreBusy Baby is one of manyUS small businesseshaving to reckon with monumental tariffs that could shutter their livelihoods.Donald Trump’s escalatingtrade war with Chinanow includes a 125% tariff on Chinese products coming into the US. These businesses were given little more than a week to confront a budget-busting tax on their goods.View image in fullscreenA child with bungee cords that hold toys or utensils.Photograph: MCFynbo/Busy Baby“After today’s announcement, and the impending 104% tariff, I am abandoning my products in China. I am leaving them there because I simply cannot afford to ship them here,” Benike told her followers on Monday, before Trump hiked the tariff on Chinese goodsup even furtheron Wednesday.“At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday as he paused tariffs on other countries.Benike already paid about $160,000 to manufacture her products in China, and would have to pay more than that to bring them to the US. So for now, she’s trying to figure out other options: she could try to sell them overseas, or send them to another country to repackage them.I’m terrified for my business, and I’m terrified for all the other small businesses in the United States right now“I’m terrified for my business, and I’m terrified for all the other small businesses in the United States right now, because we don’t know what to do, and we’re invested in our businesses. I could lose my home, and I don’t understand it, and I don’t know what to do,” she said in the video.After Trump’s latest increase, Benike said she was looking into sending the paid-for products to Australia, where she has friends, to have them repackaged, then importing them from there during the 90-day pause because it is at least a way to get the products she already paid for to the US.Her business has grown since she founded it in 2017, and accolades have come with it. She wasnamedMinnesota’s small businessperson of the year by the US Small Business Administration this year. She finally got into big retailers – Target and Walmart – with small test runs. Those contracts, though, were signed before the tariffs. Walmart told her it wanted to keep and expand its offerings from Busy Baby, she said, but she had a “hard conversation” with the buyer this week to let them know she cannot add a third product to their roster because of the high tariffs.View image in fullscreenKim Adams, warehouse manager for Busy Baby, a baby products company.Photograph: Star Tribune/Getty ImagesTrump says ‘I know what I’m doing’ before stepping back from global tariffsRead more“It has completely stifled my growth in big box retail, which has been our main goal for three years– to grow into that space,” she said. “Because as a teeny, tiny business, that’s a huge achievement, huge for our brand. And now it’s halted.”The other option, the one Trump wants, is a pipe dream: manufacturing her products in the US. Benike would prefer to manufacture here, too. But a mountain of logistics, near impossibilities, stand in her way.Food-grade silicone, which she uses for her products, is not available domestically. When she looked into the cost of importing the material when she first started, it was more expensive than importing a finished product, and the prices have gone up since then. Manufacturing facilities in the US with the compression mold machines she needed require much larger runs than she can commit to. The minimum requirements for factories here was 20,000 – in China, she could do a couple thousand at a time.I wish I understood the big picture, or how they expect us to pivot in this tiny window of time. I don’t understand, I just don’t understand thisMaking the molds for her products takes about two months. They also are made in China – many American manufacturers send American steel to China to makemolds because they’re better at it there, she said. The molds alone would cost up to $75,000 in the US. If she found a factory and the capital needed to get it all going, it would still take a minimum of four months until she had products ready to sell, she estimated.“It’s financially impossible for me to manufacture here. But even if I had an angel that just dropped a million dollars in my lap, it doesn’t make sense as a business model for how much we would have to charge for the product and charge the consumer,” she said. “It doesn’t make any sense. So I wish I understood the big picture, or how they expect us to pivot in this tiny window of time. I don’t understand, I just don’t understand this.”She said she has about two or three months’ worth of product on hand now, giving her a few months until she could theoretically go out of business if she doesn’t figure something else out. If people buy up what she has left, that at least gives her some cashflow to buy her some time to make new plans.On Tuesday, she got a call from the Small Business Administration, she said. Someone there saw her video, so she’s sending them information on her products and the machines at the factory she uses now. The agency is going to try to find a factory in the US that could make her products, but she’s not holding her breath.View image in fullscreenBeth Benike, founder of Busy Baby, talks with her brother and COO, Eric Fynbo.Photograph: Star Tribune/Getty ImagesShe decided to post her video and speak out about the way the tariffs are affecting small businesses because she has a community of supporters and other entrepreneurs who can help and commiserate, including some who know her from her appearance on Shark Tank.I can’t fail. This is my children’s livelihood. It’s my homeTwo years ago, during a different tough spot for her business, she had suicidal thoughts. The weight of being a CEO was heavy. She thought, if she was gone, at least her family would have life insurance to live on. She got help then and learned coping strategies.The thought of life insurance surfaced again this week. She caught it quickly, reminding herself that “this is a trick my brain is playing on me right now, because it doesn’t see a way out”. She wants other entrepreneurs to know they aren’t alone as they face these tariffs. She’s heard from some, who have messaged her privately to say they are feeling the same pain, but can’t speak out because it’s a business risk.Some of the comments on her video and on local news websites that have written about her predicament have not been kind. Some have said, you voted for this, or you deserve this if you voted for Trump. She did not vote for Trump, she said, but she does not know why her political beliefs matter.Fact check: are US tariffs really bringing in $2bn a day as Trump claims?Read more“No one deserves this. No one. Regardless of who they voted for,” she said. “Trump said he was going to do tariffs. We knew that. Yes, we knew tariffs were coming. I would have never in a million years guessed it would be like this.”She has more than 15 patents for the products she’s created for the “accidental business” she came up with after her son was born. She learned how to start a business, develop products, set up an e-commerce store. Now, digging her way out from huge tariffs is one more thing to learn.“We’ve got a great product, and it is a great product for babies. Babies exist all over our world, all over the planet, babies everywhere. I can’t fail,” she said. “This is my children’s livelihood.

This surpassed the previous record highs of $5.90 a dozen in February, and $4.95 in January.The latest figures come just days after the country’s largest egg producer reportedrecord salesand profits amid growing scrutiny over alleged price gouging.Cal-Maine, which produces 20% of the eggs eaten in the US, made $1bn in windfall income in the first three quarters of the financial year – the profits extracted after accounting for production, processing and transport costs.Cal-Maine’s profits more than tripled compared with the same quarter last year – and are nearly eight times as high as at the start of the bird flu outbreak in February 2022, according to financial results published on Tuesday.In March,the Guardian reported onhow major egg corporations like Cal-Maine may be usingavian fluas a ruse to hike up prices. Days later, the Trump administration opened an anti-trust investigation into price-fixing by the nation’s largest egg corporations.“Egg prices are spiraling out of control, laying bare the cracks in our corporate food system,” said Amanda Starbuck, research director ofFood& Water Watch, a consumer advocacy group. “To lower egg prices, the Trump administration must take on the food monopolies, hasten and prioritize its investigation into corporate price fixing, and stop the spread of factory farms.”Mississippi-based Cal-Maine has said that it received notice of the investigation into egg price increases last month and that it was cooperating with the investigation.The price of eggs was a major election issue in 2024, with Trump and many voters blaming inflationary prices on Biden’s economic policies.Graphic of inflationTrump pledged to bring down the cost of living, which eased slightly in March when the consumer price index (CPI) fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.1%, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.4%, down from 2.8% in February. The drop was largely fueled by a sharp fall in gas prices.But last month’s inflation does not reflect the impact of Trump’s tariff mayhem, which economists have warned could cause a spike to consumer prices.“Today’s softer than expected CPI release feels backward-looking given the large changes to trade policy seen in recent days,” Kay Haigh from GoldmanSachs Asset Management told CNBC. “Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft.”Explore more on these topicsInflationEggsEconomicsFoodShareReuse this content"

Photograph: AFP/GettyAs China retaliates against tariffs, it is also making strategic manoeuvres on EU and Asia to maximise opportunitiesByPatrick WintourDiplomatic editorThu 10 Apr 2025 14.26 EDTFirst published on Thu 10 Apr 2025 09.50 EDTShareOn the basis of Napoleon’s dictum “never interrupt your enemy while they are making a mistake”, there was a large incentive for China to do precisely nothing asDonald Trumpdisplayed his determination to lose friends and induce market panic. Indeed, the Chinese advocates of passivity cited a social media meme attributed to President Xi Jinping: “Do nothing. Win.”Initially it was tempting forChinato sit back and watch the US’s former allies recoil at Trump’s disruptive war on globalisation and let them realise that, by comparison, China represented an oasis of stability, modernity and predictability.China instead decided to be far from idle. It foresaw and prepped for this trade war, probably more so than for Trump’s first term, and decided that if the US president imposed on China the kind of tariffs he had suggested on the campaign trail, it would have to mount a counterattack. China insisted its wider-than-expected and swiftly executed package of reprisals, initially set at 34% butincreased to 84%in response to Trump’s tariffs, was a justifiable retaliation.View image in fullscreenEmployees at a factory in Suqian, in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, working earlier this week on a production line of caps to be exported to the US.Photograph: AFP/GettyEven now, with lines of communication into Washington limited, China says it had no desire for this confrontation, but wasforced to reactafter the scale of Trump’s assault. And by making an appeal to the World Trade Organization (WTO), it seeks to project itself as a defender of rules-based trading order. Why, after all, would China favour such a trade war? Trump’s initial tariffs were predicted to cut as much as 2.4 percentage points off China’s growth.By Wednesday night, war was being waged by both sides with every weapon in the field in a crazed and self-destructive bidding war. China’s retaliatory tariffs on the US sat at 84%, with the US’s even higher at an oxygen-free 125%. At these figures there could be virtually no trade between the two world’s largest economies and a complete decoupling would begin.View image in fullscreenA worker installs parts at a power equipment assembly line at an Ariens factory in Brillion, Wisconsin.Photograph: Tim Aeppel/ReutersThe WTO warmed: “This tit-for-tat approach between the world’s two largest economies, which together account for roughly 3% of global trade, carries wider implications that could severely damage the global economic outlook.”China’s diplomatic goal of portraying itself as the innocent victim has been made more complex by Trump belatedly trying to reframe the trade war by suspending tariffs on most other countries to 10% for 90 days, leaving China exposed as the US’s prime target.What began as a generalised American assault on the trading system, an assault that seemed sure to crash the US bond market, infuriating American allies inEuropeand Asia and crushing developing economies, has become a more narrowly focused attack on China.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump talks to reporters about tariffs while in flight on Air Force One on 6 April.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/GettyTrump’s aides tried to cover the tracks of this retreat by saying the isolation of China was the plan all along and the suspension was due to many countries wanting to negotiate new trade deals that would prove advantageous to the US. Those negotiations will, in theory, also provide a chance to press third countries from being Chinese export platforms.But Trump undercut the theory of a well-executed master plan by admitting the bond markets had become a bit “yippy”. In pulling back under pressure, he has probably alighted on a more defensible position that he could have adopted at the outset.View image in fullscreenApple iPhones in a Washington DC store. The US is dependent on China for 73% of its smartphones.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/GettyTrump’s critics will not thank him, accusing him of recklessly endangering the world economy in pursuit of the mirage of a revival of a 19th-century US manufacturing economy. What investor is going to put serious funds into a US factory when its prospects are dependent on a president who apparently sees tariffs as a political weapon to be unloaded on social media at will?Moreover, an insurmountable tariff wall between the world’s two largest economies remains and is unsustainable. The US isdependent on Chinafor 73% of its smartphones, 78% of its laptops and 87% of its video game consoles.China, insisting it will fight to the end, will now have to judge whether it has the firepower to withstand a trade war or find a way to open talks. Since Trump’s first term, the US share of Chinese exports dropped from 19.2% to 14.7%, partly as it diversified through investments elsewhere into the “connector” economies of Asia. But the loss of 15% of China’s export market is still crippling.View image in fullscreenShipping containers at the Port Jersey container terminal in New Jersey, on 8 April.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/GettyChina has already launched a diplomatic charm offensive of sorts, with senior officials from the international department recently touring European and Asian capitals, reminding all those who will listen that China is an oasis of responsibility and a believer in genuine multilateralism.A slick Chinese ministry of foreign affairs video shows how the world faces two choices: the chaos represented by Trump, or the spirit of cooperation offered by China. Another video targets US Republicans by highlighting Ronald Reagan’s opposition to tariffs. And the description of the Chinese as peasants by the US vice-president, JD Vance, leaves even the most ardent China sceptics exasperated.For the moment, the Chinese script writes itself: China is the reliable partner, not the US, with the EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, urged on his visit to Beijing last week to make common cause to stop Trump’s unilateral bullying.There is now a question whether Europe and China can set aside their differences about Chinese trade practices and overcapacity and form an alliance against American disruption.It’s early days, but China, if it gets its messaging right, could find a receptive audience. What has been described as the great reshoring of American jobs and wealth by the White House adviser Stephen Miller, also risks being the great offshoring of American power.China’s charm offensive was first on view at the Munich Security Conference in February when its foreign minister, Wang Yi, called for “an equal and orderly multipolar world”, while JD Vanceunleashed his volleyagainst European elites.View image in fullscreenGermany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, at the Munich Security Conference in February.Photograph: Sven Hoppe/APGabrielius Landsbergis, the former Lithuanian foreign minister, recalls: “China was very active, very supportive and very understanding of European security needs. And later on, when Europe was not invited to Riyadh for the talks on Ukraine, the Chinese reaction was that it’s imperative for Europe to sit at the table.“So they are striking all the right notes, for at least the part of Europe that is really, really worried. I think they are playing the smart, subtle game, much like what Henry Kissinger played in the Soviet Union and China in the 70s. Whether they will be successful, I’m not sure.”In recent weeks, Spain and France have been beating a path towards Beijing’s door. The Spanish prime minister,Pedro Sánchez, is in Beijing on his third visit in two years, and has called for closer trade ties with China as part of an effort to diversify away from the US. He will try to seal lucrative Chinese investment in Spain’s electric car and battery industry.View image in fullscreenXi Jinping and Pedro Sánchez shake hands before a meeting in Beijing on 9 September.Photograph: China Daily/ReutersThe European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, for the first time this week since starting her second term in office in December. The pair defended free trade and agreed to host an EU-China summit in July, although it was not clear whetherXi Jinpingwill attend.There are strict limits on a new European-Chinese relationship, partly due to China’s inflexibility. China’s lenience towards Russia over Ukraine is a huge political barrier. The EU has long seen China’s handling of the Ukraine issue as a test of its credentials as a world power. The EU’s former external affairs minister Josep Borrell said: “China cannot pretend to be a great power but close its eyes or cover its ears when it comes to a conflict that obviously makes it uncomfortable.”A visit to Beijing by the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, on 29 March failed to budge China from its defence of Moscow. Chinese officials say they accept the sanctity of borders and the UN charter, but in practice will do nothing to stop Russia breaching those principles.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If anything, the chaos, including the collapse of the Taiwan stock market (Taiwan suffered its worst one-day fall this week since 1990), makes Taiwan look more vulnerable than ever.Šefčovič told EU trade ministers on Monday that there was no easy compromise between Brussels and Beijing on trade either. The risk of China, faced with huge US tariffs, flooding European markets with cheap goods is self-evident, and extra EU surveillance measures are in place.The problem is real.China’s exports to the EU exceeded imports from the bloc by more than €300bnin 2024, according to EU data, a gap that is roughly twice as large as when Trump first started imposing tariffs in 2018.In condemning the imposition of US tariffs, the commission also accepted Trump’s view that there were some countries that traded unfairly, a reference to China.China/US tradeResearch published this week by theRhodium groupshows a clear correlation between rising Chinese imports into Europe and declining European production. The mix of China’s high overcapacity – and falling prices – on the one hand, and Europe’s rising energy costs on the other is dangerous, the report warned.Collectively, the industries experiencing rising imports from China and falling production in the EU account for 25% of Europe’s manufacturing jobs.These high tariffs, combined with weakened US consumer demand, could lead Chinese exporters to further reduce their prices, incentivise Beijing to let the renminbi depreciate and drive a shift in trade as Chinese exports are redirected toward alternative markets. Other countries are also likely to tighten their own trade barriers in response, meaning if Europe is slow to act, it risks becoming the de facto dumping ground for surplus Chinese production.View image in fullscreenCars and other vehicles for export at a port in Yantai, in eastern China’s Shandong province.Photograph: AFP/GettyIn Asia, China may find it easier to locate allies. Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said: “The uncertain and erratic nature of US trade policy is forcing countries to consider de-risking, not from China, but from the US. In a strategic sense, China is a beneficiary of this bizarre trade policy.”Evan Feigenbaum, a former US assistant secretary of state, argues the three key pillars of US influence in Asia flowed from being a standard setter, security provider and by being an economic demand driver, but all three of these positives are eroding.He said: “A shrinking, relative demand profile, withdrawal from rule-setting pacts, zeroing out foreign aid, capricious visa policies and now a tariff wall erected against Japan, Laos,Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, the Republic of Korea and Cambodia all contribute.View image in fullscreenSouth Korea’s trade, industry and energy minister, Ahn Duk-geun (centre), with Japan’s economy, trade and industry minister, Yoji Muto (left), and China’s commerce minister, Wang Wentao, at the 13th trilateral economic and trade ministers’ meeting in Seoul on 30 March.Photograph: AFP/Getty“The region is filled with pragmatists who can and do navigate all kinds of crazy stuff from outside powers, but that depends greatly on those players being either principled or strategic, and Washington is now neither.”Japanese officials spoke of trying to lobby Trump being equivalent to trying to influence an opaque dictatorship. “No matter who I talk to in the US administration, none of them knows what Trump is thinking,” a senior Japanese government official said. “We don’t even know what Trump wants to negotiate on.”China sees an opportunity. Its commerce minister, Wang Wentao, last week met his Japanese and South Korean counterparts for the first time in five years “to strengthen supply chain cooperation, engage in more dialogue on export controls and deepen collaboration in the digital and green economies”, the Xinhua news agency reported.The three east Asian countries also agreed to resume negotiations on a trilateral free trade agreement that has been on hold since 2019.Xi will visit Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia later this month, three countries clobbered under Trump’s original tariffs. The message from Beijing will be that China is now not just geographically at the centre of Asia, but also a reliable trading partner.But the Chinese president will have to tread a careful path. Vietnam, for example, so dependent on exporting to the US, would resent being dragooned against its national interest into what it sees as a bilateral conflict between two superpowers: China and the US.View image in fullscreenThe Foxconn Technology Group factories at the Quang Chau industrial park in Bac Giang province, Vietnam.

Ryan Hass, from the Brookings Institute, speaking to the Sinicapodcast, said: “Some people see this as a giant opportunity for China, to expand its footprint round the world. Maybe.“They feel this is a structural issue that is not going to resolve itself anytime soon. Their view is to make a virtue of necessity – to use the pressure that President Trump is providing to advance and accelerate their own pre-existing plans, whether it is on self-reliance, more investment, diversifying trade relationships. They are trying to use the pressure from Trump to propel their own plans forward rather than fight him on every issue on every single day.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsChinaXi JinpingAsia PacificDonald TrumpInternational tradefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They owed large sums to Swedish and Danish tax authorities. They have since set up a business inGuatemala.The story behind their disappearance and the abandoned human waste was revealed this week after an investigation by the newspapers Politiken and Dagens Nyheter. It also found that the couple had allowed wastewater to run into the forest and alleged that animals had died as a result of being left outside and that others were abandoned.Couple who ran Swedish eco-retreat fled leaving behind barrels of human wasteRead moreHansen and Helbæk’s actions were described by local authorities as “environmental crime”. However, on Thursday, the couple claimed they were acting lawfully.Commenting on the barrels left behind from their compost toilets, they said in a post on social media: “For people in ruralSwedenit’s a very normal thing.”They added: “It’s also a very important part of the permaculture principles that you deal with your own shit.”View image in fullscreenThe barrels of human waste left behind.Photograph: www.dn.seThe property’s new owner is aware of the barrels and they can be used for compost, they said. “Half of them are ready to use this spring, the other half is ready in 1 year, following the guidelines of Swedish law.”But Daniel Helsing, the head of building and environment at the local authority, Hylte council, said the couple did not follow the necessary requirements for composting waste.“There are a number of requirements that you have to follow and they have not,” he said. “Normal practice, if you do not have a water closet solution, is that you have a collecting service for your barrels that the local authorities in basically every county in Sweden provide. That would be the most common solution to handling toilet waste if you are not using water closets.”It is possible to compost toilet waste but it has to be done according to local authority instructions, he said. “You would have to report that you are going to compost toilet waste and that gives us as the local authority a chance to set out rules and guidelines for how to do it.”The Swedish Tourist Association said it was unfamiliar with the methods used at Stedsans. A spokesperson said: “I have never heard anything like that.”Hansen and Helbæk accused the journalists behind the investigation of lying and of causing “our life’s biggest (literal!) shitstorm”.They added: “The article claims that we have been damaging the local environment with our procedures at our permaculture resort and that we have left animals to die. All these claims and several others are false.”Accusing the local authorities of being cowards, Hansen and Helbæk said that Hylte council was aware of their toilets. They had, the couple said, shown the toilets and procedures to authority representatives “several times”. “Either the municipality lies, or they have not done the work we have paid them to do, which is to make sure that all rules are followed.”Hylte council said they had not been paid to deal with waste and that they were assessing whether it would be reported to police.Hansen and Helbæk said their company had gone bankrupt and that they had tax debt inDenmarkthat had “multiplied tenfold” because of interest and fees over a decade. To prevent the debt from growing, they said, they would have to pay Danish tax authorities – which they accused of being “cold-hearted” and “narcissistic” – more than 50,000 DKK a month (£5,800), which they suggest they are unable to.Hansen previously said they owed the Swedish tax agency “over 7m” SEK (more than £550,000).Among the reasons they fled to Guatemala, they said, was “to give our family a second chance”. Describing it as their birthright, they added: “If you see us as villains for making this choice, we are sorry.”Explore more on these topicsSwedenDenmarkEuropeGuatemalanewsShareReuse this content"

Just when maybe, just maybe, his followers were daring to dream of Masters glory, Augusta National bit back at the 35-year-old.Plusça change.This was box office; the problem being that forMcIlroy himselfand all those desperate to see him sample Masters success, the reasons were all wrong. Nobody could have predicted this stumble, such was his earlier touch. He was four under par and within three of the leaderboard-topping Justin Rose. The finding of water with a chip from behind the 15th green cost McIlroy an ugly, double-bogey seven. It is precisely the kind of number that can fatally undermine a Masters bid.Spanish amateur golfer urinates into creek during opening Masters roundRead moreMcIlroy was to err again, at the penultimate hole. Again, an approach went long. Again, a double bogey ensued. Three holes, four shots back to the course. The grisliest of stuff. A 72 felt like scant reward for so much fine work. That is, however, the nature of this beast. McIlroy has only delivered two sub-70 opening Masters rounds, the last arriving in 2018. He now hopes he can take out understandable frustrations on Friday morning. His response to such a bruising denouement will be fascinating. McIlroy remains a factor in this major, of course, but blows to the guts in Georgia keep on coming. It would hardly improve McIlroy’s mood that his playing partner, Ludvig Åberg, quietly pieced together a 68. Ignore the Swede at your peril; he is the real deal.McIlroy seemed to play perfectly within himself for 14 and a half holes. There were no moments of drama, no cause for panic. The Northern Irishman’s driving was at its imperious best. He missed a decent opportunity on the opening hole but was one under after three. Further birdies arrived at the 8th and 9th, the latter after a wondrous approach. McIlroy collected another shot at the 13th before missing a chance from 8ft at the next. He had a four iron in hand from the middle of the fairway for his second to the 15th. The ball went long and so much good work was partly undone. McIlroy shook his head as his playing partners holed out. He knows, better than anybody, about the impact of numbers such as seven here.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy can only smirk after after chipping into the water on the 15th hole to ruin a very promising round.Photograph: David J Phillip/APThere are of course 54 holes and hard yards still to cover in this, the 89th Masters edition. Azaleas were not the only flower in full bloom on day one. McIlroy and others will have to topple a resurgent Rose, who signed for a 65. Rose has led or co-led the Masters after 18, 36, 54 and 72 holes yet never donned a Green Jacket. The statistical quirk there relates to his playoff defeat to Sergio García in 2017. The intervening Augusta years have delivered a mixed bag for Rose.At a venue where experience is key, Rose is worthy of huge respect. His only blemish came at the last after he was unable to scramble a par. Rose had found trees to the right from the tee. Still, he had cause to reflect on an overwhelmingly positive day at the office. At 44, it is perfectly reasonable to believe Rose can still feature in major conversations. He was three under inside three holes.“Golf is not going to get easier for me in the next five, 10 years, whatever it’s going to be,” he admitted. “So your opportunity is less going forward, so you have to make the most of it.“I enjoy the work still, which is a good sign, right. And I think the other measure I have is if I go and play golf by myself in the evening and still enjoy that experience, I know that I still love the game enough to make the sacrifices that are required to play well at it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The world No 1 and defending champion did not drop a shot. Birdie putts were holed from 60ft on the 4th and 42ft on the 16th. In between, this looked a normal Augusta day for Scheffler. He continues to hide in plain sight. Corey Conners, who has three Masters top-10 finishes, sits alongside Scheffler at four under. Bryson DeChambeau suggested he has finally cracked the Masters code courtesy of a 69.Tyrrell Hatton infamously branded Augusta National “unfair” on a previous visit. His 69 suggested an attitude shift. “I don’t know if I have worked on my patience,” Hatton said with a smile. “I think it just depends what side of the bed I get out of, if I have a little bit or none.“Obviously today was a good day. I drove the ball pretty well, which in years gone by is something that I’ve struggled with. It’s just so hard. You love being here and it’s very special but at any moment you can just hit a shot and it just does your head in. I just need to keep hitting perfect shots.”Poor Nick Dunlap slumped to a 90, including a back nine of 47. Fred Couples rolled back the years – again – with a 71. Patrick Reed branded his performance “piss poor” despite equalling Couples’s perfectly decent score. Ángel Cabrera’s major return, post prison, included 75 shots. This was an afternoon in which the Spanish amateur José Luis Ballester delivered Augusta’s very own watergate scandal. None of this should mask what is already a star-studded leaderboard. By close of play, it suddenly felt unsatisfactory that McIlroy does not feature prominently on it. It is the hope that kills us. And him.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersRory McIlroyJustin RosePGA TourEuropean TourGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Onana’s opening mistake was even poorer, a Thiago Almada free-kick skipping straight past him – surely to the glee of Matic, an unused substitute.View image in fullscreenJoshua Zirkzee celebrates after putting Manchester United in front late in the game.Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersLeny Yoro made it 1-1 before Joshua Zirkzee looked to have sealed a classic smash-and-grab victory when rising to head home Bruno Fernandes’s pinpoint cross with 87 minutes on the clock. But after Cherki’s equaliser the final whistle blew to leave Onana despairing and United contemplating what might have been.As Yoro said: “It’s the worst moment to concede a goal. Two-one would have been a good result away from home but now we have to win it at home. They’re a good team with a good striker and we need to be ready for everything. We defended really well, we were compact, and we’ll need that again at home. We need to keep our heads up – we didn’t lose tonight and we can win at Old ­Trafford, of course we can.”Of his flicked, headed goal, the defender said: “I didn’t even think about it, I just reacted and tried to put my head there.” The breathless denouement means the tie is poised nicely for next week’s ­second leg but given how erratic United are, who will wager they can knockLyonout and progress to the semi-final?Porro’s touch of class for Tottenham earns draw after Frankfurt’s fast startRead moreThe Onana-Matic spat fuelled a crowd who let off flares and ­firecrackers in the sun, then entered a bouncing stadium to barrack the keeper whenever they could.The same number were close to jeering Tolisso – their captain – when he jabbed a boot at Fernandes’s free-kick: he went close to beating his own keeper, Lucas Perri, but the ball went to safety.Lyon targeted Diogo Dalot as a weakness. Twice diagonals caught him flatfooted. The second allowed Georges Mikautadze to aim a header towards Tolisso, but Dalot, ­recovering, cleared. Mikautadze’s next move was burning away from Dalot and dinking in a cross – again, the forward was thwarted and, again, United’s right-wing-back vulnerable.United were often arranged with six or seven in the backline, a result of the pressure Lyon applied. On a rare foray down their left Patrick Dorgu pulled the ball back for Rasmus Højlund, but an embarrassing scuff ensued and Lyon had a goal-kick.Fernandes was far more accomplished when Dalot and Alejandro Garnacho combined along the right and the latter found his captain in the area: the Portuguese pulled the ­trigger, Perri palmed over.How Onana must have wished he had such safe hands because now came the first moment to forget. From the left, Almada floated over a free-kick into the corridor of uncertainty that tests whether a goalkeeper should come to claim or not.View image in fullscreenAndré Onana is beaten for Lyon’s first goal after misjudging a free-kick.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersOnana decided against doing so; the ball bounced in front of him and skidded and, despairing, he flung a glove – but this only tipped the ball into the net, as if giving catching ­practice off the thick edge of a bat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lazio registered just one shot on target as the hosts attacked time and time again.Aiming to become the first Norwegian team ever to reach a European semi-final, Bodø/Glimt took the lead two minutes after half-time when Saltnes finished at close range following a precise  pass from Ole Didrik Blomberg. The hosts made more opportunities and scored their second goal in the 69th minute.Saltnes was played through and he lofted the ball over Christos Mandas. Although Alessio Romagnoli managed to clear his shot, the ball had already crossed the line. Saltnes came close to scoring a hat-trick in the final minutes but Mandas made a crucial save to keep Lazio in touch before next week's return leg.In the Conference League,Real Betistook a step towards the semi-finals with a 2-0 home win over Polish side Jagiellonia Bialystok.

The Austrian side are favourites to book a semi-final againstChelsea, who eased to a 3-0 win at Legia Warsaw.Photograph: Lise Åserud/NTBWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The visitors needed calm but at their next attack Garnacho’s shot was snatched. Yet when they wandered off at the break the score was level: Fernandes’s free-kick was punched by Perri straight to Manuel Ugarte, whose volley was nodded in by Yoro.Openings such as this had to be taken as they were scant and because each time Lyon came at United they looked like they could crumble. Once more Mikautadze zipped down the left and turned the ball in for ­Alexandre Lacazette. Just on as a replacement for Paul Akouokou, he skewed the volley and United escaped.Ruben Amorim ‘really confident’ in André Onana despite errors in Lyon drawRead moreThe crowd remained lively despite witnessing the attritional fare more typical of the journeyman, not the elite footballer.Yoro, hoping to follow up his first United goal, launched a mazy run that took him infield from the left but ended with an attempt firmly in the file marked “speculative”.On 62 minutes, Ruben Amorim ended another lost night for Højlund by replacing him with Zirkzee.Perhaps Tolisso had caught the American’s bluntness because after slick footwork opened up United, he popped a shot tamely into Onana’s hands.

Yes, you have read that correctly.Ballester was completely unapologetic about his actions. “If I had to do it again, I would do it again,” Ballester claimed. Well, if you need to go, you need to go.The Masters 2025: day one at Augusta – liveRead moreThe 21-year-old, playing alongside Scottie Scheffler and Justin Thomas, sprinted across the fairway after playing his third shot on the par-five hole. Amid incredible scenes, he earned an ovation from galleries after relieving himself into golf’s most iconic water stretch around 60 yards short of the 13th green.“I completely forgot that we had those restrooms to the left of the tee box,” Ballester said. “I’m like, ‘I really need to pee.’ Didn’t really know where to go and since JT had an issue on the green, I’m like, I’m just going to sneak here in the river and probably people would not see me that much and then they clapped for me.“[It was] probably one of the really loud claps that got today, so that was kind of funny.” Pressed on whether he was concerned about doing this all in front of an audience, Ballester added: “They [the crowd] saw me. They saw me. It was not embarrassing at all for me.”Presumably it was yet to dawn on Ballester that Augusta National is likely to take a dim view of his public performance. Only a year ago, Australia’s Jason Day was scolded here forhis choice of sweater. Earlier this week, a college coach was removed from the Masters range for wearing shorts.The Green Jackets regard their ground as sacred and the club is yet to offer comment on the 13thhole episode.

But a closer look at the data complicates that narrativeClaire de Lunewith graphics byAndrew WitherspoonThu 10 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 09.44 EDTShareTom Thibodeau just became the fourth-winningest coach inNew York Knickshistory, passing Pat Riley on Saturday as his team notched their 49th win of the season. But as has often been the case with Thibodeau’s coaching milestones, the moment wasn’t met with pure celebration. Instead, familiar questions around a controversial overtone of his NBA coaching career loomed – namely, Thibs Minutes Syndrome.Thibodeau has long carried a reputation for running his starters into the ground, a narrative built on his unwavering reliance on his first unit and reluctance to tap into his bench. This year, Knicks starters lead the NBA in total minutes playedby more than 500 minutes. And the concern isn’t new: last year, as New York’sbest chance to make the NBA finals in decadesunraveled amid a cascade of injuries, criticism of Thibodeau’s substitution patterns resurfaced with a vengeance.View image in fullscreenTom Thibodeau coaches the Knicks during a March game against the Lakers at Crypto.com Arena.Photograph: Juan Ocampo/NBAE/Getty ImagesRecently, the conversation was reignited when one of Thibodeau’s stars, small forward Mikal Bridges – one of the league’s most durable players – wasuncharacteristically candidon the subject in an interview with the New York Post. “Sometimes it’s not fun on the body,” he told Stefan Bondy in March. “I think [Thibodeau] just gets in his ways and gets locked in. He just wants to keep the [starting player] out there.” Bridges followed that with a pointed call to give the bench more run: “We’ve got a lot of good guys on this team that can take away minutes. Which helps the defense, helps the offense, helps tired bodies being out there and giving up all these points. It helps just keeping fresh bodies out there.”Thibodeau, for his part, has long dismissed the discourse. “I think sometimes people get caught up in the wrong stuff,” he saidduring a 2018 radio appearancein Minneapolis. “The most important thing is the winning.”That philosophy has followed him for years – and so has the criticism. His reputation as a career-shortener is now accepted as near-gospel, a perception rooted in part inDerrick Rose’s devastating knee injuryunder Thibodeau’s watch in Chicago. But that perception, renewed by Bridges’ comments, prompted a deeper question: is there actual, empirical evidence that Thibodeau’s players are more prone to injury?The short answer? Not really.NBA injury data is, by nature, frustratingly opaque – injuries are often categorized alongside “rest” or “illness”, making it difficult to isolate meaningful trends. That’s why, in trying to answer the question of whether Thibodeau’s players are actually more prone to injury, we had to go deeper. That led us to Jeff Stotts of InStreetClothes – a longtime independent researcher who’s spent over a decade meticulously building his own proprietary injury database. The data isn’t public, and to our knowledge, it’s never been shared in this form before. Stotts was able to extract and isolate the specific data we needed, and after a month of obsessive digging, what we found was – while perhaps anticlimactic – illuminating: there’s no clear or consistent pattern showing Thibodeau-coached players are more likely to get hurt than anyone else.Thibodeau’s starters don’t stand out as injury-plaguedInjury spikes during his Bulls tenure can largely be attributed to Rose and a lengthy absence from Richard Hamilton. But aside from those exceptions, there’s no continuous or notable trend. While it’s fair to wonder whether heavy minutes might have subtle or long-term effects – and while Thibodeau’s approach may still be out of step with evolving sports science – the data doesn’t support a definitive link between his coaching style and injury risk.Still, the process of looking into Thibodeau’s record revealed a broader, perhaps more unsettling trend: injuries have been rising across the NBA for more than a decade, regardless of coaching style, playing time or load management.NBA starters have missed 50% more games due to injury since 2012CJ McCollum, NBPA president and guard for the injury-depleted Pelicans, sees it firsthand. He talked to the Guardian last week in Los Angeles about the somewhat alarming trend and whether he had any ideas as to what could be causing it. “I think guys are playing a lot more basketball before they get to the NBA: grassroots, high school, college,” he said. “Just a lot of basketball being played. So at 22, 24, their bodies have been through a little more than [players] in previous years.”It’s a hypothesis others share. In a 2019 feature for ESPN, Baxter Holmesdove into the theoryof how early single-sport specialization and the year-round youth hoops circuit have pushed young players’ bodies to the brink before they even reach the league. “These kids are ticking time bombs,” one expert said in the piece.McCollum also pointed to changes in team routines. “Earlier in my career, we practiced a lot more. Training camp was longer, there were more preseason games,” he said. “Now, with efforts to reduce back-to-backs, we have more single-off-day breaks and fewer practices. Guys are coming in in shape because they’re playing year-round, but there’s not as much ramp-up. Sometimes it’s too much information. Paralysis by analysis.”There’s also, of course, the unpredictable: luck. “Sometimes injuries just happen,” McCollum said. “You can do everything right and still get hurt.”His head coach, Willie Green, echoed that uncertainty. “I do not have a good guess on what the reason is,” Green said. “But I think the best thing we can do is have depth – a deep roster to withstand injuries. That’s what we’ve done in the past. This year, we just didn’t have enough guys available to fill in when our main players went down.”And that’s where the Thibodeau debate still has legs. Even if his players aren’t getting hurt more than others, the broader trend of rising injuries – especially among starters logging heavy minutes – suggests every team may need to embrace depth more proactively. High-end talent isn’t going to become less important in the NBA landscape any time soon, but Green is likely onto something: depth may just be the way of the future for teams looking to weather an increasingly inevitable injury storm.Explore more on these topicsNew York KnicksNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The World Cup that precedes it, in 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, is set to be the first with an already expanded, 48-team field.The 2026 expansion is already facing criticism that it devalues the group stage, with eight of 12 total third-place teams making the knockout round. Under a 32-team format, the top two teams in each group made the knockout round.Uruguay was the original World Cup host in 1930 and is scheduled to stage one game in 2030. Paraguay, Argentina, Spain, Portugal and Morocco are also co-hosts.“That is why we are proposing, for the first time, to hold this anniversary with 64 teams, on three continents simultaneously,” added Domínguez.Critics of the 64-team proposal have argued it will weaken the quality of play and devalue the qualifying program in most continents. For example, expanding to 64 teams would probably guarantee all 10 Conmebol member countries a place in a bigger tournament. Venezuela is the only one of the group that has never qualified for a World Cup.“This will allow all countries to have the opportunity to live the world experience and so nobody on the planet is left out of the party,” added Domínguez.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite Bergvall’s best efforts, as the 19-year-old covered every blade of grass for the cause in a performance that belied his age, they could not build on Pedro Porro’s improvised back-heeled equaliser asEintracht Frankfurtheld on for a draw that will probably make them favourites to progress to the semi-finals.Yet after all the bitterness of recent weeks, at least this was a positive performance from Tottenham that maintains their manager’s hopes of ending the season with silverware and perhaps keeping his job.Onana’s errors cost Manchester United chance to gain advantage over LyonRead morePostecoglou had bristled beforehand at suggestions that he could be sacked even if Spurs end up winning this competition for the third time in their history. Other than a lapse of concentration at the start that made their task even harder against a Frankfurt side who came to frustrate, only the woodwork denied Tottenham the victory they probably deserved as Micky van de Ven came close to finding a winner in injury time.“I’m resigned to the fact that the football Gods have got their eyes elsewhere this year – they’re obviously busy with other clubs and other managers so whatever we get we’re going to have to do it without them,” said Postecoglou. “If we can perform like that over there then we will give ourselves a good chance.”View image in fullscreenFrankfurt’s Hugo Ekitiké beats Pedro Porro to slot in the opening goal.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThere had not been much optimism to be found at kick-off among a fanbase that has become so used to disappointment in recent years. While Tottenham’s successes in 1972 and 1984 date back to its predecessor the Uefa Cup, Dino Toppmöller’s side also have serious pedigree at this level having triumphed under Oliver Glasner – the Crystal Palace manager who was linked to a potential move across London to replace Postecoglou this week – in 2022.Their vociferous travelling support did not have to wait long for something to celebrate. Much has been made of Tottenham’s injuries at the back this season but with their first-choice defence available again and Rodrigo Bentancur back after suspension, it was all too easy for Frankfurt to cut through in the sixth minute when Ellyes Skhiri won the ball from James Maddison.Ekitiké scored a brilliant hat-trick for France Under 21s against England last month and is expected to attract interest from Arsenal and Liverpool among others in the summer. On this evidence, the 22-year-old former Paris Saint-Germain striker could be a shrewd investment as he cut in from the left flank and shrugged off challenges from Porro and Cristian Romero before shooting into the corner.View image in fullscreenEintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kaua Santos watches as the ball clatters against the crossbar.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMaddison made up for his early discretion by supplying the pass that set up Porro for his equaliser after Spurs had initially struggled to mount a response. The Spaniard’s brilliant back-heel after good work from Dominic Solanke in the buildup finally brought the home fans to life. But Ekitiké could easily have scored his second of the night had he capitalised on a slip from Porro on the stroke of half-time, only to shoot straight at Guglielmo Vicario.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thank goodness for Spurs that Bergvall – 13 years his junior – sprinted back to clear the danger just in time. The Swedish teenager had been by far Tottenham’s most creative player and he was desperately unlucky not to give his side the lead when he let fly from 30 yards out after beating two players with a sublime touch, only for a swerving shot to cannon off the angle of post and crossbar.Quick GuideRoundup: Lazio freeze at Bodø/GlimtShowTwo goals from Ulrik Saltnes [pictured] spurredBodø/Glimtto a 2-0 home victory over Serie A giantsLazioin the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday, with the one-sided encounter played out in freezing conditions.Snow had blanked the artificial pitch overnight in northern Norway, and although it was cleared in time for kick-off, the Italians struggled to adapt to zero-degree conditions, spending much of the match on the defensive. Lazio registered just one shot on target as the hosts attacked time and time again.Aiming to become the first Norwegian team ever to reach a European semi-final, Bodø/Glimt took the lead two minutes after half-time when Saltnes finished at close range following a precise  pass from Ole Didrik Blomberg. The hosts made more opportunities and scored their second goal in the 69th minute.Saltnes was played through and he lofted the ball over Christos Mandas. Although Alessio Romagnoli managed to clear his shot, the ball had already crossed the line. Saltnes came close to scoring a hat-trick in the final minutes but Mandas made a crucial save to keep Lazio in touch before next week's return leg.In the Conference League,Real Betistook a step towards the semi-finals with a 2-0 home win over Polish side Jagiellonia Bialystok. Cédric Bakambu broke the deadlock after running on to Pablo Fornals' pass, with youngster Jesús Rodríguez curling home the hosts' second goal just before half-time.Fiorentina, losing finalists in 2023 and 2024, are on track to face Betis in the final four after earning a 2-1 over Celje in Slovenia. Luca Ranieri struck from a tight angle to put La Viola ahead, with Rolando Mandragora adding a second from the spot before Logan Delaurier-Chaubet scored a penalty for the hosts.Rapid Viennaedged to a 1-0 away win over Djurgården, with Hampus Finndell's own goal the difference in Sweden. The Austrian side are favourites to book a semi-final againstChelsea, who eased to a 3-0 win at Legia Warsaw.Photograph: Lise Åserud/NTBWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That proved to be the spark for the hosts as Son Heung-min forced Kauã Santos into his first significant save of the evening before Bentancur’s header from the resulting corner came back off the bar. The Frankfurt goalkeeper then did well to keep out Maddison’s effort following a swivel inside the area.Postecoglou prowled his technical area as Tottenham went in search of a winner, although it was a surprise to see him wait until the 79th minute before making a triple substitution. A combination of Mathys Tel and Djed Spence set up Brennan Johnson but his effort was way off target and Postecoglou reacted by burying his head in his hands. It was that kind of night.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueTottenham HotspurEintracht Frankfurtmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He already had 14 points on 5-of-9 shooting with three threes in the first 10 and a half minutes.“It was a beautiful moment. I thought the video was great,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said. “But I think just his ability to then go perform, lights turn on, he’s teary-eyed still as we walk out on the court for the tip ball. To have the emotional resolve to then go put on that kind of performance, it’s superhuman.”The other four Lakers starters had already been introduced as Dončić looked up to watch many highlights from his time in Dallas – from being the 2018-19NBArookie of the year to last year’s NBA finals when he was the league scoring champion.Dončić didn’t make it all the way through before putting his head down and wiping away tears. His eyes were still red once he was introduced and came on the court to be surrounded by his teammates and get several hugs.The 26-year-old from Slovenia had thought he would spend his entire career in Dallas before that seismic trade out of nowhere the first weekend of February, a deal that brought Anthony Davis to Dallas.“It was a little bit of both, happy and angry, but it’s nice to see some familiar faces here,” Dončić said about arriving at the American Airlines Center before Wednesday’s game. “It was a lot emotions. When I woke up, I was tired. Ain’t going to lie, I didn’t sleep much. Excited about this game. I really appreciate the fans, the way they reacted to me.”There were loud cheers throughout the night, plus extended ovations when he was first introduced and then exited the game in the closing minutes. Draped over every seat in the arena was a T-shirt with “Hvala za vse” across the front – that Slovenian phrase translates to “Thank you for everything.”Dončić called it an amazing and unbelievable experience, but one that he is happy to have done.“Now I can get some sleep finally,” he said.Right after tipoff, fans began chanting “Fire Nico” for the Mavericks general manager who traded Dončić. That chant got louder and longer in the first quarter, and repeated numerous times during the game, when Nico Harrison was seen standing just outside a tunnel.Mavericks fans conducted a mock funeral outside the American Airlines Center on 2 February, right after news of the trade late the previous night. There have been protests and plenty of ire directed at Harrison, including “Fire Nico!” showing up on plenty of signs and T-shirts. The GM hasn’t spoken to the media since comments he made right after the deal was done.While there were no organized protests outside the arena before the game, No 77 jerseys were everywhere – both the purple and gold ones of the Lakers and blue Mavericks jerseys as well, though some of those home ones had the Dallas logo covered up. There were even some Slovenia jerseys.One fan sitting a couple of rows behind the Dallas bench had a Mavericks No 77 jersey, but had “Lakers” written on duct tape covering up the logo. A fan outside wore a Los Angeles jersey with duct tape covering the Lakers logo that read “Former Mavs fan.”This wasn’t the first time Dončić played the Mavericks. He had a triple-double (19 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists) in the Lakers’ 107-99 home win on Feb. 25, only 23 days after the trade.Los Angeles are 21-12 since Dončić was acquired. The Lakers are 17-9 in the games he has played for them.Dallas are 12-19 since the trade and Davis has played in only eight of those games (five wins). The 10-time All-Star missed six weeks after his dominant debut with the Mavs on 8 February, when he had 26 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists and three blocks against Houston before coming up lame in the third quarter because of a groin injury.“With AD, we got traded for each other, so from now on, everybody’s going to compare us two,” Dončić said. “I think he’s an amazing player and I think is going to do really good in Dallas.”Dončić admitted he had struggled to maintain his composure during the pre-game ceremony.“I don’t know how I did it because when I was watching that video I was like ‘There’s no way I’m playing this game,’” he told ESPN. “But all my teammates had my back and were really supporting me.“There were so many emotions I can’t even explain. It brought tears to my eyes. I came here as a young kid, aged 18, and they made me feel like it was home. Just a lot of great memories.“I love these fans, I love this city but it’s time to move on.”Explore more on these topicsLuka DončićNBALos Angeles LakersDallas MavericksBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Gout’s heat time also had an illegal wind reading of 3.5m/s.Gout said he felt “pretty good” after the final, and that he wasn’t upset by the conditions that prevented him formally recording a sub-10s time.“Sometimes it’s frustrating, but you know, you can’t control what you can’t control, and the wind is obviously a thing you can’t control, you’ve got to learn how to run with it or run against it,” he said.The Australian 100m record was set by Patrick Johnson in 2003, with a time of 9.93s.Gout is only the third Australian to run the 100m quicker than 10s in any conditions, after Johnson – who went as fast as 9.88s with a 3.6m/s tailwind in Perth a month before he set the Australian record in 2003 – and Rohan Browning, who stopped the clock at 9.96s in Wollongong in 2021, but with 3.3m/s behind him.pic.twitter.com/DdalJXwWQu— Australian Athletics (@AustralianAths)April 10, 2025Gout chose to contest the under-20 category for the 100m at this meet, while he juggles the opens competition in the 200m in which he holds the national record.“Sub-10 is something every sprinter hopes for and to get this early in the season is definitely great, so to gain that sub-10 definitely boosts my confidence, especially for my main event, the 200,” he said.At the WAAthleticsStadium on Thursday, thousands streamed into the stands in time for Gout’s races, while about 80 journalists and photographers are accredited for the meet, roughly three times the total of last year.“This is what Athletics Australia needs, this is what we wake up in the morning for, this is what we train for, and I couldn’t ask for anything better,” Gout said.The Queenslander is due to compete in the opens 200m on Sunday against Lachie Kennedy, the 21-year-old who upstaged Gout at the Maurie Plant meet two weeks ago.The national 200m record is 20.04s, set by Gout in December.In the first heat of the highly anticipated 1500m events, Paris silver medallist Jessica Hull beat Georgia Griffith by a quarter of a second despite challenging preparation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Without Erling Haaland, unavailable until mid-May at the earliest, City were toothless at Old Trafford, and with Crystal Palace arriving at the Etihad on a run of six wins in seven matches – the other was a draw – it is time for Pep Guardiola to earn his salary by ensuring his side are far better, or Europa League football may be on the cards next season.Jamie JacksonManchester City v Crystal Palace, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)2Lallana takes role in saving Saints’ blushesIt will be a case of deja vu for Simon Rusk as he takes interim charge of Southampton for the second time this season after the sacking of Ivan Juric. The former Boston, York and Crawley midfielder oversaw aCarabao Cup defeat to Liverpooland a goalless draw at Craven Cottage afterRussell Martin lost his jobin December. The main headline to come out of another sorry club statement this week was theappointment of Adam Lallanaas Rusk’s assistant – the 36-year-old has made 14 Premier League appearances since rejoining the Saints last summer after four years at Brighton. Rusk and Lallana’s primary objective is to pick up the two points that will ensure they avoid Derby’s notorious 11-point nadir, starting with the visit of Aston Villa.Billy MundaySouthampton v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenAdam Lallana at a Southampton training session at St Mary's this week.Photograph: Matt Watson/Southampton FC/Getty Images3Ndiaye faces tough defence at City GroundThe relief in David Moyes’ voice was clear as he spoke about the return of Iliman Ndiaye to his starting lineup last weekend. The Senegal international, who had not started since mid-February because of a knee injury, converted a second-half penaltyto earn Everton a point at Goodison Park. “We’ve missed Ili, we really have,” Moyes said. “He’s one of our major talents in the frontline.” Ndiaye, who spent time with Boreham Wood at youth level and made his professional debut while on loan at seventh-tier Hyde United, has scored in four of the six games he has started under Moyes since the Scot’s return in January. That said, he may find it tough against a Nottingham Forest side who have not conceded at home in the league for almost three months.BMNottingham Forest v Everton, Saturday 3pm4Dunk running out of time at BrightonNext month marks the 15th anniversary of Lewis Dunk’s Brighton debut in a 0-0 draw against MK Dons when they were still in the backwaters of League One. The defender has been instrumental in his boyhood club’s rise up the pyramid, which culminated in him leading them into the Europa League last season. But having lost his place with England after being an unused member of the Euro 2024 squad, the years appear to be catching up with him. Injuries and a loss of form have restricted the 33-year-old to just 19Premier Leaguestarts so far this campaign, compared to more than 30 in all but one of Brighton’s campaigns since they were promoted in 2017. With only one year remaining on Dunk’s contract, PSV Eindhoven’s Olivier Boscagli is among the potential replacements being considered this summer. Dunk is expected to start on Saturday, against a Leicester side who seem to have forgotten how to score a goal, as Brighton try to get their European push back on track.Ed AaronsBrighton v Leicester, Saturday 3pm5Kiwior comes to the fore for Arsenal“We lost maybe our best defender for four months, then Jakub Kiwior comes in and delivers the performances he’s delivering,” enthused Mikel Arteta after Tuesday’s sensational win over Real Madrid. “It’s not a coincidence.” The Poland centre-back has been a bit-part player season and was almost allowed to leave Arsenal last summer amid strong interest from several Italian clubs. But despite a few jitters at the start against Madrid, the 25-year-old, who filled in out of position at left-back last season, showed he is capable of playing at the very highest level with an assured performance against Kylian Mbappé and co. Arsenal are yet to be defeated in the eight games he and William Saliba have started together in central defence, and it will be interesting to see if either is rested againstBrentfordon Saturday with the second leg at the Bernabéu to come in midweek.EAArsenal v Brentford, Saturday 5.30pm6Chelsea to take closer look at DelapLiam Delap has an audition on Sunday: Chelsea are targeting the striker and have a chance to assess him when they host Ipswich Town. They will be wary of the 22-year-old, whose release clause drops to £30m if Ipswich go down, given he has already terrorised them once this season. He was in bulldozing form when Kieran McKenna’s side earned their only home league win of the campaign bybeating Chelsea 2-0 in December, Chelsea were unable to cope with his strength and speed, and Delap, who has scored twice in his last two appearances, will hope to make a similar impact at Stamford Bridge.Jacob Steinbergskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Vítor Pereira faces a selection headache before hosting Ange Postecoglou’s side on Sunday: the reintegration of his star attacker, Matheus Cunha. While the Brazilian’s talent and match-winning ability are undeniable, Wolves have flown during his suspension, stringing together three consecutive league wins for the first time since 2023. In recent matches, they have accrued more points per game without Cunha than with, albeit against teams lower in the table, the current attacking unit finding a rhythm and confidence that Pereira will not want to disrupt. Can he balance the desire to unleash his most potent attacking weapon without upsetting the team’s hard-earned momentum?Yara El-ShabouryWolves v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm8Liverpool seek a relaxing run-inIt is not a question of who will win the Premier League title but how it will be won: at a canter or with Liverpool testing the anxiety levels of their supporters once again? The answer should become clearer following West Ham’s visit. A catalogue of individual errors resulted in the end of Liverpool’s 26-game unbeaten league run at Fulham last weekend and left Arne Slot’s team still needing 11 points to secure the club’s 20th league championship, although the total will be fewer should Arsenal drop any more points. West Ham, Leicester and Tottenham, Liverpool’s next three opponents, present the more straightforward route to victory than trying to get over the line against Chelsea, Arsenal, Brighton andCrystal Palacein the final four games of the season. Anfield could be an apprehensive place on Sunday and will be looking to the team’s experienced leaders to get the job almost done.Andy HunterLiverpool v West Ham, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenCody Gakpo and Curtis Jones in Liverpool training this week.Photograph: Nikki Dyer/LFC/Getty Images9Howe’s success a reminder for RatcliffeIt is fair to say that throwing Eddie Howe’s name into the hat as a potential successor to Erik ten Hag did not endear Dan Ashworth to Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Manchester United’s owner was reportedly underwhelmed, telling his then-sporting director that he wanted someone with more charisma. Ultimately, Ratcliffe recruited Ruben Amorim and Howe stayed put at Newcastle but Ashworth, who has now moved on from Old Trafford, remains a highly regarded judge of coaching character and capability. During an earlier executive stint at Newcastle, Ashworth did not always see eye-to-eye with Howe, yet fully appreciated his tactical acumen and capacity to improve players. Comparisons are often invidious but was Amorim really a better appointment? Although only time will tell, Sunday’s clash of the two Uniteds on Tyneside may offer Ratcliffe pause for thought. Not to mention a reminder that assumptions can be dangerous.Louise TaylorNewcastle v Manchester United, Sunday 4.30pm10Scott ready to give Cherries fresh impetusThe consistent brilliance of exciting young talents like Illia Zabarnyi, Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen has been the mainstay of Bournemouth’s success this season. But Andoni Iraola’s side are running out of steam and it might be time to inject fresh impetus. They are winless in their last six league games, their longest such run since February last year, and have dropped seven points from winning positions in their last four matches, which is as many as they dropped in their first 27 this season. Enter Alex Scott. Having arrived with a stellar Championship reputation, Scott’s progress has been frustratingly punctured by a meniscus tear which kept him out for four months. He is fit now, though, and offers versatility in central midfield, capable of deep playmaking and driving forward. With Ryan Christie sidelined owing to a groin injury for Monday’s match against Fulham, the 21-year-old’s dynamic edge could reignite Bournemouth’s spark.YE-SBournemouth vFulham, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3142732Arsenal3130623Nottm Forest3114574Chelsea3117535Newcastle3013536Man City3117527Aston Villa310518Fulham315489Brighton3124710AFC Bournemouth31114511Crystal Palace3044312Brentford3144213Man Utd31-43814Tottenham Hotspur31133715Everton31-53516West Ham31-173517Wolverhampton31-163218Ipswich31-342019Leicester31-451720Southampton31-5110Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolArsenalNottingham ForestChelseaManchester CityNewcastle UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Within a quarter of an hour a review had led to the Rangers defender Robin Pröpper being dismissed, while in the second halfAthletic Bilbaohad a goal disallowed only to be awarded a penalty, in the same sequence of events, that was then saved. The end result was a goalless draw for Rangers to take to the Basque Country next week and the hope they can return for the Europa League final.Onana’s errors cost Manchester United chance to gain advantage over LyonRead moreThe red card sharpened theRangersminds as they fought to stay in the tie. They twice thought that had been snatched away when first Álex Berenguer fired in from an offside position before failing to redeem the situation from the spot.If the monitor was the focal point on the sidelines, Liam Kelly was it on the pitch. The goalkeeper was brought in to replace Jack Butland after a litany of mistakes in recent weeks and the dismal loss at home to Hibernian on Saturday. Barry Ferguson described dropping Butland as “one of the toughest things I’ve had to do” but the backup proved the coach’s bold choice to be the right one.It looked as if the hard work by every Rangers player had taken its toll when the fresh legs of Gorka Guruzeta and Berenguer got beyond the backline. The former took the first shot and the latter the second, which finally defeated Kelly. No one saw any immediate problem but the eagle-eyed video boffins spotted an offside to disallow a goal and then a handball in the buildup from Dujon Sterling. Ibrox was confused and deflated by what was going on but Kelly maintained his focus and thrust a leg upwards to flick Berenguer’s penalty over the bar.View image in fullscreenRomanian referee Istvan Kovacs shows a red card to Rangers’s Dutch defender Robin Pröpper.Photograph: Ewan Bootman/AFP/Getty ImagesKelly provided the quality while everyone else showed strength of character and determination to keep Athletic at bay. It was always going to be difficult for Rangers but once Pröpper’s yellow card was upgraded to a red in the 13th minute for a foul on Iñaki Williams on the edge of the box, the task doubled for a team ­hoping to avoid a sixth successive home defeat. The decision was harsh but justified by the referee, Istvan Kovacs, who enjoyed a busy night and got plenty of steps in jogging over to the monitor.“I’m really proud of the effort and the commitment that my players showed tonight,” said Ferguson. “I said to them before the game, we need to make sure we’re in this tie, and certainly the tie is there for us to go in and try and get through into the semi-finals.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Athletic dominated from that moment onwards, enjoying more than 70% possession on the night. They lacked a cutting edge however, struggling with being constantly hounded by two layers of a blue wall sitting outside the box. “I couldn’t care less if they had 100% possession, so long as we make sure we don’t concede,” Ferguson said.Maroan Sannadi had numerous chances to break the deadlock but a mix of Kelly’s reflexes and poor finishing kept the red and white corner of Ibrox quiet. Athletic had 19 shots but only three on target. The hosts were not aiming to score, they just wanted some hope to cling on to in seven days’ time, when a full complement of players in the San Mamés Stadium could prevail.It was still a case of holding on for Rangers, who finished with nine men after Sterling was taken off on a stretcher late on. They stood firm and thoroughly deserved the result, and now have one meaningful visit to Bilbao to look forward to. “We’ll go and give it our best shot,” Ferguson said, which should worry Athletic.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueRangersAthletic Bilbaomatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He was quite good in the first half, taking responsibility. He was probably better in the middle.“The one I fell in love with tonight is Josh Acheampong. He can be a fantastic player for this club. A good player can play in different positions and he showed that. Since we started I’m in love with him but tonight he showed he can be a very good player for this club. He can be good in different positions. The best thing for Josh is that he’s open – he wants to learn. ‘Full-back? No problem, what do I have to do?’”Quick GuideRoundup: Lazio freeze at Bodø/GlimtShowTwo goals from Ulrik Saltnes [pictured] spurredBodø/Glimtto a 2-0 home victory over Serie A giantsLazioin the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday, with the one-sided encounter played out in freezing conditions.Snow had blanked the artificial pitch overnight in northern Norway, and although it was cleared in time for kick-off, the Italians struggled to adapt to zero-degree conditions, spending much of the match on the defensive. Lazio registered just one shot on target as the hosts attacked time and time again.Aiming to become the first Norwegian team ever to reach a European semi-final, Bodø/Glimt took the lead two minutes after half-time when Saltnes finished at close range following a precise  pass from Ole Didrik Blomberg. The hosts made more opportunities and scored their second goal in the 69th minute.Saltnes was played through and he lofted the ball over Christos Mandas. Although Alessio Romagnoli managed to clear his shot, the ball had already crossed the line. Saltnes came close to scoring a hat-trick in the final minutes but Mandas made a crucial save to keep Lazio in touch before next week's return leg.In the Conference League,Real Betistook a step towards the semi-finals with a 2-0 home win over Polish side Jagiellonia Bialystok.

For sure, you can be quicker on the ball and take more risks, shoot more, like we scored the first one.“Overall, a professional performance, a good result. We were much better in the second half compared to the first half for different reasons. We need to learn to play different kind of games.”Palmer appeared to receive a knock in the first half before being taken off at the interval, though Maresca confirmed there was not a problem before Sunday’s Premier League meeting at home to Ipswich.“We planned for him and Tosin [Adarabioyo] to come off on 45 minutes,” he said. “Everything is fine.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa Conference LeagueLegia WarsawChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Thomas Clay, one of the forward’s legal experts, said Mbappé had been authorised to make a precautionary seizure of the money, which was frozen from PSG’s bank accounts on Thursday. A legal hearing is scheduled for 26 May, he said.Champions League review: Kane v Martínez and Rice’s newfound skillRead more“This story has been going on for just over a year now,” Mbappé’s main lawyer, Delphine Verheyden, said. “One year was the deadline we set for ourselves for trying to resolve this dispute as peacefully as possible. As the months went by,Kylian Mbappéstill hasn’t been paid the missing €55m. A decision has been taken, this time to go on the attack.” Verheyden said they were also asking the French sports minister to intervene and to challenge legally a decision by the appeals commission of the French football federation, which ruled that Mbappé’s appeal against PSG was inadmissible because of a ­continuing procedure in a civil court.Separately, she said Mbappé had asked the federation to inform Uefa that PSG failed to pay him what he was owed, in breach of the club’s salary obligations.Verheyden suggested that if PSG were found responsible the club could lose the licence allowing them to play in the Champions League.A Uefa spokesperson told Reuters: “The case is only indirectly linked with us in terms of possible arrears of payment. If a final decision is taken by the French authorities and confirms that there are indeed arrears … the club would then have to pay the arrears on time or risk noncompliance with financial fair play.”Last October, the French league (LFP) appeals commission upheld the decision ordering PSG to pay Mbappé the unpaid wages he wants. Mbappé claims the club owes him three months’ salary and the last third of a loyalty bonus.He joined Real Madrid from PSGlast summer on a free transfer after scoring a club-record 256 goals in seven years.PSG argued that when Mbappé was sidelined before the 2023-24 season – after his decision not to extend his contract – there was a verbal agreement with him opting to relinquish bonuses in order to return to the team. “They have not shown any evidence of any agreement,” Verheyden said.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé’s lawyers speak to the media in Paris on Thursday.Photograph: Michel Euler/AP“After hearing yet another fantastic story from a parallel universe today, PSG continues to fail to understand why Kylian Mbappé is not taking his case to the labour chamber, which is the only court competent to settle the dispute between him and his former club,” PSG said on Thursday.Mbappé’s lawyers have said they would submit their case before the labour chamber.Mbappé’s relationship with PSGended amid deep tensionsand some fans booed him in his last home game at the Parc des Princes. PSG felt let down by Mbappé after offering him the most lucrative contract in club history when he signed a new deal in 2022. But Mbappé was frustrated because he felt promises to sign key players were not kept. When he signed that deal, he was paraded in front of fans holding up a jersey with 2025 on it. Mbappé was reportedly annoyed because the contract was until 2024 – with a player’s option for an extra season.Mbappé stunned PSG in June 2023 by informing the club he would not take the option for the extra year and was left off a pre-season tour to Japan and South Korea and forced to train with fringe players. PSG said they would rather sell him than let him leave for free in 2024 buthe rejected a €300m moveto the Saudi Arabian team Al-Hilal. PSG left Mbappé out of the opening league game of that season but he soon returned to the team after talks.Mbappé’s legal team said on Thursday they would start an action against PSG for harassment because of the way he was treated. They will also start another legal procedure before an industrial tribunal, and Mbappé and his mother have filed lawsuits for abuse they received online.Explore more on these topicsKylian MbappéParis Saint-GermainReal MadridnewsShareReuse this content"

A statement from the Amsterdam side added: “Ajax extends heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of Leo Beenhakker.”Beenhakker also twice managed the Dutch national team, in 1986 and 1990. The Rotterdam-born coach guided the Oranje to the 1990 World Cup in Italy, where they lost to the eventual champions, West Germany, in a bad-tempered last-16 clash.The much-travelled Dutch coach also had spells in charge of Swiss club Grasshoppers, Mexican side Club América, Istanbulspor in Turkey and Spain’s Real Zaragoza, as well as a stint in charge of Saudi Arabia. His lengthy coaching career began in 1965 at SV Epe following an amateur playing career as a winger, and took in more than 30 roles.Beenhakker guided his hometown club, Feyenoord, to the Eredivisie title in 1999 and 2000. He then took Trinidad and Tobago to a first World Cup appearance in 2006, where they drew with Sweden and ran England close before losing 2-0 and exiting in the group stage with a defeat to Paraguay.The final international managerial job for Beenhakker came with Poland, which saw the team qualify for their first-ever European Championship in 2008. He then worked as a technical director for Ujpest in Hungary, director of football with Trinidad and Tobago, and as a director and advisor for Sparta Rotterdam until 2018.Explore more on these topicsReal MadridNetherlandsEuropean club footballAjaxnewsShareReuse this content"

Price thrilled the crowd with the fourth nine-darter of this season’s Premier League, checking out 141 with a treble 19, treble 20 and double 12 to claim his set of 18-carat gold darts – but Littler won 6-3.That set up a semi-final against world No 1 Humphries, who thrashed Stephen Bunting 6-1 with an average of 118.43, the third-highest in Premier League history. Littler missed double 10 three times to blow the opening leg as Humphries took a 2-0 lead.Littler almost hit a nine-darter of his own in the third leg, missing badly on double 12, and went 3-2 up before another costly error opened the door for his rival to advance to the final, winning 6-3 despite a lower average than Littler (93.80 to 96.63).On the other side of the draw, Aspinall saw off Rob Cross 6-2 in his opening match before winning by the same scoreline against Michael van Gerwen, who was still feeling the effects of a bizarre shoulder injury he gave himself when trying on shirts last week.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler and Gerwyn Price congratulate each other after Littler’s win and Price’s nine-darter.Photograph: Matt McNulty/Getty ImagesCome the final, Humphries raced into a 3-0 lead but Aspinall reeled off the next five before a ragged end to the contest. “The Asp” began the 10th leg with six perfect darts, but then missed five match doubles – and watched in agony as Humphries almost took out 170 to level the game again.Aspinall finally nailed double four to win the night in front of an adoring home crowd. “I had a feeling I was going to make the final a couple of days ago,” Aspinall said. “To come out on top is an amazing feeling.“I’ve never felt that nervous at the end. It was the most nervous six or seven darts I’ve ever thrown. I just wanted to win so much for this crowd, the support they’ve given me the last few years has been amazing and they came out in their thousands to support me, I wanted to win for them.“Luckily he missed a 170 and I won,” the 33-year-old added. “It was the perfect final for me to win wasn’t it? It wasn’t comfortable. I went 3-0 down and I came back to win 6-4. That’s my career isn’t it?”Littler stays top of the standings with 28 points after 10 rounds, five points clear of Humphries, while the win lifts Aspinall into the top four, level with Price on 15 points.Explore more on these topicsDartsLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

The second, in the last moments of added time, featured a weak push straight to Rayan Cherki, who equalised. At that point, United were leading through Joshua Zirkzee’s 87th-minute header, which followed Leny Yoro’s equaliser.Onana errors cost Manchester United and let Lyon have the last laughRead moreAmorim was asked what he will say to Onana. “Nothing,” said the head coach. “We have training, go with [Jorge] Vital [goalkeeping coach] and we deal with that – really natural. That can happen with any player. There’s nothing I can say to André in this moment that will help. The most important thing is to be natural and then, when the time comes, I will choose the best XI to play. But I’m really confident in André.“It can happen, if you play football, you play a lot of games, you can make mistakes. If you look at the season, I make more mistakes than them during these last games and these last months.”Onana’s mistakes came after he and Nemanja Matic had a pre-game spat. The former United midfielder had branded Onana one of United’s worst-ever keepers, and the Cameroonian replied that he had won trophies at the club – unlike Matic.Amorim was asked if this might have distracted Onana during the match. “I don’t know, that can happen,” he said. “The best thing is to look at the goals, all the actions that André had in the game, talk with Vital – this is the best way to help any player, it’s to focus on the game, what happened, what we need to improve and then put the player in. I didn’t see him [after the game], to be honest with you. I use these minutes to try to calm down, to come here to say the right things.“It’s normal. I felt the dressing room really quiet, we draw away in Europe, that is always hard, but the team is suffering, we need to change that.”The tie is poised before Thursday’s second leg at Old Trafford. “The other thing is we have one more game to change everything and that should be our focus,” Amorim said.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedLyonEuropa LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Things seem to be continuously going in an unstable direction. I’ve got to be honest, we are getting to a point now where our actions are having little impact with those guys.”Reid’s resignation follows only a day after the chair of Motorsport UK, David Richards, published an open letter expressing a growing number of people had legitimate concerns that: “The governance and constitutional organisation of the FIA is becoming ever more opaque and concentrating power in the hands of the president alone”. He added damningly: “We cannot allow a shift of the moral compass of our leadership to simply dismiss any request for transparency and open discourse.”Shortly after Reid’s resignation, the former FIA chief executive Natalie Robyn, who was reportedly forced to step down in May 2024 after disagreements with Ben Sulayem, referred to Reid’s decision as indicating that the FIA had “serious ongoing structural challenges”.“When professional processes are not adhered to and stakeholders are excluded from decision-making, it undermines the foundation of a strong organisation,” she told the BBC. “I am saddened to see these developments, as they threaten both the credibility and the long-term effectiveness of an important institution.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Russell, in the paddock in Bahrain, has questioned why the FIA is so unstable.Photograph: Paddocker/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe pointed and sustained criticism puts Ben Sulayem under pressure as his first term as president is set to conclude in December, when he will face re-election. As things stand he remains unopposed.His time in charge at the FIA has been marked by discord and controversy. Drivers have been repeatedly angered by the FIA’s adherence to the letter of the rules, including clampdowns on wearing jewelleryand swearing, both understood to have come directly from the president and to changes regarding their public behaviour including speaking out on issues not relating to the sport.His attitude towards women has been called into question due to sexist comments made on his former website, which the FIA said were historic and did not “reflect his current beliefs”. Under his watch the FIA is now being sued by Susie Wolff, the director of the all-female series the F1 Academy, after the body launched a conflict of interest enquiry into Wolff and her husband Toto, the team principal of Mercedes, which was then dropped after only two days.He has angered F1’s owner by making remarks about the value of the sport and been accused of interfering in grands prix by a whistleblower, claims which were subsequently dismissed after an investigation by the FIA’s own ethics committee. The officer in charge of the investigation, Paolo Basarri, was subsequently sacked.Reid is the latest in a long line of senior personnel to have left since Ben Sulayem took over. When Robyn left it followed the resignations of single-seater technical director, Tim Goss, the sporting director Steve Nielsen and Deborah Mayer, the president of the FIA’s Women in Motorsport Commission.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can no longer, in good faith, remain part of a system that does not reflect those values.”The FIA issued a response to Reid’s resignation. “The FIA is grateful for Robert Reid’s contribution to the FIA and to motor sport more widely,” it read. “The FIA has exceptionally robust corporate governance policies which guide our operations and ensure our rules, practices and processes are adhered to.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Relevent’s contention, broadly, was that US Soccer’s refusal to sanction foreign domestic league games in the United States, and Fifa’s policy barring domestic league games from taking place outside their home territory, amounted to violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act.The terms of the settlement between US Soccer and Relevent are not yet known.“We are pleased to put this matter behind us as we remain focused on growing the game and harnessing the momentum of US Soccer ahead of next year’s World Cup,” US Soccer said in a statement to the Guardian.A relevent spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but CEO Danny Stillman told ESPN in a statement that “we appreciate US Soccer’s collaboration in reaching this settlement. Ultimately, we all share the same goal: growing the sport throughout America. We’re excited to continue supporting clubs from Europe and around the world to expand the sport’s reach and impact across the US.”Relevent’s suit againstFifaand US Soccer has its roots in a 2018 attempt by the promoter to hold a La Liga game, Barcelona v Girona, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, which like Relevent is owned by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross. When Fifa announced its policy barring domestic leagues from holding games abroad later that year, Barcelona withdrew from its commitment. Relevent later attempted to hold an Ecuadorian league game in the US, and when US Soccer denied sanctioning for the match due to Fifa policy, Relevent filed suit against US Soccer and later added Fifa as a defendant.The suit was initially dimissed in July 2021 before being revived on appeal in 2023. Relevent and Fifa agreed to drop the worldwide governing body from the suit a year ago. A month later, Fifaannounced a “working group”intended to issue recommendations regarding the organization’s international match policy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At 54, the American’s smile seems to be the one bit of his game that’s still in good trim. He cuts an odd figure around the grounds these days, in his aviator shades and LIV-branded kit. Mickelson is a six-time major champion, and three-time Masters winner, and by any measure one of the very best to ever do it. He ought to be one of the most popular men here but it can feel hard to find anyone in the clubhouse who has two kind words about him to rub together.The Masters 2025: day one at Augusta – liveRead more“I don’t know what level Phil is competing at,” said Jack Nicklaus in his morning press conference. “I guess he’s still playing. He’s playing the LIV Tour, is he? I don’t know if he’s playing or not. I don’t know. You never see that any more.” Nicklaus is 85 now, and while he knows damn well which tour Mickelson is on these days, he evidently doesn’t want to spend any of the time he has left watching him play on it. “You know, Phil has been a good player, there’s no question about that,” Nicklaus offered. “He has been competitive in an odd event here and there but not really in the last few years.” Ouch.He’s not wrong, mind. Mickelsonfinished runner-uphere in 2023, when a brilliant final-round 65 swept him up the field from 10 shots back, but since then he has missed more cuts in the majors than he has made. His best finish in the seven he has played was 43rd here last year. Even more dispiriting, he has only just recorded his first solo top-10 finish on the LIV tour. He came third behind Sergio García in Hong Kong last week. Whatever else LIV got for the $200m-odd it is supposed to have paid him to join, it was not a championship contender.He still makes his fair share of headlines, mind. There were more last week when he wrote a post on X, swiftly deleted, in which he described Fred Couples, who is one of the most popular men in the sport, as behaving like a “low class jerk” because he said he was sure Brooks Koepka wanted to rejoin thePGA Tour. And he’s popular with the patrons, too, there’s a little ripple of excitement wherever he goes out on the course, although by the time he was at the turn the cries of: “Go get ’em!” had given way to chirrups of: “Hang in there!” and: “Head up!” A lot of the shots he made around the greens were met with stone cold silence, which is never a good sign.View image in fullscreenPhil Mickelson on the 7th hole, with a packed crowd behind him. Many of his shots around the greens were met with stone cold silence.Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty ImagesMickelson scrambled around the opening four holes in even par but started to slip backwards when he reached the 5th, where he had to lay up out of the big fairway bunker. He dropped another shot at the 7th where, caught under the overhanging branches on the right side of the fairway, he tried an uneasy sort of draw with his wedge and ended up back in the sand again. It was the sort of shot he would have pulled off in his pomp. Then on the 9th he had to play out of the pine straw, and dropped a third. He picked a couple of strokes coming around the second nine, though, then dropped them again as he came down the stretch.Mickelson had been paired with Jason Day and, in one of those little twists the tournament committee is so fond of, Keegan Bradley. Mickelson was, everyone reckoned, a cert to be the USA’s Ryder Cup captain at Bethpage Black later this year. Then he joined LIV. When Tiger Woods decided he didn’t want the job,it fell out of the blue to Bradley, who was just as surprised as everyone else that it landed in his lap. He is only 38 and the youngest man to get the job since Arnold Palmer in 1963. He goes by the unofficial nickname of “Cap’n”, now, “Shot, Cap’n!”, “Let’s Go, Cap’n!”Bradley and Mickelson are old buds and werea brilliant Ryder Cup pairthemselves back in the day. But Bradley has already said Mickelson is unlikely to be involved this time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Out by the 6th green one corporate sort of gentleman was busy explaining that his firm had just signed Bradley up to a brand new sponsorship deal for Ryder Cup year. “Hell of a good get,” said his friend. Bradley’s biggest problem right now may be that he’s playing so well he ends up qualifying for his own team, which would put him, and them, in a pickle.He will need to putt a bit better if he’s going to do it, though. He missed three from inside 10 feet on the front nine, and by the time he made it to 18 he was on two over par, right alongside Mickelson, who duly scored another bogey to end the round on three over.

A mostly first choice team looked sharp ina 2-0 victoryover Brazil during the first match between the teams, but an extremely young, rotated squad showed their inexperiencein a 2-1 defeat on Tuesday.Head coachEmma Hayeshas some tough decisions ahead of her to figure out difficult situations in midfield and goal. But in the forward line, Hayes mostly learned that she has a new star she can rely on.Alyssa Thompson takes the next stepThe biggest bright spot was the play of left winger Alyssa Thompson, who set up the opening goal in both matches. On both occasions, Thompson picked up the ball deep in midfield and surged past a Brazil defender before carrying the ball 20-plus yards. In the first match, she played a perfect pass for Trinity Rodman. In the second, she dribbled all the way into the box and had a shot blocked, before Catarina Macario finished off the rebound.Thompson has shown she’s capable of these kinds of highlight plays in NWSL and youth national team games, but this was the first time she’s brought out her best stuff for the USWNT.Even though Thompson was the youngest member of the 2023 World Cup squad, it’s taken a few years for her international career to properly get going. She missed the 2024 Gold Cup with an injury, and was not called up for the Olympics.“She’s someone who, her international career started at a very early stage,” Hayes said after October’s 3-1 win over Iceland, when Thompson scored her first international goal. “That’s why, I believe it does take time.”Thompson was asked about missing out on the Olympic squad during anappearance on CBS Sports, and explained how she reacted.“I was disappointed, but I knew at that time I wasn’t one of the best forwards that they could have brought,” she said. “So understanding that – kind of knowing that, going back to my club and being like these are the things I need to work on in order to be on that level and on that stage – that’s what I did.”Three NWSL trades that could define the 2025 seasonRead moreThe second half of the last NWSL season went very well for Thompson, as she finished with five goals and seven assists, leading Angel City FC in total goal contributions. And she’s started hot this season as well, with two goals in three games.Thompson has always had the speed and dribbling ability to make a big impact for the USWNT, but now she has much higher levels of decision-making and confidence to go along with those skills. She’s cemented her place in Hayes’s squad going forward.Midfield still a work in progressHayes has not made significant changes in midfield personnel between international windows, seemingly finding a group of more experienced players she trusts and younger players that she wants to develop. But she’s yet to find a lineup that doesn’t have some kind of deficiency.The group from the first match looked excellent in possession. Sam Coffey and Lindsey Heaps appeared to have an excellent understanding in early buildup play and both offered excellent progressive passing from deep in midfield. Ally Sentnor played as a second striker making runs past Macario, who regularly dropped deep to combine with Coffey and Heaps. This made Macario look much more like a midfielder than Sentnor, who was the nominal No 10. This created some excellent sequences in possession, and the US could have scored quite a few more goals than they did.But similar things could be said about Brazil, who were unlucky not to get on the scoresheet. As good as Heaps and Coffey were with the ball, they looked slow and lacking in physicality without it, as Brazil threatened with counterattacks through the middle of the field.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The trio of youngsters didn’t look as if they fit their given roles very well at all. Neither Hutton or Albert is good at playing medium-range, line-breaking passes at this point in their careers, and Yohannes was an awkward fit as a No 10 playing with a striker who wanted to come deep and combine, rather than run on to Yohannes’s through balls.These players (and playmaker Jaedyn Shaw, who came off the bench) all have valuable skills, but Hayes has yet to find the right combination of players to give the team excellent contributions in all phases of play.I wrote last window that the combination of Hutton and Yohannes could excel in the future, but Hayes doesn’t look particularly close to settling on her best midfield for the present.A goalkeeper decision probably isn’t coming soonThe USWNT has had a clearly defined No 1 goalkeeper for most of its history, with Alyssa Naeher, Hope Solo and Brianna Scurry all spending long stints as the unquestioned starter. That has fans anxious to anoint the next No 1, but it’s probably not coming anytime soon.Phallon Tullis-Joyce was excellent in the first match, keeping a clean sheet. And while Hayes was pleased with her performance, she also pointed out why Tullis-Joyce is facing stiff competition from other players, and what she needs to improve to win the job.“There’s work to do to ensure that we don’t just go long all the time,” Hayes said in her post-match press conference. “Her next step is something I’ve been clear on. Her team Man United don’t play a lot of buildup. They tend to go from back to front but her next steps is with pressure, being able to make the short passes to come out. I thought she looked authoritative and commanding but I don’t want to compromise on the things that I think are really important if you want to control football matches. That’s the challenge for her and she knows that.”Game 2 starter Mandy McGlynn is much better than Tullis-Joyce with the ball at her feet, but didn’t look as commanding in the box. It might be unfair, bordering on impossible, to make an apples-to-apples comparison between the players. Tullis-Joyce played with close to Hayes’s first-choice team, while McGlynn was in a heavily rotated side with youngsters and backups. And Jane Campbell, the most experienced of the goalkeepers called into this camp, is not out of the running for the job just because she didn’t get a start in these friendlies.Of the three, Tullis-Joyce appears to be the best shot-stopper, McGlynn the best in possession, and Campbell a compromise option. Expect to see two different starters in upcoming friendlies against China, and probably a few more similar windows before Hayes declares a No 1.Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamWomen's footballUS sportsBrazil women's football teamEmma HayesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It did this by increasing the number of workers, and temporarily extending operations at the biggestFoxconnIndia factory in Chennai to Sundays.The Chennai plant produced 20m iPhones last year, including the latest iPhone 15 and 16 models.Applehas three plants in India operated by Foxconn and Tata.The Wall Street Journalreported this weekthat Apple planned to send more iPhones to the US from India as a “short-term stopgap” while the company attempted to secure an exemption from the China tariffs. If Apple diverted all India-made iPhones to the US it would account for about 50% of American demand this year, according to the Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan.Analysts have warned that moving iPhone production to the US would be prohibitively expensive because of factors such as the cost of paying hundreds of thousands of workers. Analysts at Wedbush Securities, a US financial services company, have said a US-made iPhone would cost $3,500.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

AI will be the main driver of that increase, with demand from dedicated AI datacentres alone forecast to more than quadruple.One datacentre today consumes as much electricity as 100,000 households, but some of those currently under construction will require 20 times more.EU to build AI gigafactories in €20bn push to catch up with US and ChinaRead moreBut fears that therapid adoption of AI will destroy hopes of tackling the climate crisishave been “overstated”, according tothe report, which was published on Thursday. That is because harnessing AI to make energy use and other activities more efficient could result in savings that reduce greenhouse gas emissions overall.Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “With the rise of AI, the energy sector is at the forefront of one of the most important technological revolutions of our time. AI is a tool, potentially an incredibly powerful one, but it is up to us – our societies, governments and companies – how we use it.”Using AI could make it easier to design electricity grids to take more renewable energy. Most grids were designed for centralised fossil fuel power stations that produce reliable levels of electricity, some of which can be turned off and on relatively quickly. They have to be redesigned to balance demand when more of the supply comes from intermittent and sometimes unpredictable sources, such as wind and solar power.Finding efficiencies within energy systems, and in industrial processes, could also become easier with AI. At present, huge opportunities to increase efficiency are missed, because it is harder for companies to change their processes than to carry on with wasteful practices.AI could also assist with new technologies such as driverless vehicles or detecting threats to vital infrastructure. The technology could also be used to plan public transport to optimise for people’s journeys, or to design cities or traffic systems. Mining companies could use AI to discover and exploit reserves of critical minerals, which are crucial to modern renewable energy components such as solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles.These uses could offset some of themassive demands that AI will place on the world’s energy systems. But that is likely to require greater direction from governments, the IEA report found. Left alone, the rapid growth of AI could prove a severe problem for energy systems andthe environment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rapid increase in AI also means companies will seek the most readily available energy – which could come from gas plants, which were on their way out in many developed countries. In the US, the demand could even bemet by coal-fired power stationsbeing given a new lease on life, aided byDonald Trump’s enthusiasm for them.Done badly, AI could also suck water from some of the world’s driest areas, aninvestigation by the Guardian revealed, as many AI datacentres use vast quantities of fresh water for cooling their computers.Claude Turmes, a former Green MEP and energy minister for Luxembourg, said the disadvantages of AI were more likely to materialise than the optimistic projections of the IEA, and governments needed much more help to avoid the pitfalls.He accused the IEA of painting too rosy a picture and failing to spell out harsh truths to policymakers. He said: “Instead of making practical recommendations to governments on how to regulate and thus minimise the huge negative impact of AI and new mega datacentres on the energy system, the IEA and its [chief] Fatih Birol are making a welcome gift to the new Trump administration and the tech companies which sponsored this new US government.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)EnergyComputingClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

I have placed the issue in the hands of my solicitor,” he said.Sinn Féin said in a statement on Wednesday that the titles included its former leader’s autobiography, Before the Dawn; a prison memoir, Cage Eleven; reflections on Northern Ireland’s peace process, Hope and History; and other memoirs, a cookbook and a short story collection.Adams is the latest author to join a backlash against the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.A group of authors madea US court filingin January alleging that Meta had approved the use of Library Genesis, a “shadow library” known as LibGen, that contains more than 7.5m books.The group, which includes Ta-Nehisi Coates, Jacqueline Woodson, Andrew Sean Greer, Junot Díaz and the comedian Sarah Silverman, claimed that company executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, were aware LibGen was a database believed to contain pirated material when they sanctioned its use.The Atlantic magazine republished asearchable databaseof titles contained in LibGen last month, which led to many authors identifying works Meta may have used to train its AI system, Llama.Authors including Kate Mosse and Tracy Chevalier, and other publishing industry professionals,protested outside Meta’s London headquarterslast week and sent a letter to its US headquarters.The chair of the Society of Authors, Vanessa Fox O’Loughlin, said Meta’s actions were shocking and devastating for writers. “A book can take a year or longer to write. Meta has stolen books so that their AI can reproduce creative content, potentially putting these same authors out of business.” The SoA has asked the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy,to summon Meta executives to parliament.The novelist Richard Osman said copyright law was not complicated. “If you want to use an author’s work you need to ask for permission,” he posted on X. “If you use it without permission you’re breaking the law. It’s so simple.”A Meta spokesperson said: “We respect third-party intellectual property rights and believe our use of information to train AI models is consistent with existing law.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anyone dissatisfied with Donald Trump’s decisions should be careful about voicing their opinions, the official cautioned.Over at the state department, IT staff said new monitoring software had been loaded onto computers. Some staffers had started using white noise machines in their offices, or even turned on an office breakroom sink, to muffle conversations in case there might be any hot mics within range.A supervisor at one water management organization that works closely with the Environmental Protection Agency sent a warning to staffers that their meetings and phone calls with the agency were being monitored by an artificial intelligence tool.Anecdotes like these are rife among federal employees now, amid fears that senior agency leaders or agents from Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” may be snooping on conversations, using software to track computer activity and, possibly, using artificial intelligence to scan for disloyalty or mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) buzzwords. Many fear losing their jobs, as thousands already have.“It’s like being in a horror film where you know something out there [wants] to kill you but you never know when or how or who it is,” one employee from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development said.These details arose from conversations with more than two dozen federal employees who spoke withthe Guardian and Crooked Media’s What a Day newsletter, and shared emails from agency officials and screengrabs.The employees described a culture of fear among those who remain in the federal workforce, after waves of layoffs left many of their peers unemployed or stuck in professional limbo amid confusing and unresolved legal cases.The US government has long been transparent with federal employees about its ability to monitor them with software. But now, top officials across the government are warning employees to exercise extreme caution, over fears about what this administration might do with the information, what technology might be used, who would receive the info and whether stray talk might form the basis for fresh job cuts.Trump administration representatives denied some of the assertions and concerns raised by sources for this article, but didn’t respond to all of them. The EPA denied recording meetings, but didn’t specifically address the use of artificial intelligence. The state department denied monitoring for loyalty or other “ridiculous purposes” but also said the department has been clear about employees’ “expectations of privacy” when it comes to national security. Other agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs and the education department, didn’t respond to requests for comment.The White House issued a blanket denial.“Fake reporters are willing to draft up any sensationalist, totally fake stories for clicks, instead of spending their time and effort on real reporting. None of this story is true, and another fake news reporter is once again missing the point of Doge – saving the American people billions of dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, wrote in an email.A manager at the Association of Clean Water Administrators (ACWA), which brings together state officials to work with the EPA on water quality and management, recently distributed an email warning staffers that meetings with EPA staffers may be monitored by AI.The email reads: “We recently learned that all EPA phones (landline/mobile), all Teams/Zoom virtual meetings, and calendar entries are being transcribed/monitored.”The information is then fed into “an AI tool” to be analyzed and scrutinized, the email’s author continues, adding “we saw” an AI notetaker listed as a participant in one of the meetings. “I do not know if DOGE is doing the analysis or … the agency itself,” the author writes. Participants aren’t being notified that the call is being transcribed, the email states.The EPA denied that it is recording meetings. It also didn’t specifically address the question of an AI tool.“This is fake news,” an EPA spokesperson said in a statement. “EPA is not monitoring or transcribing phone calls, meetings, or calendar entries.”But Trump political appointees have told EPA managers that Musk’s team is implementing AI to monitor workers and look for disparaging comments about Trump or Musk,according to a Reuters report.During a meeting on Wednesday morning, EPA managers told employees that Doge is “using AI to scan through agency communications to find any anti-Musk, anti-Doge, or anti-Trump statements”, an employee told theGuardianand What a Day. Employees should be “very careful” about what they say in private messages and virtual meetings, the managers added.“I honestly just think the Doge spying is kind of pathetic,” the employee said. “If they’re that confident about what they’re doing, they wouldn’t be so paranoid.”According to another email shared with the Guardian andWhat a Day, a Department of Veterans Affairs official also warned employees that virtual meetings were being secretly recorded.The VA didn’t respond to a request for comment.Top veterans affairs researchers across the country were recently put on administrative leave, according to anemail obtained by What a Day.One of them was put on administrative leave for the “inappropriate distribution of VA material”, according to the internal email. But it’s not clear whether the individual was accused of speaking to the press or committing some other infraction.A representative for Doge did not respond to a request for comment.At the now-shuttered US Agency for International Development (USAID), employees said they discovered that their private communications were being monitored by leadership who arrived after Trump’s inauguration, prompting staff to abandon official channels altogether.“They went into our chats, like our private group chats,” said a former USAID employee who lost their position during the mass firing wave in February. “It was [the acting administrator] Jason Gray, not Doge directly. But he was put in place when they fired everybody” because he knew the systems well.The intrusions became so blatant that Gray – who was also the agency’s chief information officer – suddenly appeared in one group chat with more than 40 contractors.“We knew they were watching,” the former USAID employee, who was in the chat, said. “Everybody went on either Signal or WhatsApp because nobody was trusting [leadership] at that point.”Gray’s turbulent tenure culminated in USAID’s websitebeing taken offline.In February, IT staff at the state department warned some employees that monitoring software was being uploaded onto computers, according to an employee, who provided images showing a record of their individual keystrokes being tracked in the software.Others worry that Doge could begin combing through conversations for anti-Trump sentiments or diversity, equity and inclusion “buzzwords”, which could then be used as grounds to fire employees.Supervisors began sharing unofficial guidance to “act as though we are always on a hot mic”, the state department employee said.“We’re turning on sinks and shit to have conversations,” they added. “It’s really funny to think about the Dogebags sitting there, watching and learning in real time, that the ‘deep state’ is really a bunch of goobers just doing our boring jobs for middling pay.”A state department spokesperson said in a statement: “The state department is not monitoring its employees for loyalty or for other ridiculous purposes. The department has always been transparent with its employees on expectations of privacy in department facilities and on department networks and devices. Our focus in this regard is and always has been on preserving and protecting the national security of the United States.”Government employees should expect that they’re being watched, top officials in the Department of Veterans Affairs said at an employee town hall in New England. “There shouldn’t be any expectation of privacy,” an official told employees, according to a list of questions and answers at the town hallprovided to What a Day.At the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in February, managers warned some employees to be extra careful about what they say on calls, according to an employee. “I personally think they are watching us,” they said.Some workers at the education department are fearful of speaking out, describing the atmosphere as “total paranoia”. Doge has infiltrated the education department, where half of the staffhas already been firedas Trump seeks to dismantle the entire agency.“They are just so omnipresent and the work environment is so toxic and hostile, it feels like anything is possible,” a former senior education department official said about the potential for surveillance.This story is published in collaboration with Crooked Media"

But some did report a few children would sneak into the toilets to watch videos on phones at break.Now the government says it is necessary to go further, fully separating children from their devices for the entire school day.This enforced “digital pause” – as the French government calls it – has been tested in a pilot scheme in about 100 middle schools for the past six months, with children giving up their phones on arrival – placing them a locker or box, or in a special locked pouch that can only be unlocked by an electronic system at the school gates as they go home.Devices are banned in primary schools.Borne told the senate: “All the feedback from the trial is positive, namely on improving the atmosphere in schools, and there has been massive support from parents and teachers.”After some unions questioned the cost and logistics of organising the scheme, Borne said it would be up to headteachers to choose a format – for example lockers or pouches – adding that it would cost no more than a few thousand euros.Borne, who quoted a study last month by the French National Book Council, said: “A young person now spends on average five hours a day in front of a screen, but they only spend three hours a week with a book … Not only is reading going down, but for those who do read, half of them are doing something else on their phone at the same time. All that is damaging to students’ success.”Areport by scientists and expertscommissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, last year concluded that children should not be allowed to use smartphones until they were 13 and should be banned from accessing conventional social media such as TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat until they were 18.No child should have a phone before age 11, the report said, and they should only have a handset without access to the internet before 13.More than 90% of schools in England ban mobile phone use, survey showsRead moreMacron has said he favoured taking steps to limit children’s exposure to screens.The moves comeas the leader of England’s largest teaching union calls for a statutory ban on phones in schools. A survey of more than 15,000 schools found that 99.8% of primary schools and 90% of secondary schools in England had some form of ban.Explore more on these topicsFranceSmartphonesMobile phonesEuropeChildrenChildren's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Apple’s much-loved MacBook Air gets even more power, a much better webcam and an unexpected price cut for 2025, making one of the very best consumer laptops even more tempting.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The company’s thinnest and lightest laptop currently starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,699) – £100 less than last year’s model – and has Apple’s top M4 chip with a minimum of 16GB of memory, making the cheapest model much more capable.Nothing has changedsince 2022 on the outsideother than a fetching new light blue colour that replaces the longstanding “space grey”. The aluminium body is just as well made, thin and light. The keyboard is excellent, the Touch ID fingerprint reader in the power button is fast and the generous trackpad is best in class.The 13.6in LCD screen is crisp and good, although limited to 60Hz, unlike the faster and smoother screen on the MacBook Pro line and some rivals. New for this year is an upgraded webcam, which is now 12 megapixels and sports Apple’s Centre Stage tech for automatic panning and scanning, plus support forDesk Viewfor demonstrating things remotely, similar to theM4 MacBook Pro.View image in fullscreenThe Centre Stage camera at the top of the screen is a significant upgrade for those who spend time on video calls.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianTwo meaningful changes have been made on the inside. The new M4 chip makes the Air essentially as fast as the MacBook Pro, which is to say very fast and snappy indeed. In tests it is only marginally slower than the Pro despite not having a fan to keep it cool for prolonged periods, and faster than theiPad Pro with M4 chip. There is little the Air will not be able to manage outside workstation-class workloads. Note the cheapest model has two fewer graphics cores on its chip, which will make it slightly less powerful for certain apps and games.All Airs now also come with at least 16GB of memory, which is the recommended minimum amount for modern laptops. Theprevious modelstarted with only 8GB of memory, which cost £200 to double.Along with powerful chips, the Air’s main selling point – very long battery life – remains. For general light workloads using browsers, notes apps, word processing, image editing, chats and emails, the Air regularly lasts more than 16 hours between charges, which is roughly two full work days on battery. Pushed a bit harder, such as developing and editing photos, the Air still managed more than 10 hours’ work on battery.View image in fullscreenA full charge using a 70W or greater power adaptor and the included MagSafe cable took about 105 minutes, hitting 50% in 28 minutes.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:13.6in LCD (2560x1600; 224 ppi) True ToneProcessor:Apple M4 with eight or 10-core GPURAM:16, 24 or 32GBStorage:256GB, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB SSDOperating system:macOS 15 SequoiaCamera:12MP Centre StageConnectivity:wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, 2x Thunderbolt/USB 4, headphonesDimensions:215 x 304.1 x 11.3mmWeight:1.24kgSustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe recycled aluminium lid of the MacBook Air in sky blue looks grey in some lights and blue in others.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe MacBook Air is made with 55% recycled materials including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare-earth elements, steel and tin. Apple breaks down the computer’s environmental impact inits report.The computer isgenerally repairable, and the battery can be replaced for £159 by Apple. The repair specialists iFixit gave the machinefive out of 10 for repairability. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.macOS Sequoia 15.4View image in fullscreenMacOS continues to be one of the best operating systems for laptops available, with plenty of customisation options and very useful new window tiling tools.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Air runs the same macOS Sequoia software as the rest of the Mac lineup, recently updated to version 15.4, which brings with it a few more Apple Intelligence features.The Mac Mail app has been redesigned to more closely resemble the app on an iPhone with AI email categorisation, such as promotional emails, receipts and others. AI notification summaries are useful, as isiPhone mirroringif you also use an Apple smartphone. The new snapping and window tiling tools are very handy, allowing you to quickly arrange your windows with either mouseor keyboard shortcuts, something that previously required third-party tools.PriceThe Apple 13in MacBook Air starts at£999(€1,199/$999/A$1,699) with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. 15in versions start at£1,199(€1,499/$1,199/A$2,099).For comparison, theM4 MacBook Prostarts at£1,599, theSamsung Galaxy Book 4 Edgecosts£1,399and the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 starts at£1,049.VerdictThe MacBook Air is the consumer laptop to beat unless you specifically need Windows. It simply offers a better combination of performance, battery life, speakers, keyboard and trackpad than rivals.The M4 chip upgrade keeps it ahead of the pack while being fanless and therefore silent at all times. The new Centre Stage webcam is a huge improvement, too, for anyone who lives on video calls for work. The screen is still great, although this is one area where better displays can be found on competitors at higher cost. It only has two USB-C ports but at least it can be charged via the MagSafe port to keep them available for connections.A price cut to about £1,000 or equivalent for the 13in model is very welcome, as is the minimum of 16GB of memory, which makes the 2025 MacBook Air surprisingly good value for a premium notebook.Pros:super-fast M4 chip, silent and cool running, extremely long battery life, good 13.6in screen, great keyboard, best-in-class trackpad, MagSafe, good speakers, Centre Stage webcam, Touch ID.Cons:only two USB-C ports and no USB-A or SD card slot, no Face ID, RAM and SSD upgrades are expensive and cannot be changed after purchase, no wifi 7.View image in fullscreenThe Touch ID power button still works great for logging into the laptop, storing up to three fingerprints.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsAppleLaptopsComputingreviewsShareReuse this content"

This has been found by both Amnesty International in ourAutomated Racismreport and byStatewatch in its findingson the “murder prediction” tool.For many years, successive governments have invested in data-driven and data-based systems, stating they will increase public safety – yet individual police forces and Home Office evaluations have found no compelling evidence that these systems have had any impact on reducing crime.Feedback loops are created by training these systems using historically discriminatory data, which leads to the same areas being targeted once again. These systems are neither revelatory nor objective. They merely subject already marginalised communities to compounded discrimination. They aren’t predictive at all, they are predictable – and dangerous.Ilyas NagdeeAmnesty International UKThe 2002 movie Minority Report was about a police unit that arrested people before they could commit crimes. Science fiction may be coming true. The unit’s head, played by Tom Cruise, was accused of “future murder” and had to go on the run.

These pocket-sized cuboids plug into compatible devices and charge them, often via assorted connections, including USB-C and USB-A. Most power banks are made for charging smartphones and smaller gadgets, such as fitness trackers and earbuds, but some models can also charge power-hungrier laptops and large portable speakers.More capable still (and pocketable only in the realms of fairytale), portable power stations can charge various high-voltage appliances – perfect for camping, garden parties and power cuts.To find you the best power bank for your electrical exigencies, I put 10 top models through their paces, including options from Belkin, Anker, Cuktech, Bluetti, Acer, EcoFlow and Juice.Bear in mind that any particular power bank will only be suitable for charging compatible devices, based on its power output and connectivity. Before you buy one, check the specs against your smartphone or other devices.At a glanceBest power bank overall:Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-port 20k£79.99 at ArgosBestpower bank for portability:Anker Nano£29.99 at AnkerBest budget power bank:Belkin BoostCharge 10k with integrated cable£24.99 at BelkinBest power bank forspeed and power:Cuktech 15 Ultra£89.99 at AmazonBesthigh-storage power bank:Anker 165W£89.99 at AnkerWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing tech products since the mid-2010s. When I’m not actually trying out gadgets, I’m often writing about them using my laptop, or discussing them with editors and PR contacts on my smartphone. As a result, I spend a lot of my time using portable, battery-powered electronic devices.You might say I’m just the sort of person who needs a good power bank. I used all of the models featured in this article – even the powerhat– while working on the go at libraries, cafes and on public transport. Not once did my laptop or smartphone run out of battery!How I testedView image in fullscreenI timed how long each power bank took to charge my devices by 30%.Photograph: Pete WiseI tested these power banks by using them to charge various devices with different requirements, including:Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (battery: 6,600mAh)Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (battery: 5,270mAh)Acer Aspire Vero 16 laptop (65W ​three-cell li-ion battery)I timed how long it took for each power bank to charge these devices by 30%. I only charged the laptop with suitably powerful power banks.Thanks to Honor and Acer for loaning us the smartphones and laptop for testing. The huge batteries on these devices meant there was a lot of waiting around between test charges. These days, flagship smartphones have a battery capacity of about 3,000-5,000mAh. If you have an older or less flashy model, you may find its battery has a capacity as low as 2,500mAh.Some of the power banks had additional features, such as digital displays, integrated cables and control buttons. I tested these extras where present and also considered the portability and aesthetics of each model.Some brands didn’t want their power banks back after testing. Those models will be donated for fundraising toCat Action Trust 1977, a small national charity dedicated to the welfare of feral cats.The best power banks and portable chargers in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Charging didn’t slow down much when I plugged in two devices at once’: the Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-port 20k.Best power bank overall:Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-port 20kView image in fullscreen£79.99 at Argos£79.99 at BelkinIf you need a highly capable power bank that can recharge your laptop as well as your smartphone, this model would be a fine choice. Across three charging ports (one USB-A and two USB-C), there’s a combined power output of up to 65W – more than sufficient to charge two smartphones at once.Why we love itDuring my testing, the BoostCharge Pro topped up an Acer laptop at the sort of speeds I’d normally expect from a mains-powered charger. And it was no slouch when it came to charging smartphones. I was impressed to note that charging didn’t slow down much when I plugged in two devices at once.The power bank is a stout, minimalistic device that will make a subtle addition to your tabletop. Considering that it can store up to 20,000mAh of charge, it’s impressively lightweight – a suitable choice for a purse or bumbag.The bank’s digital display activates at the press of a button to give you a read on its storage level and outputs. The metrics are slightly less detailed than what you’d see with certain competing laptop power banks, but the information is presented clearly and includes a useful timer that indicates how soon the power bank will run out of power.It’s a shame that …the on-screen metrics are slightly less detailed than what you’d see with certain competing laptop power banks.

For me, no other power bank strikes the same balance between impressive charging speed and portability. It’s the perfect fallback for the person whose phone never quite manages to stay powered through the day.Why we love itThe Nano is minimalistic, but the features it offers are well realised. I’m a big fan of its fold-out USB-C connector, which you can use to plug the power bank directly into your phone. Not only is this a neat charging solution but also it rules out the risk of charging being impaired by a faulty or below-spec cable (each one has a maximum current and voltage). That said, if you’re attached (pun intended) to your cable, there’s also a regular USB-C port on the side of the power bank.There are a few limitations that come with using a teeny-tiny power bank like the Nano. Its 5,000mAh storage capacity is sufficient for giving most smartphones a good top-up, but it might not be enough to fully charge the device.It’s a shame that …you’d need something more powerful to charge your laptop.Weight:102gConnections:foldable USB-C connector; USB-C portOutput wattage:up to 22.5WCapacity:5,000mAh (1.29 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25)Time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):24minsTime to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):23mins 15secsBest budget power bank:Belkin BoostCharge 10k with integrated cableView image in fullscreen£24.99 at Belkin£24.99 at AmazonIt’s hard to believe this is acheapoption.

Thanks to the integrated USB-C connector, you don’t even need to remember a cable.It’s a shame that …charging two devices at once reduces the maximum total output from 20W to 15W, so single-device charging is considerably quicker.Weight:218gConnections:integrated USB-C cable; USB-C portOutput wattage:up to 20WCapacity:10,000mAh (2.57 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25)Time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):42mins 45secsTime to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):36mins 45secsBest power bank for speed and power:Cuktech 15 UltraView image in fullscreen£89.99 AmazonThis power bank was difficult to test – it charged devices so exceptionally quickly that I struggled to get to my stopwatch in time.Why we love itThe Cuketch 15 Ultra is light years ahead of the competition in terms of charging speeds, and with three ports (two USB-C, one USB-A) delivering up to 210W, there’s incredible potential to charge multiple high-energy devices. Its 20,000mAh capacity is enough to charge the average smartphone at least thrice – or give your laptop battery a significant top-up.With great power comes somewhat lower portability. This is undeniably a weighty power bank – the heaviest of its calibre that I tested. For users who prefer to pack light, that may be a deal-breaker. Still, the 15 Ultra is a well-made, smart-looking device. The TFT display gives you lots of detail on the power bank’s battery level and charging status, and you can use it with the control button to configure each port to act as a power input, output or both. You get nice accessories, too: a 3.2ft charging cable, plus a soft carry case to keep the power bank safe.It’s a shame that …the characters on the TFT display are small, which won’t be ideal for users with impaired vision.Weight:595gConnections:USB-C (x 2); USB-AOutput wattage:up to 210WCapacity:20,000mAh (5.15 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25)Time to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):10mins 30secsTime to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):15minsTime to charge Acer Aspire Vero 16 laptop (30%):26mins 15secsBesthigh-storage power bank:Anker 165WView image in fullscreen£89.99 at Anker£89.99 at AmazonA power bank for true tech lovers, the Anker 165W is capable of keeping your smartphone, laptop and other gadgets going through the day, thanks in no small part to its incredible 25,000mAh storage capacity. It’s a pleasing piece of tech in itself, with a nicely styled integrated display that tells you how much power is being drawn from each of its ports, and how much charge is still in the bank.Why we love itThis model has superb connectivity, with three USB-C inputs/outputs (two of them are connectors, one is a port) and another outlet for USB-A charging. With a 165W total output to play with, you can charge several devices rapidly at the same time.In terms of features, it goes above and beyond. Pressing the power button twice initiates trickle charging, which keeps a charged device at a stable battery level. The digital display indicates the power bank’s temperature and condition, as well as its charge level.It’s a shame that …this bulky model may be too cumbersome for some. However, a bit of heft is to be expected in a 25,000mAh power bank.

Two USB-C outputs and a USB-A output cater for your lower-powered devices, and there are DC and AC power outlets, too; the latter accepting a regular three-pronged UK power plug. With a total maximum power output of 700W (rising to 1,000W when using the AC50B’s power lifting mode, which is useful, briefly, for power-intensive applications, such as boiling a kettle) and a 448Wh storage capacity, there’s plenty of provision to power garden parties, camping trips or even renovation work in an off-grid home.I was thoroughly impressed with the AC50B during testing. It charges devices rapidly; the interface is simple with just three buttons to master; and the “cut-out” moulded handle makes it easy to carry the 6.7kg power station to its destination.It didn’t make the final cut because …most buyers won’t need something so powerful or feature-rich.Weight:6.7kg;connections:700W AC outlet, USB-C port (x 2), USB-A port, 120W “cigarette lighter” port;output wattage:up to 1,000W (lifting) or 700W (continuous);capacity:448Wh (equivalent to 89,600mAh when charging one device at 5V; 23.07 charges of a Samsung Galaxy S25;time to charge Honor Magic7 Lite smartphone (30%):24mins 45secs;time to charge Honor Magic7 Pro smartphone (30%):24mins;time to charge Acer Aspire Vero 16 laptop (30%):30minsAcer 600W portable power stationView image in fullscreen£499.99 at B&Q£499.99 at Mountain WarehouseBest for:powering devices in the gardenSimple, user-friendly and equipped with enough storage and connectivity to run or recharge numerous energy-intensive devices, the Acer 600W is a great pick to power your picnics and camping trips. Relative to other products of its type, this model is reasonably light, and the fold-down carry handle distributes its weight nicely.The integrated strip LED at the top of the front panel is a nice touch – perfect for outdoor entertaining after dark, or for visibility during a power cut (the sort of moment where you’ll appreciate having a power station charged up).

Thewattagetells you the power bank’s power output.Laptops, smartphones and other gadgets all require a certain wattage, so you need to get a power bank with a port that’s powerful enough to charge the device. The same goes forvoltage. If a power bank has multiple ports for charging devices simultaneously, then maximum power outputs will be given for the ports, individually and in total. High-wattage power banks are usually heavier, bulkier and more expensive than lower-powered models, as they require more storage and cooling capability.A power bank’sinputs and outputsare also crucial. Most power banks feature ports that connect to devices (or to a mains outlet to receive charge) via USB-C or USB-A. Some models can also charge compatible devices – especially smartphones – wirelessly. And for Apple device users, certain power banks feature a Lightning cable and port.Capacity(mAh) tells you how much electrical charge the power bank can hold in its onboard lithium-ion battery. If a smartphone has a 6,000mAh battery and your power bank holds 20,000mAh, then you should be able to charge the phone fully at least three times without running out of power.How long should a power bank last?As with all devices that rely on a lithium-ion battery, power banks gradually become less effective until they can no longer be used. When a battery is fully charged and then fully discharged, this is called acycle. The number of charging cycles a power bank can supply varies greatly between models, but you’ll get somewhere in the range of 300 to 1,000 in most cases. Depending on how much you use your power bank, that could keep you charged up for a year, or perhaps several years. It’s instructive that power bank warranties typically top out at about two years.Good usage habits can preserve the condition of your power bank’s lithium-ion battery, therefore extending the lifespan of the power bank itself. Very-low or very-high charge levels put the most stress on these batteries, so try to keep your power bank moderately charged most of the time. It’s also best to avoid storing your power bank in very hot, cold or humid places.Pete Wise is a freelance journalist with more than a decade’s experience covering everything from global development and social causes to technology and music. He has written extensively on portable tech, including laptops, smart speakers and drones – one of which he misplaced in the skies over a West Yorkshire village.

Episodes most often channel our collective anxieties about the future – or foment new ones through masterly writing, directing, casting and acting. It is a must-watch, but must we take it so seriously?Black Mirror fails to consistently explore the duality of technology and our reactions to it. It is a critical deficit. The show mimics the folly of Icarus and Daedalus – the original tech bros – and the hubris of Jurassic Park’s Dr Hammond. Missing are the lessons of the Prometheus myth, which shows fire as a boon for humanity, not doom, though its democratization angered benevolent gods. Absent is the plot twist of Pandora’s box that made it philosophically useful: the box also contained hope and opportunity that new knowledge brings. While Black Mirror explores how humans react to technology, it too often does so in service of a dystopian narrative, ignoring Isaac Asimov’sobservation: that humans are prone to irrationally fear or resist technology.Black Mirror is more pessimism porn than Plato’s parable, imparting to its audience a tacit lesson: fear the future more than the past. Fear too much technological change, not too little. It is an inherently populist narrative, one that appeals to nostalgia: intellectually, we understand the present is better than the past in large part due to scientific and technological change, yet emotionally and instinctually we can’t help but feel this time in history is different, that the future can only get worse.The heavy consequences of technological fearmongeringThis kind of reductive dystopianism – a hallmark of post-1960s science fiction – clouds our thinking about the future because it “cannot imagine a better future, and it doesn’t ask anyone to bother to make one”, as New Yorker writer Jill Leporenotedin 2017.We run from the speculative risks of the future, towards the proven dangers of the past, a dynamic I call theFrankenstein fallacy. This pessimistic archetype has bipartisan allure because “it requires so little by way of literary, political, or moral imagination”,accordingto Lepore; consequently, it is politically useful but unconstructive – as populism tends to be.Technological pessimism will not insure against a more dystopian tomorrow. Fear of genetically modified organisms – which kicked off around thereleaseof Jurassic Park – has seen countries run from GMOfood aidtoward famine, from vitamin-enriched GMO “golden rice” towards malnutrition leading tomillions of avoidable deaths. Countries such as the United States andGermanyran from a future of nuclear energy,towards coaland oil. In the Philippines, a nuclear plant built in the 1970s sits unused –never turned on– while its population deals with sky-high energy prices. All three countries are now trying toreverse course, realizing that the certainty of stasis and stagnation is its own form of dystopia. In contrast, France ran from the past towards the future, overcoming public fears of nuclear disasters, now getting70%of its electricity from nuclear power.Countries such as India, Brazil, Mexico and Thailand have run from vapes –outlawingthem, while permitting traditional tobacco cigarettes for 1.8 billion of their citizens. Better unsafe than sorry.In the US, Robert F Kennedy Jr runs from vaccines towards natural herd immunity – although he might be having secondthoughtsnow that the risks have become less abstract. Bipartisan efforts have sought toremove online anonymityto protect children, forgetting that as adults they’ll lose the protection that anonymity brings in the context of free speech. Attacks on environmentally friendly lab-grown beef from Republicans have drawn support by Democrats such asJohn Fetterman.In the UK, encryption isunder siege, a modern-day Promethean protection that angers the powerful, in the name of keeping society from runaway technology.

The risk of inaction and stasis was too real to ignore, and the absence of technology became the threat. Tellingly, it was in this period – between 2020 and 2022 – that Black Mirror went on hiatus. Charlie Brookersaidthis was because people didn’t want to consume dystopian fiction when everything felt so bleak. In a moment when screens kept us connected, protected and employed, the reductiveness of dystopian science fiction felt silly. Biotechnology like GMOs and mRNA offered existential hope, rather than risk.Suddenly, it became deeply uncool and unintellectual to fear technology – as 5G masts burned and Black Mirror-esque conspiracy theories of computer chips being injected through vaccines spread, dystopian fiction lost its allure, though its vestiges still lurked: Chipotle offered free burritos to the vaccinated, burritos it proudly markets as GMO-free. King Charles, who oncewarnedthat genetically modified organisms would cause the biggest environmental disaster of all time, wouldcongratulateOxford researchers for their GMO-based Covid vaccine. Publications like Scientific American would deplore pandemic conspiracy theories, when less than a year earlier it wouldamplifyunfounded alarmism about 5G.New parablesA new progressivism, one that embraces construction over obstruction, of pragmatism over precaution, must find new allegories to think about technology and the future – stories that challenge a mindset the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, criticized for leading us to miss massive opportunities“because of the fears of small risk”.We must move away from binary tales of catastrophe, not towards naive utopianism that ignores problems and risks that comes with change, but hopeful solutionism that reminds us we can solve and mitigate them – stories that don’t make us forget that brain chips can liberate paraplegics, robot dogs canprotect usfrom landmines, AI canpreventsuper bugs and VR canconnect usrather than cut us off from reality – even if their vibes are “a bit Black Mirror”.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyBlack MirrorTelevisionNetflixNuclear powerArtificial intelligence (AI)Cell-cultivated meatcommentShareReuse this content"

The threat to the global economy remains real.Thu 10 Apr 2025 14.08 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 19.39 EDTShareIt was Donald Trump who blinked first. Never forget that.Chinais unlikely to overlook its importance. A week after launching an all-out global trade war, the US president paused significant parts of it for 90 days. Having insisted that he would stick with therandom tariffshe imposed on most trading nations, Mr Trump suddenly decreed that he would reduce most of them to 10%. It was a major humiliation.Yet 10% is still a significant tariff to bear for nations exporting to the US. This is alsoonly a pauseuntil July, not a withdrawal, so the uncertainty remains. And huge tariffs still remain on China (now hiked to 145%), Canada and Mexico (both25%), as well as on all US imports of steel, aluminium and cars (also 25%). Mr Trump is now substituting a US-world conflict with a US-China one. The two largest economies in the world – which between them have generated around half of global economic growth in the 21st century – are, in effect, no longer doing business with each other.Even so, this was a necessary step back from the cliff edge. It wasenoughto trigger a temporary bounceback on stock markets around the globe, though prices slipped back on Thursday and remain much lower than at the start of April. In the week since Mr Trump’s absurd “liberation day”, more than $6tn dollars of value was wiped from stocks on the S&P 500 index. It is a shameful outcome.Mr Trump claims he made the move because more than 75 nations had been willing to negotiate or “kiss my ass”. This is nonsense. He has got nothing out of the tariff war. He has not won. No one has negotiated. Mr Trump is making his usual efforts to claim yet another triumph. The plain truth is that he backed down because he was forced to.That Mr Trump can retreat is good news, as far as it goes. Overall, however, the past week has been an indictment of the president, his policies, his instincts and his behaviour. The pause should on no account be seen as proof that rational business can be done with him. For one thing, this week’s mayhem may easily kick off again as July nears. The White House has merely given itself more time to make some very big calls.Two things appear pivotal inthe decisionannounced on Wednesday. The first was the overheating of the US bond market, subverting the established assumption that dollar bonds will always be a safe asset, and drawing the Federal Reserve to the threshold of intervention. Asimilar crisisdoomed Liz Truss’s economic strategy in the UK in 2022, but the destructive potential of a US bond crisis is far greater. Mr Trump’s tariffs were threatening all-out recession.The second factor was some limited elite domestic pushback. Anxious senators appeared on Fox News (which the president watches) and pressed the case for dialling down. The head of JPMorgan Chase warned about recession. So did a handful of world leaders and some Trump cabinet members in telephone calls.These realities were a brake on Mr Trump this time. It is possible the trauma has left its mark and there will now be no repeat. But there isno case for confidence, let alone for accepting that this outcome had been schemed all along. Even Mr Trump admitted that Americans were “getting yippy”. They had every right to be. So did the markets, along with the rest of the world. Trust disappeared long ago, replaced now by uncertainty. There is no way that this is over.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

IfMahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk, Yunseo Chung, Badar Khan Suri and other recent Ice detainees are considered threats to national security, then so am I.I have committed the same acts they have committed, including publishingan articlethat calls the war inGazaa genocide, participating in aprotestagainst the genocide in Gaza, speaking and protestingin favor of BDS(boycott, divestment, sanctions against Israel), participating in asit-inat UC Davis about 10 years ago, and being vocal in general about the atrocities committed by Israel against the people of Gaza and Palestinians.The US government is effectively kidnapping people for opposing genocide | Moira DoneganRead moreLet me tell you a little more about myself and all the additional reasons you might want to investigate and perhaps arrest me. I was born inIsraeland became a naturalized US citizen through my American mother. Given the administration’s recent challenges to the 14th amendment, which provides birthright citizenship, you might proceed from detaining legal residents to revoking the rights of naturalized citizens. Like other fascist regimes before you, you’ve been testing how much resistance you face in your effort to turn the United States into a fascist country. You start with the most marginalized, sending incarcerated trans women to men’s prisons, Venezuelans accused of gang affiliation to El Salvador, and detaining Arab and Muslim legal residents. But if the past is any indication, your next target might well be children of undocumented immigrants or naturalized citizens. Of course, as every student of fascism well knows, the ultimate goal is to apprehend all the supposed enemies of this administration, regardless of their legal status.Furthermore, I must confess to using academic concepts that have come under scrutiny as antisemitic by the Department of Justice taskforce for antisemitism. As a former member of the Israel Defense Forces, I have come a long way. It took me many years of soul-searching to realize that I was complicit in a settler-colonial occupation force and that my best recourse to make amends for that was to be outspoken about my country’s atrocities. As I tried to better understand the terrible tragedy of Zionism – a nationalist ideology that sought to free Jews from oppression only to end up as oppressors in Palestine – I confess to describing concepts such as apartheid, settler colonialism, ethno-nationalism and more. Perhaps even more disturbing from your perspective, I recently employed such concepts as genocide, settler colonialism and ethnic cleansing in abook I wroteabout early American history.The similarities between the actions of this administration and what my grandparents have lived through are unmistakableI also confess that in the past I have targeted white supremacist allies of this administration in my community of Chico, California. Clearly employing extralegal militias is part of this administration’s fascist playbook, as Trump already proved during the events of 6 January 2021. For instance, when my house was a target of antisemitic leafleting, I sought the help of a colleague and a local investigative journalist to make this very real form of antisemitism known to authorities. In the processthe journalist uncoveredtroubling information that there is an armed white supremacist in our community who holds deep antisemitic convictions and now knows where I work. Had you really been interested in investigating antisemitism, you might have looked into the whereabouts of that individual. But since you want people like him around so that they can be activated when needed, and since all you really want is to cynically weaponize antisemitism, you might want to arrest me instead. After all, according to your standards, I – a Jew targeted by white supremacists – was all along the biggest threat to Jews in my own community.I have long heard stories about the rise of fascism in Europe from my grandparents, all of whom fled Europe and were refugees from antisemitism. The similarities between the actions of this administration and what my grandparents have lived through are unmistakable. I tell them here so that before you choose to arrest me, you will have one more opportunity to decide whether you will go down in history as aiding and abetting the rise of a fascist regime or as someone who refused to be part of another dark episode in this country’s history. Be forewarned: even if you yourself never directly suffer for your crimes, history will judge you.My dear grandfather, Otto, may his memory be a blessing, escaped Austria by the skin of his teeth when he was only 13 after the Nazi takeover of the country. Having witnessed the horrors of Kristallnacht in November of 1938 – the night when local mobs violently rioted against Jewish homes, synagogues and businesses across much of Germany and Austria and arrested 30,000 citizens just for being Jewish – his parents made the decision to flee to Shanghai, the only port that would accept them. Clearly, our current president’s rhetoric regarding enemies of the American nation from within and without, against immigrants, trans people and people deemed un-American in their political commitments (like myself), are eerily reminiscent of the stories my grandfather told me about the scapegoating of Jews.As I consider the memory of dear grandmother Rachel, may her memory be a blessing, who grew up in Poland and survived theHolocaust, including enduring a harrowing year in Auschwitz and the death march to Germany, I cannot shake the sense of another parallel. As Hitler and the Nazi party were consolidating power, they appointed sycophants like yourself and so many others to positions of power in the Nazi administration. The most important criterion for Hitler was not that the people in positions of power were competent or even knowledgeable, but that they would be spineless and loyal to him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Knowing Hitler’s hatred for Jews, they constantly tried to curry favor by suggesting the most radical and far-reaching policy ideas towards Jews. This dynamic, which Kershaw called“working toward the Führer”, ultimately led Hitler and the people surrounding him to decide on the “Final Solution”, the plan to exterminate all the Jews in the world on an industrial scale in death camps. This idea of working toward the leader is upon us today, as we see institutions and even some in the Democratic party bowing before the great leader and his will. Instead of standing up to the administration at every turn, institutions, businesses and politicians across the country prefer to anticipate the administration’s wrath and eliminate any behavior or materials that might come under scrutiny. Meanwhile, Republicans rush to outdo each other in flattering the great leader, as American society seems frozen with fear in face of the rising tides of fascism.So, Kash Patel, do you want to arrest me and help bring about fascism?Eran Zelnik grew up in Israel and came to the US 15 years ago to complete his PhD in history.

Even after hopefulelection resultslast week,Democratsare shut out of power in Washington, bewildered over the 2024 election, and staggered by Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s blitz to rapidly assert power over themedia,universitiesand thecourts, while dismantling hugeswathsofthefederalgovernment.Exiled to the political wilderness, Democrats haveblamedtheirmessagingandmessengers. They have sought different ways to talk abouttrans rights,abortion,immigrationand populist economics. They have sought their own network of social mediainfluencersand podcasters so that they can talk to young or occasional voters.None of this will make the difference. Democrats could spend as much time as they like fine-tuning the perfect pitch on trans women and high school sports. They could develop an army of faux-Joe Rogan podcasts for future candidates to make their case. They could evenwin the occasional upset special election. And they will still remain powerless.After months of surrender, the Democrats have finally stood up to Trump – thank you, Cory Booker | Emma BrockesRead moreThat’s because whileDemocratsmight have a messaging and messenger problem, they have a much larger issue: math. And it’s a cruel math, where just coming close to a majority doesn’t count.A captured supreme court, gerrymandered legislatures, a radically malapportioned Senate, and the electoral college mean that the basic math that paves any road toward 270 electoral votes, 218 members of the House, 51 senators and five members of the supreme court is tilted dramatically against Democrats. All of it is likely to get much worse before it gets any better. Before the midterms, Republicans seem determined to pass newvoting restrictionsthat will place new barriers before tens of millions, make registration and voting itself decidedly more difficult, and call into question the very possibility of free and fair elections. Until Democrats fully recognize that the structural barriers before them could doom them to opposition status even if they reassemble a majority coalition, they are not grappling with the cold reality of this moment. Politics and public opinion could move in their direction. The structural math might only get worse.The House mapStart with the US House, the heart of the party’s midterm dreams. Republicans hold seven seats more than Democrats, andhistory suggeststhat the opposition party often gains that many seats in a midterm off anti-incumbent frustration alone. Listening to Democrats, you get the sense that they feel it’s almost agiventhey will take back the House. The conventionalwisdomsuggests the national House map is balanced. Neither is the case.Betterbalanced, perhaps, from the last decade, but Republicans still benefit from agerrymanderedadvantage of 16 seats, according to the non-partisan Brennan Center.Structural reforms represent everyone’s only hope to create a level playing field, meaningful elections and an accountable democracy for allGetting close to a majority, as Democrats did in the current House, is one thing. Getting over the top is harder than it looks. On a map that is nearly maximallygerrymanderedto eliminate competitive seats – only37 of 435 raceswere within five points in 2024 – flippable seats are rare and difficult to target. Democratswon, and must defend, 22 of those – which leaves just 15 competitive seats to provide the necessary yield. Onlyfourof those districts are in states carried by Kamala Harris in 2024.Beyond that, one might start by identifying vulnerable GOP members from districts that also backed Harris. There are onlythreeof those: Nebraska’s second, New York’s 17th and Pennsylvania’s first. These have been Democratic targets for some time. The incumbents remain safe and Democrats would have a lot of voters to persuade; those aren’t among the 15 competitive districts. Nebraska’s Don Bacon and New York’s Mike Lawler won by seven percentage points. In Pennsylvania, Brian Fitzpatrick won by nearly twice that, 13 points.Democrats meanwhile must defend13 districtscarried by Trump where incumbents have, thus far, managed to outrun national trends of partisan polarization. What that means is that in many ways, Democrats are overextended on the current map; they’ll need a strong year simply to defend what they already hold.But the operative phrase is “current map”. That’s not the same as “2026 map”. The other challenge comes from redistricting and from the US supreme court. In Ohio, where Democrats have narrowly held two Trump-leaning districts, the GOP will be able to redraw thecongressional mapahead of the 2026 elections. Two of the competitive seats carried by Democrats in 2024 are in the Buckeye state. The GOP will probablygerrymanderthose seats so that they are uncompetitive for even an incumbent Democrat, pushing a 10-seat to five-seat GOP edge in the state to a 12-3 advantage.More redistricting dominos could fall. A potential decision by the US supreme court in a racialgerrymandering casefrom Louisiana could lead to Black-majority seats there as well as in Alabama and Georgia being wiped off the map. Suddenly Democrats don’t face just a seven-seat gap; they need to find their way to several more on a difficult map.The Senate mapThe Senate map looks evenharder. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. Democrats need to gain four seats to win the chamber – if, that is, they successfully defend one seat in Georgia, as well as open seats in purple New Hampshire, Michigan and Minnesota, where Democratic incumbents have announced retirements. Democrats will once again target the Maine senator Susan Collins. Beyond that, it’s a tough road: they will need to hold the four purple seats, defeat a popular survivor in Maine, and then take three more from this unforgiving, unlikely list where the best bets are North Carolina, Texas, Florida, Ohio, Iowa or South Carolina.Trump and Musk have ushered in a terrible era of cataclysm capitalism. But I have a plan to counter it | Julia SteinbergerRead moreOuch. The longer-term Senate trends don’t look much more favorable given how nationally polarized these races have become. In 2024, there were 24 solid red states that Trump won by double digits. There were 19 blue ones. Republicans now hold all48 Senate seatsin the red states. Democrats (or independents who caucus with them) hold 37 of the 38 from blue states. Democrats would need to defeat Collins and then win 13 of the 14 from seven swing states – which means maintaining two in Georgia, Arizona and Michigan, and finding a way to win in North Carolina. Otherwise, they need inroads into states where Democrats have had almost no statewide success for more than a decade.Political realities can change. But the road to 51 seats requires challenging the current math and maps in quite dramatic ways. Texas, Florida, Ohio, Iowa and South Carolina is change that is difficult to believe in.Population changesPopulation shifts don’t favor Democrats, either. By 2035, expertssuggest, 70% of the nation will live in the 15 largest states, with just 30 senators. Right now, two-thirds of Americans live in the largest 15 states, according to census data. They are represented by 30 senators – 21 Democrats and nine Republicans. The other third of us? These smaller 35 states aren’t only whiter than the nation at large, they tilt decisively to the Republican party, represented by 46 Republicans and 24Democrats.Those population shifts will affect theHouseas well when it is reapportioned after the 2030 census. Early Census Bureauestimatessuggest that California will lose four seats, New York two, and Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin one apiece. Maybe Democrats will find a way to gerrymander Illinois so completely that a red seat is lost. But on balance, this will almost certainly cost Democrats several current blue seats. Thoseseatswould each shift to states where Republicans have locked in huge advantages via controlling the redistricting process, and where they have long drawn lines that outpace demographic trends: four each toTexasandFlorida, and one forArizona, Idaho, North Carolina and Utah.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

It is to paint a realistic picture of what Democrats face.’Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPAThe presidency and supreme courtElectoral college power will shift as well. The projected 2030 reapportionment would have cost Joe Biden in 12 electors in 2020; in 2024 it would have been a loss of 10 for Harris. That shifts the fight for the White House. This decade, a Democrat could win the White House simply by carrying the reliably blue states, as well as the once-mighty “blue wall” of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Omaha, Nebraska, elector. But subtract those 12 electors and that’s not close to enough. Beginning in 2032, if these projections hold, Democrats would have to win the blue states, the “blue wall”,pluseither North Carolina or Georgia, or both Arizona and Nevada.One place where conservative power won’t shift any time soon: the supreme court. The Democrats have won the popular vote in seven of the last nine presidential elections, yet they are in a terrible position. The 6-3 Republican supermajority should prove enduring for decades. If Trump replaces Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito with younger justices, the advantage could last even longer. In order to break this hold, Democrats will not only need to control the White House when openings arise, but also the Senate. Barack Obama’s appointment of Merrick Garland was stonewalled by a Republican Senate in 2016; the chamber has only become more aggressively ideological – let alone tougher for Democrats to win – in the decade since. It is easy to imagine a Republican Senate simply refusing to consider any Democratic president’s nominee.So what do Democrats do?None of this is intended to be oppressively bleak. It is to paint a realistic picture of what Democrats face and to explain where they must win to pry back any levers of federal power and sustain it.Of course, nothing is static. Plenty of events over the next two and four years, from a recession to further national security embarrassments, could scramble American politics. Democrats have already flipped some 2025 state legislative races few expected them to win. Still, winning November races when turnout and polarization are at the highest is much more difficult – and picking up double digits in the US House with limited targets is a demanding task. Last week’s results in Florida, where Republicans easily held thecongressional seatthat belonged to the national security adviser, Michael Waltz, despite Democratic energy, breathless coverage in the national press, and a massive fundraising advantage, should be a brutal reality check. And that’s assuming free and fair elections, and before factoring in the extreme, voter-suppressing Save Act making its way through Congress that would make it more difficult fortens of millions of Americansto vote.It’s tougher still to see the road to a Senate majority near term. Hoping for polarization to ebb, or the Maga grasp on the GOP to ease, is coming to a gun fight with good vibes and crossed fingers.Messaging and messengers are not unimportant. They’re crucial. Especially if Democrats hope to change a brand that is toxic in many states where they must find a path to victory if they want any hope of reaching 270, 218 or 51. But math remains the far bigger challenge – and even perfect messaging crashes against structural and geographic realities. Too many Democrats, and the party’s polling/consulting complex, want to bleed the ActBlue accounts of supporters on lost causes like the Florida special election.The Florida and Wisconsin election results are a warning for Trump and Republicans | Lloyd GreenRead moreThe focus for Democrats must be on something different: defending free and fair elections, and building a coalition right now behind reforming redistricting, the courts, statehood for Washington DC and Puerto Rico, and imagining the Senate reapportionment that Daniel Patrick Moynihanwarned30 years ago we would soon desperately need.That’s what needs to be communicated: structural reforms represent everyone’s only hope to create a level playing field, meaningful elections and an accountable democracy for all.The good news is that these reforms are already popular with Americans: 70% back supreme courtterm limitsandethics codes. Gerrymandering is loathed in red, blue and purple states. It’s time to make the same serious case for reapportioning the Senate, adding states, a more proportional House, ranked choice voting, and additional judicial reforms. TheNational Popular Voteinterstate compact keeps getting closer to revamping presidential elections so that every vote is equal. “A more perfect union” fundamentally means that American democracy must evolve with the times.Call it the Contract to Reform America, or Project 2029, or “make American politics fair again”. Get all the influencers and future podcasters onboard. Until Democrats fix the math and reform the system, the few will control the many for decades to come.Messaging that basic unfair reality is something even these Democrats should be able to do. If they can’t, we are in the kind of authoritarian fix that no election will be able to undo.David Daleyis the author of Antidemocratic: Inside the Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections as well as Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn’t CountExplore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionUS politicsUS CongressUS SenateHouse of RepresentativesTrump administrationDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

He promised to use his deal-making experience to negotiate an end toRussia’s invasion of Ukraine and Israel’s war onGaza, among other global conflicts.“If Kamala wins, only death and destruction await because she is the candidate of endless wars. I am the candidate of peace,”Trump told a rallyin Michigan on 1 November, as he urged Arab and Muslim American voters to choose him over the Democratic candidate,Kamala Harris.But less than 100 days into his second term, Trump has not only instigated economic and political chaos at home, he is also stoking multiple conflicts abroad. Last month, Trump launched a newUS bombing campaignagainst Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have been disrupting international shipping in the Red Sea. Trump also supported the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, after he imposed a new siege on Gaza and restartedIsrael’s devastating waragainst the Palestinian territory. And on 28 March, Israelbombed Beirutfor the first time since agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire with the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, jeopardizing another fragile truce in the region.Trump has abandoned the idea of diplomacy in the Middle East | Jo-Ann MortRead moreTrump’s campaign trail promises of ending the legacy of wars that the US had unleashed in the Middle East after the September 11 attacks resonated with a war-weary American public. But the self-declared“candidate of peace”is sleepwalking the US into multiple new conflicts because of his desire to project strength and to avoid pressuring Netanyahu into ending Israel’s wars, which rely on US weapons and political support.For years, Trump has mused that he deserves to win the Nobel peace prize for brokering a series of diplomatic deals, known as the Abraham accords, between Israel and several Arab states during his first term as president. In hisinaugural addresson 20 January, Trump went even further than he had during the campaign in trying to establish himself as a global peacemaker in his second term. “We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end – and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into,” he said, adding: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.”But Trump is making little progress toward solving the biggest conflicts he pledged to tackle, partly because he has usually sided with the aggressor. In early March, days after Trump and the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had a televised shouting match in the White House,the president suspendedall US military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Trump argued he was using the suspension to force Zelenskyy to make concessions that would help the US broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. But Trump avoided pressuring Vladimir Putin, who had launched Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022, to also make concessions.Trump restored military aid to the Ukrainians after Zelenskyy agreed to a series of US-brokered meetings, but Putinrecently dismissedthe latest US ceasefire proposals as unacceptable. With little pressure from Trump, Putin is insisting on truce terms that would force Ukraine to agree to demilitarize and pledge never to join Nato and to recognize Russian annexation of occupied territories, including Crimea. The deal would essentially dismantle Ukraine as an independent state.Trump is repeating the same mistakes for which he excoriated Biden throughout the presidential campaignIn the same way, Trump has failed to use US leverage – billions of dollars in US arms shipments – to pressure Netanyahu not to resume Israel’s war on Gaza. In fact, as the Trump administration froze military aid to Ukraine last month, it approved$4bn in new weaponsto Israel under the state department’s emergency authority. That meant those arms deals would bypass even a cursory review by members of Congress. The weapons approved by Trump include more than 35,000 US-made2,000lb “bunker buster” bombs, which often kill and wound civilians indiscriminately when they’re dropped on population centers, as Israel has done repeatedly in itsattacks on Gaza.And while Trump might have visions of securing his Nobel prize for brokering anormalization dealbetween Israel and Saudi Arabia – an expansion of the Abraham accords that eluded Joe Biden for four years – Trump would first need to stop the bloodshed in Gaza. Like Biden before him, Trump has shown little willingness to exert significant pressure on Netanyahu, whobacked outof the US-brokered ceasefire with Hamas so that he could keep his rightwing coalition in power and avoid early parliamentary elections in Israel.Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, has made clear thathe won’t agreeto a diplomatic deal with Israel until the Israeli government commits to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu, on the other hand, openlyboasted last yearthat he had spent decades of his political career blocking the creation of a Palestinian state. Trump has also failed to expand the 2020 Abraham accords because they were mainly conceived and negotiated by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser during his first term, who has stayed out of the White House this time.More broadly, as long as the president fails to use the same kind of leverage and political power against Netanyahu that he deployed againstUkraine, his dream of a Nobel prize will remain elusive.Aside from his failure to stop the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Trump recently expanded adestructive conflictwith the Houthi militia that controls most of Yemen. After Israel invaded Gaza following the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, the Houthis began firing missiles and drones at cargo vessels crossing the Red Sea. The Houthis pledged to stop disrupting global shipping once Israel ended its war on Gaza – andthey did so after Israel and Hamasagreed to a ceasefire in January. But after Israel imposed a new siege on 2 March, banning all food and other aid shipments into Gaza, the Houthis threatened to resume their attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

The US attacks on Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen continued over the past three weeks, with no end in sight since Netanyahu shattered the Gaza ceasefire.Trump is repeating the same mistakes for which he excoriated Biden throughout the presidential campaign. For nearly a year starting in January 2024, Biden had tried – and failed – to bomb theHouthisinto submission.At the start of his own administration’s airstrikes against Yemen last year, reporters in Washingtonasked Biden if US attackson Houthi targets were working. His answer perfectly encapsulated the kneejerk, and almost absurd, rationale behind the US’s forever wars. “When you say working, are they stopping the Houthis? No,” Biden said. “Are they going to continue? Yes.”In an interview with the podcaster Tim Pool during last year’s campaign, Trump decried Biden’s bombing of Yemen as a failure – and he suggested trying to negotiate with the Houthis. “It’s crazy. You can solve problems over a telephone. Instead, they start dropping bombs,”Trump said. “You don’t have to do that. You can talk in such a way where they respect you and they listen to you.”Now back in power, the candidate of peace has instead decided to drop more US bombs onYemen.Mohamad Bazzi is the director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationIsrael-Gaza warUS politicsUS foreign policyHouthisYemencommentShareReuse this content"

And a moose in the Yukon, blundering out of the scrub at full speed right in front of us, as terrified and surprised as we were. A huge thing, my vision filled with moose. It turned and kept bolting. And summer evenings camping on the Thredbo River where wombats make for strange silent sentinels, munching grass as humans rustle plastic and wrangle gas stoves, the fuss of cooking alfresco.I remember them because they are moments of such stark joy. They are usually times of quiet in the soft evening light. Australian animals are generally both silent and reserved. And these moments are rare.‘Endearing and fascinating’ yellow-bellied glider faces ‘inexorable slide’ into extinctionRead moreIn the way of oil and water, my love of nature gets expressed by being deep in the political process, with all its banality and disregard. I sit in the heart of a major political party, theLabor party, trying to build the bridge from where we are to where we need to be. This may seem quixotic, but I prefer it to melancholy resignation.Maybe politics can’t solve it. But it’s the best we’ve got.Labor has a deep legacy of action for the natural world. The Whitlam government brought environment into the heart of governing. In 1983, one of the first acts of the Bob Hawke government was to protect the Franklin River from a hydroelectric dam. Hawke ended rainforest logging, expanded Kakadu national park, led the international campaign to ban mining in Antarctica and began work on limiting greenhouse gases, appearing with his granddaughter in a 1988 documentary on climate change.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAn ALP brochure from Australia’s 1990 federal election with a message from Bob Hawke.But the legacy is a 20th-century one.The past two decades have been dominated by responding to climate change. In the economy of politics, climate has taken all the space allotted to the environment. Finding the pathway to a safer climate hasn’t been easy, with the conservatives and vested interests weaponising it at every step, but Labor has stepped up in this term and a transition is under way. The gradual but certain collapse of the biosphere is threatening us just as comprehensively as a warming planet. And the political and policy response has been inadequate.If re-elected, now is the time for Labor to do better. Governments can only do a certain number of things at once and we muffed the environmental law reform process this term. The power and ferocity of vested interests made clear how hard it is to shift the balance between commerce and the wild.But in the last week, the prime minister hasrecommitted to the reform and the creation of an Environmental Protection Authority. Rewritten environment laws are the foundation on which we can turn it around. The central innovation is the creation of national standards, rules by which decisions are made about the environment. With proper application by an independent EPA there is a chance that we can begin to address our appalling record of stewardship.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And more than money. It will only happen with strong and clear leadership. There’s a complex set of community capabilities and attitudes that need to underpin working out how to live well on our continent. And a tangled mess of overlapping responsibilities at different levels of government to address. We’ll also need incentives to make business consider its impacts on the uncosted natural capital it mines.All this is politically possible because Australia is defined by its strange and magnificent environment. It shapes our culture, it sustains our leisure time, it marks who we are. As social researcher Rebecca Huntley says, “20 years of researching what Australians think is unique to our country, it’s not ‘mateship’ or a ‘love of sport’ but our unique natural places and iconic animals. We know they are the envy of the world, and what sets us apart.”This fact is a potent political asset to be capitalised on. Addressing the Australian extinction crisis and the decline of our environment won’t become possible because the community decides it’s their number one concern, it will be because political leaders embrace it and argue the case, grounded in our national pride in our place.Felicity Wade is a co-convener of the Labor Environment Action Network, the internal climate and environment lobby within the ALPExplore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Last chanceLabor partyAustralian politicsConservationWildlifeLaw (Australia)commentShareReuse this content"

Can we stop and think before these unsightly shrubs take over?Thu 10 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 19.24 EDTShareOn my birthday I made time for my one true passion. Hating agapanthus.I was walking my kids to school, taking time from their precious blink-and-you’ll-miss-it childhoods to seethe and take a picture of the revolting, saggy mess of agapanthus on the way. I have urgently supplied this picture to the Guardian and I’m ready and willing to speak out further.If you’re thinking “What’s an agapanthus? What is this woman on about? I don’t know what this is” – yes you do! One of the many dispiriting traits of agapanthus is that they’re everywhere. They’re a forgettable, green-tongued plant, with green stalks that stand tall and occasionally produce globes of purple or white flowers. Or as one local council website described: “Flowers are borne in terminal umbels on erect stems.”Plant people really have a way with words.I hate them because they’re ugly. They’re daggy. The colour palette is cringe and as much as anything of the natural world can be, they’re dated.Beside their crimes against my aesthetic sensibilities, they also suck up water, are impossible to remove, spread seeds like crazy, are an environmental pest, can be poisonous and attract snakes. Just one plant can quickly grow into an unsightly clump. They’re a dreadful, boring landscaping choice for their hardiness and how successfully they grow everywhere. They’re an inescapable part of so many of our public places. I don’t remember agreeing to this.I’m prepared to admit their one useful application is that they’re so moist and sappy (a combination of words ready to make me gag) that they have beenhailed as fire breaks.But it proves my point. Let’s not pretend they are a logical choice. Can we stop and think before planting environmental pests or letting a seemingly harmless, unsightly shrub take over?When a right-minded person comes along and wants to remove the eyesores, they need earth moving equipment. A small, pathetic not-worthy-of-the-name shrub should not be able to withstand fully grown adults’ efforts. And yet they do! Their roots dig in wide and deep and proliferate into formidable clumps meaning it’s often more effort than people can summon to remove them. Did I mention the leaves and roots are poisonous? Give me a spiky, practical, hardy native shrub any day (agapanthus are native to South Africa).I was recently in New Zealand, on a perfect day, on a gorgeous island, surveying a small cove, the turquoise water positively sparkling. I spent a moment admiring my luck, feeling the sun on my skin. I took a picture. Only then was my peace disturbed by noticing them everywhere. Agapanthus. Obviously growing feral all over yet another landscape where they don’t belong. I responded normally with a twenty minute-plus diatribe, receiving a generous “yes dear” from my longsuffering, absolutely not a plant guy husband.Pet hates: what’s it like to dislike dogs in a dog-loving country?Read moreKeeping with the being normal theme, I continued to notice them spilling from gardens all over town, buffeted up on steep cliffs, growing places they had no business to be. Spending my time on earth Googling such things, I learned that the City of Auckland has a warning against planting, selling or distributing agapanthus. It’s a nod to good taste and one that should be emulated all over Australia. They’re a pest to our eyes as well as our digestive systems.But maybe this is the value in picking an enemy and preoccupation that isn’t aware you exist. Spending time on my birthday and on my precious holiday being mad about a plant with purple flowers I don’t care for is a lot easier to bear and potentially even fun in the face of Very Serious World Events.If I had any upper body strength or a mid-sized earth moving machine I could more directly take on my little enemies, at least the ones along the route to school. But as it is, I will indulge this passion from this safe position behind a pink laptop and hope to find some comrades in the comments. I know the landscaper forums are with me on this.So let us have our fun.

No, but behind the hype was a genuine breakthroughHelen PilcherThe pups are cute – and great for PR – but they’re modified grey wolves. The real work is being done with their red cousinsThu 10 Apr 2025 10.50 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 11.31 EDTShareI’ve been waiting for this. Ever since researchersalmostbrought a wild goat speciesback from extinctionin 2003, it was only a matter of time until someone came forward and said they had successfully “de-extincted” a species. Now,it has happened.This week, American biotech companyColossal Biosciencesannounced it had resurrected the dire wolf, an animal that went extinct at the end of the last ice age. Colossal released a video that invited viewers to “experience thefirst dire wolf howlsheard in over 10,000 years”.But these are not dire wolf howls, and these are not dire wolves. To make the pups, scientists edited the DNA inside grey wolf cells to make it more dire wolf-like. Twenty changes were made to 14 different genes involved in coat colour, body size and skull shape. Then the cells were used for cloning.The result is that the vast majority of the animals’ DNA is still that of the grey wolf. I’m not the firstto point this out, but this means that what Colossal has actually created is a genetically modified grey wolf.So, why the insistence on calling it a dire wolf?Pop “dire wolf” into a search engine, and the evidence of a PR coup is everywhere. Exhibit A: the exclusive access given to media big hitters, such as Timemagazine and ABC News. Exhibit B: the wolf howl video, which racked up more than a million views in 24 hours. Exhibits C to I: seven more films, all by Colossal, released to time with its announcement. This includes one –more pop video than documentary– that attempts to explain the complicated science of de-extinction to the soundtrack of Thomas Dolby’s She Blinded Me With Science. Oh, the irony.If the idea was to generate interest, or hype, the dire wolf announcement worked, but in the midst of it all, there is a conspicuous absence of peer-reviewed, publicly accessible science. Colossal hasn’t released its methods or analysis of results for scientific or public scrutiny. This isn’t science as most researchers do it. This is a carefully orchestrated PR campaign, by a private company valued atmore than $10bn.Dire wolves are cool. Genetically modified wolves, less so. “We’ve slightly changed the DNA of a wolf,” is less newsworthy than, “we’ve made a dire wolf … you know them, they’ve been in Game of Thrones,and World of Warcraft” (George RR Martin – a Colossal investor and adviser – reportedly met the “dire wolves” and was moved to tears). Colossal knows this and uses it to its advantage.I’veinterviewedresearchers from Colossal Biosciences. Their technology is impressive, but there is what they do, and there is how they share this. When it comes to publicity, Colossal is a master of the art.Only last month, it announced its creation of the mammoth-esque “woolly mouse”. Before that, it has dominated headlines with its plans to de-extinct thethylacine, thedodoand thewoolly mammoth. Oh, and did I mention that it has the financial and PR backing ofChris Hemsworth,Peter Jackson, andTiger Woods? I didn’t, but it has.It is a showboating, clickbaiting approach to science that prioritises media attention over accessible data. If regular science is the quiet kid, calmly eating their dinner, then Colossal Bioscience is the fidgety kid, who wants to show you how many peas he can fit in his mouth.This is science by press release, and it’s a problem. Fragments of data are scattered among glossy PR products, which makes it almost impossible for the rest of the scientific community to interrogate the quality of Colossal’s work.So what’s the point of making a dire wolf that isn’t really a dire wolf?Colossal saysit is because the wolves can improve the diversity and health of their ecosystems.This much would be true, yet the three individuals, Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi, will spend the rest of their lives in their 800-hectare (2,000- acre) reserve. Any plans to release future not-dire wolves into the wild are unclear.A second reason, Colossal says, is because the project is helping to save endangered species. Alongside its “dire wolf” pups, Colossal also announced the birth of four cloned red wolves.Red wolves are a critically endangered species, native to the US. Fewer than 20 wild animals remain, all descended from 14 founder individuals. By carefully choosing the cells that they used for cloning, Colossal has effectively produced three new founders. If the animals are allowed to breed when they are older, this could improve the genetic diversity and resilience of the red wolf population.This is a potentially valuable contribution to conservation science, but it’s a shame that this is being drowned out by the noise created by the dubious dire wolves.In the meantime, the child is being applauded for shovelling peas into their face. Colossal is playing a PR blinder, with the column inches it generates a reward for its hype. “Meh” projects are being spun in a way that is unlikely to be good for the public perception of science. How many people, I wonder, will view these headlines and think that de-extinction is happeningright now? To make informed decisions, people need to be able to discern reality from hyperbole.Colossal says that technology it developed for the dire wolf project helped it to complete the actually important red wolf project. Only, did itreallyneed to make a big, white, muscly, genetically modified wolf in order to make copies of the red wolf? I think not. But I do think it knew how much publicity it would generate.Helen Pilcher is a science writer and the author of Bring Back the King: The New Science of De-Extinction and Life Changing: How Humans are Altering Life on EarthExplore more on these topicsWildlifeOpinionBiotechnology industryCloningAnimalscommentShareReuse this content"

It does need changing,” Lee, a bin worker and union rep, told me. But the council’scurrent offerto end the strike isn’t good enough, he said. If it cuts wages the way it wants to, “people will lose their homes”.We’ve been here before. In 2017, duringseven hot and smelly summer weeks, similar interviews were conducted in the same spot and images of sky-high mounds of uncollected rubbish were beamed out of Birmingham. That dispute was almost the same as the one we’re living through now: the council wants to get rid of a role that poses a hefty equal pay risk. Essentially, workers in other parts of the council on a similar grade don’t get the same pay or perks, which means they can make costly claims for compensation via unions or no-win, no-fee lawyers. Although the problem reared its head eight years ago, it wasn’t properly addressed – those strikes ended with essentially the same role in place but under a different name, allowing expensive claims to mount.The failure of Birmingham’s leaders to get to grips with the situation is a symptom of the council’s deeper disarray. As far as dysfunctional families go,BirminghamLabour is up there with the House of Windsor. Consumed by infighting and intermittent grabs for power from within its ranks, the group often seems so focused on internal strife that the business of running the city comes second. You don’t need to take my word for it. In May 2023, a Labour council improvement board (CIB) report found the group was “divided” with “briefing against colleagues” commonplace.But it’s not just Labour. Historically, relationships between councillors and local government officers have been fraught. A 2014 government review into Birmingham found that members’ and officers’ roles were “blurred”, and the more recent CIB report highlighted a potential imbalance of power, with many members believing the council was “officer-led”. It was the most senior officer, then chief executive Deborah Cadman, who revealed in June 2023 that the council had a financial crisis on its hands. She informed councillors that the estimated potential bill the council owed in equal pay claimswas between £650m and £760m.Three months later, the council’s inability to pay for these claims was the number one reason for Birmingham issuing a section 114 notice, declaring effective bankruptcy. As if that news wasn’t dramatic enough, council leader John Cotton reportedly first learned of the decision to issue the notice whilewaiting to board a flightto New York for a family holiday, apparently blissfully unaware the authority was about to be plunged into chaos. Even the then local government secretary, Michael Gove, I am told, was bewildered by this move, given how unstable it made the council appear.Gove’s diagnosis was swift: he quickly installed a team of austerity-obsessed commissioners in Birmingham who have overseen theworst cuts in local government history. To take just one example: by 2027, £48.1m will have been axed from children’s social care, with the cabinet member for children and families saying there is the “potential”for children to die.And yet, last week, the real figure the council owes to workers making equal pay claims wasrevealed to be, not £760m after all, but £250m. True, Birmingham’s issues run deeper than that sum (it also has to pay for a disastrous new IT system that messed up its bookkeeping abilities, and has an existing budget gap of £300m), but to anyone watching the rolling news coverage that bleak autumn, the near-£800m bill for equal pay was the cause of our downfall – so why was the figure ever floated in the first place? Had it not been, the section 114 notice – the precursor to those brutal cuts – might never have been issued. As for Cadman, she unexpectedly resigned last March after beingaccused of misleading the councilover the decision to publicise the equal pay sum.‘We’re not a third world country, we’re England’: anger rises as Birmingham’s bin strike takes toll on localsRead moreMeanwhile, the Labour government in Westminster hardly seems interested in Birmingham, and its opponents are rubbing their hands with glee at the chance to make an example of the city. The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, got in early in February, with a dispatch on fly-tipping from Handsworth for GB News. Strolling around one of the city’s more deprived neighbourhoods, he pointed enthusiastically at the “hoards of filth” and discarded “soiled underwear”.Last week, Nigel Farage held a rally in Birmingham featuring a theatrical set complete with overflowing bins, potholed roads and the message: “Your council is broken. Reform will fix it” illuminated on a screen. The Conservative shadow local government secretary, Kevin Hollinrake, appeared on Jeremy Kyle’s TalkTV show a few days ago after a visit to Birmingham, which he likened to a “third world country”. Even those of us frustrated with Labour will find little solace in such opportunism.We are used to being ridiculed in Birmingham, to opening social media and seeing countless memes declaring our city is a “shithole”. I don’t know anyone who cares too much about that on a personal level – the Brummie disposition is typically light and self-deprecating. What we want,with increasing desperation,is a functioning city that is a pleasure to live in, not politicians falling over themselves to use us as their football. Birmingham’s motto, adopted in the mid 19th century when we were regarded as a municipal powerhouse and “the best-governed city in the world”, is “forward”. Today, it feels as if we are going round and round in circles.Kate Knowles is editor of the Birmingham DispatchExplore more on these topicsBirminghamOpinionIndustrial actionLocal governmentTrade unionsWasteEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

We must defend itThu 10 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 07.02 EDTShareKnight of the realm and business tycoonPhilip Greenspends a lot of money on expensive lawyers.First, he took out an injunction in 2018 toblock the mediafrom mentioning him overcomplaints from his employeesat Arcadia Group, overwhelmingly women, about bullying and abusive conduct, behaviour which he categorically denied.But that failedwhen I named himas the person making the injunction on 25 October 2018 in the House of Lords, under a form of legal immunity known as parliamentary privilege – whereupon his lawyerstried to get mesanctioned by the parliamentary standards commissioner. That failed too when his complaint wasroundly dismissed.Green’s latest action was to instruct lawyers to appeal to the European court of human rights to overturn the concept ofparliamentary privilege in Britain, claiming that my comments had circumvented court orders around the injunction, violated his privacy and violated his right to fair trial. That also failed when the Strasbourg court this week sensibly ruled it was not a matter for them. (This was a chamber decision, so there are still three months during which he could ask for the case to be referred to the grand chamber of the court for a final ruling.)If hewere to succeed in overriding parliamentary privilegein this case, that would be seismic for human rights and freedom of speech.It dates back at least to parliament’s finest historic moment in January 1642, when King Charles I and his soldiers invaded theHouse of Commonsto arrest five MPs for treason after their speeches criticising his rule.The Speaker courageously defied him while MPs chanted “Privilege! Privilege!” – a cry taken up in the streets by the people of London. In 1689, the right to free speech in parliament wasentrenchedin the English Bill of Rights.It means that MPs or peers when speaking in parliament cannot be sued and what they say can be reported in the media without the rich or powerful being able to suppress it with legal injunctions or asset seizures.Despite outrage from the legal establishment, it was used in 1955 to name for example, the notorious spy Kim Philby. It was vindicated again in 1978 when MPs used it to expose the bogus secrecy of “Colonel B”, wrongly (as judges later found) given anonymity by a court to bolster an oppressive official secrets case against journalists.When the director of public prosecutions immediately threatened the press with prosecution, newspapers, led by the Times,defied him.That said, parliamentary privilege should be used very responsibly and sparingly. In my 34 years as a parliamentarian, I had used it just twice before naming Green.In January 2000, as a Foreign Office minister, and using British intelligence, I named traffickers selling arms for “blood diamonds” fuelling wars in Africa. They went out of business. Their chief “merchant of death”, Putin cronyVictor Boutwas subsequently imprisoned.In 2017 in the Lords,I namedBritish-based global corporations alleged to becomplicit in former president Jacob Zuma’s corrupt activities in South Africa.These examples are living proof of parliamentary sovereignty – irrespective of the wishes of the executive, the powerful, and the wealthy, and even rulings by the legal establishment when it prevents the publication of allegations of misconduct – as the courts did initially over the Green case.I acted for moral reasons and was not second-guessing or criticising the judiciary when I further used parliamentary privilegeto name Greenand share details of allegations against him in the House of Lords on 23 May 2019 - Green repeated that “to the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations”.I did this partly becauseGreen’semployees had signednon-disclosure agreements, when such NDAs are meant to ensure the sanctity of confidential commercial matters, not to hideallegations of abuse.Film tycoonHarvey Weinsteinused NDAs to silence his sexual harassment victims, as did organisers of thePresidents Clubdinner in London inJanuary 2018, when 130 women were required to sign agreements in a bid to stop any details of harassment, groping and propositioning going public.Former Conservative cabinet minister Maria Miller, when chair of the women and equalities committee, said that the case had “thrown a spotlight on the way NDAs can be used repeatedly to cover up alleged wrongdoing”.Because of Charles I’s attacks, the monarch is still barred from entering the House of Commons. Parliamentary privilege is an absolute free speech right entrenched in the law, a fundamental part of Britain’s constitution and a part of the rule of law itself.It should not be whittled away by allowing judges, at the behest of the powerful or wealthy, to override the sovereignty of parliament.Peter Hain was the Labour MP for Neath from 1991 to 2015 and secretary of state for Northern Ireland from 2005 to 2007Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So declared Markus Söder, one of the political leaders who have just announced a coalition agreement. In one of the quirks of the country’s constitution, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) will play a significant role in the new administration, and Söder used his moment in the limelight to play the entertainer.It was a curious way to announce the arrival of anew government, expected to be sworn in during the first week of May. Since the elections of 23 February, Germany will have been in limbo for two and a half months, and all while Donald Trump rampages across the world.The circumstances could not be more inauspicious. The new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, must deal with an out-of-control United States, Russia taking advantage of the mayhem by feigning interest in a peace deal while making further military inroads in Ukraine, and China increasing influence as anti-US sentiment increases. Domestically, Germany’s economy, already stuttering, faces the 20% US tariffs imposedacross the European Union, plus further punitive levies on its all-important auto industry. To compound it all, a few hours before the Christian Democrats (CDU)/CSU and Social Democrats (SPD) took to the stage to seal their deal, an opinion poll put the far-rightAlternative für Deutschland(AfD) in the lead for the first time.All of this will concentrate minds. Germany andEuropecan’t afford a repeat of the last coalition, which foundered amid acrimony and under the lacklustre leadership of Olaf Scholz. The stakes were high then; they are stratospherically higher now.“Germany is getting a government that is capable of action and is strong,” said Merz. “We will govern well together,” he added, as he looked smilingly towards the SPD leader and probable next deputy chancellor and finance minister, Lars Klingbeil. It is an unlikely bromance, but they will have to get on. As both pointed out, the “political centre”, as Germans call mainstream parties, must show it can work. Otherwise the AfD is waiting in the wings for the next election, due by 2029 at the latest.During the negotiations, which were carried out with little turbulence and few leaks, Merz was accused by party hardliners of giving away too much to the SPD. The result, as set out in the coalition agreement, is anecessary compromise, which as ever leaves all sides feeling they have won some and yielded some.Merz has secured tougher immigration controls – checks at borders, no family for the first two years, and five years rather than three for citizenship applications. Corporation tax will be reduced. Rules around the minimum income guarantee will be tightened. Klingbeil and his team have preserved increases to the minimum wage and other welfare measures.All parties were agreed on their approach to Ukraine and Russia. The introduction of a national security council within the chancellery to deal with the many emergencies the country faces is a welcome if belated move. Some form of national military service will be reintroduced, but it is expected to be opt-in, with benefits for participants, rather than compulsory. The climate crisis barely got a mention.Everyone is talking the talk about modernisation and removing bureaucracy. A new digitisation ministry is designed to kickstart Germany’s lamentable digital provision. Will this analogue and cash-based society finally join the modern world?As ever in modern Germany, gloom has enveloped the country. Some of it is understandable – a country that craves stability is having to come to terms with a world more on edge than at any time since theformation of the Federal Republicin 1949. Yet much of it is self-indulgent. Having just voted in a general election, with thehighest turnoutsince reunification in 1990, and having ensured a relatively stable two-party coalition (the CSU is not seen as a separate entity), Germans have turned on Merz before he has even been given the seals of office.His biggest “crime” was to force constitutional changes through the outgoing parliament rather than waiting for the new one to be formed. He knew he had to do this, as the far right and radical left would have voted the changes down. In so doing, he has paved the way for an injection of more spending on defence and aninjection of €500bnto tackle the country’s ailing infrastructure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Merz and Klingbeil seem to work well; Boris Pistorius, thepopular defence minister, is expected to stay in his job, providing much-needed stability.Under Scholz, Germany was absent without leave. The EU was rudderless. The economy atrophied. Just over two months after the last government took over, Vladimir Putin had invaded Ukraine, and all the parties’ preparations were torn apart. This time, darkness has descended even before the work has begun. There will be no honeymoon for Merz, no first 100 days. It is hard to imagine an accession as fraught as this one.

There’s more!!” to indicate they are expecting some other gem to drop from the mouth of the person speaking.With just over 21 days until our next federal election, I’m pretty sure that line is going to be well used as both major parties try and sweeten their electorate appeal by offering all of us opportunities to benefit financially.Already we are seeing promises abound, from the Coalition’s pledge to introduce a $20bn regional Australia future fund to Anthony Albanese’s pledge to commit $10m to education and tourism funding for the Great Barrier Reef.But as the dollars seemingly rain down, I can’t help but wonder: how much do the party pundits think a vote is worth these days? And if we buy what they are selling, how can we be sure what was promised will actually be delivered?Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterIt wasAmerican president Bill Clinton who said: “It’s no wonder Americans hate politics when, year in and year out, they hear politicians make promises that won’t come true because they don’t even mean them – campaign fantasies that win elections but don’t get nations moving again.”In this context, I wonder if we would all be better placed if those who wish to “rule” us made promises about how they would wield that power in ways that go well beyond just how they intend to spend our tax dollars.If you’re going to sell us anything, let it be a vision of our country that might take 10 years to achieve and may involve some personal sacrifice along the way, but which would ultimately ensure our kids are able to live in the homes they want, do the jobs they aspire to, have the families they imagine, all in a beautiful and healthy environment.In the absence of that, our media continues to report each day on political promises made at both the national and local level which frequently involve little more than the blunt instrument of cash.Coalition nuclear plan will plough $58bn wrecking ball through renewable energy projects, analysis warnsRead moreWhether it’s sports facilities or equipment for clubs it seems the major parties believe that they can avoid the difficult conversation around where we are headed and what sort of nation we want to be – as long as, like a parent trying to distract a wayward child, they offer something sweet.This really hit home for me recently as I listened to an interview with the member for Wannon, Dan Tehan, who isseeking to be returned by his electorate in Victoria.It appeared that he was simply repeating the promises he had made to his community back in the 2022 election.When challenged as to why he hadn’t delivered on those promises, his response was along the lines of: well, you didn’t put my party into government!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Surely MPs should not commit funding for projects in their community on a basis that is predicated on their party winning government. If you promise it, you should be able to deliver it. And if you don’t deliver it, you should not expect to be returned.As the dust settles on the first debate between the current two major-party leaders, what hits me is the fact that bringing that level of “transactional” promise-making into our election process has actually weakened our democracy. Instead of seeking to inspire us with promises of bold long-term visions, our leaders sink to seeing who can throw what at whom and, as any parent will tell you, that sort of sugar eventually wears off and the come down can be brutal.Poorest urban fringe electorates gain most from Labor’s first-term tax and welfare reform, ANU research showsRead moreThose who wish wield the power of our government in our next parliament should be asked much deeper questions on how they intend to tackle the truly existential threats we face as a nation: such as climate change, continued violence against women, the breakdown of our social cohesion, the high rates of distress of young people and the extraordinary level of poverty across our nation. Because, quite honestly, my vote is worth far more than anything currently being offered and should never be for sale.Kylea Tink is the outgoing independent federal member for North SydneyThis article was amended on 10 April 2025 to correct the location of the seat of Wannon.

Tom Cruise’s final Mission: Impossible movie is showing out of competition; Robert De Niro is getting an honorary Palme d’Or – and probably treating audiences to a characteristically tightlipped onstage interview – and Bono arrives at the red carpet for Andrew Dominik’s documentary Bono: Stories of Surrender. Actor turned director Scarlett Johansson comes to Cannes with her Eleanor the Great, a quirky New York tale starring veteran player June Squibb.Scarlett Johansson, Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor set for Cannes 2025 as lineup announcedRead moreThere is also, of course, an appearance from the Belgian social-realist masters and Cannes icons the Dardenne brothers, whose appearance here with The Young Mother’s Home coincides with a mood of sadness, rememberingthe recent death of their totemic actor Émilie Dequenne, who starred as a teen in their film Rosetta, which won the Palme d’Or and best actress award.As far as the British go … nothing in competition, but Harris Dickinson, recently announced as John Lennon in Sam Mendes’ Beatles tetraology, is presenting his own feature directorial debut, Urchin, in the Un Certain Regard sidebar. And writer-director Harry Lighton has his own film in the same section: Pillion, a homoerotic biker tale, based on the novel Box Hill by Adam Mars-Jones.The mood in the world’s pre-eminent film festival could hardly be more bullish and upbeat. Mutterings some years ago that Cannes’s opposition to the streamers’ non-theatrical content would render it irrelevant have been swept aside. So too have comments that it’s Venice and Toronto which set the pace for the award-winners. With the huge Oscar success of last year’s Anora, The Substance and the much-disputed Emilia Pérez, Cannes films are at the heart of the conversation – though they can’t hope to match the huge box office firepower of films such as The Super Mario Bros Movie and A Minecraft Movie.The festival is presenting us with its keynote themes and approaches. As so often, it tackles Iranian cinema and Iranian dissident politics by including the new, secretly filmed movie by Iranian auteurJafar Panahi: A Simple Accident – as ever, testing the attitude of the Iranian authorities who detest Panahi’s campaigning but are aware of his huge international prestige. Cannes is again challenging Vladimir Putin with a new film from Russia’s prominent dissident film and theatre director Kirill Serebrennikov (he had a film in Cannes just last year). This new one is called The Disappearance of Josef Mengele with August Diehl as Mengele. Ukrainian auteur Sergei Loznitsa comes to Cannes too with his anti-Soviet period drama Two Prosecutors.View image in fullscreenInternational prestige … Iranian film director Jafar Panahi in 2022.Photograph: Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty ImagesAs far as the gender issue goes, Cannes is not to be cowed. It has a female director on its opening night gala, Amélie Bonnin’s Leave One Day – a gender-switched version of her short film about someone returning to their home town – and out of competition there is Rebecca Zlotowski’s drama Private Life, about a psychiatrist, played by Jodie Foster, investigating the death of one of her patients.In competition, there is the hugely admired Reichardt who intriguingly is giving us The Mastermind, an old-school 70s crime drama with Josh O’Connor, John Magaro and Alana Haim; Palme laureate Ducournau is there with Alpha, a meditation on the Aids crisis; Hafsia Herzi presents The Last One about the Algerian immigrant experience in France and the widely admired Japanese auteur Chie Hayakawa directs Renoir, about an 11-year-old girl negotiating a bewildering adult world. The superb Spanish film-maker Simón,a Golden Bear winner in Berlin, comes to Cannes with Romería about a young woman’s quest to discover her family identity. German auteur Mascha Schilinski is in competition with her much-anticipated title Sound of Falling.I sense some of the male big hitters might divide opinion.Aster will be a hot ticket with his contemporary western black comedy Eddington starring Joaquin Phoenix. But I was not a fan of his previous film, the clunkingly phantasmagoric freakoutBeau Is Afraid. This could be more of the same, but Aster always commands attention. Richard Linklater comes to Cannes with his Nouvelle Vague, about the making of Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless. It wasn’t all that long ago that Michel Hazanavicius was in Cannes with his Redoubtable, a slightly underwhelming film about the making of Godard’s La Chinoise which Godard himself denounced as a “stupid idea” – I wonder if his new film could be the same kind of quirky/ironised ancestor-worship.Anderson is back with his comedyThe Phoenician Schemeand it is almost by the way to complain or even notice that his style is unvarying – for fans, that is the point, and it is arguably no more unvarying than those of other bland directors whose work all resembles everyone else’s. But Anderson is always in danger of reaching saturation point.Danish-Norwegian film-maker Trier blew us all away in Cannes a few years ago with his romantic comedy-drama The Worst Person in the World with its wonderful lead and Cannes best-actress-winning performance from Renate Reinsve – now he is back with Sentimental Value (also starring Reinsve), an emotional family drama.French veteran Dominik Moll is there with Dossier 137, a tough cop procedural – Moll is always good value, although Cannes has a habit of including solid but unexciting French titles in competition to ensure its own industry is represented. South African film-maker Oliver Hermanus is in competition with The History of Sound, a queer drama about two lovers in early 20th-century New England played by Paul Mescal and O’Connor.Brazil’s critic turned auteur Kleber Mendonça Filho returns us to the grim world of the military dictatorship of the 70s with The Secret Agent. Óliver Laxe is a visually driven director (who has worked with British film-maker Ben Rivers) and his Sirat, a mystery about a music festival in north Africa, looks intriguing. Mario Martone’s Fuori is a movie from the Italian director who made Nostalgia and this is about post-prison life and Tarik Saleh’s Eagles of the Republic is the last of his Cairo trilogy about post-Arab spring Egypt.As ever, it’s a mouthwatering lineup of auteur-led cinema.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalscommentShareReuse this content"

Something of the prickly, confrontational outsider clung to them even at the zenith of their success – 1995’s quadruple-platinum Different Class is an album packed with waspish, witty ruminations on the British class system – while 1998’s This Is Hardcore offered a paranoid and occasionally harrowing examination of their era as celebrities, something its dense, doomy sound also helped to draw to a close.Accordingly, Spike Island seems to use the Stone Roses’ famous 1990 gig where 30,000 people crammed into a Widnes field surrounded by chemical factories as a metaphor for disappointment and the way nostalgia tends to burnish memories: the fact that Spike Island was famously badly organised, musically underwhelming and plagued by terrible sound hasn’t stopped it subsequently developing a legendary status as a kind of baggy-era Woodstock. Perhaps Cocker is looking back on Pulp’s own supposed glory days with greater perspective: Spike Island references his discomfort with fame (“I was conforming to a cosmic design, I was playing to type”), and the indifference Pulp’s disbanding was greeted with in the early 00s, when a theoretically valedictory greatest hits album barely scraped the Top 75: “The universe shrugged and moved on”.But Cocker seems emboldened at the prospect of his own second coming. He suggests that “this time I’ll get it right” and that he has “walked back to the garden of earthly delights”. He sings happily: “I was born to perform, it’s a calling / I exist to do this – shouting and pointing”.Students of rock history might recognise the last three words as the title of an ignored 1976 album by Mott, the dogged but doomed attempt by members of Mott the Hoople to soldier on without lead singer Ian Hunter. References to 1970s pop-culture arcana are, of course, very Pulp – and so are a lot of other things about Spike Island: the disco-influenced rhythm (decorated with the distinctive sound of syndrums), the brief spoken-word section, and the sense that complicated emotions lurk behind its anthemic chorus.For all the conflicted feelings at its centre, Spike Island is a noticeably stronger song than After You, the solitary new track spawned by Pulp’s previous reformation, in the early 2010s. Had Spike Island been released in their heyday – or instead of the strikingly downbeat Help the Aged in 1997 – it would doubtless have been a hit.Equally, you could see some of its reflections on the past as not dissimilar to those offered by Damon Albarn on Blur’s 2023 comeback single The Narcissist. Whether Pulp’s forthcoming album More goes on to attain the same degree of acclaim as Blur’s The Ballad of Darren remains to be seen, but, for now, as attested by the excited texts pouring in after Spike Island was premiered on BBC Radio 6 Music, fans are likely to be delighted.Explore more on these topicsPulpPop and rockIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

The question has increased in frequency and urgency over the past month, asmore and more people got hookedon weekly episodes that simulate the adrenaline cascade that is emergency medicine, one hour at a time. Friends, acquaintances, strangers at the coffee shop – everyone was watching The Pitt. Or, more accurately, reliving it, because to watch The Pitt is to be absorbed by The Pitt. Such is the nature of binging, but also the show’s design: a long season – 15 episodes, or nearly twice the length of a standard streaming drama, with the finale released tonight – plus a single episodic conceit, self-contained set, mixture of long and short story arcs, and archetypical characters with tight, shrewdly deployed backstories.The Pitt review – real-time medical drama puts Noah Wyle back in ERRead moreIn other words, it’s a good procedural, in the lane of some of the best network television; a medical drama with a charismatic lead is not breaking the wheel. In fact, by starring Noah Wyle as Dr Michael “Robby”Robinavitch, a haunted yet persistently cool and competent attending physician, it specifically invokes ER, the grandaddy of all medical dramas. (As well as a copyright dispute: though they share executive producers, Warner Bros would like you to know thatThe Pitt isnotan ER spinoff.)And yet the Pitt feels fresh – simple, sleek, competently made and relevant to a country whose healthcare system is notoriously inequitable and actively under attack from the administration. A mix of quick adrenaline hits and longer, nuanced story arcs, of formal gimmicks (like 24, each episode covers roughly an hour in real time) and tried and true staples (Patrick Ball’s hot doctor with an attitude, cases that are always more complicated than they initially seem). A symphony of stress that does not relent has a deft handle on the basics of camerawork, pacing, set and tone down. Good, compelling television shouldn’t be a rarity in the streaming age, and yet …This is the type of show that streaming companies should have mastered long ago but have struggled to produce, opting instead for experiments in theme and structure, such as the recent Netflix hit Adolescence, or cheaply made, disposable fluff. The Pitt still has some of the flourishes and freedom of the streaming model – nudity, swearing, flexible runtimes, the ability to show graphic detail of, say, a degloved foot (?!) or post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (and those are two of the less traumatic injuries). But it is, at its core, a show of old-school TV rhythm and blues. That it took so long to arrive is a testament to the fact that even procedural television is an art form that cannot be cracked by business logic alone, and that doing a simple formula well still requires some special sauce.For The Pitt, that’s in part its grittiness, so at odds with the prevailing logic for 2010s medical dramas like Grey’s Anatomy – that familiar glossy sheen, intra-hospital entanglements and operatic drama, usually accompanied by swelling music and long, steady shots. The Pit, as Robby calls this financially neglected and strained segment of a larger hospital, is a chaotic place. The overflowing waiting room constantly simmers with crises about to boil over. The hallways are cluttered with overflow beds, the fluorescent lighting harsh, the doctors sweaty, peaked, raccoon-eyed.The tight choreography of cacophony, roving shots of an ever-evolving environment, mirrors the real strain of an emergency room better than most medical dramas; The Pitt hasdrawn the attention of real healthcare professionalsfor its unusual accuracy (having fielded my physician mother’s many critiques of Grey’s Anatomy and House over the years, that’s no small feat). Though it is a capital-d Drama that still ludicrously pushes the limits of how much topical crisis a single ER unit can face in a single shift, The Pitt is primarily attuned to process, the type of mundane procedure other dramas would skip over for time. If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to follow the camera down the throat for intubation or how to transfer a patient to an ECMO machine, well, now you know.But The Pitt’s greatest strength is its propulsive sense of immediacy, its emphasis on the now on both a formal and thematic level. Containing the first season to a single shift in real time inherently precludes the possibility for much character development or transformation, and forces some obvious breaks from reason – why does the hospital’s chief business administrator need to return to the floor several times over one day? (Answer: exposition and a polite layer of “healthcare is a business” complication.) But it magnetically conveys one of the show’s central points: healthcare is a job, done by real, fallible humans enduring a constant ebb and flow of stress. The at times gimmicky conceit adds an extra dimension to viewership, experiencing critical minutes along with the characters, stressing for the same duration of time.View image in fullscreenNoah Wyle in The Pitt.Photograph: Max/Warrick PageThe Pitt is by no means a perfect show – the acting occasionally underwhelming, the dialogue obvious, the level of action bordering on absurd. It surpasses the believable number of hot-button crises that present in a single ER in a single day. Still, the fact that it weaves in about every conceivable knot of health and social issue – inherent racial bias in not recognizing sickle cell crisis, fat-shaming dressed up as medical advice, language barriers, state abortion restrictions – meets a national moment of overlapping crises, particularly in healthcare. The most recent episodes have pivoted from (spoiler alert) mass shooting to a measles outbreak, at a time when theprominently anti-vax health and human services secretaryis supposed to manage a measles crisis in Texas that has alreadykilled two children.In The Pitt, at least, every staff member has good intentions and a big heart, even if the demands of the job require stoicism in the face of unimaginable trauma. It’s a type of fantasy based in reality – the vast majority of healthcare professionals are sincerely invested in patient health, sometimes to the detriment of theirs – though of course reality is always more complicated. The show borders on 15-hour agitprop for healthcare as a practice; you wouldn’t think you’d need a television shown to advocate for science-based healthcare as a concept, but we’re in the age of Covid truthers.Whether for cope or catharsis, it’s working. I’m watching The Pitt, along with thousands of others joining the train as it builds momentum each week (take note, Netflix). Max has already renewed the show for a second season, said to take place over the Fourth of July – a harrowing prospect, if an exciting one, proving once again why some classics never go out of style.Explore more on these topicsMedical dramaUS televisionDramaTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Moonraker (End Title) (1979)Shirley Bassey apparently hated this Bond theme, protesting that the lyrics were nonsensical. She never performed it live. It’s certainly not up to previous standards, but the disco version that accompanies the film’s end credits is worth hearing – better than her attempt to rejig This Is My Life for the 70s dancefloor.19. You, You Romeo (1957)Classic early Shirley in that it’s both sexy and powerful, a combination that the writer Bob Stanley once brilliantly suggested evoked “the hardest girl in the school taking a shine to you and repeatedly slamming you against her locker door”. That’sexactlywhat the chorus of You, You Romeo sounds like.18. Slave to the Rhythm (1996/2007)Another should-have-been-a-hit culled from Bassey’s stock of latterday covers: Slave to the Rhythm’s commanding tone suits her voice perfectly. She first recorded it in the mid-90s, but the 2007 version is the one, its production far less indebted to Trevor Horn’s original, its breakbeat pilfered from Primal Scream’s Loaded.17. Let’s Fall in Love (1962)View image in fullscreenBassey with (from left) Danny Williams, Alvin Stardust and Jess Conrad in 1962.Photograph: PAAnyone who felt Bassey was underserved working with British bandleaders and orchestras had their prayers answered by her sixth album, Let’s Face the Music, recorded with New Jersey arranger Nelson Riddle and his orchestra while they were touring the UK. As Long As He Needs Me was the big hit, but this is the killer cut: luscious and pillow-soft.16. (Where Do I Begin?) Love Story (1971)It was bested in the UK singles chart by Andy Williams’ original soundtrack recording, but Bassey’s take on the theme from the film Love Story may be the definitive version. She is certainly more intense in her approach to the song than Williams was, cutting against the super-slick easy listening arrangement.15. History Repeating (1997)It was inevitable that the 90s easy listening revival would burnish Bassey’s career: it resulted in her biggest hit single in decades, a collaboration with big beat duo Propellerheads. Big beat wasn’t a subgenre noted for subtlety, but History Repeating is impressively respectful in its updating of Bassey’s sound. It’s a strong song that fits her perfectly.14. Burn My Candle (1956)View image in fullscreenBassey just before her 19th birthday, in 1956.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesBassey’s debut single was asuccès de scandale, banned by the BBC. Its hymning of “straight and simple sex” was remarkably frank for the mid-50s, and amplified by the 19-year-old singer’s innocent delivery. She later claimed, not entirely convincingly, that she simply hadn’t understood the lyrics.13. The Girl from Tiger Bay (2009)Of all Bassey’s recent(ish) attempts to tap into modern pop culture, her 2009 album The Performance is the best. Written by James Dean Bradfield and Nicky Wire ofManic Street Preachers, The Girl from Tiger Bay is a particularly majestic song, worth it just to hear her confidently essay a lyric about situationism as if that were the most normal thing in the world.12. Spinning Wheel (1970)View image in fullscreenPhotograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesThe album Something, big on rock covers, was a concerted effort to make Bassey more contemporary. Rediscovered during the 90s easy listening revival, her version of Blood Sweat and Tears’ 1969 hit is great: funky and commanding enough to make you wish she’d tried this approach more often.11. For All We Know (1971)One of Bassey’s weirder hits: a version of the Carpenters’ song clearly influenced by the string-bedecked reggae singles that populated the British charts in the early 70s. Whether Shirl was a quiet admirer of the skinheads’ soundtrack of choice remains unknown, but she sails through it with aplomb.10. Morning in Your Eyes (1974)View image in fullscreenPerforming for the BBC, 1979.Photograph: David Redfern/RedfernsBassey apparently wasn’t keen on Nobody Does It Like Me, an album she recorded in LA. But this is a wonderful, overlooked track, a kind of MOR/soft soul crossover that sets her voice against Motown stalwart James Jamerson’s incredible bass playing and a sumptuous arrangement by Barry White collaborator Gene Page.9. The Rhythm Divine (1987)A collaboration with Swiss electronic duo Yello, co-written by the Associates’ Billy MacKenzie, The Rhythm Divine appeared at a commercial low point in Bassey’s recording career. It’s a wonderful song that sets her voice amid moody electronics to glamorous effect – a reminder of what she could do, given the right partners.8. Light My Fire (1970)Her cover of the George Harrison-penned Something was a hit, but the best example of Bassey tackling contemporary rock was her CinemaScope rendition of the Doors’ breakthrough single. Rediscovered by DJs in the 90s, it’s just fantastic, drenched in strings that aid her transformation of the song from slow burn into high drama.7. Never, Never, Never (1973)View image in fullscreenOn stage in 1975.Photograph: United Archives/Getty ImagesBassey had a line in repurposing Italian-language ballads for an anglophone audience, as on the show-stopping This Is My Life. Never, Never, Never, meanwhile, began life as Grande, Grande, Grande. You can see why it pricked her interest: the melody is beautiful, the key changes dramatic, and she sings the hell out of it.6. Jezahel (1972)The great Shirley Bassey deep cut. Goodness knows how she came across Jezahel – it was a single by an Italian prog band called Delirium – but her version is incredible, her voice soaring over a subtly funky backing, punctuated by thrilling blasts of brass. It was sampled on Public Enemy’s Harder Than You Think.5. Till (1961)Restrained isn’t the first adjective that springs to mind when considering Bassey’s voice – one critic approvingly compared her to a flamethrower – but her version of Till, a ballad originally recorded by Percy Faith, is all about restraint. There’s an affecting tenderness to her delivery, and the results are beautiful.4. This Is My Life (1968)More so than any of her Bond themes, This Is My Life is the archetypical Bassey belter: lavishly orchestrated musical melodrama, with a lyric so filled with defiance – “and I don’tgive a damnfor lost emotions!” – it requires a voice that communicates believable passion without slipping into histrionics. It’s hard to imagine anyone singing it better.3. Big Spender (1967)In the musical Sweet Charity, Big Spender is slow, almost creepy, sung by blank-eyed “dance hostesses”. Bassey sped it up, making its come-ons more straightforward and forthright. There’s ice in her voice – this is still a transactional proposition – but when she offers you a “good time”, you know you’re going to get one.2. Goldfinger (1964)Co-lyricist Anthony Newley was supposed to sing Goldfinger, but declined because the song was “weird”. Enter Bassey, whose performance was so full-throttle she was forced to remove her bra midway through the recording session. Her vocal has power, conviction and a faint but detectable sense of camp: no wonder it became her signature song.1. Diamonds Are Forever (1971)By 1971, the shine was starting to tarnish on the Bond franchise, and employing Bassey for the theme song was a deliberate attempt to hark back to its heyday – but Diamonds Are Forever caught John Barry and Don Black at the peak of their powers. Barry’s melody is stunning, with an arrangement that is atmospheric to the point of being almost eerie, and Black’s lyrics are a fabulously cynical melding of eroticism and materialism. Always good with songs that suggested wealth had more value than love, Bassey was the perfect fit: she sounds utterly authoritative, as if bitter experience has led her to mean every word.A new compilation, Dame Shirley Bassey: The Singer (Classic and Undiscovered Gems from the EMI/UA Years 1962-79), is released 18 April on StrawberryExplore more on these topicsRankedShirley BasseyPop and rockJames BondManic Street PreachersDance musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, ahead of a new show, the ‘future of portraiture’ reveals how he originally wanted to be a tennis playerThu 10 Apr 2025 09.41 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 11.16 EDTShareNot every artist who skyrockets to fame makes it all the way into space. But that was the case for Amoako Boafo who, three years after his big break, painted three panels on the top of Jeff Bezos’s rocket ship. “I’ll be honest, I just did it for the experience,” says the Ghanaian artist, whose triptych blasted off in August 2021 and returned (intact) after an 11-minute round trip. If the opportunity should arise, would he ever be interested in taking a tour himself? “No, I like it here,” he replies, tapping the ground with his green Dior trainers.Boafo’s artistic breakthrough came when his effervescent portraits celebrating Black life caught the eye of Kehinde Wiley on Instagram in 2018. Wiley, the African American artist best-known for painting Barack Obama, tipped off his galleries, and before long Boafo’s canvases, which he began exhibiting in hotel lobbies back home in Accra, were appearing at international art fairs and fetching up to seven figures at auction. A spring/summer collection in collaboration with Dior designer Kim Jones followed in 2021, and in 2022 he was picked up by mega-dealer Larry Gagosian, who has referred to him as “the future of portraiture”. His first solo UK show has just opened at Gagosian’s largest London outpost.View image in fullscreen‘This exhibition is a gentle reminder of what I want to do when I step away’ … Amoako Boafo.Photograph: Gus Sarkodee“For me, this exhibition is a gentle reminder of what I want to do when I step away,” says Boafo in the gallery, over the whirr of nearby construction work. The opening is three days away when we speak, and yet it’s still very much a work-in-progress, with paintings leaning against the walls and the courtyard of Boafo’s childhood home mid-recreation next door. Returning our gaze are the artist’s friends and family, as well as five of Boafo’s self-portraits – pedalling on an exercise bike, lounging in bed, embracing his young son. These are more self-portraits than he’s ever included in a single show. “I want to remind myself that I don’t always have to be out there, rushing around.”Born in 1984, Boafo grew up in Accra. His father was a fisher, and his mother cooked and cleaned. From a young age, he found art to be a respite: “Whenever I would sit and draw, I wouldn’t think about anything else; it was as if there were no problems.” He was as nifty with a racket as he was with a pencil, and believing that he might have a better shot at earning a living as a tennis player, he threw himself into the sport while studying art on the side. “I managed to convince myself that I was going to make money from tennis and that when I retired I could paint,” he says. But after four years at the Ghanatta College ofArtand Design he found he enjoyed painting more. I ask him if he still plays tennis, and he inches up the hem of his trousers to reveal a pair of Nike socks. “I don’t see anyone who’s 40 years old in this world beating me.”In 2014, Boafo moved with his partner to Vienna, where he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts. “At first I had all this space and time, and I didn’t know what do with it,” he says, comparing it with the more supervised teaching he was used to at home. Surrounded by white faces, he decided to focus solely on Black subjects. Poised between figuration and abstraction, his expressive portraits are at once rooted in tradition and wholly contemporary, borrowing from Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele as much as Toyin Ojih Odutola and Amy Sherald. What sets them apart is the technique that has become synonymous with his name: modelling the skin of his sitters with his fingertips.0View image in fullscreen‘It’s not like I paint one way and then have a different character’ … Amidst Tulips by Amoako Boafo, 2025.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates Ltd/© Amoako Boafo, Courtesy Gagosian“I mean, it’s not as beautiful as painting with a brush, but it allows me to be more playful,” he says, as we stand up and stroll around the room. “With fingerpainting you have no control, and I like the challenge. You can’t go over it – if you do, it’s kaput.” Up close the effect is mesmerising: ripples of bright blue and brown appear to pulse, blood-like, along his sitters’ limbs, lending them a sense of vitality that’s hard to shake. The poses are static, but contained within the smears and swirls of a single hand – even an ear – is a rhythmic movement, a fizzing energy.Some backdrops are plain, others patterned with the same wrapping-paper designs that appear on the sitters’ clothes. At first, Boafo used African fabrics, but the majority here came from Vienna. “I love fashion,” he says, in case I couldn’t tell from the cream-coloured baseball cap (also Dior), “and after a while I realised I could just make my own prints and dress someone the way I want them to look or according to how I feel and what I want to say.” Unusually for Boafo, he isn’t wearing anything patterned today, but his green overshirt and trainers echo the zingy palette of a large self-portrait featuring lush potted plants. “I like to look like my paintings,” he says. “It’s not like I paint one way and then have a different character. The way I live is the way I paint.”By now, the drilling has stopped, so we head next door to see how his childhood courtyard is coming along. Soon it will be hung with paintings, but at present it’s bare, an abstracted artefact made from charred wood – a nod to the fire on which Boafo’s mother cooked their meals growing up. Located at the heart of most traditional residences in Accra, the courtyard is a communal space where family and friends come together. “For me, it’s a space of knowledge and learning,” says Boafo, “a space where you get to see how people live.” Like his paintings, it’s a celebration of community.View image in fullscreenVitality that’s hard to shake … Shoulder Stand by Amoako Boafo, 2023.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates Ltd/© Amoako Boafo, Courtesy GagosianThe courtyard has been recreated by architect and designer Glenn DeRoché, who worked with Boafo on dot.ateliers | Ogbojo, the writers’ and curators’ residency programme he established on the edge of Accra in 2024. As the appreciation for African art continues to grow in the west, Boafo believes that what’s needed is more education back home. “There’s a lot of talent, but we still depend on the west to collect and to maintain it,” he says. “I think there should be more education on collecting, because once we have home-based collectors, careers can be more sustainable.”More residencies are cropping up, among them one Boafo and DeRoche are working on specifically for sculptors. Boafo also has plans for an art club – “a proper creative space where you come and just be inspired” – as well as a tennis academy and a football academy. But first, DeRoché needs to finish the court he’s building for Boafo, who wants to play more tennis. “I’m not stopping painting – I can’t,” he says. “I paint when I’m on holiday, I paint when I’m sick.Paintingis part of me.”Is he feeling the pressure that comes with being the so-called future of portraiture? He says it’s inevitable, but that to be in the position he’s in is a dream come true.“So, yeah, I will complain about the stress, but I can take it, I’m good.”Amoako Boafo: I Do Not Come to You by Chance is at Gagosian Grosvenor Hill, London, until 24 MayExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Has there been a role where you felt youtook a plungeout of your comfort zone?AliciaGrace1Getting to portray an American comes with inherent impostor syndrome, because so many other US actors could take the role. The roles I’ve played in the US have bigger distinctions from my lived experiences than some of my other roles. But it can be rewarding and fulfilling to do something that’s very different, so it works both ways.’71 wasone hell of a white-knuckle ridearound the backstreets of Belfast. Did you get that sense of urban claustrophobia when filming it?Aubrey26We didn’t actually film any of it in Belfast. I think it would be quite insensitive to shoot that type of story on the streets where, not so long ago, that ferocious, urban conflict was getting lived out for real. There’s no way you can pull that off without upsetting people. We shot a lot of it on the Derbyshire-Yorkshire border.Didthe ’71 screenwriter, Gregory Burke,draft the screenplay to fit your background,for example the line about Derby and Nottingham folk not getting on?InverclydediasporaYeah, dead on. Originally, my character was from Sheffield. I think the original line was people from Sheffield and Leeds not getting on, but those local rivalries are relevant over the whole country.View image in fullscreenMean streets … Jack O’Connell in ’71.Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/ShutterstockDid Michael Caine really yell: “Star of the future!” at you while filmingHarry Brown? And didAngelina Joliereally hire a helicopter for you to join a family dinner in Derby while filmingUnbroken?TurangaLeela2Michael Caine had me tied up to a chair, interrogating me. I had to spit in his face, which was massively daunting. I think it was doing that that caused him to come out with that. I’ve not forgotten it. It was totally mind-blowing for a 19-year-old to be working with someone like Michael Caine, a hugely important actor for young, working-class actors.We were doing prep for Unbroken. I had to lose quite a bit of weight [to play the Olympic runner Louis Zamperini], so I was hunkering down in a hotel in Ascot, dieting and learning my lines. Before we went off to shoot in Australia, Angelina wanted to meet my family, my nearest and dearest. We got together somewhere on the outskirts of Derby that was rural enough to land a helicopter. Everyone just buzzed off each other. My nana picked a moment during the meal to stand up to say a few words, in that way old-school nanas would, and I think that really stuck with her [Jolie].How did you prepare for your role inStarred Up?ExileCuChulainnJonathan Asser [the writer] was generous enough, once we’d been cast and rehearsed a few times, to step back and give us licence to invent stuff and bring new things to the fold. We filmed sequentially, so it was very organic. We shot it at this empty, crumbling Victorian jail in Belfast and had free rein there, apart from the odd guided tour. It can certainly be challenging when the subject matter is dark, because you’re dealing within trauma. It helps to equip yourself with as much information as possible to do justice to what you’re trying to portray.View image in fullscreenUnder starter’s orders … O’Connell as the Olympian Louis Zamperini in Unbroken.Photograph: Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarWhois your favourite character you’ve played?jessputnamI couldn’t possibly say. I’ve been very fortunate. I think it’s obvious what character people associate me with [Cook from Skins], but I don’t mind that – it’s a massive compliment. I think by the time we turned up [the second iteration of characters in season three], we knew we were on to something that felt culturally important. It amazes me that people still talk to me about it, 15 years on.You made your directorial debut last year,directing the video forPaul Weller’s Nothing.

It would be very odd to be in the shower wearing clothing. So I just assumed: I’ll be naked. You just crack on.

But Evie Hone and Mainie Jellett faced huge hostility. Now a thrilling new show is celebrating their brilliance – and determinationJoanna MoorheadThu 10 Apr 2025 07.20 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Apr 2025 07.27 EDTShareTwo oils on canvas hang together, strikingly similar, in the first room of the National Gallery of Ireland’s new show. Both titled Composition, they date from 1924 and 1925. They’re cubist still lifes, with the regular, geometric patterns and contrasting colour schemes favoured by many early 20th-century modernists,Marcel Duchampand Juan Gris among them.The paintings are clearly by the same hand. Except they’re not. The 1924 work, featuring what might be a fried egg, or might be an easel, is by Evie Hone; the piece from the following year, centred on a chessboard, is by her best friend, Mainie Jellett. These two women, virtually unknown outside their homeland, and not well-known even there, revolutionised art inIrelandby introducing modernism.In the deeply conservative country that it was at the time, that didn’t always meet a favourable response. And yet they soldiered on, buoyed up by one another across several decades, plying their craft, and turning their hands to different styles and art-forms.So the exhibition feels very eclectic. Here there’s cubism; there, abstraction; in the next room, we’re back to figuration. In another room landscapes, and elsewhere devotional religious art. Most are paintings, but one room is filled with the stained glass that Hone spent part of her career focusing on – she made commissions for public buildings and churches alike.View image in fullscreenThe single most significant modernist painting in Irish history … Mainie Jellett’s Decoration, 1923.Photograph: Photo © National Gallery of IrelandBut there is one element that unites almost all the 90 artworks in the exhibition, and it’s colour. Bright colours, primary colours; rich colours, strong colours; clashing colours, harmonious colours: they sing out of every room, and without knowing anything else about the women who put them together, they tell you that this pair believed in life and believed in art.They were both born in Dublin, into well-to-do middle class families. While they met for the first time in London during the first world war, this exhibition traces their story from the early 1920s, when they moved to Paris to train under André Lhote, and then Albert Gleizes, whose work exploring abstraction they very much admired. He didn’t take students, but the pair had made up their minds: he remained in touch with them all their lives, and much is made in the show of the importance of his influence on their work. It was a two-way street – Gleizes acknowledged the importance of Hone and Jellett on his own oeuvre – but art history in its inimitable way has remembered him, and airbrushed them out.For now, though, they’re back. The quality of the art is as eclectic as the styles. The standout piece is Jellett’s Decoration (1923): fantastically well composed, immensely pleasing, this piece pays homage to the work of the Renaissance artists whose work both women adored (they knew it mostly through reproductions), painted in tempera on wood with gold leaf to reference that period of art history. But it’s more than a homage: it’s a marrying together of old and new, a gorgeous abstract depiction of the ages-old Madonna and Child, contained within the shape of a Trecento altarpiece, with a pointillist background.Sheer genius, and considered today to be the single most significant modernist painting in Irish history, it went down like a ton of bricks: writer George “AE” Russell made the astonishing remark that there was nothing much to say about it. The following year, 1924, Jellett and Hone had a joint show – the current show in Dublin is only the second time their work has been shown together – which was met, again, with much criticism.The Irish Times used the phrase “freak pictures” in a review, and Russell again had a field day, referring to their work as “artistic malaria”. It all weighed heavily on them both, so much so that it was almost certainly a factor in Hone’s decision to enter an Anglican convent in Cornwall in 1925, much to the horror of Jellett, who was left alone trying to convince the Irish art world of the importance of modernism.View image in fullscreenMagnificent … Evie Hone’s east window at Eton College chapel.Photograph: © Geraldine Hone, Kate Hone and the FNCI. Photo, National Gallery of IrelandHappily Hone’s life as a nun was short-lived, and just over a year later Jellett went to retrieve her and return her to her primary vocation as an artist. But religion remained a central theme, for Hone – who later in her life became a Catholic – and also for Jellett, whose other works shown here include a striking Deposition (1939) and an intense crucifixion titled The Ninth Hour (1941).Hone, though, would mostly pour her religious feelings into her stained glass, using her cubist training and love of strong colour to great effect in a series of windows including one often-seen on Irish TV, My Four Green Fields, as it’s installed in the Department of the Taoiseach (having been made originally for the 1939 New York World’s Fair) providing a backdrop to many a government statement. The window, bringing the symbols of Ireland’s four provinces – Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht – together, was one of her greatest triumphs.But an even more magnificent example of her stained glass is in England, and sadly behind closed doors (excepting occasional public tours of the college). It’s a huge (almost 1,300 sq ft) window in Eton College chapel, and it was commissioned to replace a window destroyed by bombing during the second world war. The window, showing the Last Supper in the lower section and the crucifixion above, is regarded as one of Britain’s finest 20th-century examples of stained glass. In Dublin we get only a glimpse of its splendour via a watercolour study Hone made in 1950.View image in fullscreenEvie Hone’s Snow at Marlay.Photograph: © Geraldine Hone, Kate Hone and the FNCI. Photo, National Gallery of IrelandBy then, Jellett had died, aged 46, of cancer. Hone visited her in the nursing home on her last night. Neither woman had ever married; and while there is no suggestion they were a couple, they clearly filled a role that might be called a partnership in each other’s lives. Jellett had spent her final years much influenced by Chinese art, after a visit to an exhibition at London’s Royal Academy. Hone, despite the legacy of childhood polio which affected her throughout her life, continued to travel in France and Italy – as works here attest – and painted the woods and landscape around her home in Marlay in the Dublin hills.By the end of their careers, the women – whose work had been so similar in the early days – had each found her own style, with Hone’s intuitive, freer approach contrasting with Jellett’s much more precise attention to detail. Convergence, divergence and a friendship that brought the stirrings of the great changes in Ireland that continue to play out to this day.Mainie Jellett and Evie Hone: The Art of Friendship is at theNational Gallery of Ireland, Dublin, from 10 April to 10 AugustExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingIrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a ‘swan song’, he says – for his series but also the industry as a wholeSasha MistlinThu 10 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTShareAs the longtime editor of Taschen’s All-American Ads book series, cultural historian Jim Heimann has helped chronicle the shifting landscape of commercial artistry through each decade of the 20th century. Now, with a final volume dedicated to the 2000s, Heimann has completed what he calls a “swan song” – not just for the series, but for an entire era of advertising. It presents the last moment before social media and the decline of print media transformed the industry for ever.The 2000s were fraught with social, political and cultural disruptions. Chief among them were the September 11 terrorist attacks, which sparked a dramatic wave of national trauma that simultaneously drove the advertising industry to embrace patriotism while seeking escapism. Brands such as Budweiser, with its iconicClydesdale tribute– which sees a team of horses pulling a beer wagon to New York before bowing their heads towards the Manhattan skyline – channelled unity, while luxury brands offered distraction through aspirational messaging.“It was a transitional period,” says Heimann. “There were not these huge changes that you would see from the 30s to the 40s, and the 40s to the 50s, in terms of things like fashion and cars.” Instead the 2000s was notable for the prevalence of nostalgia, with many campaigns harking back to previous eras of American dominance.The main innovations in the sector came from tech companies, who had an unparalleled ability to harness the tide of economic optimism and hire the best ad execs. Among the most influential campaigns of the era were Apple’ssilhouetteiPod advertisements. With striking imagery of black shapes dancing against vibrant backgrounds, the campaign looked beyond traditional selling points – such as product features and price – to sell a new way of living. “Their campaigns reflect that sophistication,” Heimann says. He compares this approach in the 2000s to Apple’s famous 1984 campaign, which featured a flagship Ridley Scott-directed Super Bowl ad: “From an advertising point of view, it wasn’t so much print as much as the television and video. That’s where it really struck its core.”Despite technological evolution, certain advertising constants remained and arguably reached their apotheosis in the period. “The one thing that never seems to change is sex,” Heimann observes. “Sex sells, women sell and, in the last 40 years, exploiting women has been a consistent way to go.” The book features numerous examples of this, including controversial Calvin Klein campaigns and provocative alcohol advertisements such as the one for Skyy Blue vodka, where the viewer looks through a woman’s legs at the product.You want to know: who was in the meetings, who gave the green light to go with some of this stuff?Jim HeimannCelebrity endorsements also reached new heights, becoming central to marketing strategies. “Look at who’s endorsing fragrances,” Heimann says. “David Beckham, Paris Hilton. You go down the line – everybody jumped on that bandwagon.” In this case,everybodyincludes a bronzed, smiling Donald Trump, pictured in the book posing with his new wife Melania in an ad for Donald Trump the fragrance. In many ways, the era’s biggest campaigns prefigure the rise of influencer marketing. As traditional media fragmented, brands increasingly relied on familiar faces to cut through the noise, transforming celebrities from mere endorsers into brand architects whose personal mythology became inseparable from the products.The rise of environmental consciousness also created intriguing contradictions in advertising. Innovations such as the Toyota Prius promised eco-friendly cars, while Hummer advertisements celebrated gas-guzzling excess. “Those are the kind of contrasts you look for,” Heimann notes. “In one section you have the environment being concerned, and then the next section you’ve got these giant gas-eating monsters.”The true significance of the 2000s in advertising history may be its position at the precipice of fundamental change. “Where is advertising going?” says Heimann. “Well, we know where it’s gone, and it’s not print … with online and influencers, and now AI, who knows what advertising is going to be? You don’t even need a human any more. You don’t need advertising agencies. You don’t even know whether it’s real!”As well as celebrated ads, the book features a number that missed their mark, including one perplexing ad for Axe Dry deodorant, which features the surely unprecedented scene of a model holding a glass of wine in one hand, while the other is wrapped around her partner, a stubby, mutated foot with a “vaguely vaginal hairy armpit for a face”. “You want to know who was in that meeting”, says Heimann. “Who gave the green light to go with some of this stuff!”For Heimann, the book serves as both celebration and epitaph for an era when advertising retained its quality: “It’s depressing but the 2000s were the final time where real people made real campaigns. And for better and for worse, you know, it’s in this book.”All-American Ads 2000s,published by Taschen, is out now.You’ve been ad: six noteworthy campaignsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: TaschenOmega, 2006James Bond has long been a staple of high-end advertising, with many campaigns employing a retrofuturist vision of the 60s. This ad appeared when Daniel Craig began playing the iconic spy and tied in with the film’s return to a rugged, masculine aesthetic after the Pierce Brosnan era had leaned heavily on gadget wizardry.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: TaschenHummer, 2002This Hummer advertisement embodies the conflict between environmentalism and masculinity perfectly. The comically large SUVs, popularised in the US by Arnold Schwarzenegger, had become symbolic of an era where bigger meant better, a mentality that was beginning to face cultural scrutiny as the decade progressed.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: TaschenConservation International, 2008In the 2000s, NGOs and public bodies used advertising techniques to appeal for a less consumerist culture. Conservation International were criticised for their work with companies such as BP and Exxon, with Heimann remarking that it became important for the industry to rehabilitate its public image.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: TaschenEvian, 2000The “Evian mermaid” ad featured a very artistic concept that was highly unusual at the time for such a quotidian product. The ad was notable enough that it likely inspired a scene in the movie Zoolander (2001), in which the title character plays a “merman” for a beauty campaign, to the chagrin of his friends and family.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: TaschenSKYY vodka, 2002While sexually explicit imagery has long been a feature of advertising, the 2000s is particularly notable for evincing a sort of hypersexuality that frequently bordered on the comic. “Flicking through the magazines you see sexuality being expressed in all kinds of weird situations,” says Heimann. “I thought there was something zeitgeisty as well as graphically interesting about the stilettos being featured as prominently as the product.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: TaschenEarth Day 2009Earth Day, an annual environmental event, produced this image to promote its day of activism in 2009.

However, Thursday’s measure comes as a significant blow to western studios, with Bloomberg reporting shares of Walt Disney Co, Paramount Global, and Warner Bros Discovery Inc all suffering an immediate decline.Last week, the newly releasedA Minecraft Moviefrom Warner Bros topped the Chinese box office with ticket sales of $14.5m – around 10% of the global total. In 2024, the highest-grossing US film released in China was Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which took $132m in that territory, towards a global total of $572m.The first US film was approved for Chinese release 31 years ago, with the number peaking at more than 60 in 2018. Since then it has declined, according to data from the Chinese ticketing service Maoyan Entertainment, thanks to escalating tensions and the increased popularity of homegrown movies.Animated fantasy filmNe Zha 2, about a child battling monsters from Chinese mythology, was released in late January and has now taken $1.8bn in China, and $20m in the US.Its huge domestic success made it the highest-grossing film both of 2025 so far and in a singlebox office territory, as well as the highest-grossing animated film in history and the first animated film in history to cross $2bn globally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While historical library catalogues attribute the skin to either boar or deer, the distribution of the hair follicles does not match either animal. Researchers therefore conducted protein and DNA analysis on the covers, which revealed that harbour seals, a harp seal and a bearded seal were used to make them.The use of sealskin for manuscript covers was common in Scandinavian countries and in Ireland. However, its use in France was “surprising” to researchers because of the inland location of the monasteries and the lack of evidence of seal populations on the French coast in the middle ages.“I was like, ‘that’s not possible. There must be a mistake,’” said Élodie Lévêque, of Panthéon-Sorbonne University in Paris, on finding out that the samples had come back from testing as sealskin. “I sent it again, and it of course came back as sealskin again.”There is no written record of the purchase of sealskin at Clairvaux Abbey. However, the monasteries may have had access to sealskin because they were located near Norse trading routes, said researchers.The findings support the “notion of a robust medieval trade network that went well beyond local sourcing, linking the Cistercians to wider economic circuits that included fur trade with the Norse.”Norse settlers arrived in Greenland in the 10th century, remaining until the 13th century, and traded walrus ivory and fur with northernEurope.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The brown colouration seen today is likely due to degradation over time. The monks may not have known that they were using sealskin at the time, as seals were rarely depicted in medieval art.“In the middle ages, seal exploitation was common in northern Europe and persists in all Arctic cultures today,” said researchers. They were hunted for their meat as a food source, their blubber for heating, and their skin to make clothing including gloves, boots and coats.Explore more on these topicsBooksEuropeHistory booksnewsShareReuse this content"

British TV executives are now hoping it can bring some of that lustre across the Atlantic in a deal to bring the show to the UK for the first time.After numerous failed attempts to recreate the late-night comedy format that has proved so successful in the US,Skyhas announced it is making a British version of the show to premiere next year. Crucially, the show’s original creator and champion, Lorne Michaels, will be an executive producer.Saturday Night Live: Jack Black returns for a stellar episodeRead moreThe broadcaster is already promising a “star-studded lineup of hosts”, adding that it will be filmed in London. It is also promising to stay true to the US show’s “live, fast-paced style” – which has included comedy sketches, a roster of comic presenters and musical guests – with a cast list of “the funniest British comedians around”.It will no doubt be a draw for leading comedians in the UK, as the US original has launched the careers of comedy royalty including Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell and Mike Myers.Sky’s chief content officer, Cécile Frot-Coutaz, said: “For over 50 years Saturday Night Live has held a unique position in TV and in our collective culture, reflecting and creating the global conversation all under the masterful comedic guidance of Lorne Michaels. The show has discovered and nurtured countless comedy and musical talents over the years and we are thrilled to be partnering with Lorne and the SNL team to bring an all-British version of the show.”The move is also a gamble by Sky, given the number of previous attempts to recreate a live, late-night comedy show concentrating on topical issues. While the UK has had a number of hit comedy panel shows, such as Have I Got News for You, the live sketch-style programme has not endured in the same way.In the 1980s, Saturday Live was launched and similarly featured rising and established talent, including Ben Elton, Harry Enfield, Stephen Fry, Tracey Ullman, Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall. It was moved to Friday nights for its third series before being cancelled. It was briefly revived in 1996, hosted by Lee Hurst.Channel 4 launched Saturday Zoo in the early 1990s, featuring comedy and celebrity interviews. It ran for just 13 episodes. Channel 4’s The 11 O’Clock Show also worked with up-and-coming comedians and boosted the careers of Ricky Gervais, Sacha Baron Cohen and Jimmy Carr.Brian Logan, the Guardian’s comedy critic, said there was a “strange alchemy” in the early successes of SNL in the US that had made it self-sustaining. “They’re quite different comedy cultures,” he said. “It’s not just SNL that has been tried here, but also late-night talkshows and comedy shows.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So there is clearly something going on whereby these things don’t always transfer. But if the SNL team are involved in this one, it stands a better chance than some.”Others in the TV industry say the format’s mixed success in the UK comes down to money. In the US, the show’s backers are able to pay and retain top comedy talent. But shows in the UK, made on far lower budgets, often lose their star performers to more lucrative ventures.Explore more on these topicsSaturday Night LiveSkyTelevision industryTV comedyUS television industryUS televisionComedynewsShareReuse this content"

Originally based on James Leo Herlihy’s novel, it is a bromance of suffering, of sorts, between a small-time con-artist nicknamed Ratso, and a former Texan dishwasher who re-invents himself as a sex worker. Neither makes it big in the Big Apple and it ends bleakly, although the multi Oscar-winning film starring Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman has the patina of a buddy movie.Paul Jacob French, as Joe, captures the same wide-eyed optimism as Voight’s self-made cowboy who heads east to make his fortune. Max Bowden, as Ratso, is less characterful and the friendship here does not fully come to life, although you feel the desperation as Ratso sinks into ill health and Joe scratches around for the money that might save them both.The production, directed by Nick Winston with a book by Bryony Lavery, has a polished, hallucinatory look and Andrew Exeter’s expressionistic set shines. It is monochrome and imaginative, taking the story out of its period setting, and re-configuring it in a psychological space.

A few songs fly, such as Don’t Give Up on Me Now and Blue Is the Colour, but most feel wordy and generic.Not every voice is strong enough either; some numbers sound thin or dissonant, and it is hard to pinpoint whether this is the song itself or the voice singing it. At least there is Tori Allen-Martin, who is a highlight as multiple characters, including Cass – a rich New Yorker who becomes Joe’s first, unsuccessful, customer. The sexualised humour of the film is queasily caught in her song, Whatever It Is You’re Doing, sung while in the throes of sex.‘I was too busy to sleep with millions of people’: ex-boybander Eg White on penning bangers for Adele, Duffy – and a builderRead moreThe film, released in 1969, earned an X-rating for its portrait of furtive male homosexuality. Here, graphic sex scenes capture guilt, shame and desperation, with the violence at the end still shocking.The pace of the production is choppy and it feels too long overall but it presents an unvarnished portrait of an urban underclass that still resonates.Midnight Cowboy is atSouthwark Playhouse Elephant, London, until 17 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMusicalsJohn SchlesingerreviewsShareReuse this content"

While the shoot ended back in March last year, there must have been points during the post-production process when those involved wondered if their film – a rousing story of a Black female president taking charge – would coincide with a similar, albeit less schlocky, real-world victory.Sinners review – Ryan Coogler’s deep-south gonzo horror down at the crossroadsRead moreIt wasn’t to be, and instead the film has landed on Amazon at a far less inspiring time for the US, when a president has decided to destroy rather than save his country. Any links to be made from fiction to fact push Trump’s agenda closer to that of the bad guys, who aim to tank the global economy and stop a perceived US overspend of foreign aid. While there are moments that might unintentionally insist we make the connection (lead villain expressing glee at a horribly familiar red stock market arrow), G20 isn’t trying to be The Political Film We Need Right Now, its makers smartly picking brawn over brain.One might be fooled into thinking that might not be the case, however, with a glance toward the film’s choice of lead, the EGOT-winning actorViola Davis. Since she graduated from bit-part player to Oscar winner, Davis has had the odd flirtation with genre (supporting roles in the DC and Hunger Games franchises) but has mostly stuck with drama, a decorated stage actor who gives a stirring monologue like no other. Yet in G20, she’s letting her fists do the talking, a fun diversion for an actor who often hasn’t had the meaty roles many of us believe she has deserved (this is only her third lead since winning an Oscar for Fences in 2017).She’s a smart choice to play Danielle Sutton, a president with military experience, as she has both the commanding regality of a leader (she did, after all, play one in The Woman King) and the imposing physicality of a fighter (she has retained her well-trained physique from that movie). She’s forced to rely more on the latter after a G20 summit in South Africa descends into chaos when terrorists take over. She’d hoped to use the conference to help further her noble agenda to help many in the poorer regions of Africa gain better access to digital banking capabilities, but her antagonist, played by The Boys baddie Antony Starr, has a different idea. He hopes to stoke fear by hijacking her plan using deepfake tech to convince people across the world that this is in fact a cover for world leaders to gain control over the finances of less capable countries.He hopes to use this distrust to destroy existing currencies and persuade others to use crypto instead (very easy to root against a guy who is super into blockchain!), which will divert all of the money to him. With her heels replaced by flats and a gun in hand, Sutton is determined to save her family, the economy and the world – order to be determined.Contemporary buzzwords aside, G20 works off a blueprint perfected in the 80s and popular in the 90s, a decade that saw its own president-v-terrorists actioner in Air Force One. There’s nothing quite as sleekly entertaining here but there are low-grade pleasures to be had in the moment before they’re forgotten about soon after. Davis provides Jack Ryan director Patricia Riggen with safer hands than we’re used to in a streaming mockbuster such as this, although sometimes the film could benefit from more talk and less action. There are moments in the last act where she’s allowed to verbally spar with Starr, as they bark their agendas at each other, that have a crackle that’s missing from much of the more mechanical film. It’s pacey but also a little rushed, especially in the development of her integral relationship with a rebellious daughter, a payoff that loses some of its power at the end. The script, credited to four people including White Boy Rick scribes Logan and Noah Miller, isn’t funny or smart enough to elevate this in the way that Davis easily can and it’s hard not to wonder what a sharper writer could have done with this setup.The action is serviceable enough, enjoyment based less on deftly staged choreography and more on the catharsis offered to Davis, as president and actor (she has spoken in recent press about the pleasure and freedom the role has provided). The thrill it offers to her doesn’t always make its way to us but there are worse ways to spend a Sunday afternoon, watching a hyper-competent president save the economy and bring down a tech bro.

Narrow townhouses, public swimming pools, leafy pockets of nature and Melbourne’s famous trams form the terrain of Jenny’s life, with these locales doubling as cosy spaces for gathering and sites of trauma. Often cast in shadow or sketched in impressionistic pencil, they seem to echo the protagonist’s tumultuous interior world.Ang, adroit at dialogue, gives Jenny and her loved ones lengthy conversations in which they banter about aviral cow(“the Yao Ming of cattle”), commiserate over shit jobs and attempt to move past old wounds. Yet even with those closest to her, Jenny rarely digs into the heart of matter, instead talking around her true feelings. In the electrifying opening story, Hunger, she and her burgeoning crush sensitively debate the morality of his “feeding fetish” – only for Jenny’s feelings to be sidelined when they begin a relationship. In subsequent stories, Jenny avoids talking about her own problems while her ex-lovers vent, or she lies about her troubles at work.Jenny’s crises of communication are evoked with blank speech bubbles that alternately swarm her uncertain face, shatter like plates or twist into noodles. Ang is a master at capturing these infinitesimal moments, where a character flinches, feels frozen, or is flooded with self-disgust.View image in fullscreenA page from I Ate the Whole World to Find You by Rachel Ang.Illustration: Rachel Ang/ScribeMuch of the pleasure of reading this book is witnessing Ang’s experiments in form, which often function as a cathartic release. In the novel’s fantastical centrepiece, The Passenger, Jenny’s railway day trip with her ex and his wannabe-life-coach girlfriend is derailed by a train crash – vaulting them into a hallucinogenic dreamscape. The polymorphic wackiness of this chapter showcases the absurdity of our social platitudes and Ang’s darkly comic voice. During an uncomfortable conversation in which Jenny’s ex criticises her while his girlfriend shoots off pop psychology aphorisms (“The power to change is within you!”) the three characters transform into different cartoon forms, including chess pieces, dogs, and Aardman trio Wallace, Gromit and villainous penguin Feathers McGraw (of course, Jenny feels like Wallace, the dog who cannot speak).Through this artistic flexibility, Ang leans into the fresh possibilities of the graphic novel: creating surreal dimensions where truth can be fully unleashed, memories painfully accessed and alternative paths can be embraced.View image in fullscreenA page from I Ate the Whole World to Find You by Rachel Ang.Illustration: Rachel Ang/ScribeIn Ang’s comic for the Washington Post,Age of Autobiography, they write of “the manifold self” that is “molded by those around [you] – other selves, lives, impulses, now sent through the screen”, and ponder the nebulous concept of “inner self”:“Does it need to be seen to be seen and recognised? Can I live an emotionally honest life without sharing it with others?”I Ate the Whole World to Find You appears to be a continuation of this exploration. Ang’s shifting, distorted depictions of Jenny’s physicality are a visceral expression of her incoherent self-understanding – whether it’s a carefully placed panel where Jenny is drawn with a doubling effect, or a splash page in which the detail is suddenly stripped from her face (as in the story Swimsuit, at the exact moment when Jenny witnesses a racist attack at a swimming pool). Ang’s wide-eyed, scratchy faces are often drawn very similarly; while this was initially confusing, it ultimately added to the experience, with the collection’s recurrent imagery building into a universal tapestry of fragmented identity.It’s fitting that the cosmically themed final story, Purity, follows Jenny as she shares her body with another life, one that is wholly new: her baby. This chapter features the most rendered illustrations and fluid linework, as Jenny is able to “jettison the old, broken codes” of communication. While her conversations with her partner break down, she can speak privately to the “co-pilot” inside her, with her fears existing alongside hope. In this lovely coda, the barrier between two beings is simply a translucent veil, one that will eventually part.I Ate the Whole World to Find You is a confronting expression of the desire to connect. In a world where it feels like speech bubbles distort and shatter as soon as they leave our mouths, Ang’s speculative vision of transcending language, and finally being understood, is potent and unforgettable.I Ate the Whole World to Find You by Rachel Angis out through Scribe ($39.99)Explore more on these topicsComics and graphic novelsAustralian book reviewsAustralian booksreviewsShareReuse this content"

Naomi Denny’s tender three-hander navigates the rocky aftermath of death, in the tricky period where you don’t know what you’re meant to feel, and no one around you knows what to say. Handled with care by director Lucy Jane Atkinson, All the Happy Things is a quiet, sweet and simply told story of two sisters, one learning how to keep going without the other.Playwright Denny also leads the narrative as Sienna, a high achiever who would disapprove of being described primarily in relation to her dead sister, Emily (LJ Johnson, playful and loose-limbed), though the two are inseparable in this story. A year on from Emily’s accident, Sienna is still seeing her everywhere. So all-consuming is her goofy, sometimes grumpy sister’s presence that Emily repeatedly speaks over others and distracts Sienna,Ghosts-style, from her job and relationship.Denny and Johnson have an easy rapport, one moment bickering and sniping at each other, the next dancing in unison as they always used to do. Dejon Mullings is the final part of our trio, playing Sienna’s boyfriend Sam, a model partner in the face of loss. He is gentle when Sienna snaps at him, soft when she needs to be held, and understanding when she pushes away his efforts to help her wade through the grief that she insists isn’t overwhelming her, even as her movements become skittish and strained.View image in fullscreenA model partner in the face of loss … Naomi Denny and Dejon Mullings.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe play’s reflections on grief are hardly new, but the familiar conversations are performed with humour and affection. Warmth pushes through, even as Eamonn O’Dwyer’s sound design jolts us back to the reality of loss. Where the script sings is in the small detail of the sisters’ relationship. The moment we realise the limitations of Emily’s visitations is painful; she can’t remind Sienna of her favourite song because if Sienna doesn’t know it, this figment of Emily doesn’t either.Denny throws Sienna little life buoys in the form of new knowledge about her sister. It is a unique joy to learn something fresh about someone who has died: from an object they’ve hidden; a card they’ve written; something silly they used to do that you’re hearing about for the first time. These new memories are finite. By weaving them throughout Sienna and Emily’s story, Denny illuminates just how precious they are.All the Happy Things is atSoho theatre, London, until 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreSoho theatreBlack British culturereviewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, the best known of his three piano quartets is the first in G minor, largely because it is often heard in the masterly orchestral version of it that Schoenberg made in the 1930s.View image in fullscreenBrahms Piano Quartets Nos 2 and No 3Zimerman and his colleagues, violinist Maria Nowak, viola player Katarzyna Budnik and cellist Yuya Okamoto, focus on the other two quartets, with playing of unforced democratic refinement. There’s never any sense of these pieces being turned into vehicles for a star pianist, even one of Zimerman’s stellar reputation; whether leading off the furious scherzo of the C minor quartet Op 60 or providing the running backdrop as the violinist presents the lyrical main theme in the finale of the same work, Zimerman is very much a team player in every sense. This is high-class chamber music in every respect.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

The new run has two outstanding things going for it, in the shape ofMark Elder’s conducting andAigul Akhmetshina’s return to the title role. But there is plenty of vigorous underpinning elsewhere, particularly in the energy of its largely youthful cast.DamianoMichieletto’s 2024 production, revived here under Dan Dooner, is an improvement on Barrie Kosky’s bold but ill-judged 2018 effort to purge Carmen of almost all of its Spanishness. Michieletto’s modern-day Spain, however, is a flyblown place, with not a cathedral or a bullring in sight, and none of the horses of even earlier productions here either – this is a place where life is fierce, lawless and precarious.Some minor things jar. There is too much aimless milling in crowd scenes. A non-speaking actor haunts the production in mourning black, presumably Don José’s mother, adding little. A gaggle of kids, disturbingly violent in act one, then do a series of cutesy turns while the curtain is lowered for scene changes.But these do little to lower the impact.Akhmetshina, in particular, is one of the best Covent Garden Carmens in decades, bright voiced but a true mezzo, untroubled by Carmen’s often low-lying vocal line, looking and inhabiting the part, and carrying off her many famous numbers with panache.View image in fullscreenRapt urgency … Yaritza Véliz as Micaëla and Freddie De Tommaso as Don José.Photograph: Marc BrennerShe is not quite matched byFreddie De Tommaso’s more stolid and repressed José. The tenor doesn’t capture José’s naive allure in the early scenes but he impressed increasingly in the Flower song, and was on vocal home ground in the dark impassioned fervour of Bizet’s remarkable closing scene.Yaritza Véliz, like Akhmetshina, an alumna of the Royal Opera’s Jette Parker Artists Programme with a now blossoming career of her own, brought rapt urgency to Micaëla’s vain pleadings with José. Marianna Hovanisyan and Ryan Vaughan Davies led the smugglers’ crisp exchanges and Jamie Woollard added a fine streak of cynicism as José’s superior officer Zuniga.On the podium, Elder found breadth and seriousness as well as colour and atmosphere in Bizet’s score. Quicker scenes tripped along, with phrasing sharply pointed. But Elder has spent enough years in the opera pit to also know when to slow down and give his singers space. TheRoyal Opera Houseorchestra played beautifully for him, none more so than the flute solo at the start of act three.AtRoyal Opera House, London, until 3 July.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

The Royal Exchange’s new production is the third major revival of Mike Leigh’s play in less than 12 months, after outings withTheatre Royal Stratford EastandEnglish Touring Theatre.Natalie Abrahami’s version relocates the play to Manchester, though this could be a middle-class cul-de-sac anywhere.View image in fullscreenInnocence and uneasiness … Yasmin Taheri as Angela, and Tupele Dorgu as Susan in Abigail’s Party.Photograph: Johan PerssonLeigh’s tale of suburban boredom and aspiration transports easily, speaking to a whole generation of striving consumers. At its heart is domineering hostess Beverly, played with a loose-limbed, tipsy energy by Kym Marsh. Forcing drinks and nibbles on her guests, she’s forever on the verge of swaying – either to the music or from one too many gin and tonics – but beneath this there are occasional glints of something harder.The main target of her barbs is estate agent husband Laurence (Graeme Hawley, almost vibrating with contained frustration), while new neighbours Angela (played with both innocence and grit by Yasmin Taheri) and Tony (a taciturn Kyle Rowe) are on the receiving end of her bullying hospitality. The party is completed by Tupele Dorgu’s brilliantly uneasy Susan, mother of the eponymous Abigail, whose understated horror is written all over her face.Putting Beverly and Laurence’s home on theRoyal Exchangestage compresses it, creating an even tighter pressure cooker. Surrounded by the audience, there’s no escape for these party guests. The sparingly used revolve evokes the booze-fuelled wooziness of the evening and heightens the climactic drama, lending a growing queasiness to Peter Butler’s design of oranges, browns and yellows.It remains a play that feels very much of its time, but Abrahami and her cast bring subtle shades of light and dark to these well-worn characters, underlining the sadness as well as the comedy of Leigh’s suburbia.Abigail’s Party is at theRoyal Exchange theatre, Manchester, until 24 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal ExchangeMike LeighreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ridley plays Annette, whose daughter Matilda (Hiba Ahmed) wins a role in a movie. However, it’s her writer spouse Ben (Shazad Latif) who gets to chaperone the child on location – and lust after its Italian star – while Annette is stuck at home with their new baby. Latif is on point as a self-entitled, sexist fool, while Ridley is mesmeric and edgy as the vengeful Annette.Simon WardellFantastic Planet (René Laloux, 1973), 10.45pm, Sky ArtsView image in fullscreenFar out … Fantastic PlanetPhotograph: Courtesy of the Criterion CollectionA product of the hippy era in the same vein as Yellow Submarine, French director René Laloux’s extremely trippy 1973 cartoon feature follows the Draags, blue-skinned, red-eyed inhabitants of the planet Ygam. They have taken humans, who are tinier than them, from Earth to use as pets – but the “Oms” have escaped and now constitute a wild population to be controlled and culled. An allegory of our treatment of animals, the film’s principal pleasures come from the weird and wonderful flora, fauna and far-out fashions on display, rendered in exquisite cutout animation.SWRadical (Christopher Zalla, 2023), 11.40pm, Film4View image in fullscreenUnconventional methods … Eugenio Derbez in Radical.Christopher Zalla’s “inspirational teacher” drama leaves the likes of Dead Poets Society in the dust – not least because it’s set in a Mexican border town mired in poverty, corruption and gang violence. Eugenio Derbez is Sergio Juárez, who takes over a sixth-grade class at an institution nicknamed Punishment School. The kids are nonplussed by his unconventional methods – as is the head – but they quickly become engaged and reveal their hidden potential. Based on a true story, the film’s setting guarantees heartbreak as harsh realities intrude on them all.SWLive sportGolf: The Masters,2pm, Sky Sports Main EventRound one of the Augusta major.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a scene as authentically Vietnamese as I could expect to find. But I am not in Vietnam or even Asia. I am in Prague.Sapa, or Little Hanoi as it is affectionately known, is the hub of the Czech Republic capital’s Vietnamese community, and is a far cry from the spires, dumplings and beer-sploshed splendour of the historical centre. Tucked inconspicuously on its outskirts, this city within a city is where the nation’s Vietnamese people come to stock up on spices, eat plates ofbun chaor sell inordinate amounts of large, fluffy geese.The fact that there is a Vietnamese community in Prague may come as a surprise to anyone who’s visited. Unless you popped into a corner shop –potraviny– for some late-night crisps, or accidentally stumbled into one of their cheap clothing boutiques, it’s unlikely your paths will have crossed. But after Ukrainians and Slovaks, the Vietnamese are the biggest minority group in the country.View image in fullscreenThe pagoda-style entrance to Sapa, Prague.Photograph: peterforsberg/Alamy“It all happened during communism,” says Khanh Ta, who – along with his brother Giang – owns four Vietnamese restaurants in Prague. “An agreement between the Vietnamese and Czech governments meant that talented students from Vietnam were given the opportunity to study here and then later work. My parents came in the 1980s from Phu Tho, a small town 40 miles (70km) from Hanoi, and then got jobs working in the textile industry.”It wasn’t just the Vietnamese who were invited through such a scheme; students from Mongolia, Laos and Cuba also came. However, after the Velvet Revolution in November 1989, which spelled the end of communism in Czechoslovakia, it was only really the Vietnamese who stayed. “Very simply, there was a better life here,” Ta says.You’d assume that with such a long-rooted presence, Vietnamese food would have been a Czech staple for decades. But when I arrived in Prague 15 years ago, there were no notable Vietnamese restaurants to speak of, and the Vietnamese people who did own restaurants were serving Chinese food.Sapa, or Little Hanoi, is the hub of Prague’s Vietnamese community, and is a far cry from the dumplings and beer-sploshed splendour of the historical centre“The Vietnamese simply didn’t think of selling their food,” says Trinh Thi Duan, owner of the hugely popularPho U Letnérestaurant in Prague 7. “The Chinese were here before us and Vietnamese food was unknown to Czech people. It just seemed far easier to sell Chinese food because the Czechs were used to it.”This all changed just over a decade ago, when Prague’s first Vietnamese restaurant,Pho Vietnam, opened in Vinohrady, with other restaurants such as Pho U Letné tentatively following suit. So what made this sudden change happen?Trinh hands me a plate of her acclaimedbun bo nam bo(€8),and says:“As more Vietnamese people kept arriving in the Czech Republic, Czechs started travelling in turn to Vietnam. They tried our food there and told us how good it was. So the Vietnamese people decided to try to sell their own food in Prague, and it just caught on.”This is an understatement. Despite a tepid first few months in which the restaurants struggled to attract sceptical locals, there was a sudden surge around 2015. Just through word of mouth alone, Prague residents – aided by a rise in foreigners seeking non-stodgy alternatives – began flocking to the city’s Vietnamese establishments in droves, prompting Trinh to move to larger premises and the Ta brothers to open other restaurants.View image in fullscreenA gourmet twist on a banh cuon at Taro in Prague.Photograph: Vojtech Tesarek“Vietnamese cuisine is a simple cuisine and although there are so many flavours, it’s never overpowering,” Khanh Ta says, introducing me to his latest outlet,Taro, a high-end concept restaurant in the city centre. “Here we take food that we like from our childhood but we make it a little bit different. Not too different, though, because the feeling from the food should always be the same.”By way of demonstration, he hands me a trio of Vietnamese amuse-bouches – crab basket, cauliflower croquette and aquaypuff pastry with steak tartare, all with clearly authentic Vietnamese roots but given a stylised gourmet twist. Thebanh cuonthat follows is similarly constructed: rice pancakes made with a specially imported machine from Hanoi, but served with succulent cubes of pork knee, a meaty treat more common on a Czech menu.The entire meal – an impressive seven-course tasting menu (€105)– is delectable, and when he serves the green rice ice-cream –kem– out of a polystyrene box like the one used by bike tenders in his grandparents’ home town, you can’t help feeling that you have, in fact, experienced a taste of his childhood.View image in fullscreenA bowl of pho.Photograph: Lucie MuškováThe most authentic place of all to experience Vietnamese cuisine and culture in Prague, however, is undoubtedly Sapa. Located in Libuš (take tram 17 from the centre, or bus 197 from Smíchovské nádraží), this is the mecca of all things Vietnamese. Once through the pagoda-style entrance, you’re thrown into a chaotic labyrinth of alleyways, wholesalers and market stalls selling all kinds of knick-knacks, clothes and fluffy toys. It is not designed for tourists – as the “No photography” signs and the brusque manner of some vendors attest – but if you dive deep into Sapa’s frenzied heart, you will be richly rewarded.The golf-themedHippo Café, for example, is a good spot for coffee – their robusta beans imported from Vietnam and roasted on site by the chatty, golf-obsessed owner – and thebanh mi(baguettes, around €4) served from the street stalls behind the Lotus restaurant are delicious.When all’s said and done, though, Vietnamese food is almost always about thepho– and while there are lots of great options dotted around,Pho Tungis the undisputed king. The bowls are always piping hot and packed to the brim with beef and noodles, and the generous pile of freequay- sticks of tasty deep-fried dough – make for great dippers (€7). True, you might not get too much of a smile from the waiter but by the time you’ve finished such a satisfying meal, your smile will probably be big enough for the both of you.Explore more on these topicsPrague holidaysFood and drinkCzech Republic holidaysVietnamese food and drinkEurope holidaysFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a major cultural moment that marks the end of the harvest season, and some key customs include everyone cleaning their home to prepare for the festivities (and to clear away bad luck!), the lighting of oil lamps and, of course, food. That can take the form of special sweets, celebratory treats such askavum(cakes made with coconut oil),kiri-bath(milk rice),kokis(a crisp fried dough), and everyday favourites such as today’s two dishes.Egg curry (pictured top)This hearty vegetarian dish is a hug in a bowl, and is especially welcome on gloomy days. Serve with steamed rice or shop-bought parathas.Prep10 minCook30 minServes2-46 eggsSalt and black pepperAbout 250ml coconut oil, for deep-frying, plus 2-3 tbsp extra for the onions1 tsp cumin seeds¼ tsp dill seeds1 sprig curry leaves, picked2 small green chillies, finely chopped1 onion, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped3cm piece cinnamon stick½ tsp fenugreek seeds1 tsp chilli powder350ml thick coconutmilk½ tspturmeric powderJuice of ½ lime, to finishCoriander leaves, to garnishBring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, carefully drop in the eggs and cook for five minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggs to a bowl of iced water. Once cold, peel the eggs, then prick the whites all over with a toothpick or fork. Lightly salt the eggs and put them to one side.Put two to three tablespoons of coconut oil in a deep-sided frying pan on a medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds, dill seeds, curry leaves and chillies, and after a couple of minutes, when the spices start to pop, add the onion and garlic, and fry, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until the onions start to brown.Stir in the cinnamon, fenugreek seeds and chilli powder, cook for another two or three minutes, then add the coconut milk and turmeric. Cover the pan and leave to cook gently for 15 minutes.While the curry is cooking, put the remaining 250ml coconut oil in a medium, deep-sided saucepan and heat to about 180C/350F. Once it’s at temperature, deep-fry the eggs for a minute or two, until the whites turn a light yellow,then lift out with a slotted spoon and put on a plate or tray lined with kitchen towel to drain.Gently drop the deep-fried eggs into the curry sauce, simmer on a low heat for three to four minutes, then season to taste. Add the lime juice for a bit of acidity, and serve garnished with a scattering of coriander leaves.Mackerel pattiesView image in fullscreenDom Fernando’s mackerel patties.Nothing reminds me more of my grandmother than fish patties. She used to make them regularly whenever she came down to visit us in London. They resemble empañadas, and are one of my go-to snacks.Prep10 minChill1 hrCook1 hr 10 minMakes6For the filling250g potatoesSalt and black pepper500mlsunflower oil, plus a little extra for shallow frying1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced1tsp turmeric powder½ tsp ground cumin¼ tsp ground cinnamon¼ tsp ground cloves300gtinned mackerel, or tuna, in oil or spring water, drainedA few sprigs of fresh dill(optional)½ limeFor the pastry300gplain flour½ tspsalt100g cold unsalted butter, diced1 egg, separated80ml coconut milkWash the potatoes, then put them in a pan of salted water, bring to a boil and cook for 10-15 minutes, until cooked through. Drain, leave to cool a little, then peel and finely chop.Heat a little oil in a medium saucepan, then fry the onion, garlic and ginger for about 10 minutes, stirring until everything turns golden. Add the turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, cloves and a teaspoon of crushed black pepper, cook, stirring, for a minute, then add the tinned fish and fresh dill, if using, and cook, still stirring, for two to three minutes more.Stir in the chopped potatoes and two teaspoons of salt, cook for another couple of minutes, then take off the heat, squeeze in the lime juice and leave to cool.To make the pastry, mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub into the flour with your fingertips until the mix turns to crumbs. Beat the egg yolk in a small bowl, work it into the flour mix, then incorporate the coconut milk bit by bit, kneading it in well before adding any more, until you have a smooth dough. Don’t worry if you don’t achieve the right consistency automatically; add a little extra flour or some water to firm up or loosen, as required. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and chill for an hour.Divide the chilled dough in half and, on a floured surface, roll out each piece to roughly 3mm thick. Use a pastry cutter to cut out three 4-6cm-diameter circles from each piece of dough.Put a tablespoon of the fish mix in the centre of each pastry circle. Beat the egg white in a small bowl, then brush this all around the edge of each pastry circle. Fold over the circle to make a half-moon shape, then press all around the edges to seal.Put the 500ml oil in a large, deep-sided saucepan to fill it by no more than two-thirds, and heat to about 180C. Working in batches, carefully drop in the patties and deep-fry for two to four minutes, turning occasionally, until they turn crisp and golden. Lift out with a slotted spoon and put on a plate or tray lined with kitchen towel to drain while you fry the remaining patties. Serve warm with chilli sauce or tomato ketchup.Dom Fernando is chef/patron ofParadisein LondonExplore more on these topicsSri Lankan food and drinkSnacksMain courseFoodCurryEggsVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"
