It is as if some enemy within guides it unerringly along the wrong strategic path. Declaring war on Andy Burnham anoints him as a northern martyr and hero, and casts Keir Starmer as a coward. Many opposed Burnhamthrowing down the gauntletfor all the problems it would have caused if he won. If he had run, and won, Starmer would have a choice: squeeze him python-tight within the fold, or confront any leadership manoeuvring head on. Instead, before he could show any strength, he funked it, using evasive proceduralism to block his rival from the byelection in Gorton and Denton.What timing for this decision! Starmer, along with his chancellor, business secretary and other chief allies are due to depart for China on Tuesday: his absence from PMQs, from the weekly parliamentaryLabourparty meeting and from TV studios is a blunder.Why this provocation when obstacles aplenty were already in Burnham’s way, with no easy route to No 10? Even those who are not particularly his supporters see how boldly he was ready to hazard his political career on an uncertain byelection at a time of wild political volatility. He could have lost to Reform or to the Greens, or been hindered by a pro-Gaza independent, and that would have finished him politically. But he had a good chance of winning: now, if that seat gifts Nigel Farage hisninth MP, excoriating blame will fall on Starmer.The byelection to replace Burnham as Manchester mayor would indeed have been mortally dangerous: a Reform win would have been a disaster, not just for Labour but for the future of the country. Anger at that needless loss might well have terminated any Burnham leadership bid. But, even if returned as a victor to the Commons, he would have been cold-shouldered by a fair number of unwelcoming Labour MPs: they note that, ever since he said government should not be“in hock to the bond markets”, the markets twitch whenever he steps towards power. It happened again last week when he threw his hat into the ring.A leadership contest with Wes Streeting and maybe others would be hard fought, no shoo-in. But, fearless or reckless, Burnham was willing to risk everything with that familiar challenger’s blend of personal ambition and resolve to rescue his party from its deepest slough of despond. It took guts.Starmer has dealt himself a blow. “Frit” was how Margaret Thatcher described it, when, in 1983, she accused Denis Healey of being afraid of an election. Blame falls on Starmer’s henchman Morgan McSweeney, but it was the man himself who ducked letting his challenger reach even first base, being on the national executive committee (NEC) panel that voted eight-to-one to hold Burnham down.Rows may lead to this NEC blunder being reversed in one more U-turn, aspolling showsthat 66% of Labour members thought that Burnham should be allowed to stand. Either way, his status is burnished, members preferring him to Starmer for Labour leader by 48% to 26%. Only he among senior Labour figures scores apositive public rating, gaining from the northern air of Manchester, uncontaminated by the detested Westminster miasma. But as suggested by astute psephologists such asMark Pack, surveying all polls, that’s scant prediction of how much lift any new leader would give Labour. After all, they will follow the five PMs in a row who have each been the most hated ever, in this time of anti-politician ferment.But whatever the unknowable result, keeping calm and carrying on over the precipice looks like the worst option. Labour has had that lemming instinct in the past, but no longer. This is not about one party’s survival but mortal combat with the Farage forces of darkness. The left-liberal bloc of parties is duty-bound to see off the hard-right bloc, the Tories now sucked into the frighteningly race-driven orbit of the Trumpian Reform UK. Starmer himself said on Monday, ashe did in his conference speech, thatthis is the fight. But it’s now clear to all that he’s not the one to lead that fight.The new leader has to be acceptable enough to appeal to tactical voters across the whole liberal-green-left spectrum. The new leader has to be bold enough to go for immediate electoral reform, to ensure every party only gets the seats earned by its vote, or Farage could do as Labour did in 2024, and win by a mile, despite the great majority voting against him.Let selecting a new leader be done with the least bloodshed, but it needs to be done before May: why wait for brutal results if there’s a chance of stopping a haemorrhage of Labour councils and terrible losses inScotlandandWales? Choose whoever is fittest to draw in the most support for the stop-Farage fight.The Scottish secretary, Douglas Alexander, one of the wisest put up to defend the NEC decision, was right when he told the Today programme on Radio 4 that the last thing the country wants now is an internal Labour melodrama, when the cost of living, state of the economy and public services should take up ministers’ every waking moment. But Labour’s failure to persuade on those essentials is exactly what has brought us to this crisis. If Gorton and Denton (Labour majority in 2024: 13,413) falls, that signals that there is no time to lose. That Labour’s NEC could even dare contemplate using the excuse of possibly losing Greater Manchester’s mayoralty to Reform shows the hierarchy accepting too complacently the depths of the party’s failure.Labour may fall out, unable to agree on the policies or person of a new leader, preferring to stagger on while vainly scanning the horizon for something to turn up. But I would hope the great majority of Labour MPs, members, voters and potential voters want to put up the strongest contender, setting aside factionalisms of small difference in the face of a grave national threat.Here is the Starmer tragedy, a good and clever man not made for politics or leadership. His lack of arrogance and his earnest endeavour is what his admirers like, but lack of political instinct and firmness of direction is a fatal flaw. Turning the party round after Corbyn was a triumph. His convictions are deep-dyed Labour: children’s opportunities, green investment, workers’ rights. But No 10’s over-cautious wariness of the right stifled the telling of that story. Look, I slid into the past tense because that is where he is almost certainly headed. His legacy will be a far longer list of good things done than anyone heard tell, because it was never well told. How he goes and who succeeds is the next story.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerReform UKLocal electionscommentShareReuse this content"

Melania was directed by Brett Ratner, and has a reported $40m production budget. And, obviously, you’re probably not going to watch it.Of course you’re not. Coming days after thekilling of Alex Prettiby a US Border Patrol agent, an authorised vanity project about the current wife of a globally unpopular political leader – and directed by a manaccused of sexual assault by multiple women(he was never charged, and denies the allegations), and whose production and release carried the smell of institutionalised media timidity – seems like just about the least appealing prospect ever. But, hey, any excuse for a party, right?View image in fullscreenThe popcorn machine.Photograph: @trump.family_usa/InstagramOn Saturday, a special screening of Melania was organised in the White House, in a makeshift cinema that had to be erected due to the ongoing construction ofthe White House ballroom. It was attended by what the Hollywood Reporter describes as “70 assorted VIPs”, including Amazon’s Andy Jassy, Apple’s Tim Cook, Queen Rania of Jordan and Mike Tyson. Amazon has thrown a $35m marketing budget at Melania, some of which could be seen at Saturday’s screening. If the images from the event are any indication, there should be quite a lot of it left over.Guests reportedly left the screening heaving with Melania merch, which included framed Melania screening tickets, black and white cookies bearing the name Melania, a limited-edition version of Melania’s book, Melania, and commemorative black and white Melania popcorn boxes. Additionally, judging by photos of the event, snacks included black and white M&Ms, black and white chocolate-covered pretzels, black and white macarons and a central display of white cake pops. In other words, it’s exactly what you would find at a baby shower thrown for someone who happens to suffer from debilitating achromatopsia.View image in fullscreenAssorted cookies.Photograph: @trump.family_usa/InstagramAnother cute fact about the screening is that, as they arrived, guests were treated to a full military band playing Melania’s Waltz, the central musical theme of the documentary, as written by the film’s composer, Tony Neiman. Obviously, the vast majority of us don’t know what Melania’s Waltz sounds like, but Neiman’s IMDb page lists his work as including eight episodes of Top Chef and 2020’s Russian 3D superhero space opera Cosmoball (‘An enormous spaceship hovers over Earth – this is a stadium, which hosts sports events that resemble soccer but at mind-boggling speeds. The name of the game is cosmoball’) so it’s probably pretty banging.More will follow. On Thursday, the day before the film’s release, Melania will get its official premiere at the recently renamed The Donald J Trump and theJohn F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.Details remain under wraps, but it will be interesting to see how much further a big event like this will be able to push the monochrome look established by the White House screening. Will there be a black carpet? Will the popcorn be black? Will someone be able to dig out and dyeMelania’s terrifying red Christmas treesfrom 2018, so the whole place resembles a nightmarish 1920s German expressionist forest? We wait with bated breath.The trailer for the film.In truth, if you’re able to squint hard enough to detach yourself from the horrors of everything, there’s something sort of sweet about this rollout. Clearly, Melania wishes that her documentary was a Sex and the City-style cultural phenomenon, a stylish and chic luxury brand that all the girlies can enjoy together. Obviously that’s quite hard to accomplish when you’ve convinced a quisling media corporation to finance a $40m ego massage during a tipping point of global insecurity instigated largely by your husband, but you can’t blame a woman for trying.Again, in reality, you’ll probably end up skipping Melania to watch something less depressing, likeDie My Loveor a documentary about asbestos inhalation. That said, the lucky attenders of the White House screening should keep hold of the merchandise they received on Saturday. Sure, a framed and numbered cinema ticket may not have all that much value at the moment. But 50 years from now, any number of upsetting niche collectors will be willing to pay top dollar for it on the dark web. Just be sure to keep it in a safe, to stop it getting destroyed during the upcoming civil war riots.Explore more on these topicsMelania TrumpFilm blogDocumentary filmsDocumentaryShareReuse this content"

The sound of the barrel getting scraped. Only last summer, Reform insiders were briefing the rightwing media that the party would never welcomeSuella Bravermaninto its ranks. Too much baggage. Too out of control. Reform wasn’t a convalescent home for disgraced and failed Tory MPs. Surely not? Heaven forbid.So it was only a matter of time before the MP forced to resign from Liz Truss’s cabinet as home secretary for breaking the ministerial code – imagine the shame of being sacked by Liz – and then fired by Rishi Sunak for criticising Scotland Yard’s policing of protests was welcomed byNigel Farage. Let’s face it: if Kemi Badenoch weren’t already leader of the Tory party, she’d almost certainly be next in line to defect.“I feel like I’ve come home,” said Suella. And in a sense she had. There are now more members of the Truss cabinet in Reform than there are in Kemi’s shadow team. This after Nige had hijacked what had been intended as a rally for military veterans to welcome her on stage. Nige just can’t help himself. There again, he might have welcomed the distraction. Farage is on dodgy ground trying to champion veterans’ causes after his close mate Donald Trump personally insulted British service personnel last week. Someone might have got round to asking why the Reform leader so admires the US president.It was the surprise that wasn’t a surprise. The most undramatic drama from Reform yet. The stunt that bombed. Most people in the east London hall had to remind themselves that Braverman hadn’t already defected long ago. She was Reform long before Reform even existed. An accident waiting to happen.Suella then set about winning over hearts and minds. In her own very special way. You have put your lives on the line, she said to the vets. Out of love for your country. And she knew what that was like. Because in her own way she had put her own life on the line out of love for her country. All this without a trace of embarrassment. She really does believe she has also been in the frontline with bullets being fired. “I spent the night in Norway once,” she added. So she could easily have served in the Arctic.Strangely, given that earlier we had heard from an SAS veteran about the levels of homelessness among ex-servicemen and women, Braveman neglected to remind the audience that she considered rough sleeping to be a lifestyle choice. Surely this was the time for the politician who has always prided herself on straight talking to tell it like it is. Stop feeling sorry for yourself because you haven’t got a roof over your head. Just pretend you are bivouacking behind enemy lines as you try to avoid capture.Next Suella moved on to her parents. Her dad had been expelled from Kenya and sought refuge in the UK. Her mum had come from Mauritius. This must never be allowed to happen again. Even the grateful ones must go. Everywhere you looked there were far too many immigrants. Britain was broken. People were terrified to walk the streets. It was a war of attrition. The country was no longer recognisably British.With no sense of irony, Suella segued seamlessly into a discourse on loyalty. A virtue along with honesty that was to be prized above all others. Except everyone got a free pass on these if they were members of the Tory party. What you really had to remember is that she had been living a lie.She had been trying to be a good Tory MP but she just hadn’t been able to stop herself from rubbishing her friends. Which is why in the greatest act of self-sacrifice and loyalty imaginable, she was resigning the Tory whip. And she knew that some in her Fareham and Waterlooville constituency would be upset. But really she wasn’t that bothered. Certainly not enough to call a byelection. This was all about her and her ambition. This was her moment to shine. Robert Jenrick was last week’s news. And Andrew Rossindell hadn’t even been worthy of his own press conference. Too many awkward questions. Too many “no comment” answers.Suella ended with a long attack on the Tories. “We failed you,” she said. Though by we, she meant everyone except her. So not we; they. Even though she had been attorney general and home secretary, she had been responsible for nothing. Her sackings were portrayed as some kind of personal triumph. A sign of integrity. She had tried her best and everything that had gone wrong was someone else’s fault. The fact that immigration had risen to record levels on her watch was nothing to do with her. Nige will need to keep a close eye on her. She is a politician you would do well not to trust.That just left Farage to do the final bits of housekeeping. He was sure the veterans wouldn’t mind having their rally totally upstaged. They were used to taking orders and being treated badly. Start as you mean to go on. He was the general, they were the grunts. And defections were so much more exciting. Though he was beginning to wonder if you can have too much of a good thing. Still, it was too late for quality control. Reform had long since morphed into the very worst of the Tories.Explore more on these topicsSuella BravermanThe politics sketchReform UKConservativesNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

But beneath panicked viewers’ sweaty palms, there was a queasy truth about the future of televisionStuart HeritageMon 26 Jan 2026 07.19 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 12.53 ESTShareWell, have your balls descended back out of your body yet? Netflix’s Skyscraper Live has been and gone, and it may well qualify as the single most stressful viewing experience on record. Alex Honnold’s unassisted ascent of the 508 metre Taipei 101 was an absolutely extraordinary achievement. Whether or not it represents the future of television, though, is a completely different matter.Honnold’s work is already well-known. As the star ofFree Solo– a feature documentary once again so nerve-racking that the only way to comfortably enjoy it was under the influence of industrial sphincter relaxants – he has long been the poster boy of people climbing up stuff without ropes.But the difference between Free Solo and Skyscraper Live is vast. The former was a meticulously structured account of his attempt to climb El Capitan unaided, edited to wring out the maximum level of drama possible. The latter was just footage of him climbing up a building for an hour and a half. Obviously, the risk factor for the viewer was amplified enormously, because – unlike Free Solo, which could have been retroactively reedited in the event of an accident – Skyscraper Live had nowhere to hide.View image in fullscreenNerve-racking … Alex Honnold in Skyscraper Live.Photograph: Chong Kok-yew/NetflixHowever, an hour and a half is a long time to watch anything. And in the case of Skyscraper Live, you were essentially watching a guy repeat the same set of movements hundreds of times in a row. You invariably kept finding yourself zoning out a little, maybe checking your phone or going to make a cup of tea, because the human mind simply wasn’t designed to sustain a state of panic for that long. In effect, the act of watching Skyscraper Live was like taking a long-haul flight in turbulent weather, with long periods of boredom spiked with moments of sheer panic.At least Honnold and his team can be congratulated for picking an incredibly dramatic skyscraper to climb. Taipei 101 seems like it was custom-made for this sort of thing, consisting of three clear stages that aggressively ramp up in terms of difficulty. There were heights. There were overhangs. Towards the end, at the first part of the structure’s spire, there was a moment when Honnold had to climb outwards at a 45-degree angle, up a portion of building that didn’t appear to have much for him to hold on to. I just watched it back – having seen it once and knowing how it ends – and my palms instantly became sweaty. Even watching him stand up straight at the summit gave me the same sort of fizzy-tummy panic you get when you see that your toddler has got into the knife drawer.Which is to say that it was exceptional, but also: should we really be making entertainment predicated on the possibility that someone might die? Because as much as you can admire Honnold’s athleticism and pluck, you watched Skyscraper Live for the jeopardy of it. Even if you pushed it all the way down to the pit of your stomach, a tiny part of you knew that you were tuning in to the possibility that he might slip and fall to his death.There are plenty of events where this is implied – I maintain that most of the people who watch Formula One do so for the crashes – but there was something gaudily explicit about this. The closest example I can think of is when Red Bull paid Felix Baumgartner to jump from a height of 24 miles in 2012. There was the same giddy excitement leading up to the broadcast of the jump. And then, when he entered an uncontrolled, life-threatening spin after 90 seconds, there was the same sense of grim self-examination. You realised that you were simply a rubbernecker, tuning in to the macabre possibility that something would go wrong.I suspect that isn’t how Netflix wants to market itself – Home of People Plummeting Off Buildings (and Stranger Things) – which means that Skyscraper Live should remain a one-off.If it decides to capitalise on the success of this by commissioning more live events that could result in the death of a human being – Free Diving Live, or Rooftop Parkour Live, or even Eating a Steak Sandwich Without Chewing It Properly Live – it runs the risk of turning the future of television into a Victorian freak show. It’s better than that. And, besides, my sphincter couldn’t take it.Skyscraper Live is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionNetflixExtreme sportsTaiwanAsia PacificRock climbingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But soon after landing in St Petersburg from Nairobi with six other Kenyans one afternoon last August, he started feeling something was off.The man who received them at the airport drove them to a house where their luggage was taken away and they were given black clothes and shoes to wear. Afterwards, they were taken to a police station where they were fingerprinted and forced to sign documents written in Russian, a language they did not understand.When they were taken the next day to a large military facility in the city for processing of military IDs, it began to dawn on the 24-year-old that he had unknowingly enlisted in the Russian armed forces.His fear was confirmed when he asked one of the Russians why they were processing the cards. He recalled the Russian telling him: “You travelled all the way fromKenyaand didn’t know what you were coming to do?”Oduor – not his real name – is one of more than 200 Kenyans and hundreds of other Africans who have been trafficked to Russia with promises of ordinary jobs, only to end up on the frontline inits war with Ukraine.View image in fullscreenThe Kenyan national Evans Kibet was captured while fighting for Russian forces on the Ukrainian front and is now a PoW.Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty ImagesOduor, who eventually managed to escape and returned to Kenya in November, spent three days at the military facility. After getting their IDs, the Kenyans were put on a train and travelled for two days to the city of Belgorod in south-western Russia near the border withUkraine. At a military camp in the city, they were handed military uniforms, assault rifles and other weapons in order to go straight to the battlefield without training.“I didn’t know how to shoot anything,” Oduor recalled.For the next three months, his main job was to shoot down Ukrainian weaponised drones. Hiding for hours on end inside foxholes in forests across the border in Ukraine, he listened keenly for any signs of drones to bring them down. Every day alive felt like a miracle – if a drone spotted him first, it would strike him.Allegations of racist mistreatmentA growing number of people from Africa – including Kenya, Uganda andSouth Africa– and elsewhere have been lured to the frontline as Russia seeks manpower to sustain its war.Late last year, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said more than 1,400 citizens from 36 African countries were fighting for Russia in Ukraine. Many are being held in Ukrainian camps as prisoners of war.Kenya’s ministry of foreign and diaspora affairssaidmore than 200 of its nationals may be in Ukraine, having been tricked by recruitment networks that post fake job adverts online.Footage recently posted to social media gives an apparent glimpse of the conditions facing Africans in Ukraine and their racist mistreatment by Russian soldiers.Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv and Moscow set to hold more face-to-face talks as US hails ‘big step’ forwardRead moreOnepurports to showa black man with an anti-tank mine strapped to his chest, being ordered at gunpoint in what appears to be a trench to move to Ukrainian positions. A Russian speaker calls him a “piece of coal” and says he’s going to be the “opener today”, implying that he will be made to detonate the mine in order to “open” a Ukrainian bunker. The man reluctantly lurches ahead. “No, no, no,” he says as the Russian speaker prods him with the tip of his gun.Anotherpurportedly showsarmed black men in military attire singing a Ugandan revolutionary song in the snow in the woods, while a Russian speaker in the background laughs and describes them as “disposables”.It has not been possible to verify the videos, but Russia’s military in the war in Ukraine has a history of deliberately sending soldiers to their deaths. Testimonies from Russian troops have described being dispatched on what amounted to suicide missions. Earlier media reports also documented cases in which soldiers were deployed as “mayachki” (“beacons”), ordered to walk ahead of assault groups, sometimes without proper equipment, to draw enemy fire.The recruitment networks, which include local employment agencies thatpromise Kenyans foreign jobs, are capitalising on the east African country’shigh youth unemployment rateandits pushto send its citizens to work abroad.Denis Muniu, a security and foreign policy analyst, said the networks target unemployed youth who qualify for general labour and infantry roles and former security personnel who can be deployed with minimal training. They leverage what he termed weak oversight of employment agencies. “It’s a very strategic way of recruiting these people,” he said.Russia’s foreign affairs ministry and its embassy in Nairobi did not respond to a request for comment. Its government has in the past denied involvement in schemes to recruit foreigners into its military.Kenya’s ministry of foreign and diaspora affairs did not respond to a request for comment. Ina statementlast month, the ministry said it was engaging the Russian government and Ukrainian authorities in a repatriation effort. On 22 January, the foreign affairs principal secretary, Abraham Korir Sing’Oei, said the government had repatriated 28 Kenyans since December.‘I just saw death’Oduor trained in plumbing after secondary school but never got a steady job. When a friend told him about employment agents offering job opportunities in Russia, he asked for an introduction. The agents promised him a plumbing job paying 100,000 Kenyan shillings (£567) monthly. He paid them a fee of 25,000 shillings and they said they would cater for everything else, including air fare and visa fees.Oduor’s path to return home had a bloody start. At about 6pm one day, he and three Russian soldiers were in a forest heading in a pickup to a location for their night shift to shoot down drones when he suddenly heard one of his fellow passengers screaming.Oduor looked up and saw a drone flying towards them. It was the moment he’d dreaded – a kamikaze drone had spotted them. “I just saw death … I knew this was the end of us,” he said.The driver accelerated the vehicle through the forest, trying to lose the drone, but in less than two minutes, it had caught up with them and exploded. Oduor’s fellow passenger in the back had his head blown off, while Odour and the driver suffered injuries from the fragments. “We were lucky. God was with us,” he said about the survivors.Oduor was taken to a hospital in Belgorod where he underwent first aid, then transferred to another one nearby before being taken to a hospital in the western city of Pskov. He spent a few days there receiving treatment but also – knowing he’d be taken back to the frontline upon recovery – plotting his escape.He regularly asked a security person to let him walk to a supermarket and always returned, but one morning he instead took a taxi to the Kenyan embassy in Moscow, more than 400 miles (644km) away, where officials helped him get an emergency passport for a flight back home.Having sold his belongings to relocate to Russia and having returned empty-handed, Oduor is trying to restart his life just outside Nairobi by looking for jobs in plumbing and other areas. He underwent surgery in Kenya to remove a fragment and is still recovering, meaning he can do only light work.The trauma from the war zone lingers. “The experience seriously hurt me,” he said. “When you see someone dying and his head falling off, that disturbs you. It disturbed me a lot.”‘I don’t know whether he’s dead or alive’Most Kenyans who end up in Ukraine have not managed to return home.Susan Kuloba hasn’t seen her eldest child, David, since he left Kenya for Russia in August. Kenyan employment agents told him he would get a job as a security guard but in fact he was conscripted into the Russian military.View image in fullscreenSusan Kuloba has not seen her son since he left for Russia in August.Photograph: Carlos MureithiThe 22-year-old, who used to work as a construction worker in Nairobi, kept his mother constantly updated on WhatsApp, sending her messages, photos and videos of his time in Russia.On 30 September, a day before his second mission to fight Ukrainians, he sent her a copy of his military contract and a disturbing voice message suggesting he may not survive the mission. “In case of anything, you’ll get a call to inform you whether I’ll have died or I’ll be alive. If I’ll have died, take the documents to [the Kenyan] Immigration or to the [Russian] embassy. If you take them to the embassy, tell them I’m your child. When you do that, they’ll give you a pay cheque … I love you all very much.”They chatted for three more days, then he went quiet. After a week, a friend of David’s who had gone to Russia but escaped told Susan that he learned from a WhatsApp group for Kenyan fighters that her son had been killed.View image in fullscreenSusan kept in touch with her son, David, through WhatsApp while he was in Ukraine.Photograph: Carlos MureithiFor three months now, Susan has been trying to get answers about what happened. She has visited and written to the foreign affairs ministry, which she said only confirmed that David landed in Russia. She has also gone to the Russian embassy in Nairobi, which she said told her it does not deal with military affairs.“What hurts is I don’t know whether he’s dead or alive,” she said. “All I have is a claim by someone that he died, but I don’t believe it. But it’s been long. The government should just help us.”Explore more on these topicsWorld newsRussiaAfricaKenyaUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I got Baudelaire into the lyrics somewhere, too’Interviews by Lee CampbellMon 26 Jan 2026 10.11 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 17.34 ESTShareAlison Goldfrapp, co-member, writer, producerThis song was an ode to glam rock. My older sister was really into Marc Bolan and her passion for him and his sound really rubbed off on me. I love the vocal effects and drum sounds on those old records.I couldn’t think of a lyric for the chorus, though, and I thought to myself: “What do I need?” We’d just been to France, hence the “Ooh la la”, but we wondered if it was sufficient. It felt good, though, so we stayed with it and kept layering the voice and then added these vocoder voices. We liked the synthetic robo feel alongside the natural voice.Simon Cowell made me freeze with frightThe lyrics were personal, about a relationship and how I was feeling. I like to use visual metaphors. The breakdown section, about breaking a heel on a shoe, came from this old 1950s film I’d seen on TV. An image of a woman, walking along the road in a tight pencil skirt, limping because the heel had broken. That stuck with me. I had a book of Baudelaire poems hanging around, so I got him into the lyrics somewhere, too.Portishead’s Adrian Utley, a friend of ours, came in to play guitar, which was quite a departure for us because for ages we wanted to stay clear of guitars. He’s so instinctive the way he plays, incredibly lean with the notes. He got the right tone immediately.For the video, I thought it would be fun to have an imaginary glam rock band. Dawn Shadforth was director, the late Cathy Edwards the stylist. We had some good budgets back then, there was plenty of time to do it all carefully with detail, no rushing.The song gets used in many places. Some requests are pretty funny – often sex scenes. We’re not too precious but we have said no many times, too. I remember performing the song on US TV, being in this freezing cold studio waiting to go on air, and Simon Cowell was standing about six feet away with his arms crossed, doing that thing he does on The X Factor, a rather disapproving expression. He was wearing this pink fluffy jumper, which I became fixated on. “Wow!” he said. “It’s all just kicking off for you in America, isn’t it?” I was already so nervous and him being there and saying that made me freeze with fright.Will Gregory, co-member, writer, producerI was listening to Ooh La La again recently for the first time in ages and was surprised at how little is actually in there. The whole thing hinges on the claps – it’s just claps, bass line, vocal, and a few little stabs from synths and guitars.We used to have this thing of renting spaces – usually slightly chintzy holiday homes – over winter when you could get a six-month let. The more lo-fi, the better. It felt more satisfying than being in a flashy studio. And not being in London was important. A lot of great music comes from that isolation.View image in fullscreen‘We used to have this thing of renting slightly chintzy holiday homes’ … Goldfrapp in the studio.Photograph: Joe DilworthThe song was an outlier because every time we tried to change the chords, we thought: “Why don’t we just stay as we are?” So it’s literally a one-note piece. We were delighted that we’d somehow sidestepped all those complications that usually come with songwriting. I made this mistake one day when I was playing the riff – I’d left a microphone on, so when I played it back, I got the sound of the bassline but also the clatter of the keys. I couldn’t get rid of it because it was all on one track, so it’s in there.I’m old enough to remember the 60s and thinking in the 70s: “Oh no, it’s all over, it’s all gone wrong.” I absolutely hated it after the Stones and the Beatles, but Alison was very good at educating me. I remember her playing me Joan Jett. I needed talking round, but I got it.I didn’t appear in the video. That was probably a mutual choice. Alison has always had this great visual side. I would have looked like Ron Mael, the synth player from Sparks. He used to do nothing – and I always thought I could relate to that.We got Mark “Spike” Stent interested, this amazing mixer who’s had millions of hits. We ended up camping in his studio while he was mixing and we were still writing. I felt like such an amateur – I couldn’t even get a bass track together without splitting it into a mosaic of different parts. But it was exciting, a real whirlwind.The track still seems relevant, partly because of the synths and the simplicity. It doesn’t bed itself into an era particularly, because it’s got this mixture of things boiled down to something without putting a foot too far into any identifiable genre.Supernature byGoldfrapp20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition is out nowExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeGoldfrappElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She immediately went on the attack against her former party.At a press conference after her defection, Braverman said she had felt “politically homeless” for the last two years and that too many Tory promises to the country – including on Brexit and immigration – “lie in tatters”.Her critics immediately pointed out that as Brexit minister, home secretary and attorney general under the Tories she had played a major role in the success, or otherwise, of those policy areas.But a bitter row broke out after the Tories issued a statement after her defection saying that the party had done “all we could to look after Suella’s mental health” but she was “clearly very unhappy”.The move sparked an angry response from across the political spectrum. The party later issued a corrected statement saying the original lines were “a draft version”, which had been “sent out in error”.The earlier statement also said: “It was only a matter of when, not if, Suella would defect. She says she feels that she has ‘come home’, which will come as a surprise to the people who chose not to elect a Reform MP in her constituency in 2024.“There are some people who are MPs because they care about their communities and want to deliver a better country. There are others who do it for their personal ambition.”The statement mentioning Braverman’s mental health provoked criticism from across the political spectrum. The former Conservative MP Nigel Evans said it was an “absolute disgrace”, while Mike Tapp, the immigration minister, described it as “gutter politics”.Braverman herself addressed the statement later, saying that Badenoch had previously accused her of having a “breakdown”, adding”: “It is a bit pathetic. As I said, it says more about them than it does me.“It is, I’m afraid, just more sorry signs of a bitter and desperate party that seems to be in free fall.”Asked by the Guardian when she had last spoken to Badenoch, Braverman said it had been during the latter’s leadership campaign. She claimed Badenoch had apologised to her for making a claim about her having a breakdown and asked her to vote for her.View image in fullscreenFarage told reporters after Braverman’s defection that they had been speaking for at least a year.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianBraverman, who has been an MP since 2015 and served as home secretary under Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, was unveiled before a Reform rally attended by veterans in central London. Appearing before Farage later at Reform HQ, she accused the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, of forcing her out as part of a “witch-hunt against rightwingers”.“If the party you joined no longer reflects the values and principles that it once did, you should question your allegiance,” she said. “If the party keeps breaking its promises, you should question your loyalty.”Farage, who presented Braverman in front of a rally of veterans, told reporters after Braverman’s defection that they had been speaking for at least a year. He said that Braverman’s husband, Rael, who had joinedReform UKsome time ago but then quit after criticisim of his wife from the party, had also played a role in the defection. Braverman said her husband had “rejoined”.Farage said her defection brought much needed experience to Reform UK. There are now more members of Liz Truss’s cabinet are now in his top team than in Kemi Badenoch’s.Amid speculation that key allies and supporters of Braverman could follow her, David Frost, the Conservative peer and former Cabinet Office minister, posted a picture of him campaigning with her in 2024 and wrote: “We’ve always seen things the same way.”But others on the right of the Tory Party spoke out against Braverman’s defection, which had long been expected. Mark Francois, who was name-checked by her during her appearance at Reform UK, said he was “deeply disappointed” at the departure of a fellow self-styled “spartan” who held hardline positions on Brexit.Labour says Farage ‘stuffing his party full of failed Tories’ after Suella Braverman joins Reform – UK politics liveRead moreFarage indicated he was eager to take more Tories, but drew the line at named Conservative MPs including Jeremy Hunt and rightwinger Priti Patel.“Look, I’m not welcoming people like Priti Patel, who says she did nothing wrong despite opening the doors to the biggest levels of immigration Britain ever saw. I’m not welcoming Boris Johnson. I’m not recognising those who were part of the problem and still refuse to accept it,” he told GB News.At the same time, Farage came under pressure in other interviews to explain why a planned unveiling of a Labour defector last week did not materialise and claimed the party was in discussions with Labour figures.View image in fullscreenSuella Braverman joins fellow Tory defector Robert Jenrick.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersEchoing talking points raised by Robert Jenrick when he defected earlier this month, Braverman had told the rally earlier in the day that Britain was broken, before using the press conference with Farage later in the day to list what she saw as failings in a range of areas such as the treatment of veterans, immigration and the allowance under a Tory government of children to socially transition in schools.Such was the secrecy surrounding Braverman’s defection that Reform staff at the event were taken by surprise at the event earlier in the day.The Fareham and Waterlooville MP follows Jenrick, who was shadow justice secretary anddefected on15 January, and Andrew Rosindell, who made the movea few days later. Her move means Reform now has eight MPs.The defection is likely to worry some in Reform, which in a short space of time has taken on board three former Tories who once had leadership ambitions in their old party. Braverman was sacked as home secretary by Truss and Sunak, thefirst timefor sending official documents from a personal email to another Tory MP, and thesecondafterbeing accusedof fuelling far-right violence with her rhetoric.Reform figures havebriefedin the past that neither Braverman nor Truss would be welcome in the party.Braverman told the event she would be setting out her reasons for leaving the Tories later in the day, as she used her speech to lambast previous Conservative governments. She revisited her sacking by Sunak, saying she had gone to him when she was home secretary to express her concerns about the impact of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) on Britain’s ability to enforce immigration policies.“First he ignored me and then he sacked me,” she said.Farage is coming under growing pressure over claims that Reform is turning into another Conservative party, and he was reluctant to be drawn on whether Truss could be next to join his party.Reform’s press team told the Guardian last week that Truss would never join the party. Asked again on Monday about closing the door to her entry, Farage replied: “I didn’t say that. I said it was unlikely.”Asked about his previous description about Braverman as “absolutely pathetic” on immigration, he responded: “She was utterly useless, as they all were. They all were utterly useless because they were stuck within the ECHR. So she found herself in this bizarre position.”Labour seized on the defection. The party’s chair, Anna Turley, said: “Nigel Farage is stuffing his party full of the failed Tories responsible for the chaos and decline that held Britain back for 14 years. Suella Braverman helped botch Brexit and got sacked as home secretary.”Explore more on these topicsSuella BravermanReform UKConservativesNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s now more likely that any change will be in the wrong direction or insufficiently radical,” they said.A letter being circulated by soft left Labour backbenchers said the decision to block him from running was a gift to Nigel Farage and that losing the byelection would be “unimaginable”. It came after Burnham himself appearedto predictthat Labour would lose the byelection.View image in fullscreenThe former minister Louise Haigh is one of several on the soft left of the Labour party to have expressed concern about the Burnham decision.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersThe executive of the soft-left Tribune group of MPs – which includes the former ministers Louise Haigh and Justin Madders and the select committee chair Sarah Owen – have conveyed concern to Shabana Mahmood, the chair of Labour’s national executive committee (NEC).On Labour’s soft left, the question isn’t whether to challenge Starmer, but whenRead moreBut with the interviews for candidates for the seat due to begin on Tuesday, many Burnham allies have conceded that their hopes of him fighting Gorton have been dashed.Starmer said on Monday that he and his fellow NEC officers had decided not to let Burnham quit to avoid triggering a costly mayoral election.He said: “Andy Burnham’s doing a great job as the mayor of Manchester, but having an election for the mayor of Manchester when it’s not necessary would divert our resources away from the elections that we must have, that we must fight and win. Resources, whether that’s money or people, need to be focused on the elections that we must have, not elections that we don’t have to have. And that was the basis of the NEC decision.”Addressing the turmoil in his party, he said: “Yes, there is a fight, but that fight is with Reform and we all need to line up together to be in that fight, all playing our part. I think that everybody in the Labour party, everybody who’s a Labour MP, wants to be in that fight, wants to fight alongside all their colleagues in a fight that matters hugely to the future of our country.”The prime minister’s allies were trying to shore up support after a turbulent few days, as Starmer left the country for the rest of the week on a visit to China and Japan.Richard Hermer, the attorney general and a close friend, told a regular private meeting of MPs: “What we are achieving as a government is radical, deeply principled and nothing short of an attempt to rework the state so it is fairer and more equal for all.“I do not for one minute underestimate the political challenge we face. Or how many people do not trust politicians and will not do so until they can at least feel we are making a difference. But nor do I underestimate this party, and my passionate belief that as our policies take hold, we will change this country for the better and for the long term.”View image in fullscreenRichard Hermer, the attorney general, attempted to shore up support for Starmer, his close friend.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianHe added: “I can say with all honesty that Keir was the most able and principled lawyer of his generation and his belief in public service is every bit as strong today as it was then.”Reactions were mixed. One usually loyal MP said: “Everybody was in a massive grump before Christmas and now they’ve come back and nothing has got any better. Keir has used an opportunity to demonstrate strength and instead demonstrated weakness.”Burnhamsaid on Sundayhe was disappointed by the decision but promised to support whoever was selected to fight the seat vacated last week by Andrew Gwynne.In a social media post on Monday night, he sought to make light of the situation. Ahead of a match between his football team, Everton, and Leeds, he posted: “Given the weekend I’ve had it feels very much like a [former Everton and now Leeds striker] Dominic Calvert-Lewin hat-trick is now incoming.”If Burnham had been selected for the seat, he would have been obliged to give up his Greater Manchester mayoralty less than halfway through a four-year term, triggering a byelection there.A Labour statement on Sunday said this “would have a substantial and disproportionate impact on party campaign resources ahead of the local elections and elections to the Scottish parliament and Welsh Senedd in May”.The decision caused fury among many Labour MPs, not all of them natural allies of Burnham, with one condemning what they called “petty factionalism”.

It worked for The Dark Knight and Mamma Mia!, released in the US on the same day in 2008, as well asfor Dunkirk and Girls Trip in 2017. In 2023, Barbie and Oppenheimerleveraged the tactic to the tune of $2.5bnin combined box office takings.This week we could see another example as Amazon releases its authorised documentary about Melania Trump in more than 100 UK cinemas. There it will compete against an already-eclectic slate of releases including the Jason Statham action film Shelter, theape horror Primate, Bradley Cooper’scomedy-drama Is This Thing On?and Richard Linklater’sJean-Luc Godard fictionalisation Nouvelle Vague.Black cakes and branded buckets: welcome to the White House premiere for Brett Ratner’s Melania movieRead moreUK ticket sales for Melania are so far “soft”, according to Tim Richards, the chief executive of Vue, one of the country’s biggest cinema operators. Just one ticket has been sold for the first 3.10pm screening on Friday at its flagship Islington branch in London, while two have been booked for 6pm.At the time of publication, all seats remained available for the 28 screenings of Melania at the Blackburn, Castleford and Hamilton branches.The picture was slightly rosier at the Cineworld in Wandsworth, which had sold four tickets, while five backrow seats were also booked at the Cineworld in Broughton.Richards told the Telegraph he had received a considerable number of emails from the public criticising Vue’s decision to screen the film. “I have told everyone that, regardless of how we feel about the movie, if it is BBFC [British Board of Film Classification] approved we look at them and 99% of the time we will show it,” he said. “We do not play judge and jury to censor movies.”One industry analyst told the Guardian they suspected the underlying strategy was “four-walling”, meaning distributors pay a set fee to each cinema if they agree to play a certain title.This would explain why so many exhibitors – which usually adopt a revenue-sharing model with distributors – have agreed to take on a movie with such modest financial prospects at a time when award-nominated films are vying for screen time.“I’d be amazed if box office gets reported on this title,” added the pundit, who wished to remain anonymous. The Guardian has contacted Comscore, the body that tracks UK box office performance, for confirmation.Amazon MGM Studios bought the rights to the film for $40m (£30m) – which reportedly included a considerable sum to the subject of the film – and is spending $35m on a global marketing push. This spend has so far been mostly in the US, with TV spots, billboards and a takeover of Las Vegas’s immersive events venue The Sphere.The film, which documents the 20 days preceding Donald Trump’s return to power in January 2025, was screened at the White House on Saturday and will have its official premiere at Washington’s Kennedy Center – which the president has renamed the Trump-Kennedy Centerin a legally disputed move– on Thursday, before its release in 27 countries.At the start of the month, Boxoffice ProestimatedMelania would take between $1m and $2m during its opening weekend, but this week the National Research Group estimated takings of $5m domestically.The most successful documentary at the US box office, Michael Moore’s 2004 Iraq war film Fahrenheit 9/11, made $24m in its first weekend. In 2024, Am I Racist?, a mockumentary that satirises inclusivity initiatives, was the best-performing documentary of the year in the US, taking $12.3m, including a first weekend of $5.4m.UK projections for Melania are harder to call, beyond extrapolations of the sluggish advance sales. The film’s enormous rollout – most documentaries are capped at about 25 venues – means that even if audiences do turn up, the per-screen average is likely to be embarrassingly low.Prime Minister– the recent documentary about the former New Zealand leader Jacinda Ardern – took £33,000 on its first weekend of release in December 2025 across 28 UK screens.Becoming Victoria Woodopened on 23 screens across the country earlier this month, making £21,000 on its opening weekend, towards a current total of £61,000.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

She builtthat trailer. She created the cliffhanger, she selected the music. Same thing with the ad campaign that we’re seeing worldwide now in almost 30 countries.”The film is Brett Ratner’s first project since hefaced multiple accusations of sexual misconductin 2017. The director denied all the allegations and no charges were brought.Ratner is best known for the Rush Hour franchise, a fourth instalment of which was recently greenlit by Paramount, after Trumpcalled for the series to be revived.Explore more on these topicsFilmMelania TrumpDocumentary filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

As vice-chair of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the ruling body of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), he is the second-most powerful person in China’s military, after Xi, the commander-in-chief.But on Saturday, China’s defence ministryannouncedthat Zhang and Liu Zhenli, another CMC member, were under investigation for “suspected serious violations of discipline and law”, party-speak for corruption.Zhang and Liu have not been formally removed from the party or the commission, but being placed under investigation is all but certain to lead to those outcomes.“This is easily the most significant PLA purge in the post-Mao era,” said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society thinktank. “It’s hard to overstate how rare this is … it would be like arresting the chair of the US joint chiefs of staff for corruption.”View image in fullscreenZhang Youxia at a naval symposium in Qingdao in April 2024.Photograph: Florence Lo/ReutersA Sunday editorial in the PLA’s official newspaper laid out the charges against Zhang and Liu. The men allegedly “seriously betrayed the trust and expectations” of the party and the CMC and “fostered political and corruption problems that undermined the party’s absolute leadership over the military”.Precise details of the allegations have not been revealed, but the editorial suggests that political problems were a factor as well as corruption.Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore, said Zhang’s recent appearance alongside Xi and his nomination to the CMC at the 20th party congress in 2022, when he was past the normal retirement age, indicated that he was a trusted figure until relatively recently. “Corruption does not just happen overnight,” Wu said.Zhang is the most senior in astring of top PLA officialswho have been defenestrated in recent years, includingLi Shangfu, the former defence minister, who was kicked off the CMC in 2023 and expelled from the party in 2024. The Wall Street Journal reported that Zhang’s downfall was linked to the fact that he had promoted Li.Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University and a former senior CIA analyst, said a power struggle was a more likely explanation than corruption. The purge “isn’t about corruption, it isn’t about leaking secrets, it is about a general that became too powerful”, he said.graphic depicting the leadership of the CMCWhatever the reason for Zhang’s fall from grace, one thing is certain: Xi wants him gone.“The fact that Xi is purging his right-hand man in the military is a shocking development, which suggests Zhang was guilty of a significant betrayal of Xi’s trust,” Thomas said.Zhang was once considered to be one of Xi’s closest military allies. He is a fellow Communist party “princeling”, the son of revolutionaries who served under Mao Zedong. He is one of the few generals to have seen active combat as a frontline officer during China’s conflict with Vietnam in 1978.These credentials, and the fact Xi handpicked him to serve on the CMC, might have suggested a degree of political protection.But Xi seems determined to prove otherwise. “For Xi, there’s nothing more important than strengthening party discipline and ensuring it does not go the same way as the Soviet Communist party, which in his view was rendered ineffective by corruption,” said Thomas. “No one is safe in Beijing because Xi puts the party above any individual.”The party’s control of the armed forces is central to its, and therefore Xi’s, grip on power. That means that Xi is willing to assert his authority at all costs, even if the result is a somewhat absurd CMC lineup effectively down to two people: Xi himself and the CMC’s anti-corruption chief, Zhang Shengmin.View image in fullscreenZhang Shengmin at the opening session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing in March 2025.Photograph: Florence Lo/ReutersFor western analysts, the biggest question is what it means for China’s military buildup, and particularly its readiness to launch an assault on Taiwan. US intelligence believes Xi has ordered the military to be ready to win a fight for it by 2027, making this a crucial year for modernisation. Unification with the self-governing island which Beijing claims as its territory is one of Xi’s main priorities and he has not ruled out the use of force to achieve it.Some argue that the purges make an attack on Taiwan less likely, at least in the short term, because the army does not have the high level decision-making capacity to launch a sophisticated operation. “It gives the US military more time to prepare for a Taiwan conflict,” said Wilder.Others caution that the ousted men could be replaced by a younger, more aggressive lineup of officers who are unlikely to question their leader.Lyle Goldstein, the director of the Asia programme at Defense Priorities, a US foreign policy thinktank, noted that China had unveiled a suite of powerful new weapons at its military parade in September, a sabre-rattling display of bravado.“I think it would be a major mistake to assume that the Chinese military lacks capable senior officers or that it is less likely to move against Taiwan due to this recent shake-up of the CMC,” he said.One aspect widely agreed on is that the investigations will not end with Zhang and Liu. Scholars of the Chinese Communist party describe corruption as a feature of the system, not a bug. Zhang and Liu are likely to be interrogated about whatever offences they are specifically accused of, which will throw up more names. “More arrests are likely,” Wu said.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

More soon please!Hannah J DaviesMon 26 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTShareAfter decades as a BBC journalist and – latterly – one of the corporation’s best-known news presenters, you may well associateClive Myriewith more serious endeavours. Indeed, it was a little jarring to see him – just a few hours before presenting the latest Trump-flavoured bulletin last Tuesday – reclining on the One Show sofa to promote his latest travelogue, declaring himself “a warrior god”. As unlikely as this recent-ish pivot might seem (he previously presented Clive Myrie’s Italian Road Trip in 2023, and the Bafta-winning Clive Myrie’s Caribbean Adventure in 2024), I’m here for it. As a chronicler of cultures, Myrie is faultlessly fun and eager, and his African Adventure is no exception. This series of 10 half-hour episodes set in South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and Morocco is infused with joy and hope, while also not entirely adopting a fingers-in-ears approach to some of the bigger issues affecting the continent – be it environmental concerns or health inequalities.We kick off in SouthAfrica, a place Myrie knows well from his time posted there as a foreign correspondent for the BBC. He catches up with a former colleague, Milton Nkosi, and the pair reflect on the stories we tend to hear about the country. The news, says Nkosi, “is not wrong, but it can be one-sided”. Their episode in Soweto is a beautiful thing: a corrective to some of those more difficult stories about the country and its largest township, which also acknowledges its complex history. Myrie was, he says, inspired to get into journalism in the first place by the stories he saw on the news back home in Bolton about apartheid. Now, all these decades later, he finds himself having lunch with Nkosi and Ndileka Mandela, Nelson’s eldest granddaughter. They reflect on Mandela Sr’s humanity, and Myrie seems genuinely touched to find out that – by chance – they’re even eating the great man’s favourite food (braised oxtail, if you were wondering).View image in fullscreenYou absolutely cannot fault his enthusiasm … Clive Myrie’s African Adventure.Photograph: BBC/Alleycats TVSouth Africa is full of fun: “Banksy who?” says Myrie, as he grabs a spray can and helps artist Senzo Nhlapo with some street art. Mucking in is the theme of the whole series, in fact, whether he’s cooking a huge pot of bunny chow, a South African dish with Indian roots (“I feel like I’m rowing a boat in the Oxford and Cambridge boat race,” he says, the stirring proving a challenge) or helping out at a craft centre in Durban supporting women with HIV/Aids (“maybe in about six months,” he says, looking down at the minuscule part of a beaded pin he has managed to complete, “I would have a South African flag”). Whether it’s trapeze lessons or jazz drumming or dancing to the country’s thriving amapiano dance music, you absolutely cannot fault his enthusiasm.As mentioned, the series doesn’t shy away from some of the more difficult issues affecting Africa. The strongest part of the series are the episodes filmed in Ghana, where Myrie covers much ground – contemporary and historical. As the child of Jamaican parents who came to Britain during the Windrush era, Myrie knew he had West African descent due to transatlantic slavery. Here, he visits the vast fortresses where enslaved people were held: “I’ve spent my whole life reporting on the inhumanity of human beings to fellow human beings,” he says, “but this is personal.” He is also welcomed by the Fante people in a naming ceremony that is a pure delight to watch, and he is thrilled with his new sobriquet: Papa Kojo Abaka. As for the contemporary, the deeply troubling issue of textile waste (much of it from the west) leads Myrie to visit the Or Foundation in Accra, masters of recycled fashion who make him a fetching outfit from sportswear that would otherwise have ended up polluting the country’s beaches. He meets people with ingenious ideas for solving the continent’s biggest problems, including a startup whose AI-powered chatbot aims to give Nigerians health advice on the go, amid a worrying shortage of doctors (staggeringly, we are told, around a third of all maternal deaths across the world occur in the country).The Morocco episodes feel most like a traditional travelogue, but they’re still a lot of fun – even if Goat Milking with Clive Myrie does have a touch of the Partridge about it, as an idea. Really, though, this is a wonderful series which shows that the much-maligned celebrity travel show can be educational, informative and really moving (and, crucially, that destinations other than Italy are available). And with so much more of Africa to see, here’s hoping they give him a few weeks off from the news again soon.Clive Myrie’s African Adventure aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewClive MyrieAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

For the rest of the fashion industry, it is a battle for bragging rights between the haughtiest brand names in the world. With ambitious young designers newly installed at Dior and Chanel vying for domination, that battle is feistier than ever.Haute couture is an arms race like no other. At 10 o’clock on a Monday morning, the Oscar nomineeTeyana Taylorwas in a diamond tiara in the front row of Schiaparelli, where the house is preparing for a lavish exhibition opening at the V&A Museum this spring. A few hours later in the garden of the Rodin Museum, where a mirrored Dior catwalk reflected a suspended canopy of lush moss studded with silk flowers, Pharrell Williams and the actor Josh O’Connor arrived promptly, but the show was delayed an hour for the arrival of Rihanna in a black satin cocoon coat.View image in fullscreenCharming floral motifs became snowball-sized earmuffs of cyclamen.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersJonathan Anderson, the 41-year-old Northern Irish designer who took over as creative director last year, is spinning the historic house ofDioroff on a tangent. For this first haute couture show, the hourglass silhouette of Christian Dior’s 1947 New Look became a silk georgette cocktail dress with pleats that twisted around the body like clay thrown on a pottery wheel. The shape, inspired by the work of the Kenyan-born British ceramicist Dame Magdalene Odundo, brought an urgent, kinetic energy to Dior’s classic curves. Meanwhile, the charming floral motifs adored by Monsieur Dior, a devoted gardener, became snowball-sized earmuffs of cyclamen, inspired by a bouquet which John Galliano, one of Anderson’s predecessors in the Dior job, brought as a gift when he visited the atelier last year.The myth of Dior is built on curvaceous dresses and bestselling floral fragrance. But Anderson is gambling on re-energising the house by leaning into its dramatic backstory, rather than selling nostalgia for midcentury femininity in pursuit of a quick megabuck. At a preview before the show, he said “the guy” – meaning the house’s founder, Christian Dior – “changed fashion in 10 years. Hitchcock, cinema, everything. The shows he did, we look at them now as classicism, but at the time people were quite confused by them. And then he dropped dead.” (Dior died in 1957, just 10 years after the collection that made him a star.)Anderson added: “It is very intimidating to do this job, because you are going up against people who are in the history books. My Dior is never going to be a formula, because my brain doesn’t work like that. I get bored too quickly. Everyone wants every designer right now to work out the brand, like, tomorrow. But Dior is ginormous. If I was to lock it down right now, and it was all perfect, you would never turn up to shows any more because there would be nothing to see. It has to be about the creative process.”View image in fullscreenJonathan Anderson said of his designs: ‘My Dior is never going to be a formula, because my brain doesn’t work like that.’Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersAnderson’s resistance to straightforward prettiness is divisive, but his reading of the history of Dior is that shock value can sell. “I believe that ideas can make money,” he said. “Dior was a genius business guy. He licensed his designs to make a lot of money.” His new look Dior has an alternative spirit but is grounded by accessories that suggest a gimlet eye on the bottom line. Loafers with Dior-branded cameo motifs, collectible clutch bags, and evening stoles thrown nonchalantly over an arm or a shoulder so that the Christian Dior label is on show, all pointed to strong commercial instincts. The collection will be on public display at the Rodin Museum, where the show was held, for a week-long exhibition beginning 28 January, which will also feature archival looks from Christian Dior’s first shows, and ceramics by Odundo which inspired Anderson.There was a rare bright spot in what has been a bruising week for Victoria Beckham, when the designer was presented with the Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters at a ceremony and champagne reception hosted by the French minister for culture, Rachida Dati. The event, the timing of which was planned months before last week’sexplosive statementfrom Beckham’s oldest son Brooklyn, was Beckham’s first public appearance since the story broke.View image in fullscreenVictoria, Harper, Romeo and David Beckham leaving their hotel in Paris on Monday.Photograph: Jean-Marc Haedrich/SIPA/ShutterstockThe Beckhams, Brooklyn excepted, put on an emphatic united front. David Beckham, formally dressed in a double-breasted suit, watched the presentation accompanied by the couple’s three younger children, who had travelled to celebrate the honour. Beckham herself cut a composed but low-key figure in an understated black dress, giving a short, formal speech thanking her husband, and “my parents and my children for always believing in my vision”. She called the award, which recognises her contribution to Paris fashion week where she has staged shows since 2022, “a profound privilege which reflects years of commitment and dedication”.The turnout reflected a notable show of solidarity with Beckham from the fashion industry. Anna Wintour, the former British Vogue editor Edward Enninful, the supermodel Helena Christensen, the designer Haider Ackermann, the photographer Juergen Teller and French industry titans Antoine Arnault and François Pinault greeted the designer’s appearance on stage with a prolonged round of applause. Dati was lavish in praise of Beckham, calling her “a woman of your time” who “makes Paris shine, and describing her as “a global icon who holds a very special place in the hearts of the French people”.Explore more on these topicsHaute couture showsDiorVictoria BeckhamFranceParisEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to avoid thatMadeleine AggelerMon 26 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 12.02 ESTShareRecently, I decided to go for a jog after not running at all for more than [redacted] years. I did a half-marathon a couple of presidential administrations ago, so surely it would be fine? It was! Until the next morning, when I rolled out of bed, put my feet on the floor and felt a sharp pain in my heel.Plantar fasciitis, my old nemesis.Maybe yours, too. It’s one of the most common causes of heel pain, affecting roughly 2 million people each year in the US, says Dr Lance Silverman, board-certified orthopedic foot and ankle surgeon. About 10% of people in the UK and US will experience it at some point in their lives.Even the pros fall victim to it. “I don’t even know if I’ve admitted this to my wife or not, but I have had some plantar fasciitis in the last year or so,” says Dr Amiethab Aiyer, division chief of foot and ankle surgery in the Johns Hopkins department of orthopedic surgery. He suspects it was the result of suddenly cranking up the mileage on his treadmill. “I was in denial. But I’d get out of bed, and oh boy, there it is.”So what exactly is plantar fasciitis, and how can you avoid it? We asked the experts.What is plantar fasciitis?To understand plantar fasciitis, you have to get familiar with the plantar fascia first, says Aiyer.The plantar fascia is a thick band of fibrous tissue that runs from the bottom of the heel all the way to the toes. It is a ligament that connects the bones of the foot to one another, and supports the arch of the foot.“The plantar fascia is constantly working to support our day-to-day activities,” says Aiyer. Whether you’re running, walking, standing or doing any sort of weight-bearing activity, you’re using your plantar fascia.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Plantar fasciitis occurs when this ligament becomes inflamed or develops microtears. Generally, this presents as pain in the bottom of one’s heel that increases after periods of rest (like sleeping or sitting at a desk) and lessens as one moves around. “About 80% of these [cases] resolve on their own within a year,’ says Dr Brennan Boettcher, a sports medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic.But if healing is delayed by continued overuse, warns Silverman, this could lead to the formation of large, painful scar tissue, which can lead to chronic heel pain.What causes plantar fasciitis?Plantar fasciitis happens when the plantar fascia is overloaded, says Silverman. This could be a result of sudden increases in activity (like going for a jog after not running for more than [redacted] years), prolonged standing, weight gain, abnormal arches or repetitive stress.How can you prevent plantar fasciitis?There are a number of ways to protect your plantar fascia.Strengthen the muscles of the feet.Silverman suggests doing toe curls (with your feet flat on a towel, grip the towel with your toes and scrunch it towards your body) or marble pickups (using your toes to pick up marbles or similar objects from the floor).Stretching.Specifically, stretching the calf muscles and the achilles tendon. Regularly stretching and massaging these areas “can help to not only assuage the inflammation, but prevent it from coming back”, says Aiyer.Increase activity levels gradually.Allow your body to get acclimated to increases in activity levels rather than suddenly ramping up. Basically, don’t do what I did.Wear the right shoes.Choose a shoe that’s too supportive, and your foot muscles can weaken over time, says Silverman. But choose a shoe that’s not supportive enough, and you may expose your plantar fascia to more direct trauma. Rather than sweating this Goldilocks challenge, Silverman says you should “choose footwear that matches the environment and activity”.How do you treat plantar fasciitis?Most cases of plantar fasciitis will resolve on their own after a week or so of rest. But according to theCleveland Clinic, if the pain and symptoms don’t improve in a week or two, you should consult with a healthcare provider.Feel your feelings and reconnect with past passions: how to recover from burnoutRead more“Our first line of treatment often includes a short period of rest, activity modification, and initiation of stretching exercises and strengthening exercises,” says Boettcher. He adds that the rest period should be limited. One of the most common mistakes Boettcher sees in his clinic is people staying off their feet for long periods of time. “We sometimes see patients who are immobilized in a cast or walking boot for weeks or months,” he says. “That often leads to muscle atrophy and weakness.”Physical therapy and regular foot strengthening works “the vast majority of the time”, says Aiyer. But if symptoms persist after several months, physicians may treat the condition with corticosteroid injections, shockwave therapy or plasma injections.Extreme cases may require surgery, but these are rare, says Silverman. He explains that these procedures involve excising thickened tissue along the fascia.What should someone who went jogging after [redacted] years of not running do?I’m happy to say that after a few weeks of gentle, non-overloading activity, my heel feels great. I can probably lace up my sneakers again soon, but I’ll probably stick to my current preferred form of cardio: walking slowly on the treadmill while watching murder mysteries on my iPad.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After arresting political opponents, banning the most popular political party and using violence to crush dissent, the military’s proxy is on course to win by a landslide.“This is a fake election,” says a man who voted on Sunday in Mandalay, the second most populous city, his finger freshly dipped in purple ink. Like many, he voted only out of fear, worried that junta officials could retaliate if he stayed home.“They are heartless people. Right now, we don’t have a future, we don’t have freedom, we can’t speak freely,” he says. He spoke anonymously and moved on quickly, nervous that police and election officials were watching. Before hurrying away, he adds of the military: “They kill my brothers.”‘We are always living in fear’: inside Myanmar’s ‘sham’ electionRead moreAfter seizing power in a coup five years ago, imprisoningAung San Suu Kyithe then state counsellor and de facto leader, and ousting her government,security forces gunned down pro-democracy protestersin the streets and went door-to-door arresting people who opposed its rule. Many took up arms in response,triggering a warthat has swept across the country, drawing in ethnic armed groups that have long fought with the military. The junta has torched homes, massacred villagers and launched airstrikes repeatedly on civilian infrastructure to suppress its opponents, according to UN experts and rights groups.View image in fullscreenMyanmar voters arrive to cast ballots during the third phase of the general election at a polling station in Yangon, Myanmar, 25 January 2026.Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPAJust a few hours drive away from central Mandalay, the fighting has continued to rage. Voting was cancelled in rural areas of Mandalay region because of the conflict, according to local media.In urban areas, voting proceeded under the watch of armed police. At sunrise, families, packed on motorbikes, arrived at polling stations and filed beneath blue gazebos to vote.Few believe the election will bring any change. The military will try to present a facade of democracy, says Kyaw Kyaw*, a Mandalay resident, adding: “They cannot change reality.” The same problems will persist for the people: repressive laws and continued fighting, he says. He does not expect either side to relent.It’s feared fighting could even worsen. The military has lost swathes of territory to opposition groups over recent years but,supported by China, it has begun to regain momentum on the battlefield and is ramping up airstrikes to take back ground.Mandalay city is peaceful, but the city’s proximity to conflict areas, and to the Mandalay PDF, one of the more powerful anti-junta groups formed after the coup, has led to disrupted trade routes and restrictions on the sale of various goods. Prices for basic items such as rice and cooking oil have tripled since the coup, estimates Kyaw Kyaw. The number of displaced people who have fled to the city to escape conflict has also soared, driving up housing costs, he added.Last year’s devastating earthquake, which destroyed buildings across Mandalay, has caused further strain. The once 12-storey Sky Villa condo is now just a vacant spot hidden behind blue sheets of metal. Along the road, cars that were dragged from its collapsed car park lie mangled and abandoned.View image in fullscreenMilitary chief Min Aung Hlaing visits a polling station during the third and final phase of Myanmar’s general election.Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty ImagesThe biggest sites, like Sky Villa, have been cleared, but other buildings remain cracked and damaged. “Definitely, some residential buildings in Mandalay are not safe to live in after the earthquake,” says Kyaw Kyaw. People in taller apartments are especially nervous, but even those in smaller wooden homes feel paranoid whenever they sense shaking.Almost everyone avoids talking about politics in public, nervous others could listen in and report them. “They could be everywhere in tea shops,” says another Mandalay resident, Thandar*, 35, of the security forces and their informants. Residents live in fear of being stopped by the authorities and having their phones searched for banned VPNs or social media posts that show support for the military’s opponents.There is no doubt the military’s proxy party, Union Solidarity and Development party, is set to win a landslide victory in the election. It fielded the most candidates and secured the majority of seats in previous rounds.Many expect junta chief Min Aung Hlaing will become president, though some have questioned if he will carve out a special role that allows him to retain both political power and continue being military commander in chief. He has defended the vote as free and fair, and said it has the support of the public.The UN, and western governments including the UK and Australia, as well as the EU’s top rights official have rejected the vote as lacking legitimacy. The regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, did not send observers and will not endorse the poll. China, however, a key military ally, is backing the vote.Turnout in early rounds of the month-long election has been low, at 55%, compared with about 70% in previous elections – despite the military reportedly threatening residents of repercussions if they did not participate.In urban areas of Mandalay, local officials blasted out reminders about the election on loudspeakers, Thandar says. Once polling stations had opened on Sunday, they went door to door, including to her home, telling residents to go out and vote. Still many defied the orders, including Thandar. The vote was not fair, she says. “I don’t care for their threats.”*Names have been changed.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

After he is dragged away from the woman he was trying to help, a gaggle of ICE officers surround Pretti and force him to the ground, beating and restraining him there as he struggles to free himself.At least10 shotsappear to be fired within the span of five seconds. Pretti is splayed motionless on the asphalt. “What the fuck, they killed him,” a bystander’s voice can be heard screaming in one of several videos of the incident. “Did they fucking kill that guy?” Like his fellow Minneapolis resident Renee Good, who was also killed by ICE this month, Alex Pretti was 37.Trump administration and border patrol officials immediately sought to cast Pretti, like Good, as a villain. After the US senator from Minnesota Amy Klobuchar posted on X about Pretti’s killing, saying: “Donald Trump and all your lieutenants who ordered this ICE surge: watch the horrific video of the killing today,” Stephen Miller, the senior White House official,replied saying: “A domestic terrorist tried to assassinate federal law enforcement and this is your response?” Miller provided zero evidence for the terrorism label or for the assassination attempt claims.Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, also described Pretti, a nurse, as a “domestic terrorist” without providing evidence. Meanwhile the border patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who wears an olive-green greatcoat thatGerman media outletsliken to a “Nazi uniform”, said it “looks like” Pretti “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement”. He also did not present any evidence for his claims.The administration also claimed that Pretti, who was licensed to carry a legal firearm, was attacking the ICE officers. This claim is contradicted by the video evidence, which shows Pretti filming ICE – a constitutionally protected activity – and seeking to assist fellow observers who were being hurt by the agents, with one hand holding his phone and another shielding his face from pepper spray.Ella Baron on the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis – cartoonRead moreWe can believe what both video evidence and ICE’s own past behavior suggest: that Pretti was observing the actions of federal agents who are engaged in a military occupation of his home city; that he was looking to make the agents’ work of ethnically cleansing his neighbors more onerous, but that he was not looking to engage in violence; that he was peacefully exercising his right to observe Trump’s agents and to voice his disagreement with what they were doing. And that he was killed for it. The videos of Pretti’s shooting are disturbing. When dissidents face summary executions by armed, masked thugs in a totalitarian regime, they are usually read accusations in a mock trial before they face the firing squad. Pretti didn’t even get that.Pretti was just one of the thousands of Minneapolis residents who have been called to resist the occupation of their city by ICE. Every day, as immigrant families in the Twin Cities hide in their homes, those with citizenship brave the streets to bring them groceries and medicine. Patrols of local parents supervise school and daycare drop off, so that children and parents won’t be snatched away by agents; others follow ICE vehicles in their cars, and look to record as many arrests as possible on video, so that the families of the disappeared can be contacted. Many ordinary people in Minneapolis now wear whistles around their necks as they attempt to go about their daily lives, so that when the gangs of men appear, they can alert those around them with the shrill sounds. “They’re here!” these Minnesotans can be heard calling out in the videos that now emerge daily from a city under siege. “Stay inside!”What these people are doing is protecting their neighbors, seeking to help those more vulnerable with gestures that are ordinary, effortful and kind. These gestures have also become dangerous. With the slaughter of Good, and now of Pretti, it has become clear that ICE does not want to be watched. They seem to be targeting ordinary Minnesotans – especially the helpers, the observers and the growing masses who are standing up to oppose them. The result is killings of citizens in broad daylight.In both the Good and Pretti killings, ICE officers reacted to a calm observer with indignant violence. Videos show ICE officers escalating situations and pulling their guns with needless eagerness. In both the Good and Pretti killings, the response of the administration has seemed to suggest that opposing the violent occupation and mass ethnic cleansing operation that ICE is being deployed to conduct is worthy of a death sentence.It is of course well known by now that ICE agents do not want to be seen. They cover their faces; they drive unmarked cars; they have been told by their own leadership not to wear insignia stating that they work for any of the deportation agencies when they are off the clock. The gangs of masked, armed men committing anonymous violence in the streets of Minneapolis of course evoke past instances of racial terror in America – like the masked men of the Ku Klux Klan, who also did their best to eradicate racial undesirables from American communities.Any path back to political stability in the United States must involve a reckoning with what ICE is doingPerhaps ICE’s homicidal rage at the Americans who film them represents this same refusal to countenance being seen, being witnessed, being documented doing what they are doing to innocent people. In that sense, perhaps their actions towards observers like Good and Pretti exhibit a sense of shame. Some, like Tom Nolan, a former Boston police commander and criminology professor who once advised the DHS on civil rights issues, are calling Pretti’s death at ICE’s hands astone cold murder. You could also call it the elimination of a witness.ICE agents know, as we all do, that one day the Trump regime will come to an end. And they know, as more and more of even once reticent Americans are now coming to understand, that there can be no quiet moving on from the Trump era, no calm, forward-looking determination to absolve the Trump regime and its agents of their actions.Any path back to political stability in the United States must involve a reckoning with what ICE is doing – on the streets, in its camps, and to people like Pretti and Good. Any restoration of something like a republic in America will require, as a precondition, investigations, prosecutions and tribunals to assess and punish those responsible for these actions.The ICE agents who shot Good and Pretti know that the whole world can see them; they know that their countrymen, enraged and called to heroism and witness, will not look away. If they are trying to eliminate witnesses, they cannot eliminate us all. There will be an accounting one day, and though Pretti and Good will not live to see it, many of us will – many of the ICE agents now terrorizing America will, too. As thepoet wrote, “After such knowledge, what forgiveness?” These killers, deep down, must know that they will not be forgiven.It is small comfort to those who loved him that in his last act of witnessing, Pretti has now called thousands more to witness the horrors of their time – no matter the consequences that such a reckoning threatens. After his death, a video of Pretti was released by those who knew him as the nurse at work, at the VA hospital. It is customary there for staff to read out loud a tribute to veterans when one dies in their care.In the video, Pretti can be seen reading this final salute to an elderly veteran who died in his unit. “Today, we remember that freedom is not free,” Pretti reads. “We have to work at it, nurture it, protect it and even sacrifice for it.” Pretti sacrificed, too. We must all be at least as brave as he was.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Putin is weaponising the savage eastern European winterMon 26 Jan 2026 11.44 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 11.49 ESTShareIn the winter of 1993, during thesiege of Sarajevo, people burned books and furniture to keep warm. Water froze in pipes. Electricity vanished for the duration of the war. Children slept in coats and hats, their breath visible in dark rooms. Cold itself became a weapon of war.I remember, when I was reporting from the Bosnian capital, seeingdoctors operating by candlelight or wearing camping headlamps. I remember old people chopping wood in the park in the centre of the city until there were no trees left, then dragging it home on sledges. I remember the ground being too frozen to bury the many dead on the football pitch, which later became a cemetery. I remember a terrible, frozen day when I went to an old people’s home near a frontline and counted dead body after dead body, all frozen in their sleep.Three decades later, I am watchinganother winter war– this time in Ukraine. It is a human-made catastrophe. Russia is now systematically targeting the country’s energy infrastructure.Since last mid-autumn, attacks on power and heating systems across eastern, central and southern Ukraine – includingKyiv, Odesa andKharkiv– have forceddaily electricity outages. Until December, power cuts followed a grim rhythm: four hours on, four hours off, all day and night. Twelve hours of light and warmth, 12 hours of darkness and cold.According to Ukraine’s minister of economy, Oleksii Sobolev, thetotal damage to its energy infrastructurefrom these attacks over the past three months will cost an estimated $1bn to address. But no statistic can capture what it means to live in a city where winter has beendeliberately turned into a tool of terror.Ending the war in Ukraine has more support than ever. So why is peace still not in sight? | Gwendolyn SasseRead moreOn 9 January 2026, a massive strike on Kyiv’s energy grid left6,000 residential buildings– about half of the city’s housing supply – without heating. On20 January, another attackcut power from more than 5,600 buildings, many of them the same ones. On 24 January, the same neighbourhoods were hit again: 6,000 buildings lost heating, with 3,200 buildings still without as night fell.This is happening as temperatures in Kyiv fall to between –15C (5F) and –18C, dropping to –20C at night. During a Zoom call I had last week with the human rights lawyer andNobel peace prize winner Oleksandra Matviichuk, she sat wrapped in a parka and scarves, refusing to complain. “It’s not your fault,” she said when I apologised, embarrassed that my colleagues at The Reckoning Project are suffering so valiantly.Another Reckoning Project colleague, Maksimas Milta, lives in Podil, one of Kyiv’s oldest neighbourhoods. In one week in January, he was without electricity for 98 hours out of 168. The following week, 99 hours without power. Yet he went to work every day, refusing to complain. This is not a temporary disruption. It is a siege by other means.One day, people will recall these terrible stories. On 21 January, Oleksii Brekht, the former acting CEO of Ukraine’s electricity transmission operator,was killedwhile working at a damaged substation. In the city of Dnipro, divers from the emergency services areentering the freezing Dnipro River, working for hours in sub-zero temperatures to repair heating pipelines. This is heroism, but it is also desperation: people are freezing to death. They have to do something.Ukrainians havebegun calling this reality “kholodomor”– death by cold – an echo ofHolodomor, the human-made famine Stalin used to crush Ukraine in the 1930s. Then, hunger was the weapon. Now, it is winter.Inside apartments, people heat bricks on gas stoves and use them as makeshift radiators. Families pitch hiking tents in their living rooms, sheltering inside them in thermal clothes and sleeping bags. Schools in Kyiv have extended holidays until February; elsewhere, children are back online because classrooms are too cold.View image in fullscreenPeople in Kyiv warm their hands over a barbecue at a blackout party during an electricity outage on 24 January 2026.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersOne of the cruellest stories from the winter cold is that of military veterans with bionic prosthetics. Without electricity, they cannot recharge their limbs.And yet, amid this suffering engineered byVladimir Putin, something extraordinary persists. People keep going, refusing to be broken by Moscow.Someday, people will tell these stories, too: how supermarkets now allow stray dogs and cats inside to keep warm; how young people, refusing to lose their youth, organise generator-powered raves in courtyards, dancing in the dark as an act of defiance. This defiance is Ukraine’s trademark – an act of fierce rebellion against Russia.I remember this all from my Sarajevo days. The refusal to be broken. The refusal to lose humour, despite nearly four years of siege. The bars that were heated with open gas pipes that flamed dangerously as you sat down and ordered a black market whisky. The laughter at an underground party in a bomb shelter. The strength it took to burn your PhD thesis that took six years to write, to heat a room so that your family could survive.Let’s be honest. The purpose of Putin’s attacks is not only physical destruction. It is psychological warfare. The Kremlin hopes civilians will break – but what they really want is for them to turn on their own government.During the Bosnian war, the international community failed to stop the siege and 100,000 people died who might have been alive today. We said “never again”, and then we looked away.In Ukraine, winter is a weapon as deadly as the drones that buzz through the frozen night skies, seeking prey. And the world must finally call it what it is: a war crime.Janine di Giovanni is a war correspondent and the executive director of The Reckoning Project, a war crimes unit in Ukraine, Sudan and GazaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As with thedefection of Robert Jenrickearlier this month, the continued “self-purge” of the “out-Reform Reform” brigade can only help the electoral fortunes of the Conservative party. As I said in a previous article, “wreckers like Braverman are why the public don’t like us”.For those of us who have long pointed out the utter failure of their strategy, it’s schadenfreude to see them leave a ship they themselves so effectively torpedoed. Reform UK is welcome to them. I suspect Nigel Farage will rue the day they came on board. ManyConservativeswill hope they have the same record of failure at their new party as they did at their last.Their hectoring, divisive and aggressive style was the ultimate turn-off for millions of centre-ground voters who had previously backed the Conservatives. Add to this their incompetence in government, as well as their lack of political strategy, and the Conservative party haemorrhaged support under their watch.Because their sense of political entitlement exists at stratospheric levels, there is no “you break it, you fix it” mantra for these people. Instead, they’ll leave their political mess of a Conservative party for someone else to clear up.They now argue, from Reform, that “Britain is broken”, as if they were not the ones involved in breaking it. Their rhetorical style is that of Momentum and Corbyn: it describes the problems rather then solving them. It’s negative politics. Yet what really matters to voters are positive solutions.More broadly, shedding this toxic, vote-destroying band of political losers may just give the leader,Kemi Badenoch, the glimmer of a chance to get the party back on track – and at a time when it feels the leadership has been perhaps surer-footed than over the past several disastrous years.It’s a small window of opportunity, but the defections can give Badenoch greater freedom to take a step in the right direction. The Conservative party can only win by returning to the mainstream of British politics, focused on aspiration, access to opportunity, stronger social mobility and a vision of equality of opportunity for all.The new centre-right group that I am supporting,Prosper UK, launched earlier today, could be a vehicle for Badenoch to steer the party in the right direction. It’s a long way back, but let’s finally all agree: we’ve reached the end of the political cul-de-sac that Braverman, Jenrick and co so catastrophically led the party down.The battle for a rejuvenated Conservative party truly begins today. It could offer millions of disenfranchised centre-right voters the choice they so badly deserve.Justine Greeningwas the Conservative MP for Putney from 2005 to 2019Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Everyone likes himZoe WilliamsLabour may have successfully blocked the mayor of Greater Manchester from running for parliament, but this definitely hasn’t solved their problemsMon 26 Jan 2026 10.17 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 11.42 ESTShareSome people callAndy BurnhamLabour’s prince across the water and others call him the King of the North. Those are two pretty different symbolisms – the first referring to James Francis Edward Stuart, the exiled son of James II, the second referring to Robb Stark, and later Jon Snow, from Game of Thrones. Everyone on Team Starmer will be sticking with the Stuarts, since that whole saga was defined by fakery and flakery. Since the moment of his birth, there were rumours that James was an impostor. It was all a little bit convenient that, just as his father was about to be deposed, this heir would appear. If history had taught the era anything, it was that having sons could not possibly be that easy.The Starks, by contrast, were known for honour, bravery and legitimacy, even the ones that were definitely illegitimate. The fact that they are also fictional is a side issue, really, given that none of these routes to power – commanding fealty, raising troops – has much to teach any pretender to Labour’s throne.The rebel’s basic checklist is as follows: they need an absolutely minute knowledge of the party’s rulebook, yet at the same time, an understanding that the rule-based order is over. Item one in Labour lore used to be that, unlike the Conservatives, they found it more or less impossible to change the leader until he’d lost an election. If that was true even in opposition – which is where they normally are – it was so much truer while they were actually governing that it’s never really been worth examining other, lesser rules, such as “what’s the national executive committee (NEC) allowed to do again?”So when Burnham’s desire for a parliamentary seat was just a (very loud) rumour last week, there was a lot of speculation about what cards the NEC had up their sleeve – would they demand an all-female shortlist for the seat vacated by Andrew Gwynne? An all-people of colour shortlist? The staggering and self-defeating cynicism of either move, from a leadership that had no discernible qualms about female or minority representation where the 2024 election was concerned, was priced in. Of course they’re cynical – they’re trying to run a country here. That’s what government is like.In the event, they went for the much simpler, committee-says-no solution,blocking Burnham because he already has a job, as the mayor of Greater Manchester. It was smart in the sense of being self-evident and dumb in the sense that it failed to address the real source of Burnham’s threat: people like him.It’s just one of those unfortunate coalitions: everyone who wishes a Labour government stood for something, and had a discernible sense of purpose, likes Burnham; everyone who has fond memories of the Blair years likes him, but everyone who hated the Blair years also likes him. He has somehow managed to put clear blue water between his current self and his 90s self, and maybe all that water imagery did the trick, in a roundabout sort of a way, or maybe he’s an entirely different politician to the one he was – or maybe just being different to the ones in government is enough. Everyone who doesn’t really concentrate on politics likes him, perceiving his effectiveness in Manchester, and sensing somehow that he’s on their level – people are much more into a politician who knows the bus fare than one who knows the price of milk. Everyone who does concentrate on politics is exhausted by watching the discourse, horrified, through their fingers, as the entire mainstream seeks to chase off Reform politics by sounding exactly like it.In other words, that’s pretty much everyone, as evidenced by Burnham’sfavourability ratings last September, which were +7. Some other time we can worry about the state of the nation – that a single digit positive would be such a skyscraper on the political landscape – while every other leader is well underground.A YouGov pollthis month put Keir Starmer equal with Trump, at -56, and less popular than everyone except Vladimir Putin and Hamas.This saga isn’t going to end quietly, but nor is there anything obvious the Labour leadership could have done instead to assure its own survival, except maybe go back in time, be more pluralistic and respect the broad church that delivered its victory. Or, to put it simply, be completely different in almost every way. Instead, we have all the backstabbing of Game of Thrones and none of the dragons; the worst of all possible worlds.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But nation states in the Americas have spent more time with open borders than closedMon 26 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 12.02 ESTShareLate last year, Donald Trump’s White House published a newNational Security Strategy(NSS) outlining its vision for the world. At the time, the plan raised alarm fordismissing European alliances(now largely confirmed after Trumpthreatened Nato alliesoverGreenland), previewinginterventions in Latin America(also largely confirmed by recent military action inVenezuela), and aligning closely with the priorities of theKremlin.The document alsodemonizes immigrants. In one widely cited passage, it even claims that “unchecked migration” has gotten so out of control that Europe is facing imminent “civilizational erasure”. On these grounds, the plan makes ending “The Era of Mass Migration” a top priority for the US.It is one of the great marvels of our time that, in a world where governmentsspend more on border securitythan ever before, buildmore miles of border fencingthan ever before, deploy moremilitary-grade technologyto stop migration than ever before, spend more ondetention and deportationthan ever before, and knowingly causethousands of preventable deathsevery year by cutting off safe routes to migrate, people in power can look at the disastrous consequences of this system and unironically proclaim: “You know what our problem is? Open borders!”This is essentially what the NSS is saying, though, to be fair, it did not originate this marvel of modern absurdity. During the Biden administration, for example, afterarrests at the borderhit record highs,deportations spiked, and recordnumbers of asylum seekerspiled into overcrowded shelters and hotels (de facto detention centers since they werenot allowed to legally workor otherwise participate freely into society), a Republican senator from my home state of Texas whined that all of this amounted to a “radical experiment in open borders”. Not to be outdone, hisDemocratic opponentat the time made similar claims.The global rule of law is not collapsing – Trump is the lone problem and he can be defeated | Simon TisdallRead moreThe NSS still distinguishes itself, however, by applying this inverted way of thinking far beyond the Biden years, even to the point of making sweeping generalizations about the history of nations. As a historian of border policy, I find this part of the NSS particularly noteworthy.You can find thepassage in questionat the bottom of page 11, where the NSS blames “unchecked” migration for a host of social problems including: straining domestic resources, distorting labor markets, increasing crime, weakening social cohesion, and undermining national security. Rather than attempt to explain how immigration causes these problems, however, the argument looks for evidence in a curious reinterpretation of the past. To quote: “Throughout history, sovereign nations prohibited uncontrolled migration and granted citizenship only rarely to foreigners, who also had to meet demanding criteria. The West’s experience over the past decades vindicates this enduring wisdom.”To be clear, this version of history is nonsensical.My own researchexamines how nation states in the Americas have actually spent more time with open borders than with closed. In Latin America, many countries passed affirmative declarations protecting the right to immigrate, often going as far as to enshrine these rights in constitutions. In Central America, for example, the constitution of 1824 declared the entire region a “Sacred Asylum for all.” Far from viewing unimpeded migration as a threat to the national project, Central American policymakers proudly used open borders as a way to demonstrate the sovereignty of the newly formed government.In the US, open borders were more of a default policy born out of the absence of legal restrictions, but this was still the case for nearly the first 150 years the country’s existence.Immigrants were by default presumed admissible, and the federal government did not implement immigration restrictions at all until until the late 19th century when it singled out Chinese immigrants for exclusion, though borders remained open otherwise, and even many Chinese were able to evade these laws by naturalizing in other countries first, such as Mexico.It was not until the 1920s that federal lawmakers experimented with a fully closed-border system (defined as a system in which any immigrant is presumed inadmissible until they demonstrate that they fit into one of the restricted, previously defined categories that would make one admissible and have that admissibility officially recognized by the state). This was a massive expansion of federal powers, and under this clunky new system, some decades saw heavier enforcement than others – especially for racialized groups such asMexicansandHaitians– even as late as the 1980s, closed borders were flexible enough that alarge-scale amnesty programcould pass with relatively little controversy.The true historical deviation of “past decades”, therefore, has NOT been open borders. In fact, the real experiment has been making them militantly closed: a trend thataccelerated in 1990sunder the Clinton administration and intensified even moreafter 9/11.In sum, I actually agree with the NSS that our immigration system has been disastrous in the last few decades. I also agree that, in trying to envision a better future, it’s not a bad idea to take some inspiration from how early nations managed borders.Of course, that would mean embracing the “enduring wisdom” of open borders.It also worth noting that, according to a large body of corroborating evidence, the problems attributed to open borders by the NSS are actually caused by closed borders. Overwhelming evidence shows thatimmigrants do not costthe government in resources any more than citizens cost. What is costly, however, is arbitrarily rounding them up, detaining them, and deporting them. Opening borders would actually alleviate resource strains.Closed borders also distort labor markets. With closed borders, workers lack the freedom to move around looking for the best job, yet multinational corporations are free to shop around for the “cheapest” trapped labor pool.As I have written before, this is a massive grift, hurting workers on all sides of the border. Opening borders would alleviate these distortions.Still more, closed borders create optimal conditions for organized crime. Even though immigration itself does not increase crime – studies in the US, for example, have consistently shown that, on average,immigrants commit fewer crimesthan the native-born population – the fact that vulnerable people around the world need to move for their livelihoods, yet are not allowed to do so legally, hasincentivized cartelsto capitalize on the situation. Opening borders would reduce organized crime.There is also a case to be made that closed borders – or perhaps more specifically, the rhetoric calling for closed borders – actually weakens social cohesion. Studies show that people who havepersonal relationshipsor other forms ofpositive contactwith immigrantsare less likely to hold negative views toward unauthorized immigration. On the other hand, for people who lack these types of interactions, media images tend to matter more. And in the US, we are bombarded with a steadystream of defamatory newscalling immigration a crisis, even from politically “neutral” outlets. Accordingly, it’s not a huge stretch to hypothesize that replacing divisive rhetoric with informed discussions on the benefits of open borders might actually strengthen social cohesion.In this Trump era, we need satire more than ever. Just don’t expect it to save democracy | Alexander HurstRead moreFinally, we are at this very moment watching closed borders undermine national security by subjecting otherwise peaceful communities to the biggest security threat of all: the state itself. When closed-border zeal causes swarms ofheavily armedagents tostorm into communities,separate families, detain people indangerously deplorable conditions, and deploy increasingly unrestrainedviolence against people who object, no one is safer.Given this evidence, it is all the more vexing that people in power can so easily attribute the failures of our immigration system to the specter of “open borders”. The sheer audacity of blaming something that doesn’t exist is already pretty mind-boggling. But the whole thing is even more absurd considering that closed borders are causing these problems. I have been doing my best to explain this in academic terms for quite some time, though lately I find myself turning tosurrealist fictionto try to express how absurd this really is. The logic of our immigration system is backwards! How are policymakers getting away with this?It is worth noting, however, that as of late they seem to be getting away with it a lot less. Even before the killing of Renee Good set offprotests in Minneapolis,several major citiessaw mass protests in favor of immigrant protections, and countlesssmaller townsacross the country had likewise mobilized. Ultimately, these actions tell me that we are ready to have a serious conversation about the root of the problem: our failing experiment with closed borders.Daniel Mendiola is a professor of Latin American history and migration studies at Vassar CollegeExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionTrump administrationMigrationDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Watch out: you could be a Young 40Emma BeddingtonMillennials in South Korea are being mocked for trying too hard to follow fashion. It’s far better to accept the march of timeMon 26 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 09.19 ESTShareApparently, South Korea’s millennials are getting ribbed by gens Z and Alpha as mercilessly as their western counterparts. The BBC explainsthey are getting labelled and parodied as “Young 40s”. It’s a term that used to have positive connotations – youthful and “with it” (yes, an expression no one youthful or “with it” uses) – but is now more mocking. A “Young 40” is a try-hard, clinging to a dearly held idea of their own relevance.Some Young 40s the BBC interviewed sounded wounded and confused by their new status. “I’m just buying and wearing things I’ve liked for a long time, now that I can afford them,” one said of his skate gear and Air Jordans. “Why is this something to be attacked for?” Another felt self-conscious in interactions with younger colleagues: “I try to keep conversations focused on work or career concerns.”Realising you’re irrelevant stings the whole world over, but take heart, Young 40s. It gets better – soon you’ll just be old. A decade on from my own young 40s, no one could accuse me of trying too hard. I don’t know my Olivia Rodrigo from my Sabrina Carpenter, and I’ve stopped trying to keep up with jeans – they lost me at (honestly, way before) “horseshoe”. I’m at peace with not understanding fandom controversies or influencer gossip – I get enough drama from my own body, wondering if its newest weird development is just disgusting and embarrassing or might kill me.My lot, gen X, are past feeling hurt when people laugh at our band T-shirts and outdated references – we have real problems now, such as osteoporosis, high cholesterol, inadequate pensions and ailing parents. Besides, look at our idols! Documentaries about the edgy music scenes of our youth are peopled with unrecognisable grey-haired men who look as if they lodge well-researched comments on their local planning portal about the ecological impact of new developments on waterfowl, and women who are heavily into lino printing. And, mostly, they, we, seem fine with it.I’m not suggesting this sense of acceptance is definitive – God knows what’s round the corner – but I can promise the Young 40s it’s quite peaceful.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSouth KoreaOpinionAgeingcommentShareReuse this content"

Yet by blocking Andy Burnham, he chose self-preservation over the coalition politics needed to winMon 26 Jan 2026 14.02 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 18.25 ESTShareJoe Bidenrepeatedlysaid that Donald Trump was an existential threat. Yet the former US president clung on to his party’s nomination when he ought to have allowed a better candidate to take on Mr Trump. What happened next is history. There is an uncomfortable parallel in Britain. Sir Keir Starmer insists that defeating Reform UK is the overriding priority. He warns of the “fight of our lives” against a party offering “racist” policies. But when faced with a choice between maximising Labour’s chances of beating a far-right insurgent and protecting his own position, he – like Mr Biden – chose the latter.ByblockingAndy Burnham from being selected as a Labour parliamentary candidate for an upcoming byelection in Manchester, where he is a popular mayor, Sir Keir has mistaken authority for control. In politics, this desire for control usually signals fear of one’s own side. Cowardice would be to avoid risk. This is where prime ministerial pride has overridden purpose and principles. If beating Reform UK really mattered above all else, Sir Keir would deploy his strongest political weapon in the form of Mr Burnham, even if it threatened his own position. Failing to do so doesn’t just weaken the message; it reveals that the message was never really believed.Sir Keir’sdefenceis that he didn’t want Mr Burnham to become an MP only for Labour to lose a mayoralty. There is a chance that that might have happened, but Mr Burnham would have surely campaigned for Labour to retain his old job. It’s hard to see how the party would have collapsed so comprehensively given that he won214 out of 215wards in Greater Manchester in 2024.Labour has failed to learn the lessons of recent anti-Reform UK contests. TheRuncorn and Helsbybyelection, and that in the Senedd constituency ofCaerphilly, suggest that defeating Reform UK is not about presenting a “sensible” policy platform. It is about leading a broad coalition of opposition: poorer voters, minorities and younger professionals. The problem is not excessive radicalism. It is about being seen as the anti-Reform UK opposition. Runcorn showed how close Labour can get when it consolidates the anti-Reform UK vote. In Wales, Labour failed to do so – and another progressive force stepped in and claimed the “change” narrative instead.That’s the dilemma facing Labour in Gorton and Denton. Mr Burnham is a national figure capable of unifying a bloc of support on the left. He is trusted by working-class voters, acceptable to Muslim voters and popular with young professionals – precisely the mix thatdefines the seat. A Starmer-endorsed candidate is unlikely to inspire such a following. Instead of positioning itself atop an anti-Reform UK coalition, Labour risks fragmenting it. If the Greens and Gaza-focused candidates pull left and Reform UK captures protest votes on the right, Labour would be stranded in the middle.Labour’s governance is not in itself illiberal; the instinct behind blocking Mr Burnham is. Insecure leaders tend to confuse unity with control and competition with risk. That habit is most fully developed in Beijing, where Xi Jinping has spent more than a decadeextinguishingrival power centres. Sir Keir arrives in China having just illustrated at home a diluted version of that logic. It is not the comparison that troubles. It is the ease with which it now presents itself.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The US must be rescued from Trump’s authoritarianismMon 26 Jan 2026 14.02 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 18.26 ESTShareFollowing the fatalshootingearlier this month of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, his colleagues received reassurance that they continued to enjoy “federal immunity” for their actions. “Anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony,” the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller,had previously stated. “No city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator or domestic insurrectionist can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties.”Words have consequences. Ms Good, a US citizen and mother of three children, had in fact been attempting to drive away from a protest in Minneapolis, where ICE’s deportation snatch squads have terrorised migrants and those who have attempted to defend their rights. On Saturday, in the same city, the same quasi-paramilitary force was responsible for a second shocking death. Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, wasshotmultiple times in the back after being wrestled to the ground and pepper-sprayed.Mobile phone footage demonstrates that Mr Pretti, like Ms Good, represented no threat. Contrary to scurrilousclaimsby senior members of the Trump administration, he was holding a phone, not a gun, before he was overpowered. His killing, which occurred after he attempted to assist a fellow protester who was being manhandled, amounted to a summary street execution by security forces. As anger erupted across Minneapolis, federal officers then reportedlypreventedstate investigators from accessing the scene of the shooting.As Trumpism seeks to impose a new authoritarian reality on the United States, Mr Pretti’s brutal death feels like a moment of reckoning. Pledges to shut down the US’s southern border, and to deport undocumented migrants, undoubtedly played a part in winning Donald Trump a second term. But the US president’s determination to wage urban warfare with a force that resembles a secret police – and his indifference to the law as he does so – is generating a widespread backlash that includes at least some of his own supporters. In a recent New York Timespoll, almost two-thirds of respondents said they disapproved of ICE tactics.Amid the growing public outrage, and with treacherous midterm elections due in November, some senior Republicans have begun to sense which way the wind is blowing. Some are nowdemandinga proper investigation into Mr Pretti’s killing, and the future funding of ICE has been brought into question. Mr Trump, having initially described Mr Pretti as a “gunman”, has sincestatedthat his administration was “reviewing everything” regarding his death.It would, of course, be foolish to place any faith in these words. Shortly before Mr Pretti was killed, it was widelyreportedthat an FBI agent had resigned after being blocked from investigating the shooting of Ms Good on 7 January. But Republican unease and burgeoning nationwide protests suggest that Saturday’s tragedy could yet function as a cross-party wake-up call if Congress can summon up the moral courage to act.With impunity, masked agents have acted with lethal and lawless violence inMinneapolis. With the connivance of the White House, their actions have been defended with assertions that most of the country has been able to see are false. In such a dark moment for democracy in the US, a different, decent America must now find ways and means to reassert itself.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The rules-based order that we thought was here to stay after 1989 is no longer something we can rely on, if it ever was – as recent self- serving actions of the US president and his sycophantic gang make clear.Gordon Brown’s piece (As Trump menaces Greenland, this much is clear: the free world needs a new plan – and inspired leadership, 20 January) provides a hopeful antidote to the chaos following the continuing breakdown of the postwar settlement. That settlement gave birth to international bodies such as the United Nations, Nato and others aimed at developing and maintaining democratic values. Brown wants to breathe new life into bodies such as these, essentially through the reiteration and rejigging of founding principles.There is nothing in his proposals that fair-minded democrats could disagree with. The trick is how to get there and how to maintain the global order that continues to break down as powerful nations continue to dominate the weak.It is only in Brown’s last few column inches that the enormous elephant in the room is acknowledged. He recognises that what has happened until now, and is likely to happen again without clear boundaries, is global elites agreeing how to balance their power.The power of these elites has become widely recognised in recent years as enormous multinational bodies (eg big tech, big oil, big pharma, big defence) control elected representatives. But even worse is the increasing power of individual multibillionaires, whose wealth can exceed the GDP of medium-sized countries. This is not healthy.It will take a lot more than fine words to get the corporate and individual genies back in their bottles. But that is where the serious effort needs to be, to curb their illegitimate influence before we try to give real meaning to whatever fine words we use to describe the role of new or repurposed global institutions. We certainly need to try to very soon, if it’s not already too late.Alan HealeyBaschurch, ShropshireIt isn’t, asGordon Brownsays, “in the past few weeks” that the promises of the US-led Atlantic charter have been broken, but throughout the last two years, when American presidents gave Israel carte blanche over Gaza and now the West Bank.It should not beGreenlandthat “marks the end of the world looking to the US for leadership” after American presidents funded and aided Israel’s policy of collective punishment, leading to what most of the world regards as genocide against Palestinians. It should have been when it became clear in early 2024 that BenjaminNetanyahu’s policy was to destroy just about every building in Gaza regardless of injuries and loss of life.Sadly, what most of the western world did was to remain silent or join in, like the UK, which disgracefully continued to sell vital parts for the Israel Defense Forces’ F-35 fighter jets instead of demanding sanctions against Israel. How his critics can accuseDonald Trumpof breaking international law over Greenland when they did exactly that over Gaza beggars belief.Now, their silence is deafening as Israel steps up its illegal settlement of the West Bank, demolishes remaining buildings inGazaand East Jerusalem, limits humanitarian aid, continues deadly airstrikes during the supposed ceasefire and still refuses access to the world’s press. International law was abandoned long before the Greenland crisis.Bernie EvansLiverpoolGordon Brown says that “the US has abandoned its longstanding championing of the rule of law, human rights, democracy and the territorial integrity of nation states. Gone is its erstwhile support for humanitarian aid and environmental stewardship.” Seriously? Does he really believe that the US ever had these qualities? Has he forgotten Chile? Indonesia? Panama? Nicaragua? Guatemala? El Salvador? Afghanistan? Libya? Iraq? Iran? Israel/Palestine? Lebanon? The list is long.America has been a malign influence, ruthlessly pursuing its own economic hegemony for over a century, all the while masquerading as the land of the brave, home of the free. Democratic regimes have been subverted and toppled. Coups financed. Hideous militias armed and trained. Vicious dictators enabled. The US has been aided in this by a parade of obsequious allies, led by our own country.Gordon Brown needs to reread a bit of Noam Chomsky and give his head a wobble. We do indeed need to “choose diplomacy and multilateral cooperation over aggression and unilateral action”, but until the UN security council is reformed and the vetoes of its permanent members abolished, this will continue to be the sham that it has been since the second world war.Steve RazzettiHesket Newmarket, CumbriaGordon Brown, an honourable man, has strained hard with the current crisis and come up with … a charter. Sorry, Gordon, but don’t make me laugh. We have enough charters and declarations to fill a library. The critical issue is that they don’t get implemented – multilateralism seized up before Trump embarked on his campaign to test it to destruction. What is needed is a radical restructuring of the UN security council and an all-out diplomatic effort to reform the UN’s machinery so that it produces hard output – laws and judgments rather than “declarations” and waffle, while at the same time bringing more countries and interests into the decision-making process, making the UN more inclusive. That would provide the best hope of counterbalancing the stranglehold that the major powers have on the UN meeting itsexisting charter.Neil BlackshawAlnwick, NorthumberlandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The problem isn’t simply that children are watching screens. It’s that they’re not creating anything meaningful.For 11 years,Red Paper Planehas worked with more than 30,000 children in Bulgaria using a project-based learning programme we call Design Champions. As part of it, five- to 10-year-old children don’t consume content – they become park designers, car engineers and city architects. They work on “missions” lasting weeks, solving real problems with real materials.The contrast with the children described in your article is stark. While reception teachers watch children make cardboard iPhones because “that’s what they know”, our children build models of their dream playgrounds and present them to their communities. Same age, radically different outcomes.What your article describes isn’t a screen problem, but a purpose problem.Childrenwho spend hours passively consuming are missing the serve-and-return interactions that build language and social skills. But the solution isn’t simply less screen time. It’s more meaningful time: hands-on projects, collaborative challenges, real-world problems scaled for small hands and increasingly large minds. Maria Montessori understood this a century ago. Children don’t need better content delivery – they need environments where they can act on the world, not just watch it.The forthcoming UK government guidance on screen use should address not just duration, but purpose. The question isn’t how many hours children spend on screens, but what experiences they’re missing – and how we can design early years education to restore what’s being lost.Georgi KamovCo-founder, Red Paper PlaneThank you for publishing this much-needed article about screen time and child development. I write as a psychologist who’s studied child development and the critical role of the early years in establishing a child’s sense of self, world, self-esteem, trust and attachment.The brain is rapidly developing during the first five years, and that development is critical and dependent on the child’s interaction with its primary “object”, typically the mother. It sets the stage for that child’s life, relationships, ability to trust and attach to others, and its sense of self and of others. Basically, the child’s personal/emotional, psychological, social and cognitive development.The “hard wiring” is being established and is not easily amenable to change.I live, unfortunately, in the US, where we have a very sick society focused on money and power as success. There are many things wrong, but I’m often heartsick about child-rearing. We don’t really value child-rearing here and often look down on those who chose to be stay-at-home moms. But the critical obstacle is typically financial. We do not support child-rearing in any way that’s even close to what’s needed. Take some of the Scandinavian countries that offer long paid parental leave and child subsidies, plus other benefits.What’s really lacking, profoundly lacking, is an understanding of child development and how the brain is growing and “hardwiring” the child’s experiences and establishing the foundations for its sense of self, self-esteem, trust and attachment etc, as I mentioned above. This has got to be understood by everyone in order to emphasise the critical importance of these early years. Or perhaps people don’t want to know, because it might mean making big changes in their lives, if they can even afford them.I often recommend an excellent book called A General Theory of Love, which addresses the critical importance of these early years, child-rearing and brain development.Lisa HarmsSt Petersburg, Florida, USHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The irreversible melting of polar ice sheets, the collapse of key ocean currents and the dieback of the Amazon rainforest are next in line, with devastating risks for people and nature.The government’s report, however, is right to highlight the enormous risk to countries such as the UK from ecosystem collapse in other parts of the world – not just through accelerated climate chaos but through disruption to supply chains and the potential for food insecurity. What it fails to say is that countries such as the UK are helping to drive ecosystem collapse beyond our borders through our financial investment and the commodities we import – the Amazon region being a case in point.It is therefore beyond belief that the UK government, despite this knowledge, has failed to invest in theTropical Forest Forever Facility, a vital new international mechanism to protect tropical forests that it helped to set up, failed to end investments that drive ecosystem loss, and failed to legislate to prohibit the imports that drive deforestation. The science and evidence are clear. The national security implications are clear. The solutions are clear. There is absolutely no justification to delay political action.Dr Mike BarrettChief scientific adviser, WWF-UKDr Steven R SmithGlobal Systems Institute, University of ExeterThis assessment from the government’s intelligence chiefs on global biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse and national security is stark, but its warning must not be drowned out by global politics. Ecosystem collapse is already under way, and our lack of preparedness is deeply worrying. Although the security agenda is dominated by President Trump’s territorial ambitions, the breakdown of nature is not a side issue that can be buried behind headlines. It’s a national security threat and should be treated with the same seriousness as any military risk.The government must not shy away from this report. Instead, this moment should be seized to redefine the government’s mission; one that tackles climate change and biodiversity loss in order to protect the public and deliver tangible, everyday benefits.Restoring nature at home and abroad, and taking adaptation seriously, can cut through to the public in an era of division and political uncertainty. We face a world in which flooding, droughts and wildfires are already affecting daily life, from disrupted commutes to homes destroyed. Yet this moment also presents an opportunity to improve the lives of people across the UK, showing how tackling the combined climate and nature crisis can deliver real benefits not only in the future, but here and now. The threat is clear.

Maybe that 3-4-2-1 might not be the answer for this Manchester United team? Perish the thought. The club’s recently sacked manager was clear that not even the pope would make him change – presumably because Leo XIV is also a big fan of three centre-halves. Saying that, Amorim did come close to losing his religion towards the bitter end, however brief and unconvincing his dalliance with a back four was. He reverted to a three forhis final game at Leedsin early January.As the dust settles on Michael Carrick’s second thrilling win as the United interim manager in two matches,the last-gasp triumph at Arsenalfollowingthe home win against Manchester City, it is a moment, first and foremost, for the club’s supporters to savour.Arteta’s team of ruthless cyborgs malfunction in way that is all too human | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThe bedlam in the away enclosure at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday after Matheus Cunha’s 87th-minute winner made all of those present feel lighter. Ditto the celebrations upon the full-time whistle. The songs for Carrick. For Casemiro, too,who was once again excellent in midfield. Even Sir Jim Ratcliffe looked ready to accept an invitation for a post-match interview before pulling back and pointing at the smile on his face. “This is all you need to know,” was the gist from the minority owner.The basis for the result, as it had been against City, was United’s assurance on the ball; the bursts of quick, direct passing to get them out of tight spots and up the field. They were not as pronounced as in the derby, which was a game the players enjoyed more, but they were there as Carrick’s team recovered from an opening half-hour when they were under the cosh.Witness the interchanges between Patrick Dorgu and Bruno Fernandes before the former lashed home the long-range drive for 2-1. Or when Kobbie Mainoo took one touch after a short pass from Fernandes before swiftly moving the ball up and past Declan Rice for Cunha, who ran on to produce another emphatic finish from distance.It was difficult not to link it to something basic. Under Carrick, it has not been Fernandes or Mainoo plus the extra defender. It has been both of them – together with Casemiro – with a man fewer at the back. Darren Fletcher played the 4-2-3-1 with Fernandes in the No 10 role when he took charge against Burnley and Brighton after Amorim’s departure, the latter in the FA Cup. United dominated against Burnley only to find a way to draw and it was a slog in the defeat against Brighton.View image in fullscreenMatheus Cunha (right) wheels away alongside Diogo Dalot (centre) and Kobbie Mainoo after scoring a spectacular winner for United.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersCarrick has got it to work and it has been easy to fixate on Mainoo’s comeback after his deep freeze under Amorim. There is a reason why Mainoo is loved by United fans and it is not only because he is a local boy and academy product. It is because of his nervelessness on the ball, his ability to receive – especially under pressure – and make a move, maybe a shoulder drop or sharp turn, and get the team forward, either with a dribble or a secure pass.Amorim’s frustration will be that there were signs of progress under him this season. The buildup play from the back was effective, at times; faster and more direct. The patterns could be attractive, especially when Fernandes was drilling his first-time passes. It was just that his team let themselves down so often in both boxes. The inconsistency was maddening, best reflected by the statistic that showed Amorim won back‑to‑back league matches only in one short spell – the three‑game run last October that featured victories against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.Carrick has won two in a row; they were not smash and grabs, either. He is now confronted by a fresh challenge. Can he do it on a lazy Old Trafford lunchtime against Fulham on Sunday? Perversely, Amorim did not struggle in the very biggest matches against Liverpool, City and Arsenal. His record in all competitions against them read: W3 D3 L3. In other words, six positive results out of nine.It was against less storied opponents such as Fulham where the problems came. When Amorim’s team played them at Old Trafford last season, they exited the FA Cup on penalties. United will be the favourites to win this time, just as they will be in the four fixtures that follow: Tottenham at home, West Ham and Everton away, and Crystal Palace at home. Amorim’s record against those clubs in all competitions? W3 D4 L7.“In the coming weeks, when people expect more from us and we are the favourites to win, you also have to pull through,” Senne Lammens, the United goalkeeper, said. “They are sometimes the most difficult games, the ones you have to win.“We know we can play against those better teams so now we have to do it against those teams who are maybe a bit more difficult to play against … [when] we play against low blocks. If you want to be a great team, you have to win against those teams as well.”Apart from the formation and Mainoo, what has Carrick done to enjoy such a bolt from the blocks? It is impossible to ignore Dorgu, who he has played on the wing rather than at left-back – as Amorim did towards the end of his tenure.It was a bold move to start Dorgu ahead of Cunha against City but one that was more than vindicated, with Dorgu starring and scoring. There was no debate about him keeping his place at Arsenal. It will be interesting to see if Carrick brings back Cunha against Fulham.View image in fullscreenSenne Lammens, the United goalkeeper, feels Carrick’s biggest strength has been ‘sticking to the basics’.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersCarrick has pushed savvy backroom staff appointments, including that of the assistant coach, Steve Holland – a boyhood United fan, who used to follow the team home and away. Carrick has also benefited from the club’s less than crowded schedule. It is an embarrassment that United will play only 40 games this season owing to cup exits and no European football. Carrick, at least, has had time on the training pitch.There has been no silver bullet. Rather it feels like a case of a manager doing sensible things, including getting a system to fit his players. “I’ve got to be honest … there’s not that many special things he did,” Lammens said.“It’s just like sticking to the basics. Football is basics. If you do the basics well, then our quality comes out. Tactically, we are standing right. We are defending good together and as a team. If you fight as a team and keep believing then you can win.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedMichael CarrickRuben AmorimfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s had a good opportunity to do that and is only going to come back when he’s fully ready to give everything of himself to the squad.“He’s in Nigeria at the minute but he’ll be back ready to give all of himself to the team and be successful to make the rest of his family very proud. We’re all determined to do that for him, too.”Such situations clearly put into perspective minor details such as a game of rugby, but this year most of the teams are encountering varying degrees of untimely disruption. France, for example, have just lost their prop Uini Atonio and flanker Paul Boudehent to injuries, with the Toulouse pair Georges-Henri Colombe and Alexandre Roumat added to the squad as replacements.Ireland, who begin their campaign against France, also have worrying front-row problems, particularly at loosehead prop where Andrew Porter, Paddy McCarthy and Jack Boyle are injured, prompting a call-up for Connacht’s uncapped 20-year-old Billy Bohan. Further injuries in such a key area would be seriously problematic given the power of the French pack. As the captain, Caelan Doris, drily put it, an opening night in Paris “definitely sharpens the mind”.Antoine Dupont, similarly, has urged his players “to be ready” for their entrance next Thursday, the fixture having been brought forward to avoid a clash with the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics.The Wales captain, Dewi Lake, meanwhile, says his side will be bringing “sheer fight and will” against England, despite the uncertainty aboutthe future shape of the Welsh domestic game.Borthwick, though, is braced primarily for a barrage of high balls, suggesting the hosts are anticipating “50 kicks” from a side hoping to apply aerial pressure and feast off the scraps. Either way, the head coach will not necessarily be reshaping his entire tactical approach to suit the recently released Rugby Football Union strategic plan, which specifically urges the national team not only to be consistent major title winners “but to do so in a way that inspires future generations”.Borthwich said: “We want to win every game we go into. Very clearly we want to win the World Cup in 2027. I want the players to attack this tournament and come with an attitude to play fast and to play brave.”Bullish Borthwick tells England to target Six Nations triumph in ParisRead moreEngland, meanwhile, may split their summer tour resources to maximise their prospects of victory in their inaugural Nations Championship games in South Africa and Argentina in July. With Tests in Johannesburg and Santiago del Estero either side of a Test against Fiji scheduled to be staged in the north of England, it is possible several senior England players will head straight on to Buenos Aires rather than fly back to the UK.“It’s one of the considerations I have right now,” Borthwick said. “We are looking at how we manage that.”An England XV is also due to play a French XV in Vannes on Friday 19 June.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamMaro ItojeSix Nations 2026Six NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The demand was made in open letter also addressed to the presidents of Fifa’s 200-plus national associations.Among its 20 signatories are Ali Karimi, who played 127 times forIran, and three other former full internationals. The list also includes a coach, a referee and sports journalists.Sepp Blatter suggests fans should not travel to US for World CupRead moreThe letter says a “nationwide, popular, and civic movement” has been met by the Iranian authorities with “systematic repression, mass killings, and actions that constitute clear instances of crimes against humanity and war crimes”.Amongthousands killed in protests this month– the letter refers to information and reports that put the death toll at more than 18,000, though some estimates are even higher – were what the letter describes as “a significant number of members of the football community”. It names among them Mojtaba Tarshiz, a former top-division player, who had two young children.Other victims listed include Saba Rashtian, a women’s football assistant referee, the youth coach Mehdi Lavasani, the footballers Amirhossein Mohammadzadeh and Ribin Moradi, and Mohammad Hajipour, a goalkeeper for Iran’s beach soccer team.View image in fullscreenIranians attend an anti-government protest in Tehran.Photograph: APThe letter also raises concern over the fate of Amirhassan Ghaderzadeh, a 19-year-old player with Sepahan Isfahan. His family has reportedly been told he faces an imminent risk of execution because of his participation in protests. His case was condemned by the US state department last week after being highlighted by Amnesty International.Signatories of the letter, who include a second Iran player picked for the World Cup in Bakhtiar Rahmani, saya nationwide shutdown of internet and telephone communicationshas made it difficult to verify deaths and arrests. They say several members of the football community have been arrested upon entering Iran for expressing their opinions and have had their passports confiscated.Addressing Infantino, the letter says: “Football, as the most influential social phenomenon in the world, cannot and must not remain silent in the face of executions, killings, arbitrary arrests, and threats against athletes.”The group call on Fifa and the national football federations to publicly condemn those actions, demand an immediate halt, use all available legal and disciplinary mechanisms to protect Iranian football figures and “affirm that peaceful protest and the expression of personal opinions are fundamental human rights”.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right: Saba Rashtian, Amirhossein Mohammadzadeh, Ribin Moradi, Mehdi Lavasani, Mojtaba Tarshiz.Photograph: Voices of IranThe letter concludes: “Silence in the face of these crimes amounts to abandoning the very principles that global football claims to defend.”Fifa has been approached for comment.Karimi has become one of the most prominent sporting voicessupporting Iran’s protest movement. In 2022, he accused the authorities of trying to kidnap him and claimed his family had been threatened after he publicly supported anti-government protests. Karimi, who played for Bayern Munich, moved to the US in 2023 after Iranian security forces briefly seized his family home.Karimi said Iranians had paid “heavy prices, such as their lives and their freedom” for basic rights over decades and that his aim was to ensure the international community hears about the crimes being committed.View image in fullscreenA protester wears a T-shirt with Ali Karimi’s name during a demonstration in Germany in 2022.Photograph: Zuma Press Inc/Alamy“I have always considered myself one of the people,” he said. “Now that our country is going through one of its most sensitive and sorrowful periods, the least I can do is be the voice of my people.”Karimi said the protesters were “more hopeful than ever” and that “freedom and democracy through the ballot box” were what they wanted. “We witnessed the mass killing of people, the real numbers of which are far higher than the figures that are announced.”At least 22 athletes from other sports, including basketball, rock climbing, wrestling and taekwondo, have been killed for taking part in the protests. Massoud Zatparvar, a two-time World Classic Bodybuilding champion, died during protests in the city of Rasht in Gilan province in northwestern Iran. “We only want our rights, the voice that has been stifled for 40 years must be shouted out,” he wrote in his last Instagram post on an account since deleted.It is understood Iranian authorities are using CCTV footage from shops to compile evidence against those who took part in the protests. The deaths of prominent athletes are often given widespread coverage in the state-run media.“All they try to do is to create fear,” said one source in Iran who did not want to be named. “They want to say: ‘This is what we do to the athletes, this is what we do to the celebrities, this is what we do to the biggest names. What do you think we can do to you?’”Explore more on these topicsFootballIranFifanewsShareReuse this content"

A point apiece reflected a dominant half apiece, though both managers felt they could have had more.Everton v Leeds United: Premier League – liveRead moreHaving failed to score in his first 16 appearances for Everton, or from his first 15 attempts on goal, Barry made it five goals in his past 10 attempts with a superb finish to puncture a fine away display by Leeds.Daniel Farke’s visitors, under pressure following weekend wins for relegation rivals Nottingham Forest and West Ham, were vastly superior in the first half and deservedly led through James Justin.Moyes’s half‑time changes – in personnel and formation – sparked a huge and necessary improvement from the hosts, but the Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlow had not been seriously tested until Barry took centre stage.“I’m really pleased for Thierno,” Moyes said. “There are a lot of strikers in the Premier League who cost a lot of money and it has not been easy for them, either. He is a young French under-21 international who is finding his way and just beginning to get settled in. He’s getting used to the whole club, the intensity of the league and while we’ve not been creating as many chances recently he’s getting a few goals. His goal was textbook.”Everton marked the recent death of Tommy Wright with a period of applause before kick‑off. Wright, considered one of the club’s finest full‑backs, won the FA Cup with his boyhood team in 1966, the league championship in 1970 and also represented England at the World Cup in Mexico that year.Leeds made by far the stronger start, however, with the movement of Farke’s midfield five and Brenden Aaronson constantly dragging Everton out of shape. Dominic Calvert‑Lewin, who received applause and some half-hearted boos when facing his former club for the first time since leaving on a free transfer, had an early chance saved by Jordan Pickford, while Jayden Bogle and Ilia Gruev also threatened.View image in fullscreenLeeds’s James Justin slots home the opening goal of the game past Everton’s Jordan Pickford.Photograph: Matt McNulty/Getty ImagesThe visitors’ eventual lead came as no surprise. Leeds carved open Everton with a flowing move down their right in which Iliman Ndiaye, James Garner and Vitalii Mykolenko all came off second best in the challenge. Anton Stach swept in a low cross that evaded both Calvert‑Lewin and the covering James Tarkowski but rolled perfectly for Justin as he arrived at the back post. With Aaronson sensibly getting out of the wing‑back’s way, Justin placed a clinical finish beyond the exposed Pickford.Calvert-Lewin was centimetres away from doubling the visitors’ advantage moments later. The opportunity came from another Leeds move down the right with Aaronson finding Bogle, who crossed towards the near post. The former Everton striker connected well with an awkward delivery but his attempt cannoned off a post from close range.Moyes had no option but to make changes for the second half. Jarrad Branthwaite was introduced for his first appearance of an injury-plagued season, while Kiernan Dewsbury‑Hall also returned from injury as the Everton manager matched Farke’s 3-5-2 formation. The anonymous Dwight McNeil and Harrison Armstrong made way.Moyes’s switches had the effect he desired, with Everton enjoying far more possession and finally troubling Leeds. The previously unemployed Darlow came to Leeds’s rescue when tipping away an improvised effort from Barry, who attempted to curl a shot inside the far corner with the outside of his foot. It was an excellent save by the Leeds goalkeeper but he was powerless to prevent Barry equalising with his – and Everton’s – second shot on target.The second half turned into a role reversal of the first and the home side’s constant probing led to reward when Dewsbury-Hall released Idrissa Gueye. The midfielder played a low cross to the near post where Barry stole in ahead of Sebastiaan Bornauw to flick a superb finish into the roof of Darlow’s net.In another repeat of the first half, Everton struck the woodwork moments after scoring when Gueye hit the crossbar from the edge of the area. Moyes made another positive substitution when replacing Nathan Patterson with Tyler Dibling, who could have clinched victory late on but opted to cross when he should have shot for the far corner.Farke said: “It is a really good point for us on the road. We were outstanding in the first half, it was one of our best performances, and we should have scored a second when Dom hit the post. It was obvious Everton would eventually show up but we didn’t allow them many chances. We have to respect it’s tough at their place so we take the point and move on.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They are the second team to fail to take full advantage of the opening test afterWilliams also announced they would be unable to take to the trackat all in Spain.Testing is taking place from Monday to Friday this week at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya with teams able to use three of the five days to assess their cars. They have been designed to entirely new regulations and with new engines this season and consequently three full pre-season tests are being held. But as the track running began,Aston Martinconceded they would not be there at the off and issued a statement.Storm brews over new F1 rules loopholes as Mercedes and Red Bull gain advantage | Giles RichardsRead more“The AMR26 will be in Barcelona later this week for its shakedown. Our intention is to run Thursday and Friday,” the statement read.While not a major setback, it will be of concern, perhaps indicating there is still considerable work to be done on the AMR26, the first car to be designed for the team by Adrian Newey, who has also now taken over as team principal. The drivers Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll will now have at best two days between them behind the wheel in the first test.Under the ownership of Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin have invested hugely, including building an entirely new factory complex and wind tunnel at Silverstone with no little optimism that the new rules and Newey’s impact would prove a stepping stone toward the front of the grid.View image in fullscreenLiam Lawson, of Racing Bulls, on the first day of testing in Barcelona.Photograph: Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty ImagesNo reasons were given for the delay in coming to the track but, at the launch for the team’s Honda engines in Tokyo last week, senior figures at the Japanese manufacturer were expressing concern that their power unit was not where they required it to be with the season to start in Melbourne on 8 March.Seven teams did take to the track on Monday: Mercedes, Audi, Alpine, Cadillac, Racing Bulls, Haas and Red Bull. Ferrari are due to make their first laps on Tuesday and last year’s drivers’ and constructors’ champions, McLaren, have yet to confirm whether they will open their account on Tuesday or Wednesday.The test is taking place behind closed doors in Barcelona and the priority for teams is to put mileage on the cars and engines in what is being called a “shakedown” before two further tests in Bahrain. Information being released is extremely limited but it was noticeable that all seven teams did complete laps in to double figures, a strong start after such a major regulation change, with Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli clocking up more than 20 in the opening two hours.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Aston MartinFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

He was an uncapped inclusion in the 2016 World T20 touring party, when Eoin Morgan’s fresh-faced team were denied right at the end byCarlos Brathwaite’s “remember the name” sixes. He was there as a squad member onthat golden day at Lord’s in 2019and a travelling reserve whenEngland won the T20 World Cupin Australia three years later.But, remarkably, the 35-year-old is still waiting to make his debut at a global tournament. It has been an international career spent on call, limited to 33 appearances in all formats, his left-arm spin and handy batting there to use in case of emergency.Bangladesh boycott brings a sad reality to T20 World Cup countdown | Taha HashimRead moreThe next few weeks will be different, Dawson’s drought surely breaking when England begin their T20 World Cup campaign on 8 February against Nepal. He has taken 12 wickets at 19.25 since becoming Adil Rashid’s spin partner in the T20 team in June and conditions in India will demand his presence.The warm-up is going smoothly, too. In the current series against Sri Lanka in Colombo – marking his return to the ODI team after more than three years out – Dawson has conceded four boundaries in 20 overs and nabbed a couple of wickets.“On these pitches you just simplify it as a bowler,” he said. “Just try to land the ball in an area and let the pitch do the work.”It is a compelling story, the supporting act finally getting his big shot as his career winds down. But Dawson, at least when facing the media on Monday, kept his guard up when asked about the prospect of a first World Cup appearance. It was “amazing” to be back in the England setup and that it would be a “really cool occasion if selected to play”.Asked if he had contemplated the possibility of earning a Test recall this year, he said: “It’s not something I’ve overly thought about. I’ve got the World Cup to focus on first, domestic cricket in England, see how that goes and then see where we end up.”Quick GuideArcher joins England squad in Sri LankaShowJofra Archer has joined up with England’s white-ball squad in Sri Lanka as he continues his preparations for the upcoming T20 World Cup.The fast bowler is continuing his recovery from a side strain sustained during the Ashes and, while not part of the playing group for the three-match T20 series that begins on Friday in Pallekele, he is in England’s 15-man squad for the tournament that starts next month.Archer played in the first three Tests of the Ashes, taking a five-wicket haul and hitting a half-century at Adelaide, before he was ruled out of the rest of the series with injury. Only Adil Rashid has taken more T20 wickets for England in the last two years than the 30-year-old.Phil Salt and Josh Tongue – yet to make his white-ball debut for England – are the other T20 players not part of the ODI squad who have arrived in Sri Lanka. Zak Crawley and Joe Root are only part of the 50-over leg, which concludes with a series decider on Tuesday in Colombo.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Having played against India in the Old Trafford Test last summer, was he expecting to go to the Ashes, a tour he eventually missed out on? “I played that one Test match and you can’t control selection at times, but it’s something I didn’t really overthink. It was enjoyable to play [Test cricket] again.”Surely, though, he could let us in on his work off-Broadway? Dawson has shone year after year in the shires, his return to international cricket last year preceded by 103 wickets in the County Championship for Hampshire over the 2023 and 2024 seasons. He simply highlighted the helpful pitches in Southampton.“For those couple of years we had some wickets that we tried to make spin,” he said. “I know I’m accurate enough to exploit those conditions sometimes. That was the main reason I took more wickets than I’d taken before in my career.“In the years gone by, we’d played on more seamer-friendly wickets at Southampton. It was nothing I did differently, it’s just that conditions suited me a little bit more those two years.”He was full of answers that all landed roughly in the same area and fairly modest when the reality is this: he has properly earned his place in this England XI, not only through his Championship numbers, but those in the Blast, Hundred and SA20, too.Before the World Cup, he will have a key role to play on Tuesday, when England face Sri Lanka in the deciding third ODI. The visitors have had a dreadful run in this format, with six series defeats in their past seven, but their 11-match losing run away from home was brought to an end bya five-wicket victory on Saturday. Another ragging pitch surely awaits, Dawson primed for 10 overs of his usual.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

By the end, the main lesson concerned the vagaries of chance, after aserious injury to Sir Gino, and then a long delay to the final race after a hole was discovered in the turf, close to the final flight on the hurdles course.Trainers, jockeys and officials inspected the course before agreeing that conditions were safe to continue, with the runners rerouted around the problem. By the time Kripticjim and Taurus Bay eventually crossed the line almost as one, the sun had set and the photo-finish image was too murky to determine the result. Instead, the stewards resorted to the video footage to declare Kripticjim the winner by a short head.The British are coming! Will the tide turn at the 2026 Cheltenham festival?Read moreThe evidence of recent seasons, even at a time when Irish-trained runners have enjoyed overwhelming dominance at the festival, suggests that at least one of the winners on Saturday will follow up in March. Ma Shantou, who started the season in a handicap, is certainly a live contender for the Stayers’ Hurdle after his win in the Cleeve Hurdle, while Jordans Cross, Maestro Conti, Spillane’s Tower and The New Lion, also staked significant claims for punters’ consideration.When they would ideally have been digesting a wealth of fresh festival clues, punters and racegoers were instead fretting about Sir Gino, and questioning whether the last race should have taken place at all. It will, of course, seem like a distant memory when the traditionalCheltenhamroar marks the start of the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle on 10 March, but it was an inauspicious final pre-festival day at the track all the same.Was it the right decision to allow the final race to go ahead? That is one of those questions that is easily answered from behind a keyboard and, more often than not, a cloak of anonymity on social media, but much harder to weigh up in the moment, as Jon Pullin, Cheltenham’s clerk of the course, was required to do.Pullin was advised by a group of senior riders – among them the reigning champion jockey, Sean Bowen – as well as leading trainers including Nicky Henderson, Ben Pauling and Olly Murphy. All agreed it was safe to continue – although Henderson scratched the likely favourite for the race, Act Of Innocence – and Pullin, well aware of the importance of the race as a festival trial, was also satisfied that there was just one hole to worry about.View image in fullscreenKripticjim (right) on his way to victory in the gloom in the final race at Cheltenham on Saturday.Photograph: Nigel French/PAIt was a close run thing but, after a swift reconfiguration of the track, they got it done and the connections of the horses involved will head to the festival having had their prep race of choice.Had it been up to me, I would have erred very much on the side of caution and wrapped up proceedings after the seventh, due to the fear that there might be other holes in the track that had gone unnoticed.But I would not be a clerk of the course for any money and nor do I spend many hours each week observing and nurturing the track at Cheltenham.

His sudden departure from the stage, for this season at least and, quite possibly, for good, leaves the home team without a favourite in any of the four feature events at Cheltenham in March, even before the Irish stage their familiar parade of collective might at this weekend’s Dublin Racing Festival.Despite the sad absence of Sir Gino, Henderson still has two Grade One favourites on the festival’s opening day card in March in Lulamba, 7-4 for the Arkle Trophy, and Old Park Star, 5-2 for the opening Supreme Novices’ Hurdle.The warm second-favourites for both races – Willie Mullins’s Kopek Des Bordes and Gordon Elliott’s El Cairos respectively – are among the likely runners at Leopardstown this weekend and after a somewhat unnerving Trials Day at Cheltenham, it is over to the Irish to show their festival hand.

But in the biggest game of his career, he delivered the performance of a lifetimeMelissa JacobsMon 26 Jan 2026 03.15 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 11.17 ESTShareMoments after clinching a Super Bowl berth, Sam Darnold strolled over for his obligatory television interview. He was thrilled; the Seattle Seahawks had justtoppled the Los Angeles Rams in a 31-27 thriller. But he was also measured. Unlike receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who would follow and was teeming with emotion, Darnold simply spoke about his love for his teammates. And when asked about his improbable journey, he replied, “I haven’t really thought about it that much.”He may not have, but the rest of us have. And whether Darnold likes it or not, his comeback story will be the prevailing storyline of Super Bowl 60. How can it not, especially after the quarterback saved what may have been the best performance of his life for Seattle’s third, and most important, tilt with the Rams this season.He completed 25 of his 36 passing attempts for 346 passing yards, three touchdowns and no turnovers, but those stats are just one part of the story. It was Darnold’s decision-making under pressure, lack of mistakes, and execution of Klint Kubiak’s aggressive play calls that are the key reasons Seattle will be playing for the Lombardi Trophy.Per NextGenStats, Darnold was the first NFL quarterback to throw three touchdowns under pressure in a playoff game. In his previous two meetings with the Rams this season, Darnold had thrown zero touchdowns and three interceptions under pressure. That contrast is a microcosm of Darnold’s career.Sam Darnold statsIn two weeks, Darnold will not only take the field as a starting quarterback on football’s biggest stage, but he’ll also return to Levi’s Stadium. San Francisco is one of Darnold’s many former homes, and it was also the start of his career resurrection.Before San Francisco, Darnold was just another failed Jets quarterback. The third overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft, he was plagued by turnovers and crumbled under a dysfunctional franchise that didn’t give him much of a supporting cast. Darnold’s most memorable moment with New York was a live mic recording him sayinghe was “seeing ghosts”during a blowout loss to the New England Patriots. Darnold was eventually shipped off to Carolina and New York would turn to another young quarterback, Zach Wilson, who would also be crushed by the Jets’ misery machine.Darnold’s two-year Carolina tenure was marked by injuries and turnovers, including 16 interceptions in 18 games. He wasn’t exactly atop any free-agent lists but he chose to join San Francisco as a backup to Brock Purdy in 2023.Darnold was only in San Francisco for a season but it changed his career. He recentlygushed about studying under Kyle Shanahan’s system. San Francisco is also where Darnold bonded with Kubiak, who was the 49ers’ passing game coordinator that season. He didn’t play much – most of his time came in a meaningless Week 18 game – but it was enough for the Vikings to sign him as a bridge quarterback for rookie JJ McCarthy at the start of last season. Still a laughing stock in many NFL circles, Darnold’s time as a starter was predicted to be short lived. Until McCarthy suffered a season-ending injury.All Darnold did in Minnesota was put up an MVP-caliber season, throwing for 4,000 yards, 35 touchdowns and a 102.5 passer rating. Yes, having the brilliant Justin Jefferson as his No 1 receiver helped, but Darnold displayed more fire and confidence than he had in any of his previous stops. His fairytale season came to a crashing halt in last year’s wildcard loss to the Rams. The pumpkin came in the form of nine sacks and two turnovers, and the general consensus was that although Darnold had improved, he would always wilt in the biggest moments.When Minnesota decided to turn their focus back to McCarthy, the Seahawks ignored predictions of Darnold’s doom loop. In fact, they treated him like a legitimate starting quarterback with a three-year, $100m contract. And “Ginger Cuz” – asone famous Seahawks alumnus dubbed him– was thrilled to be reunited with Kubiak, now the offensive coordinator in Seattle. “Just being able to work with Klint, having talked with Klint a ton in San Francisco about what we like and dislike. We have so much in common when it comes to football,” Darnold said upon signing with the Seahawks.While his regular season numbers didn’t jump off the page as much as they did in Minnesota, he led an efficient, balanced offense that earned the No 1 seed. And now, not only are the Seahawks headed to the Super Bowl, they are there because Darnold balled out when it mattered most. Seattle didn’t win in spite of Darnold on Sunday, they wonbecauseof him.Maybe Darnold doesn’t think much about his eight-year, five-team journey. Or about the fact that among 2018’s quarterback draft class it is he, and notNFLMVPs Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen, who has led a team to the Super Bowl.If he did, he may not believe it was possible.Co-MVPs of the weekNew England’s entire defense.To call the Pats chippy entering the AFC championship game in Denver would be an understatement. All they’ve heard this postseason is the greatness of their opponents. But after another dominating performance, the Patriots defense is no longer sneaky good. They were otherworldly on Sunday, holding Denver tojust 181 total yardsina 10-7 winto clinch New England’s first Super Bowl berth in seven years. New England’s defensive mastery was needed as Drake Maye struggled with the windy weather turning into an all-out blizzard.View image in fullscreenChristian Gonzalez celebrates a crucial interception against the Broncos.Photograph: Garrett W Ellwood/APThe Patriots manhandled Denver’s o-line, hitting quarterback Jarrett Stidham seven times and collecting three sacks. Cornerback Christian Gonzalez, responsible for one of those sacks, also grabbed a key interception.In three games this postseason, New England have forced eight turnovers, and only allowed two touchdowns and 26 points. This defense, an impressive combination of homegrown talent such as Gonzalez and Christian Barmore alongside key free agent pickups that include Milton Williams and Carlton Davis III, is no longer a secret.Stat of the week332.That’s the number of receiving yards put up by Puka Nacua this postseason. Nacua was excellent again for the Rams on Sunday, picking up 165 yards from nine receptions. His chemistry with Matthew Stafford remains excellent and helps propel the Rams offense. Stafford turns 38 in February, and Nacua will play a crucial role in deciding how long he keeps on playing. Meanwhile, Nacua’s fellow Rams receiver Davante Adams had tears in his eyes after the loss: he is 0-5 in conference games after Sunday’s defeat. “It’s tough to focus [on the future] right now,” he said.View image in fullscreenPuka Nacua celebrates his touchdown against the Seahawks.Photograph: John Froschauer/APVideo of the weekDenver had fourth-and-one on the New England 14 in the second quarter, and sure, analytics may tell you to go for it. But not when you’re trying to eke out points with a backup quarterback who hadn’t thrown a real pass in two years. Not when you have a shot at going up 10-0 with your defense playing lights out. Not when your opponent’s defense has been dominant this postseason. And not when the forecast is for snow, which will make points much harder to come by.Perhaps worse than Sean Payton’s decision to go for it in pre-blizzard conditions was his play-action bootleg call. The Broncos were averaging 3.3 yards per carry at that point and not exactly sporting Josh Allen under center.“There’ll always be second thoughts,” Paytontold reportersafter the game. You think?Leaving Milton Williams unblocked on 4th-and-1?Alright then.pic.twitter.com/ktu7lPJeCs— Chris Mason (@ByChrisMason)January 25, 2026Elsewhere around the leagueThe Bills’ head coaching vacancy, arguably the most attractive gig in the league a week ago, has taken a bizarre turn. Owner Terry Pegula and GM Brandon Beane held a disastrous midweek press conference that featuredthrowing rookie wideout Keon Colemanunder the bus, admitting to players learning of Sean McDermott’s firing through the media, and Pegula unable to answer how he evaluates coaching v roster construction. Why did he fire McDermott and not Beane? Then the duo joined with Allen tointerview Philip Rivers, who appeared to be an actual candidate to replace McDermott before reportedly withdrawing from consideration on Monday. Then again, at least one Pegulais having a good week.Former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel cancelled his Bills interview, as well as a second interview with the Browns, toreportedly take the Chargers’ offensive coordinator job. According tothe Athletic’s Dianna Russini, McDaniel told coaches in the NFL that “he is moving west and taking the job to coach Justin Herbert”. But no deal has been signed, and McDaniel is still reportedly in the mix for the Raiders job.In a departure from hotshot hires, Mike McCarthy was named just the Steelers’ fourth head coach since 1969.

Then 13, Maye and his dad showed up to the game without tickets but wound up getting into the stadium to cheer on Maye’s hero Cam Newton. Ten years later, Maye will return to the Super Bowl in Santa Clara as the second-youngest quarterback to start the big game (Dan Marino holds the record).Explore more on these topicsSeattle SeahawksNFLLos Angeles RamsNew England PatriotsDenver BroncosUS sportsWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The four men on board – three Colombians and a Venezuelan – were arrested.“The vessel, which had come from Latin America and was crewed by four foreign nationals, was carrying 300 bales of cocaine,” the Portuguese police said in a statement. “The interception of the semi-submersible occurred at sea, approximately 230 nautical miles from the Azores, under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions due to the current adverse weather conditions.”A police spokesperson told Agence France-Presse that the operation had resulted in “the biggest seizure of cocaine ever in Portugal”. According to Portuguese media reports, the impounded drugs could be worth up to €600m (£520m).In March last year, Portuguese police located and intercepted another narco-sub off the Azores that wasferrying almost 6.5 tonnes of cocaineto Europe.1:34Inside 'narco-submarine' used by South American drug lords to carry cocaine across ocean – videoAlthough semi-submersible vehicleshave been used regularly in Colombiaand other parts of South and Central America since the 1980s, they were not detected in European waters until 2006, whenan abandoned subwas found in an estuary in the north-west Spanish region of Galicia.Thefirst full-laden narco-sub found in European waters was recovered from an inlet in Galiciain 2019, where it had been scuttled along with its cargo of three tonnes of cocaine.Four months ago, Spanish police seized3.6 tonnes of cocainethat had been brought to Galicia by narco-sub.Inan interview with the Guardianlast month, the head of the central narcotics brigade of Spain’s National police said plummeting cocaine prices were leading drug gangs to reuse the narco-subs they would once have ditched at the end of a one-way journey from South America.“The price of the merchandise is really, really low, so the organisations have, logically, had a rethink,” said Alberto Morales. “Rather than sink them, what they do now is unload the merchandise and set up a refuelling platform at sea so that the semi-submersibles can head back to the countries they came from and make as many journeys as possible.”Spanish police on Monday separately announced they had dismantled a massive and highly sophisticated cocaine smuggling operation that used powerful speed boats and offshore bases in the Atlantic to bring more than 57 tonnes of the drug into Europe over the past year.The year-long investigation, led by the National police, has resulted in 105 arrests and the confiscation of 10.4 tonnes of cocaine and the seizure of 30 boats.Officers discovered that gang members based in southern Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and Morocco were using the cover of dark to set off in speedboats and rendezvous with supply and storage ships. The drugs were loaded on to the speedboats, some of which had a speed of 40 knots, and brought back to mainland Spain and the Canaries.“They created real aquatic platforms where drivers would remain at sea for over a month at a time, carrying out several successive operations,” the force said in a statement.“They had their own fuel storage facilities, with evidence showing the use of over 100,000 litres. Smaller vessels were responsible for supplying gasoline, provisions, communication equipment, and even clothing for the couriers who escorted the drugs from the mother ship to our country.”Investigators also discovered the lengths to which the gang was prepared to go to in order to keep its activities secret: the family of one member who died was paid €12m to “guarantee their silence and avoid any suspicion of criminal activities”.Explore more on these topicsPortugalDrugs tradeDrugsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He said he believed everyone else on the boat, which had departed fromTunisiaon 20 January, had died, according to Alarm Phone, an organisation running a hotline for people in distress at sea.In a separate tragedy last week, one-year-old twin girls from Guinea are presumed to have died off the coast of the Sicilian island of Lampedusa after an overcrowded boat they were travelling on was battered by Cyclone Harry, according to the Italy unit forUnicef’s migrant and refugee response.Italy’s coastguard estimates that 380 others who set sail from Tunisia during the cyclone, which generated huge waves in the Mediterranean, might also have drowned. The coastguard has been searching for eight vessels that had been launched by people smugglers from the Tunisian port city of Sfax during the past 10 days despite the treacherous conditions.According to figures from Italy’s interior ministry, 66,296 people arrived by boat on Italian coastlines during 2025, representing a slight dip on the previous year but about half the number of arrivals in 2023, when Italy’s far-right government either reinforced or enacted deals withLibyaand Tunisia to stem the flow.There are fewer NGO rescue ships operating in the Mediterranean owing to a crackdown by the Italian government, including fines and a mandate to disembark people rescued at distant ports rather than bringing them to ones that are closer, such as in Sicily.Despite the hardline measures, people still attempt the high-risk journey from northAfricain search of refuge in Europe.Italy is one of the main landing points, with the central Mediterranean route considered one of the world’s most dangerous. The UN’s International Organization forMigrationhas registered at least 25,600 deaths and disappearances among people attempting the crossing since 2014.

Tuesday was “not a day for complacency”, he said, urging people to restrict any unnecessary travel.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWith six major fires burning across the state, the high to extreme fire conditions would increase the risk of fire spread. Authorities were particularly concerned about the Carlisle River fire in the Otways, which may pose a serious threat to homes, properties and lives. A statewide total fire ban was in place.Fire danger was extreme across much ofSouth Australia, including the eastern Eyre peninsula, mid north, Mount Lofty ranges, Yorke Peninsula, Kangaroo Island, Riverland, Murraylands and across the south-east. Total fire bans were in place for those districts.Heffernan told the ABC it would be a challenging day for not only firefighters, but for Victorians generally.Four zones around the Carlisle River fire have been asked toevacuate immediately. Heffernan said the biggest bushfire danger would come in the afternoon on Tuesday.“We do expect that fire will run today under the conditions, those hot northerly winds, but it’s the change that’s going to come through about 5pm with some really punchy winds, that is likely to do most of the damage and drive that fire further into the Otways,” he said.“Today is a day not to be complacent. Whilst we are focus on the Walwa and the Carlisle River fire, to be frank, the state is very, very dry. Any fire that takes hold will be a challenge for community.”He said communities should take care to look after elderly people, young and infirm amid the heatwave.January and all-time records were expected to tumble in parts of eastern South Australia and across Victoria on Tuesday, with temperatures approaching 50C across inland areas, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.Ouyen and Mildura in north-west Victoria were forecast to reach 49C.

Anything above 48C was extremely rare for the state.Maximum temperatures of 45C were forecast for Melbourne, up to 20 degrees above average, and the hottest day for the city since Black Saturday saw temperatures reach 46.4C. Play would continue at the Australian Open, following extreme heat protocols.On Monday, the heatwave sawAdelaidereach 44.7C just after 5pm, the city’s hottest day since 2019, and as high as 46.5C in the northern suburb of Elizabeth. Ceduna on the Eyre Peninsula hit a scorching 49.5C, the town’s highest temperature recorded in 84 years of data.There was little relief overnight for Adelaide, which saw a minimum temperature of 34.1C – the city’s hottest night on record. Residents woke to 35C at 6am.By 10am, the temperature had risen to 41C, while Roseworthy, north of the city, was 43.8C.Victoria’s chief health officer, Dr Caroline McElnay, said prolonged heat, together with high overnight temperatures, posed an increasedrisk of heat-related illness.“Heat‑related illness can come on quickly, so it’s important to know the warning signs,” McElnay said.Heat is Australia’s ‘silent killer’. Here are the symptoms to watch out forRead more“The telltale symptoms include heavy sweating, dizziness, nausea, headache, pale or clammy skin, or feeling unusually weak or confused. If someone shows signs of heatstroke, such as very high body temperature, red hot skin, confusion or loss of consciousness, call Triple Zero (000) immediately.”The City of Melbourne was ready to provide “cool kits” containing cooling towels, water, handheld fans and rehydration solution to vulnerable people.A cool change was forecast to bring some relief for coastal areas of South Australia and Victoria, reaching Adelaide just after lunch on Tuesday and Melbourne by about 8-9pm in the evening.But for inland areas across Victoria, SA andNew South Wales, the severe-to-extreme heat, with temperatures in the mid-to-high 40s, was expected to persist into next weekend.Dubbo, NSW also recorded a January record, reaching 46.1C at the airport on Monday. More records could be broken on Wednesday as the heat moved into inland and western NSW and north-east Victoria.The heat tomorrow “will very much take centre stage across inland parts of New South Wales”, How said.Australia’s energy market operator said the power grid was prepared with sufficient generation to meet increased demand due to the heat. Network company Powercor urged households to prepare by charging phones and other devices, in case of localised outages due to the bushfires or extreme weather.It was Australia’s second major heatwave for January, and came off the back of one early in January, which analysts said was made five times more likelydue to global heating.The climate crisis hasincreased the frequency and severityof extreme weather events, including heatwaves and bushfires.Hotter-than-average days and nights were expected to continue until April for much of the country, according to the latest long-range forecast.

Although the tropics and southern hemisphere will be worst affected by rising heat, the countries in the north will also find it difficult to adapt because their built environments are primarily designed to deal with a cooler climate.The new paper,published in Nature Sustainability, is the most detailed study yet of how far and how fast different regions will encounter temperature extremes as human-driven global heating rises from 1C above preindustrial levels 10 years ago, towards 1.5C this decade, to 2C, which many scientists predict could occur around mid-century unless governments make rapid cuts to emissions from oil, gas and coal.This will change the pattern of energy demand for temperature management. Over the coming decades, the northern hemisphere’s heating bill will decrease, while the cooling bill of the southern hemisphere will increase. Separate studies have confirmed that by the end of the century, global energy demand from air conditioning will overtake and then far outstrip that from heating.For the latest study, extremes were defined by how many days each year temperatures deviate from a temperate baseline of 18C. Using computer models, the authors then mapped where the biggest changes will happen and how many people will be affected.If the 2C threshold is breached, the new dataset indicates the number of people experiencing extreme heat will increase from 1.54 billion people (which was 23% of the world population in 2010) to 3.79 billion (41% of the projected world population in 2050).Human activity helped make 2025 third-hottest year on record, experts sayRead moreThe majority of those affected will be in India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Philippines. But the most significant increase in dangerous temperatures will threaten Central African Republic, Nigeria, South Sudan, Laos and Brazil.In a surprise to the authors, the computer models also found that the greatest shift will occur early in the warming trajectory – near the 1.5C phase, which is where the world is now. This adds urgency to the need to adapt areas such as healthcare, the economy and the energy system.“This is a really core finding because it tells us that we need to act much earlier in supporting measures for adaptation and mitigation,” said one of the authors,Radhika Khosla, of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at Oxford University. “Overshooting 1.5C of warming will have an unprecedented impact on everything from education and health to migration and farming. Net zero sustainable development remains the only established path to reversing this trend for ever hotter days. It is imperative that politicians regain the initiative towards it.”She said even relatively wealthy, northern nations will struggle. “No part of the world will be able to shy away from extreme heat. There is a lack of preparedness across nations,” she said.In the case of the UK, she said buildings and infrastructure are old, inefficient and primarily designed to cope with the cold, so when temperature extremes move in the opposite direction, it poses a challenge to health systems, energy supplies and the economy. In 2023, for example, the UK National Gridasked to fire up two coal-fired power plant unitsto cope with air conditioner demand from an unusual heatwave.Explore more on these topicsExtreme heatExtreme weatherClimate crisisFossil fuelsGreenhouse gas emissionsEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

They are members of the Brazilian soy producers’ association Abiove, which recently removed its name from theofficial websiteof the soy moratorium.Without their participation, conservation groupswarn of a free-for-all raceto clear land in the Amazon biome despite scientific warnings that destruction of the world’s biggest tropical rainforest is approaching a point of no return. Supporters of the moratorium say its loss could open up an area the size of Portugal unless alternative measures are put in place.The letter states: “We are deeply disappointed to see that Abiove, and your company, has now voluntarily withdrawn from the moratorium. Stepping back risks weakening existing deterrents to deforestation, undermines future efforts to develop collaborative protection agreements, and threatens efforts to secure the sustainability of your investments in Brazilian soy production in the face of accelerated climate change.”Soy is one of the most widely grown crops in Brazil and posed a huge deforestation threat to theAmazon rainforestuntil stakeholders voluntarily agreed in 2006 to impose a moratorium and no longer source it from the region.The retailers behind the letter, which also include Lidl, Aldi, Morrisons, Marks & Spencer and the Co-op, say they will continue to apply the key principle of the soy moratorium – not to source the grain for Amazon land cleared after 2008 – and urge the traders and producers to clarify whether they still adhere to previous commitments on the climate and environment and are able to make assurances about the reporting, monitoring and verification of their supply chains.Under this voluntary agreement, any detection of soya beans planted on areas deforested after 2008 would result in the farm being blocked from supply chains, regardless of whether the land clearance was legal in Brazil. In the two decades since, this has prevented an estimated 17,000 sq km (6,564 sq miles) of deforestation.In the past two years, the moratorium has come under fierce attack from Brazil’s powerful agribusiness lobby, particularly in the soy-producing heartland of Mato Grosso where state legislatorsrevoked tax incentivesfor companies engaged in the agreement. Brazil has threatened to penalise grain traders for involvement in the moratorium on the grounds that it involves the sharing among competitors of commercially sensitive information, which poses monopoly risks.This appears to be a fig leaf as Mato Grosso’s subsidies were modest, and the administrative council said traders could have continued to apply the 2008 cutoff date independently. However, these firms backed out of a globally significant moratorium, in line with a broader US-led trend of major corporations welching on commitments to environmental and social governance.Europe consumes 10% of the world’s soya bean production. In the letter, the retailers say they need a substitute for the moratorium to avoid supply chain uncertainty and a backlash from consumers. Will Schreiber, a director at the Retail Soy Group, said: “There needs to be some sort of agreement. We need credible action to avoid fragmentation. If there are just guidelines, some soy producers will make money from destruction.”Cargill,Bunge,ADMandCofcohave their own sustainable supply chain policies against deforestation, but without the moratorium there is a risk they will pursue different paths using separate criteria. Aninvestigation by Reporter Brazilfound that Cargill had already weakened its no-deforestation commitment by moving the cutoff date in some documentation to 2020.Conservation groups includingWWFand Greenpeace have said land speculators are already moving into the Amazon in the expectation that the 2008 cutoff date will be moved, which will reward them for destruction.Explore more on these topicsAmazon rainforestDeforestationFoodFarmingBrazilAmericasSupermarketsnewsShareReuse this content"

She knew that,” she said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailTodd James, Piper’s father, said on Monday he didn’t think Piper would have supported killing the animals “because of a mistake that she made to put herself in that vulnerable position”.But he said “for the safety of the island … maybe that pack needed to be euthanised, but not because of Piper, but because of the way they’ve been behaving”.The Queensland coroner is still to determine the cause of death, buta court spokesperson saida preliminary assessment of the autopsy “found physical evidence consistent with drowning and injuries consistent with dingo bites”.Canadian backpacker’s death poses question for Queensland’s K’gari: can dingoes and tourists coexist?Read moreThere were “pre-mortem dingo bite marks” that were not likely to have caused her immediate death, as well as “extensive” postmortem bite marks.James had gone out early and alone for a swim on 19 January. Her body was found by passersby surrounded by a dingo pack near the Maheno shipwreck.The tragedy is the latest in a string of incidents involving dingoes and tourists on the world heritage-listed sand island and the first death since nine-year-old Clinton Gage was killed by two dingoes in 2001. That tragedy saw 32 dingoes culled.Dr Kylie Cairns, an expert on dingo genetics at the University of New South Wales, said she was “disheartened, disappointed and frustrated” by the government’s decision to kill the pack after the latest death.“I feel like the scientific evidence on this population [of dingoes] is not being used in the decision-making,” she said.mapK’gari’s isolated dingo population – likely present for thousands of years – has low genetic diversity and high levels of inbreeding, said Cairns.With only between 70 and 200 dingoes living on the island, she said “removing 10 is quite significant. That can have a disproportionately large impact”.“At the moment [the dingoes] seem to be coping with this high level of inbreeding, but when you have a genetically constrained population it does not take much to push them into an extinction vortex.”She said a lack of genetic diversity meant K’gari’s dingoes were already susceptible to disease. Further reductions could risk pups being born with disfigurement and mothers suffering stillbirths.“We’re at the point where we could start to see some of these things,” she said.Killing a pack could see an increase in movement of other dingo family groups that would claim the vacant territory.“We are punishing animals for doing what wild animals do in a way that likely won’t help people in the future,” she said.Advisers havepreviously expressed deep concern that K’gari– the world’s largest sand island, formerly known as Fraser Island – was being damaged by overtourism. The Crisafulli government has ruled out capping visitor numbers.Dr Bradley Smith, an expert on interactions and conflict between dingoes and humans at CentralQueenslandUniversity, said killing the dingo pack was a “kneejerk reaction” and was “dumb management”.“It gets cheap political points and makes people feel better, but culling never fixes an underlying problem,” he said.“This is a people problem. You have to fix how people behave. You can’t stop a dingo being a dingo, but you can change how humans behave.”The Queensland government has said rangers had seen the pack of dingoes involved in further “aggressive behaviour” since the tragedy last week, and the decision to kill them was “informed and in the public interest”.Smith said male dingoes on the island were now looking to breed and their testosterone levels were elevated, making them behave more aggressively.“[Rangers] would not see this behaviour [from those dingoes] in a few months time. It is cyclical,” he said.The Queensland environment minister, Andrew Powell, who is also the tourism minister, has said he backed the advice from park rangers that killing the pack was “appropriate for public safety”.Explore more on these topicsK'gari (Fraser Island)QueenslandWildlifeMammalsQueensland politicsAnimal behaviournewsShareReuse this content"

Measles is an eminently preventable disease but vaccine coverage of MMR has declined. We are seeing vaccine hesitancy growing in the UK, as in many countries, and social media-based conspiracies about MMR are a factor.”He said the decision by the UN health body “is a wake-up call that more needs to be done” to get rates of MMR in children in the UK back up to the 95% that the organisation says is needed to eliminate measles, mumps and rubella altogether through herd immunity.The WHO’s European regional verification commission for measles and rubella elimination said it “noted with concern the loss of measles elimination status in some member states, including some with high-performing immunisation programmes”.It highlighted the fact that the vast majority of people across Europe who had contracted either disease were not immunised and it urged governments to revamp their vaccination efforts in order to “close all remaining immunity gaps, focusing especially on vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations”.Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist at the UKHealthSecurity Agency, said: “Infections can return quickly when childhood vaccine uptake falls. Measles elimination is only possible if all eligible children receive two MMRV doses before school. Older children and adults who missed vaccination must be caught up.”Children in Britain are offered two doses of the MMR jab, at 12 and 18 months old, but coverage has declined over the last decade. The most recent annual data shows that uptake of the first MMR jab in England fell from 91.9% in 2015-16 to88.9% in 2024-25.Similarly, the proportion of five-year-olds who have had a second MMR vaccine, which the WHO recommends to ensure immunity, fell from a peak of 88.2% in 2015-16 to 83.7% in 2024-25.Dr Helen Stewart, the officer for health improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “The UK measles resurgence is a failure of policy, not parenting. While vaccine hesitancy plays a role in low vaccine uptake, the reality is that there are many who simply need better support and easier access to appointments.“When appointments are difficult to get and support isn’t there, the system ends up failing the very families who need it most.”In areport last year, the college said many patients were unable to get their child vaccinated because they “simply can’t access services that work for them”. It said they faced difficulty booking appointments, transport problems and a lack of access to the same GP every time they sought help, which made them less likely to seek vaccination.Explore more on these topicsMMRVaccines and immunisationHealthChildren's healthWorld Health OrganizationnewsShareReuse this content"

That has triggered warnings about future home secretaries abusing the power, after senior figures in Reform UK – which currently leads opinion polls – discussed curtailing the operational independence of policing.Peter Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, told the Guardian an NPS made sense but carried dangers if overseen by unscrupulous politicians.“I worry if a future government makes the head a political appointment and directs it to focus on illegal immigrants or a particular racial group it suits them to blame, we could end up with a Minnesota situation where local politicians and the local chief are against the deployment and see other priorities,” he said. “The crucial importance here will be the operational independence, the oversight and independence.”Emily Spurrell, the chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, whoseroles will be abolished in 2028, said: “Policing must be rooted in the local communities it serves, and this planned structure will place unprecedented power in the hands of just two people at the centre – the home secretary and the commissioner of the new National Police Service. This concentration of policing power in England and Wales is constitutionally alien and brings enormous risks.”The group Spotlight on Corruption said: “These proposals risk unprecedented centralised political control of policing, which could seriously undermine police independence and leave it at the mercy of the whims of a home secretary.“In particular, the proposal for the home secretary to be able to issue directions to police forces and require them to comply with the home secretary’s priorities enables a very clear route for political interference in national policing.”Gavin Stephens, the chair of the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council, said: “The policing by consent model is going nowhere, nor is the operational independence of policing that’s strongly set out in the white paper.”View image in fullscreenThe government’s overhaul backs a big expansion in facial recognition vans, from 10 to 50 mobile units.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAMatt Jukes, the deputy commissioner of the Met police and frontrunner to be its next leader, said “power and decision making” in British policing was distributed and he saw nothing in the white paper nor from this government that threatened that.Mahmood told the House of Commons: “An elite national force will tackle nationwide crime, regional forces will conduct specialist investigations and local policing will tackle the epidemic of everyday crime.“Our structures are outdated and so is our adoption of the tools and technology that could make our policing both more effective and efficient. Criminals are operating in increasingly sophisticated ways. But in policing, in all honesty, our response is mixed. While some forces surge ahead, with the results to show for it, others are fighting crime in a digital age with analogue methods.”The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, attacked Labour over a fall of 1,000 in officer numbers after Labour’s first year in power, down from 149,769. “She is presiding over falling police numbers and the public will be less safe as a result,” he said of Mahmood.Chief constables believe the political obsession with officer numbers has meant those with modern skills are not being recruited.Forces will be freed to change who they employ, with rules tying money to how many fully warranted police officers they employ now scrapped. The topic has been politically sensitive with politicians of both parties promising more officers at election times.A commission will decide by the summer on mergers, an attempt that failed under the last Labour government. People in more rural areas fear they would rarely see an officer, with them being concentrated in more urban areas with higher crime.Mahmood says thousands of police in back-office roles should be freed to get out on the frontline. Local areas will be promised a neighbourhood guarantee of a local policing team, with research finding 25% of people in 2010-11 said they never saw an officer on foot, rising to 54% in 2024-25.An Institute for Fiscal Studiesreportin 2024 found the first phase of the Conservatives’ austerity measures brought a 20% reduction in funding to all police forces.Labour’s overhaul backs a big expansion in facial recognition vans, from 10 to 50 mobile units, and greater use of artificial intelligence.Part of policing’s problem is rising demand, in part picking up mental health work, in part because of technological changes meaning most crimes have a digital element.The Police Superintendents’ Association president, Nick Smart, said: “There is no true picture of police demand, but we know without doubt that it is overwhelmingly high and that the majority of it does not relate to crime … from missing people to complex safeguarding issues.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceShabana MahmoodLabourPolice and crime commissionersEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

It is by no means certain that further US attacks on Iran will reignite the street protests, as many Iranians opposed to the clerical leadership in power since 1979 are also opposed to externally imposed regime change.Trump says US ‘armada’ heading to Middle East as Iran death toll put above 5,000Read moreWith no signs of a diplomatic breakthrough imminent, the Iranian stock market suffered a record daily fall on Monday. Regional powers including the United Arab Emirates declared they will not allow their airspace or territorial waters to be used to mount an attack on Iran but the presence of the carrier strike group in the Mediterranean means permission will not be needed from many third parties for an attack. Over the weekend, theUS militaryannounced that it would carry out an exercise in the region “to demonstrate the ability to deploy, disperse, and sustain combat airpower”.View image in fullscreenSailors prepare a Boeing EA-18G Growler on the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Indian Ocean on 21 January.Photograph: Seaman Daniel Kimmelman/US Navy/APAny such attack will not be designed to weaken Iran’s already shattered nuclear programme, the chief target of the 12-day war in June, but to target Iran’s political leadership and bring the protesters angered by falling living standards back into the streets. Inflation in the last month reached 60%, new official figures showed.Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, claimed the US was trying to destroy Iran’s social cohesion before an attack. He said Donald Trump’s effort to portray “the country as being in a state of emergency is itself a form of warfare, and this is exactly what the enemies are seeking to achieve. The rioters constitute an urban group with terrorist-like characteristics. When they rush toward military and police centres to obtain weapons, it indicates that they are seeking to provoke a civil war. This time, the US tactic is to first break public cohesion and only then carry out a military attack.”Trump has pulled back from the brink on Iran – for now | Mohamad BazziRead moreIran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmail Baghaei, speaking at his weekly press conference said it was a lie to suggest that the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in touch with the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, to discuss a possible diplomatic deal.Witkoff has recently been raising his demands to include the return of UN weapons inspectors, the removal of all Iranian highly enriched uranium and curtailment of Iran’s missile programme.Baghaei added that Iran’s armed forces are “carefully monitoring every movement” and warned that sending forces and making threats “goes against the principles of the international system” and threatened that “if these principles are violated, insecurity will befall everyone”. He then said “we will give a comprehensive and regrettable response to any aggression”.Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, the chief justice, called for Iran not to return to the negotiating table.Trump held off from an attack on Iran a fortnight ago in the midst of the protests fearing he had not been offered decisive options to remove the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, from power or a detailed battle plan for how Israel would be protected from Iranian reprisals. Many Iranians resent Trump’s failure so far to hold good on his promise to come to the help of the protesters. The US administration remains divided whether to push for what amounts to regime change in a country of 90 million people.Estimates of the death toll continue to vary massively but one of the most respected human rights groups, the Human Rights Activists news agency, said the number of deaths of protesters had reached 5,419. The group was still investigating a further 17,000 fatalities.The United Nations special rapporteur on Iran, Mai Sato, who is also a professor at Birkbeck in London, said she could not verify the figures. She claimed families were facing demands for ransoms of $5,000 to $7,000 to retrieve the bodies of loved ones, a claim denied by the Iranian government, Internet access has been throttled since 8 January, and the communications department said business could not tolerate an outage for more than 20 days.In Europe the Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said he would be recommending to the EU foreign affairs council the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps be labelled a proscribed organisation in Europe.Explore more on these topicsIranUS militaryIsraelUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The band has been on hiatus since 2022 while its members undertook South Korea’s mandatory military service.BTS named their new album Arirang. What is so striking about their choice?Read moreThe new tour launched a worldwide scramble for tickets, particularly in Mexico, one of K-pop’s largest fan bases, where just three concerts were scheduled. Many people missed the initial rush and others complained to the consumer watchdog about problems with sales.Mexico’s consumer watchdog said it has launched an investigation into Ticketmaster and is sanctioning resale platforms StubHub and Viagogo for “abusive and disloyal practices” over theBTSticketing process, without giving more details.Tickets were selling on Ticketmaster from about 1,800 pesos to as much as 17,800 pesos for VIP tickets (around $100 to $1,030), but on resale platforms on Monday the tickets were selling from 11,300 to 92,100 pesos (more than $5,300).The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The watchdog agency said it would help develop new guidelines to better regulate ticket sales to concerts and festivals, with prices and locations established ahead of the tickets’ release.Ticketmaster, which is owned by Live Nation Entertainment, has faced other controversies in Mexico, including in 2022 when it reimbursed around $1m to customers after more than a thousand fans reported being denied access to a Bad Bunny concert at Mexico’s Estadio Azteca.At the time, Ticketmaster criticised resellers and fraudulent ticket vendors and called for stronger control measures.BTS’s new album is slated for release in March and the world tour will begin in Goyang, South Korea, on 9 April. The three concerts currently scheduled in Mexico, all in Mexico City’s GNP Seguros Stadium, will take place from 7 to 10 May.Explore more on these topicsBTSK-popPop and rockMexiconewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities allege that after his snowboarding career, Wedding “turned to a life of crime” as a narcotics trafficker and led an organization that moved cocaine from South America to the US andCanada.He is also accused of directing the “drug-related” murders of two members of a family in Ontario in 2023, the 2024 murder of another victim in Canada over a drug debt and the January 2025 murder of an associate, and FBI witness, in Colombia.During his first appearance in court in Santa Ana on Monday, Wedding pleaded not guilty to 17 felony charges laid out in two indictments. He will remain jailed without bond as ordered by the US magistrate judge John D Early.Ryan Wedding’s journey from Olympic snowboarder to alleged cocaine kingpinRead moreThere was a reward of up to $15m for information leading to his arrest. Wedding, who was wanted by theFBIand the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), was taken into custody last week after reportedly surrendering at the US embassy in Mexico, Mexican authorities announced.However, Anthony Colombo, Wedding’s attorney, told reporters after the arraignment that his client had not surrendered and was apprehended,CBC reported.“The indictments are not evidence, they’re just an accusation,” he said, adding that Wedding was in “good spirits” and “mentally tough”, according to the outlet.Wedding allegedly worked with the Sinaloa cartel and oversaw an illegal drug operation that generated more than $1bn a year. His alleged enterprise was said to be the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, according to a separate 2024 indictment from his home country.At a press conference on Friday, Kash Patel, the FBI director, compared Wedding with Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman and Pablo Escobar, describing him as the “largest narco-trafficker in modern times”.“This individual and his organization and the Sinaloa Cartel poured narcotics into the streets of North America, and killed too many of our youth and corrupted too many of our citizens,” Patel said. “That ends today.”US authorities have said that Wedding’s operation trafficked some 60 tons of cocaine a year, but that figure does not appear in the indictment, and security experts have expressed skepticism about the comparisons to El Chapo.“There’s no indication [Wedding] controls territory, nor that he’s at the head of an armed militia, nor that he’s a major player politically,” Stephen Woodman, a security analyst in Guadalajara, Mexico,told the Guardianlast week.The next court date in the case is 11 February, according to a statement provided by the US attorney’s office for the central district of California. His trial is scheduled to begin 24 March.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS crimeWest CoastDrugs tradeCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

In May, he released a song called Heil Hitler, which sampled a speech by Hitler and praised the Nazi leader. The song was banned in Germany owing to laws against hate speech and extremism, but went viral online. Last week, rightwing influencers including Andrew Tate and Nick Fuentes were filmed making Nazi salutes to the song as it played in a Miami Beach nightclub. West also engaged in Holocaust-denial.“One of the difficult aspects of having bipolar type-1 are the disconnected moments – many of which I still cannot recall – that led to poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body-experience,” he wrote. “I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability, treatment, and meaningful change. It does not excuse what I did though.”West traced his condition back to the car accident in 2002. He had his jaw wired shut in the aftermath, which inspired his debut single, that year’s Through the Wire. “At the time, the focus was on the visible damage – the fracture, the swelling and the immediate physical trauma,” he wrote. “The deeper injury, the one inside my skull, went unnoticed.”He said that his brain injury wasn’t properly diagnosed until 2023. “That medical oversight caused serious damage to my mental health and led to my bipolar type-1 diagnosis”, which he received in 2016.West wrote that in early 2025, he experienced a four-month manic episode “psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life”, which caused him to experience suicidal ideation. He wrote that after hitting rock bottom in recent months, his wife, the Australian architect and performance artist Bianca Censori, whom he married in 2022, encouraged him to get help.West wrote candidly about his mental health experiences, and highlighted the mortality rate – “on par with severe heart disease, type 1 diabetes, HIV and cancer” – associated with his condition. “Bipolar disorder comes with its own defense system. Denial. When you’re manic, you don’t think you’re sick. You think everyone else is overreacting. You feel like you’re seeing the world more clearly than ever, when in reality you’re losing your grip entirely.“The scariest thing about this disorder is how persuasive it is when it tells you: You don’t need help. It makes you blind, but convinced you have insight. You feel powerful, certain, unstoppable.”He confessed to treating his loved ones – presumably among them his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, and particularly their eldest daughter, North West – “the worst”, writing that they “endured fear, confusion, humiliation, and the exhaustion of trying to have someone who was, at times, unrecognizable”.West also apologised to the Black community. In recent years, he made comments suggesting that slavery was “a choice”,wore a T-shirt bearing the slogan “white lives matter”and appropriated the Confederate flag. “The Black community is, unquestionably, the foundation of who I am. I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us.”He said that he had found solace in Reddit forums reading of other people’s experiences with manic and depressive episodes. “I read their stories and realized that I was not alone. It’s not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day and being told by the so-called best doctors in the world that I am not bipolar, but merely experiencing ‘symptoms of autism’.”West wrote that medication, therapy, exercise and “clean living” had helped him find clarity, and encouraged him to channel his efforts into making “positive, meaningful art”.West’s current slated album is known as Bully. Its release has been delayed several times, and at one stage was scheduled for 30 January.“I’m not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness,” West concluded. “I write today simply to ask for your patience and understanding as I find my way home.”Ye’s letter in fullTo Those I’ve Hurt:Twenty-five years ago, I was in a car accident that broke my jaw and caused injury to the right frontal lobe of my brain. At the time, the focus was on the visible damage – the fracture, the swelling, and the immediate physical trauma. The deeper injury, the one inside my skull, went unnoticed.Comprehensive scans were not done, neurological exams were limited, and the possibility of a frontal-lobe injury was never raised. It wasn’t properly diagnosed until 2023. That medical oversight caused serious damage to my mental health and led to my bipolar type-1 diagnosis.Bipolar disorder comes with its own defense system. Denial. When you’re manic, you don’t think you’re sick. You think everyone else is overreacting. You feel like you’re seeing the world more clearly than ever, when in reality you’re losing your grip entirely.Once people label you as “crazy,” you feel as if you cannot contribute anything meaningful to the world. It’s easy for people to joke and laugh it off when in fact this is a very serious debilitating disease you can die from. According to the World Health Organization and Cambridge University, people with bipolar disorder have a life expectancy that is shortened by 10 to 15 years on average, and a 2x-3x higher all-cause mortality rate than the general population. This is on par with severe heart disease, type 1 diabetes, HIV, and cancer – all lethal and fatal if left untreated.The scariest thing about this disorder is how persuasive it is when it tells you: You don’t need help. It makes you blind, but convinced you have insight. You feel powerful, certain, unstoppable.I lost touch with reality. Things got worse the longer I ignored the problem. I said and did things I deeply regret. Some of the people I love the most, I treated the worst. You endured fear, confusion, humiliation, and the exhaustion of trying to have someone who was, at times, unrecognizable. Looking back, I became detached from my true self.In that fractured state, I gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika, and even sold T-shirts bearing it. One of the difficult aspects of having bipolar type-1 are the disconnected moments - many of which I still cannot recall - that led to poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body-experience. I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability, treatment, and meaningful change. It does not excuse what I did though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I love Jewish people.To the black community - which held me down through all of the highs and lows and the darkest of times. The black community is, unquestionably, the foundation of who I am. I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us.In early 2025, I fell into a four-month long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life. As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn’t want to be here any more.Having bipolar disorder is notable state of constant mental illness. When you go into a manic episode, you are ill at that point. When you are not in an episode, you are completely “normal”. And that’s when the wreckage from the illness hits the hardest. Hitting rock bottom a few months ago, my wife encouraged me to finally get help.I have found comfort in Reddit forums of all places. Different people speak of being in manic or depressive episodes of a similar nature. I read their stories and realized that I was not alone. It’s not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day and being told by the so-called best doctors in the world that I am not bipolar, but merely experiencing “symptoms of autism”.My words as a leader in my community have global impact and influence. In my mania, I lost complete sight of that.As I find my new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise and clean living, I have newfound, much-needed clarity. I am pouring my energy into positive, meaningful art: music, clothing, design and other new ideas to help the world.I’m not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness.

But, the team note, if those identifications are incorrect then the AI system will also be flawed.“You never find a footprint and alongside [it] the dinosaur that had made this footprint,” said Dr Gregor Hartmann, the first author of the new research from Helmholtz-Zentrum in Germany. “So, no offence to palaeontologists and such, but most likely some of these labels are wrong.”View image in fullscreenA Middle Jurassic-period theropod footprint on the Isle of Skye, Scotland.Photograph: see captionTaking a different approach, Brusatte, Hartmann and colleagues fed their AI system with 2,000 unlabelled footprint silhouettes. The system then determined how similar or different the imprints were from each other by analysing a range of features it identified as meaningful.The researchers discovered these eight features reflected variations in the imprints’ shapes, such as the spread of the toes, amount of ground contact and heel position.The team have turned the system into afree appcalled DinoTracker that allows users to upload the silhouette of a footprint, explore the seven other footprints most similar to it and manipulate the footprint to see how varying the eight features can affect which other footprints are deemed most similar.Hartmann said that at present experts had to double check if factors such as the material the footprints were made in, and their age, matched the scientific hypothesis, but the system clustered prints with those expected from classifications made by human experts about 90% of the time.Researchers discover new tyrannosaur species in ‘duelling dinosaurs’ fossilRead moreAmong other results, the team said the AI system supported what palaeontologists had previously noticed: that a set of footprints from the Triassic and early Jurassic are remarkably birdlike despite being about 60m years older than the oldest bird skeletons, the fossilised bones ofArchaeopteryx.Brusatte said this showed that the similarities were not just down to wishful thinking. “If these tracks were made by birds, that would mean that birds have a much older, much deeper ancestry than we used to think. And not just a few million years but tens of millions of years,” he said.However, it is far from case closed. “I suspect it is more likely that these tracks were made by meat-eating dinosaurs with very birdlike feet – maybe bird ancestors, but not true birds,” Brusatte said.Dr Jens Lallensack, of Humboldt University of Berlin, who has also used AI to help identify dinosaur tracks but was not involved in the study, said a key limitation was that the features of interest identified by the new system were not necessarily based on the shape of the foot itself.He added that the birdlike tracks may be a result of the way the foot of a regular theropod sank into soft ground. “They are not evidence for an early appearance of birds,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDinosaursFossilsPalaeontologynewsShareReuse this content"

This restricted him from entering or accessing funds in member states including the UK, then still an EU member.After Brexit he was added to the UK’s list. The EU annulled Ovsiannikov’s designation in 2022 but he has remained on the UK list.On 4 August 2022 he made an online application from Turkey for a UK passport, having travelled from Russia to Turkey three days earlier, the court heard during his criminal prosecution.In the banking case, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) found that Ovsiannikov opened an account at Halifax, part of Bank of Scotland, on 6 February 2023 using his UK passport, which contained a spelling variation of his name that differed fromthose on the sanctions list. This meant the account was not flagged as a potential match by the bank’s automatic sanctions screening system.The account remained unrestricted until 24 February 2023 when the bank identified him as a designated person as part of a “politically exposed person” screening.The penalty for Bank of Scotland, which is part ofLloyds Banking Group, was cut by 50% because it voluntarily disclosed the breaches a month after the payments were made.A spokesperson for LloydsBankingGroup said it “takes its regulatory responsibilities extremely seriously”.The company said: “We acted swiftly and transparently, proactively referring this one-off, isolated matter to OFSI and working closely with them throughout. OFSI has recognised our prompt voluntary disclosure, resulting in the maximum possible reduction of the penalty.“We have further strengthened our controls to ensure we continue to meet the highest standards of risk management and governance.”Ovsiannikov was not named in the OFSI notice. However, a source familiar with the case confirmed that he was the individual in question.Efforts to contact Ovsiannikov were unsuccessful.Explore more on these topicsLloyds Banking GroupBankingRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

She has now promised a support package to mitigate the impact that could come as early as Tuesday, but confirmed at Davos last week that the support wouldonly be for pubsand not the wider hospitality sector.The boss of Waterstones, which has 316 bookshops in the UK, including Foyles, Blackwells as well as its main chain and Barnes & Noble in the US, was also relaxed about the higher legal minimum wage and much-criticised increases to employers’ national insurance contributionsthat came in last April.Daunt said Waterstones had seen extra costs as a result but “from our perspective nothing we are being asked to do are things that don’t feel manageable and reasonable”.“I have been complaining long and hard all through the Conservative years about government failing to support the high street and particularly less affluent high streets where [we paid] totally disproportionate business rates,” he said, arguing that the Labour government was now “trying to do sensible things” to help.Daunt’s argument that rates are good for small retailers runs counter to comments from the trade body representing thousands of independent bookshops. After the budget, Meryl Halls, managing director of theBooksellersAssociation, said: “The Booksellers Association has been clear from the outset that the government’s business rates reforms risk being deeply damaging, particularly for small and medium-sized bookshops.”She said that a recent survey of members found 85% were less likely to invest in stock, staffing, events or their premises “as a direct result of the Westminster budget’s business rates changes”.Many UK retailers have complained of higher tax bills after changes in the 2024 budget. Daunt said Waterstones had not been badly affected by increases in employers’ national insurance last year as it did not generally employ people on short-hour contracts, which were most affected by the changes.He said he was not concerned about new rights for workers due to come in from April under the Employment Rights Act as “we are already well ahead of that”.Daunt’s comments came as accounts published at Companies House revealed sales at Waterstones’ UK trading arm rose 7% to £565.6m in the year to 3 May 2025. Pre-tax profits fell back by about £3m to £40m, largely as a result of a £2.6m one off cost related to a cyber-attack on its supplier, Blue Yonder.The company paid out nearly £34m in dividends to its private equity owner Elliott Investment Management – £5m in August 2024, £23.8m in May 2025 and a further £5m in June 2025. That comes after Elliott reportedly hired advisers for a public listing of the bookseller, either in London or the US.Daunt said he was “very relaxed” about a potential IPO as it seemed “highly probable” that Elliott would sell the business “at some point”, adding: “That’s what private equity do.” He said Elliott had “bought us for not very much and we have turned the US business around pretty dramatically”.He said the company, which is planning to open10 stores a year in the UK, continued to trade well through Christmas last year and into January as book fans were being inspired by sharing on social media including TikTok.“Bookselling is enjoying a nice time. We had a good Christmas and January. It is not just us, independents are also doing well. It has been very good since the pandemic.“Clearly people who buy books are buying an awful lot more of them.”He said trends in reading were changing, often led by social media, so that bestsellers could be quite unusual. He singled out Mona’s Eyes, a translation of a French novel by Thomas Schlesser, which took off over Christmas in the US.Explore more on these topicsWaterstonesBooksellersRetail industryTax and spendingMinimum wageNational living wagePrivate equityShareReuse this content"

But that work has been produced under a cloud of uncertainty and rumors of widespread job cuts.Those long-rumored cuts now appear to be close, with staffers expecting the ax to drop in early February – though nothing is certain. Inside the Post, staffers have tossed around estimates of potential cuts, with most exceeding 100, which would represent more than 10% of the newsroom–but no one really knows how widespread the cuts will be – or in fact if they will happen at all. The sections most likely to be affected by the cuts include sports, metro and foreign, according to staffers who spoke with the Guardian.On Sunday morning, members of the foreign staff, concerned that the section could be decimated by cuts, sent a letter to the Post’s billionaire owner,Jeff Bezos, urging him to change course and conveying the significance of international reporting for the institution – and for the public interest. Approximately 60 people signed the letter.“We urge you to consider how the proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance – not the shared success that remains attainable,” the staffers wrote in the letter, reviewed by the Guardian butfirst reported by the New York Times. The signatories, which included many of the paper’s most prominent international journalists, said they were open to “finding ways to reduce our costs even further” in discussion with management – “while retaining as many jobs as we can”.“We know what happens when newspapers slash their international sections: they lose reach and they lose relevance,” the staffers wrote.On Friday night, in one of the first tangible actions suggesting how dire the paper’s financial situation might be, the managing editor, Kimi Yoshino,sent a memoto the sports department informing them that the Post would not be sending anyone to Italy to cover the upcoming Winter Olympics. “We realize this decision and its timing will be disappointing to many of you,” Yoshino wrote in the memo, which was obtained by the Guardian. (The Post had already spent about $80,000 on accommodations,according to the Times, making the decision even more baffling for some at the paper.)“It’s all very confusing and no one knows anything,” said one Post staffer who was not authorized to comment. “The anxiety is so sad.”Several staffers said the persistent rumors about impending layoffs had been a distraction during an extremely challenging news cycle, with some suggesting that the Post should not be dragging out the process. “[It’s] safe to say most people aren’t thinking of filing right now,” a second Post staffer said.The Post has not confirmed that any cuts are coming, and a spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about them. But it would be just the latest instance of cost-cutting at the publication, which has offered rounds of buyouts to employeesin 2023and 2025, and has also done targeted layoffs of specific teams. In fall 2024, the Postlaid off 54 employeesfrom the division responsible for its proprietary publishing software. In January 2025,the Post laid offabout 4% of staffers – “fewer than 100 people” – as part of a strategy to “[transform] to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are.”The newsroom, however, has largely been protected from layoffs, though many journalists accepted buyouts or left for other jobs – or new endeavors. All told, several hundred employees have left the company over the last few years, a significant level of turnover. (This reporter worked at the Post from 2020 to 2025.)Despite the uncertainty, the newsroom has continued churning out ambitious pieces. The paper’s foreign coverage has included in-depth stories aboutthe impact of USAID cuts on rape survivorsin eastern Congo;about Russian missile strikes in Ukraine; andabout a man who sailed around the worldwhile battling gastrointestinal cancer.Senior media figures have warned that cuts to the newsroom would have consequences.“Its stellar international reporting is part of the heart and soul of a great newspaper,” wrote David E Sanger, Times White House and national security correspondent,in a post on X on Sunday. “And its international reporting not only makes Post readers smarter, it makes its competitors better – and thus American journalism better.”Post veterans, and some current staffers, expressed alarm on social media over the weekend at the paper’s decision to not send anyone to cover the Olympics, considering some of the excellent coverage it has published in the past.“I was the Washington Post’s Olympics beat writer from 1988-96,” wrote veteran sports columnist Christine Brennanin a post on X. “Tonight I’m thinking about my talented friends and colleagues at the Post who were getting ready to travel to Italy to tell the important stories of the Winter Olympics. This is just a stunning and awful development.”“Holy shit,”wrote Mike Wise, a sports writer who worked at the Post from 2004 to 2015. “That sports section is where I found my voice, where I covered 4 Olympic Games – 2 of them the Winter Olympics. My colleagues were some of the best and brightest in all of journalism. Jesus.”Dan Diamond, a White House reporter for the Post,called the news“difficult to read”.Some current and former Post staffers who spoke with the Guardian conveyed a sense that Bezos, who acquired the Post in 2013 from family ownership, is missing in action. Notably, Bezos did not comment afterFBI agents raideda Post reporter’s home on 14 January – though the Post’s top editor, Matt Murray, and publisher, Will Lewis, spoke out. (Emails sent to Bezos and a representative at Amazon were not returned.)The rumored cuts also come at a time when the company that Bezos founded, Amazon, is reportedly spending lavishly to promote a documentary on Melania Trump that its MGM Studioshad already paid $40mto acquire. The online publication Puckreported on Fridaythat the company additionally plans to spend $35m to market the film and bring it to theaters – though it is not expected to be a blockbuster.Internal frustration has also centered on Lewis, who was brought in by Bezos in the fall of 2023 to help turn things around financially after a successful stint as publisher at the Wall Street Journal. Instead, the Post continues to lose a significant amount of money, leading to persistent questions about how long Lewis can last atop the paper – though Bezos has given no indication that a change is coming. A key endeavor championed by Lewis, the Post’s so-called “third newsroom” devoted to new initiatives and digital formats, largely disbanded last year.“There is a creeping dread in the building that Bezos is dragging us to the edge from which there will be no easy return. Or, no return at all,” a third current Post staffer said, suggesting that Lewis’s job should be in jeopardy. “All of us in the newsroom have been diligently pursuing the most challenging stories, holding powerful people to account, and crafting rich, deep narratives, whether in text or video or any other format, and whether in metro, sports, foreign, politics or investigative. But what, exactly, has Will Lewis done?”Explore more on these topicsWashington PostNewspapersJeff BezosUS politicsShareReuse this content"

It’s a movie whose entertaining initial premise and shrewd satire are finally damaged by Raimi’s need to juice everything up with spurious “horror” flourishes for the fanbase, on-brand gore eruptions that aren’t really scary and undermine the film’s believability, turning everything into silliness. The poster and promotional materials promise a “horror” film, but that isn’t really what this is. But what is it? Well, it’s a desert island parable that owes something to JM Barrie’s The Admirable Crichton and to … how to say it? … other dramas. No spoilers, but Raimi appearing to borrow from a recent Cannes Palme d’Or winner was not, as they say, on my bingo card.Rachel McAdams plays nerdy Linda Liddle, a single woman living alone with a caged bird. She’s devoted to her job. She is an extremely smart researcher in a corporation, but is passed over for promotion by the charmless misogynists running the firm: useless, untalented males in Patrick Bateman suits who depend on her work. Chief among these odious sexists is new CEO Bradley Preston, played by Dylan O’Brien, a vacuous smoothie and nepo princeling whose late father, the company founder, valued Linda enough to promise her a VP position – a promise on which the hateful Bradley now smugly reneges.He and his ghastly bros mock and humiliate her, especially her ambition to be on a top-rated “survivor” TV show. They find her audition footage online – which shows how skilful she is at bushcraft, making fires and shelters, etc – and giggle over it. But they can’t avoid bringing Linda with them for a business conference in Thailand on the firm’s private jet, and when this crashes on a remote island in a storm, with the only survivors being gutsy, capable Linda and spoiled alpha-idiot Bradley … well, guess who the boss is now?It’s a time-honoured and perfectly enjoyable setup, and the first act, when the new reality dawns on clueless Bradley, is watchable. But the plot twists are derivative and the action then becomes dependent on weird stabs of grisliness that are not convincing or consistent with the characterisation. By the end, it’s exasperating – but McAdams delivers a solid performance.Send Help is out on 29 January in Australia, 30 January in the US, and 5 February in the UKExplore more on these topicsFilmSam RaimiHorror filmsRachel McAdamsComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The presence of a Phil Collins banger on the soundtrack and a reference to Jean-Claude Van Damme are tells. One assumes the target audience are males of all ages with a bloodlust for highly choreographed casual violence and stunts interspersed with quips. As such, it gets the job done, plus it throws in the bells and whistles you’d expect, such as fireballs erupting in the background as characters flee the scene, scads of civilians getting killed along the way while evoking not a drop of regret from the protagonists, and estranged siblings getting in touch with their feelings about their errant, recently deceased father, and learning lessons about love along the way.Yes, you read that last bit right, because The Wrecking Crew offers a mildly enlightened, post-therapy 2020s spin on the genre – going so far as to give one of the main characters a child-psychologist wife (Roimata Fox) who is ready to diagnose emotional dysfunction when the script requires. Otherwise, the action is dominated by Dave Bautista andJason Momoa, playing excessively muscled, abundantly inked, initially estranged half-brothers James and Jonny, who spend the film trying to work out who killed their father Walter (Brian Keaulana) in a hit-and-run incident. James is the one with the child psychologist wife; he trains Marines and is a disciplined, solid citizen only slightly simmering with rage. Jonny, an Oklahoma-based cop, is more flamboyantly booze-sozzled, roistering and irresponsible – a classic younger brother according to all those TikTok videos about sibling birth order.Walter’s death reunites them in their home state of Hawaii, which gets showcased in an especially flattering way with plenty of pretty location photography and drone shots. At the same time, the script (by Jonathan Tropper, who wrote and show-ran the recent TV seriesYour Friends and Neighbours), which is slyly more interesting than it needed to be, acknowledges that there’s plenty of corruption in paradise, with various gangster groups and corrupt figures keen to exploit the islands’ beauty for their own interests.The most obviously nefarious character is a rich businessman named Robichaux, whose French name obviously hints at effete monstrosity; he is played by arthouse studmuffinClaes Bang(The Square), projecting cruelty just by affecting a British accent and wearing a topknot. The final big-boss banter between him and Momoa is a gas, as is the chemistry between Momoa and Bautista, two lovable lugs who clearly like each other. The whole package is an easily digested guilty pleasure.The Wrecking Crew is on Prime from 28 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmJason MomoaAction and adventure filmsThrillersHawaiireviewsShareReuse this content"

It stars Vic and Bob and a stellar backup cast – Reece Shearsmith, Tim Healey, Mark Benton, Matt Lucas and Morwenna Banks. It starts off innocuously enough with Carl Palmer (Bob) returning to Catterick to visit his brother Chris (Vic) but quickly descends into anarchy. The extremely loose plot centres around the criminal antics of mummy’s boy Tony (Shearsmith) but there are more tangents than a geometry conference. From ripped up posters of George Clooney and haunting dance routines to Chris Rea and Foreigner, Catterick should be top of your TV destinations.Tom Whelan, South ShieldsMonkey DustI first caught a glimpse of the sharp, dreamlike animation Monkey Dust back on BBC Three in the mid-2000s. I was mesmerised by its dark slice of post-millennium British life. Every week, each episode played somewhat the same, but with a tragic, twisted or nightmarish spin befalling the sad bunch of urban dwellers. Why did Clive perform depraved acts with German businessmen, his father in-law, or a dog and some peanut butter? How did Divorced Dad survive his dire ending every week? I haven’t seen anything this dark or hypnotic since.Liam, 40, AmsterdamThe OAView image in fullscreenEnter the twilight zone … The OA.Photograph: Nicola Goode/NetflixI don’t know what the hell it was about.

It starts off straightforwardly enough with a flashback to a medieval secret society and the holy grail, then back to modern day and a crimefighting nun in a world ruled by a benign AI. From there it gets odder each episode until it finally comes together and makes sense. It was only ever meant to be one season, so it’s all tied up without too hefty a time commitment.Claire Shepherd, south WalesLegionView image in fullscreenA Marvel spin-off without any superheroes … Lauren Tsai and Dan Stevens in Legion.Photograph: nullLegion is by far the best baffling TV show of recent times.

It has an amazing cast and production design – and it is bananas but brilliant.

Each episode and season became weirder than the last, but the central mystery and tight writing, along with the excellent cast including Justin Theroux, Carrie Coon, Christopher Eccleston and Liv Tyler, kept me hooked. I still don’t really understand how it ended, but what a ride it was.Mark Hawksley, 46, Wisconsin, USAThe PrisonerI always loved The Prisoner for its fascinating and slightly menacing atmosphere. This beautiful Italianate village was everything the 60s did best in design, colours and music. Patrick McGoohan, No 6, had been abducted and was kept prisoner in this gilded cage for obscure reasons, all to do with the secret services apparently. Rebelling against the system was useless, and as for escaping, forget about it, because a huge white balloon would pursue and eliminate you by smothering you on the beach. It was scary, baffling and the dissociation between the psychedelic décor and the sinister purpose of its masters made the show eternally spellbinding. The Prisoner remains a cult series for exactly that reason.Catherine Laz, 63, LondonWestworldView image in fullscreenMore of an art installation than a drama … Thandiwe Newton in Westworld.Photograph: 2020 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.Westworld quickly became more of an art installation than a drama. I gave up trying to understand what was going on and just got lost in the beautiful visuals. The show also had a great title sequence and powerful theme music, but making sense was not a priority. When I heard it had been cancelled, I didn’t care because I had no clue what had happened.Ben McCrory, ManchesterNowhere ManThe one-season show Nowhere Man (1995-1996) was in many ways the US version of the equally perplexing British show, The Prisoner. The protagonist has his identity erased and he is constantly pursued because of a photograph he has taken, which contains elements of an unknown conspiracy. The show revels in reversals, betrayals and devastating reveals and no one is who they purport to be. Meanwhile the photographic negative at the heart of the struggle fluctuates between red herring and impossible touchstone. The whole affair concludes, much like The Prisoner, with an answer that invites even more questions and leaves both the protagonist and the viewer further unmoored from certainty.Howard Kistler, 60, Richmond, VirginiaDarkView image in fullscreenThe most confusing and brilliant TV show to ever exist … Dark.Photograph: NetflixIf you’ve seen Dark, you already agree. And if you haven’t, you are about to discover the most confusing, mind bending, brilliant TV show to ever exist. Without spoiling too much, it’s about a boy who goes missing, cause and effect, free will v determinism, and a very literal grand(mother) paradox. Watch it, follow along with the ever evolving family trees that were released as supplements with each season, and be baffled that Netflix cancelled the creators’ follow-up after one season.Paul Clayton-Rana, 43, HitchinPatriotView image in fullscreenGuffawingly funny throughout … Michael Dorman in Patriot.Photograph: YoutubeDon’t be put off by the name. It’s a conflicting web of spy intrigue, workplace comedy, detective drama and surrealist masterpiece centred around a depressed folk musician and his tracksuited brother trying to do their hapless best for global geopolitics. Expect Beastie Boys montages, weird side characters and unforeseen consequences across Luxembourg and Milwaukee. Patriot is hysterical, complicated and heartbreaking in equal measure, all anchored by Michael Dorman’s bemused sweetness as he does terrible things. Full of confusing tension, yet somehow still guffawingly funny throughout.Charlotte Kingston, 45, BournemouthExplore more on these topicsTelevisionWestworldLegionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

André Is an Idiot, the result, mixes in stop-motion puppetry to create an astonishing record of an extraordinary lifeTim JonzeMon 26 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareWhen André Ricciardi turned 50, his best friend Lee made an unusual proposition: how about they go and get a colonoscopy together? The pair had reached the qualifying age for men in the US to access the health check, and Lee had visions of them farting merrily on adjacent toilets while the medication flushed out their bowels, then chatting on hospital beds as tiny cameras travelled through their anal passages. André was always up for ridiculous stuff, but on this occasion he surprised Lee: he said no.“I was 100% shocked,” says Lee today. “I actually got jealous because I assumed he must have organised to go with somebody else!” But André had not made other colonoscopy plans. He just thought it was a crazy idea and for once, he was being sensible. That turned out to be the stupidest thing he’d ever done. Eighteen months later, perturbed by blood in his stools, André did go for a colonoscopy. It turned out he had stage 4 cancer.André bought a pair of Kim Kardashian’s old leather trousers at an auction in the hope of cloning her DNA“I hadn’t spoken to André in probably five years,” says Tony Benna, director of a moving – and hilarious – new documentary called André Is an Idiot. “Then I get this email from him and Lee saying, ‘We’ve got a great idea for a film. Can we meet on Zoom?’” Benna was excited. He had worked with André, a maverick advertising creative from San Francisco, on numerous projects. “We’d go shoot with Ozzy Osbourne, or meet Eminem, or hang out with the guitar technician for the Rolling Stones. And somehow you’d tie that back to, like, Dove soap or something.”The next day, on screen, André told him: “I have cancer and I’ll probably be dead in three years. Want to make a film about it?”View image in fullscreenHis hair grew back even wilder ... Ricciardi in André Is an Idiot.Photograph: A24It was a lot to process, says Benna. He didn’t particularly want to make a maudlin film about cancer, but hehadalways wanted to make one about André. “He’s one of the most insane people I’ve ever met. He had so many wild stories. I wanted to get to the bottom of them.”And so, Benna soon discovered, André really did once buy a pair of Kim Kardashian’s old leather trousers at auction in the hope of cloning her DNA. He really did have to pull splinters out of his penis after a masturbation experiment gone wrong in his grandparents’ bathroom. He really did read Helter Skelter, a book about the Manson murders, to his daughter while she was recovering from surgery in hospital.Then there was the wedding story. In the 1990s – during what friends call André’s “bathrobe era” since he spent an entire year wearing one – he was out drinking when he overheard the server asking a friend to marry her so she could get a green card. The friend declined, so André piped up: “I’ll do it!”André had a girlfriend at the time (“She didn’t take it very well”) and Janice the bartender was seeing someone too, so the marriage was to be strictly platonic. Yet somehow, this fake couple ended up wangling their way on to Newlyweds, the US gameshow in which couples compete to show how well they know their new partner. André devised an ingenious plan: when asked multiple choice questions separately, they would each select the answer that, going by its first letter, came latest in the alphabet.“I don’t know how legal it was,” laughs Janice today. Probably not very – but it worked. The pair won a holiday to the Caribbean where, somewhat inconveniently, they fell in love.View image in fullscreen‘He had so much more to do’ … André Is an Idiot.Photograph: A24Although André, with his wild hair and explosion of ideas, is the star of the film, Janice is the understated hero, always there crossing her fingers for positive test results, keeping the house running and nursing André as he gets sicker. Her presence adds emotional depth to what might otherwise be a series of wacky adventures, of which there are many. At one point, André considers making a hard copy of his genome so he can return as a clone. He visits a teacher of “death yells” – basically, a rehearsal for the last sound you will ever make on Earth. And he pitches a TV show called Who Wants to Kill Me? in which contestants compete for the chance to finish André off in imaginative ways (fed to lions? Cooked by a chef with a thing for human flesh?).“He was so serious about that idea, we actually went to Hollywood to pitch it,” says Benna. “We got turned down, so then he went out on Hollywood Boulevard, asking people if they would watch this show, so we could go back and say, ‘Look, all these people want to see it!’” He wouldn’t really have let someone turn him into soup, though, would he? Benna laughs. “You never knew. It was a little scary at times – because you weren’t sure if he was actually going to get a head transplant.”Part of Benna’s job was to just roll with André. “If he wanted to go to a Radon mine and breathe radioactive air, we went. If he wanted to do a crystal healing session, we did it. If he wanted to do nine grams of mushrooms, we were OK with that.”It’s riotous fun. Benna uses stop-motion animation to recreate some scenes. In one, clumps of André’s fallen chemo hair are brought to life. When André’s dad, an intensely private man, refuses to appear on camera, they hire a lookalike. This turns out to be the legendary weed smoker Tommy Chong.View image in fullscreen‘One of the most insane people I’ve ever met’ ... a moment of defiance in the film.Photograph: A24The pace is frenetic, but there’s a point to it. “We’re all going to go through this at some point,” says Benna. “And there are different ways to approach it. You don’t have to be scared. You don’t have to be angry. You can approach it with humour, with friends, with art. I think that message has resonated.”At the start, André declares: “You only have time in life to get good at one or two things – and I choseadvertising. What the fuck is wrong with me? What a waste of a life!” But he gets a chance to find meaning in his work, creating a campaign encouraging men to get their colon checked (it revolves around everyday items that look like sphincters).André is forced to confront difficult parts of his past. The love he has for his two girls is undeniable, but he is not always affectionate. He never hugs them. “He won’t talk about pain and fear,” one of them says, “which is hard for my mum.”But it’s Andre’s conversations with his therapist, Peter, that take the film to another level. Peter loves André’s jokes but realises they’re often a defence mechanism to avoid confronting difficult emotions. “You are more than just your irreverent humour,” he tells André.“Without Peter, I’m not sure the film would have had much direction,” says Benna. “Peter helped André grieve his own situation, but also let his family grieve. André learned to be vulnerable and humble. That allowed him to appreciate the life he lived and the love that was all around him.”“I was surprised at how willing he was to talk,” says Janice. “The film was a wonderful way for him to think about his path and what was valuable in his life.”André copes with chemo incredibly well. “I prepared myself by getting the worst hangovers for 30 years,” he says in the doc. But eventually it stops working. His belly swells, his hair grows back crazier than ever and he develops long eyelashes. He starts to resemble a wild mystic sat atop a mountain. And the changes are not just physical: spiritually, his transformation is even greater, providing the film with a powerful climax and sense of closure.“He had so much more to do,” says Janice, who lost her soulmate in December 2023. “So many more stories, so much creativity. And he would have made a great cranky old man.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re all going to go through this. You don’t have to be scared’ … another stop-motion image from André Is an Idiot.Photograph: A24When Janice heard the film had won the audience award at last year’s Sundance festival, she pulled her car over and cried. Nobody had expected the film to even get a showing there. Benna hadn’t even RSVPd. “There was a standing ovation and it felt surreal, like I was floating,” he says. “People came up to me and said they wished they’d seen it when they’d been diagnosed, because they would have felt less afraid, less angry, less isolated.”Then there are all those who got colonoscopies because of the film. “I’ve had at least three dozen people say the film saved their life, because they got checked and caught something early.”Lee asked Andre, shortly before he died, how he’d sum up the previous three years. “André said, ‘The best years of my life.’” Janice, who was in the room at the time making a sandwich, shouted out: “Mine too!” Lee realised it was the same for him.Despite the heartbreaking outcome, they’d spent three precious years making countless memories with their crazy friend. “It brought us all together in a really intense, emotional way,” says Lee. “I honestly think this was part of André’s master plan all along.”André Is an Idiot is in UK cinemas from 6 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmCancerHealthDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While this is egregious for an actor of her calibre, the bigger snub is that she wasn’t even nominated for her best performance yet. Enchanted’s Giselle introduced Adams to a mainstream audience and was possibly considered too frivolous for Academy tastes, but her pitch-perfect take on a real-life Disney princess is a masterclass in full-bore commitment, and the gravitational force around, which this winningly charming Disney film revolves.‘Cinematic comfort food’: why Heat is my feelgood movieRead moreI was instantly won over by Enchanted on its 2007 release, but having since revisited it many times (including with my own kids), I’m convinced it’s close to a platonic ideal of family-friendly feelgood viewing, and there’s been nothing in this vein that’s come close to matching it since (including, sadly, 2022 Disney+ sequel Disenchanted). It’s also so much better than the Disney’s many official live-action remakes.Much of its success is down to Adams’ performance, utterly without guile, as the fairytale princess who becomes a fish out of water in ’00s New York – “a place where there are no happily ever afters” – but the tone is just right from the off. Its throwback to the leatherbound-storybook framing device segues into a 2D-animated prologue introducing Giselle, who’s an amalgamation of Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty’s Aurora. Optimistic, friendly with woodland creatures, prone to spontaneously breaking into song and eagerly awaiting her true love’s kiss, Giselle is due to marry Prince Edward (James Marsden) before she’s shoved down a well that turns out to be a portal to Times Square.There’s something cosy in the predictable framework the story follows, as Giselle gets to know divorce lawyer and single father Robert (Patrick Dempsey). Through culture-clash osmosis, she loses some of her naivety, but not without encouraging those around her to occasionally treat life a little more like a Disney movie, with casual declarations of love, an unwaveringly sunny outlook and frequent bursts of song. The upbeat centrepiece Central Park number That’s How You Know never fails to move me to tears. Adams’ delivery of an impromptu ode to wearing your heart on your sleeve is so wholly idealistic, something about the pure joy of it gets me every time.It might not always have been this way. According to director Kevin Lima, the original spec script shopped by writer Bill Kelly and producer Sunil Perkash was a little too cynical. “I came in and said: ‘Hey, why don’t we make it a love letter to Disney?’” There’s certainly a great deal of warmth for Disney movies past: Enchanted is littered with in-jokes, references and cameos (including the voice artists behind Ariel, Belle and Pocahontas) that provide an extra dopamine hit for the target audience. But it gets its affectionate ribbing of the tropes spot-on, finding the humour without disparaging; the tidying-up sing along Happy Working Song parodies with genuine wit and a catchy tune. That’s why it’s aged so much better than the low-hanging-fruit snark of the Shrek movies.Enchanted earns bonus feelgood points for neatly tying up the loose ends for all of its characters. Robert’s partner Nancy (future Elsa, Idina Menzel), who gets slightly short shrift for the most part, has a happily ever after send-off, and even the divorcing couple played by Tonya Pinkins and Isiah Whitlock Jr gets a beautiful little subplot in the scantest of screen time.Every supporting role is well cast, from Susan Sarandon’s vampish sorceress to Timothy Spall’s minion. Marsden – who could’ve coasted on his cheekbones alone – is an absolute hoot as the pampered prince blissfully unaware of how at odds he is with his surroundings. He bags the funniest lines, telling Robert and his daughters: “Thank you for taking care of my bride, peasants.” But his straightforwardly romantic pronouncements (Nancy is taken aback when he introduces Giselle as “the love of my life, my heart’s true desire” without a hint of irony) also chime nicely with the film’s underlying sincerity, which is what makes it such a balm for the real world’s harshness.Compared with the recent box-office trend of carbon-copy live-action remakes of beloved animated classics, which even at their best feel like hollow exercises, Enchanted pushes the nostalgia buttons and provides everything you could want from a Disney character in a real-world context, but it does it with wit, invention and a palpable affection for its source material. Talking about revisiting the film in preparation for Disenchanted, Adams recently said: “It was nice to have distance from it and to be able to see it for the absolute joy that it was.” That’s how you know you’ve made a generational comfort movie.Enchanted is available on Disney+ in the US, to rent digitally in the UK and on Disney+ in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAmy AdamsMy feelgood movieComedy filmsComedySusan SarandonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The premise is not the problem: a sexy young woman lures six eligible young men to her family’s country pile for a weekend of romance, only to reveal to the men that they are now trapped in a reality-TV-meets-Saw farce in which they will struggle to survive. On paper, The Bachelorette-meets-femme-Jigsaw sounds potentially fun.The biggest problem is that the film never achieves the necessary suspension of disbelief; horror films have to feel at least somewhat real or deliberately ludicrous while you’re watching them; but this just feels like student theatre. You can pick out interesting individual moments that could have been something, but you’re never inside the action, willing the characters to escape (or die).It doesn’t help that right out of the gate it feels like the film can’t quite make up its mind how to begin. Is this a woodsy folk horror with a guy fleeing through the rain at night, or a torture porn deal with a guy shackled to a bed, or a twisted family in an elegant mansion chiller where bad shit is about to happen? It’s all three, but not in a way that feels bracing; the effect is more like channel hopping.Perhaps if things were staged with more conviction it could work, but there’s a sense of flimsiness to much of it – sometimes quite literally, since the modest plastic cable ties and wispy gags used to restrain the unlucky young men give the impression of being highly escapable.Lure is on digital platforms from 2 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Musicians are doing incredible things to engage, support and sustain us; we should tell those stories tooMon 26 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 07.18 ESTShareWhen did you last read a good news story about classical music?Think of the stories that have made the headlines in recent years: fundingcuts to national opera companies, closurethreats to university musicdepartments,councils axing local provision,classroom music-makingin decline.Successes reported only tend to be reprieves or salvages in the face of such crises, fought for by a sector running out of fuel to keep defending itself. Each new bombshell raises stress and antagonism among music-makers on social media, intensifying the gloom.I know these are dark days generally, with bad news in every walk of life, but think of the music. If you’re a fan, you surely rely on its vitality, how it speaks to your emotions and uplifts or consoles you at times of need. Even if classical music is not your cup of tea, it’s unlikely you find it harmful or condemnable. How then has the narrative around it veered from the spirit of the thing itself?Recall the pioneering deeds of broadcasterSir Humphrey Burton, who died last month. When television first cast its spell, vanguards such as Burton seized the medium to make the case for music. In shows including Monitor, Omnibus, Aquarius, Arena and BBC Young Musician, Humphrey and colleagues put classical music on mainstream TV channels and on everyone’s radar.View image in fullscreenThe Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment’s Breaking Bach with choreography by Kim Brandstrup. The 2025 show is an RPS awards 2026 nominee.Photograph: © Edinburgh International Festival / Tommy Ga-Ken WanToday, the internet and streaming offer access to more music than ever before. But it offers more ofeverything. In that vast sprawl, musical advocates can less readily capture the public’s attention than Burton did when there were just three or four TV channels for UK viewers to watch. We’re also challenged with how to compress the expansive wonders of symphonies and operas into digital formats designed to hold the attention for 30 seconds.Classical musicis simply no longer on everyone’s radar. This diminished presence takes its toll and funders and opinion formers read less visibility as less relevance. Then the cuts, closures and negative headlines come our way.We need to reset the story. We need to measure up to the energy and imagination of the music and those who create it. We need to make a more compelling case for why classical music matters, accounting the difference it makes to so many lives.We sensitive souls disposed to the arts can be quite bashful articulating such matters. Let me try to crystallise what classical music has done for me: it has given me my calling, my voice, my confidence and my tribe. The dedication and integrity that composers and performers invest in their craft has compelled me to live by such virtues myself. Watching musicians onstage, I regularly witness the best of humanity, striving together to give the best of themselves for the benefit of others. Performing sublime music that’s sometimes centuries old, classical musicians reassure us that good things endure. They remind us that, if we can find meaning and resonance in what a composer had to say generations ago, we can surely find commonality and connection with each other in today’s world.In today’s unsettled times, what a precious force. On which note, I can’t think of any classical music organisation in the UK today that isn’t actively discovering how focused, informed engagement in its community can have a positive impact on multiple aspects of healthcare.Classical music surely deserves brighter exposure than it currently gets.One way we are trying to do this is via theRoyal Philharmonic Societyawards, whoseshortlist we announce today. Each year, our judging panels are overwhelmed by all the incredible things musicians are doing to engage, to entertain, to support and to sustain us all. Take this year’s nominees. They include luminaries such as conductor John Wilson. With his Sinfonia of London, Wilson pursues an Olympian level of musical excellence that’s gripping audiences in bestselling albums and sell-out concerts around the UK. Also nominated is the star soprano Louise Alder who dazzled at the BBC Last Night of the Proms, and composer Mark-Anthony Turnage, whose Festen at Covent Garden was a powerful reminder that the UK produces some of the greatest and most compelling opera in the world.View image in fullscreenCompelling … Natalya Romaniw (Helena), Stéphane Degout (Michael) and Julian Hubbard (Lars) in the RPS nominated Festen by Mark-Anthony Turnage at the Royal Opera House.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe RPS awards don’t just celebrate star talent. Among the nominees are unsung heroes, with great tales to tell. Take the Welsh community of Gresford who created an opera to commemorate the village’s mining disaster of 1934. In this, music brought people together, giving multiple generations a voice and a refreshed sense of the values that unite them.Take the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, who last year not only recorded its highest-ever ticket sales, but delivered interactive music-making projects for over 70,000 people, including its Big Music Weekend – collaborating with jazz and soul artists, and local chefs and breweries – in Glasgow’s deprived ward of Anderston.Take Sean Chandler, principal cornet of the amateur Shepherd Brass Band in York. Sean establishedI Can Play Brass Roots– an initiative that’s helping hearing d/Deaf children in York to feel heard and valued by teaching them brass instruments and playing as a band.These aren’t isolated ventures. They are representative of what all UK classical music-makers do. So many good deeds, so many good news stories. At a time of global woe, we should cherish and embrace this extraordinary infantry.View image in fullscreenGresffordd: I’r Goleuni ‘Nawr - a community opera based on the Gresford mining disaster, a 2026 RPS awards nominee.Photograph: Stephen CainHere we can take heart that a growing audience recognises classical music’s worth. In a Royal Philharmonic Orchestra survey in 2023, 84% of adults said they would like to experience a live orchestral concert. Last year, BBC Radio 3 reported an audience of 2.15m listeners in a single quarter – its largest since the pandemic – and the BBC Proms last year enjoyed a record-breaking digital audience, with more than 10m TV viewers and six million streams. Audiences are integral to classical music and it’s vital we find every way to ensure they are recognised. While many awards shows are just for the glitterati, we particularly welcome the music-loving public to attend the RPS awards – they are part of the story we have to tell.Humphrey Burton himself was a driving force in launching the RPS awards. Tributes to him last month talked of how he led a golden age for classical music storytelling. This is true, but he did more than that: he gave us the blueprint, showed us the zeal, and passed us the torch, to keep classical music in the hearts and minds of the nation, where it positively belongs.James Murphy is the chief executive of the Royal Philharmonic Society.The Royal Philharmonic Society awards are at Queen Elizabeth Hall , London, on 12 March.

It was alleged that she created an online identity as a man and used this character, Kye Fortune, to lure another woman into a sexual relationship, which was consummated repeatedly with the assistance of a blindfold and a prosthetic penis. The woman believed she was having sex with Kye until one day her ring caught on his hat and she felt long hair. Tearing off her blindfold, she realised her male lover was actually her female friend. As these lurid, almost fairytale details seeped out, the case went viral. “Sex attacker who posed as man found guilty” was one of the milder headlines.The trial caught Izabella Scott’s attention because it was a real-life example of a plot device she recognised from literature. The bed trick can be found in folk stories and operas, in Chaucer and Shakespeare. Often told for comic effect, it concerns sex by trickery and deception, under cover of darkness. “The plot suggests,” Scott writes, “that, in bed, anyone might be mistaken for anyone else.”It dropped out of literary fashion with the invention of artificial light, but here it was again, unfolding in a 21st-century court of law.According to Newland, there was no bed trick. She claimed the two women, both in their early 20s, were closeted lesbians. She’d invented the online alter-ego of Kye Fortune in her teens, as a way of expressing her inadmissible sexuality. She claimed that her friend, who was granted anonymity and is designated Miss X, was aware at all times that Newland and Fortune were the same person. After all, they had the same birthday, same job, same pet dog and were studying the same course at university. It was a shared fiction, a way of managing the clandestine fact of the two women’s sexuality. The fight that led to Miss X going to the police was caused not by the discovery that Kye was Newland, but because Newland wanted to come out of the closet and tell her parents she was gay.Miss X disputed all of this. She said she was lured into a romance at university by a handsome young man on Facebook, who repeatedly postponed a physical encounter by claiming a series of outlandish injuries and health emergencies. He had cancer, had been in a car crash, was in a coma: all classic features of a catfishing episode. But most catfishing is enacted entirely online, without the high risk of exposure that accompanies a real-world date. In this unusual case, Kye’s supposed illness was used to create a framework of deception in which a full-blown relationship could be carried out.Kye claimed he was so badly injured that he was embarrassed to be seen. At his request, Miss X wore a blindfold at all their dates, from brief encounters in hotels to long lazy weekends of cooking and watching movies at home – something the defence lawyer found particularly implausible. Kye also claimed he wore a woolly hat to protect his damaged skull, and a body suit to secure the wires in his failing heart. Miss X believed all this, apparently never recognising her friend’s voice, her body, her smell.A trial, especially one for rape or sexual assault, is in Scott’s words a “storytelling contest”, in which one person must be lying and the other telling the truth. It is exposing, often cruel, and gladiatorial in style. In 2015, Newland lost. She was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault. After an appeal, she was found guilty again at retrial in 2017. She served six years in prison and was placed on the sex offenders’ register.Scott is less interested in whether this was the correct verdict than she is in investigating the larger meanings of this strange, sad trial, which exposed the private lives of both participants to ridicule. Though the bed trick appears in literature as a joke, it turns out to have a significant presence in the history of rape. Rape is notoriously difficult to prosecute. According to a 2021 government survey, only 1.6% of rape reports result in someone being charged, while fewer than one in five rapes are even reported.UK rape law is based upon the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which means Victorian attitudes to women’s sexuality and value still shape present-day law. Because the Victorians had a powerful belief in women’s physical inability to undergo unwanted sex, the crime of sexual fraud – rape by deception, by husband impersonators or immoral doctors – became a credible route to prosecution.Although the 2003 Sexual Offences Act was a reframing of sexual offences according to the principle of consent, it absorbed much of the old law, including the crime of sexual fraud, now known as Section 76. This rarely used clause obviates the need to prove the defendant knew consent was lacking, meaning a prosecution is far easier to obtain. It was on this that Newland was convicted in her first trial.Scott is a supremely good guide to this complex terrain, thoughtful, nuanced and agile. She holds unusual objects up for clear scrutiny. Female husbands, Victorian quacks, statues sentenced to death, prosthetic limbs, witches with stolen penises fattened up on oats. A lesbian herself, her deepest interest lies in how the court’s binary vision – of truth and lies, deception and innocence – collides with more complicated narratives around queerness and gender, as well as the necessary secrecy of the closet.It turns out the case was not such an outlier after all. Newland was the fifth in a sequence of recent convictions for what has become known as “gender fraud”. “All suspects were accused of falsely presenting as men; some identified as trans, others as lesbians.” These convictions were not achieved by way of Section 76, but by case law known as the McNally principle, which states that “deception as to gender can vitiate consent”. Lies about wealth or status, or having a vasectomy, don’t have this special power to obviate the role of consent as a defence in rape and sexual assault, meaning even a willing yes can become a retrospective no. The McNally principle is how Newland was convicted at retrial.Newland never described herself as trans and it wasn’t brought in as a defence by her lawyers, though by the time of her retrial she’d been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. But as Scott pores over the trial transcripts, she finds repeated scenes of Newland explaining her existence as Kye in ways that are allied to trans narratives – not as a falsehood or deception but as a way of being real and authentic, of expressing something true. (When I first heard about the trial I was struck that Newland wore her swimsuit under her clothes, a not-uncommon practice for gender dysphoric people.)Whatever the facts of Newland’s own case, the McNally principle has clear implications for trans people, particularly in light of the2025 supreme court ruling on biological sex. To put this focus on gender into context, the so-calledspy cops, undercover police officers who carried out long-term relationships with more than 50 women as a way of deliberately shoring up their false identities, have still not been prosecuted. Rape by state, their victims called it.Olivia Laing’s most recent novel is The Silver Book. The Bed Trick by Izabella Scott is published by Atlantic.

Her proseEssay on Knowledgeexplores incisively, but with fuller argument, related themes, including the importance of women’s education. In fact, Chudleigh had many things to say on a range of subjects, and it’s rewarding to discover her hard-won scientific knowledge.Prof Kevin Killeen has written an excellent introduction to her 2,000-line poem The Song of the Three Children, Paraphras’d, which, not without some justification, he has headedMary Chudleigh’s View of the Entire Universe. A devout Anglican, self-taught in the subjects which were probably her deepest interest, Chudleigh blends her scientific understanding with a rich, biblical narrative, culminating in a praise-song to the “Jewish heroes” Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, the children who, in the Book of Daniel, un-scientifically survived incineration.In her more sociable and immediate forms of writing, Chudleigh was able to argue a case with admirable clarity. I chose Song this week partly because of its form: enlivened by the repetitions the genre traditionally allows, its rhythms sing freshly from the page. Its critique of artificial femininity is impartial, sympathetic to the generic male it addresses, Damon, and it demonstrates the rational but Christian basis of the writer’s gender politics. It’s not a lecture, though. It has a brisk and even sunny touch.Chudleigh, it must be admitted, presents the owner of the “Heart” coveted by Damon with uncompromising disapproval. However delightful her “Face” and “Shape” the woman is judged superficial, somewhat confected. What are missing, in Chudleigh’s opinion, are “inward Charms”. These aren’t charms in the usual sense, but qualities of more lasting worth. The poem appeals not only to Damon’s values but to his vanity. If he continues to pursue this undeserving woman so desperately, he will look ridiculous, despised both by those who witness his humiliation, and the heartless woman herself.As to the nature of the commended “Charms”, we learn two of them, at least, in verse three. It’s interesting that “Wit” as well as “Virtue” is recommended. Wit was a quality Chudleigh herself possessed abundantly – which is not to suggest the Song is a ploy to win Damon for herself. (Chudleigh would never stoop so low.) The word “wit” originally denoted knowledge and understanding and, since Chudleigh makes it the companion of “Virtue” and equally entitled to Damon’s “Duty”, she brings together the original meaning with the narrower one associated with spritely humour.The poem is didactic in tone, of course, but it clearly has Damon’s happiness in mind as well as his moral instruction. The repetitions are playful – tonally varied and sometimes startling. It’s in the first line that the device is most insistent, and even impatient: “Why,Damon, why, why, why so pressing?” The repeated “no more” later has, perhaps, the cadence of a failed suitor’s sigh. The fifth line of the middle verse cleverly mimics the love object’s dallying and reluctance: “Till she, till she thinks fit to prize him.”It would be interesting to know more about Chudleigh’s process of composition. Did she write the poem for an existent piece of music, or in anticipation of a new one? Did she write music herself? I’ve hunted unsuccessfully for a recording of the Song with music, but perhaps it’s hiding somewhere in plain sight. If anyone spots it, please provide a link!The text used here isfrom the Poetry Foundationsite where other examples of Chudleigh’s work can be found.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Each regards themselves as a guardian, and the other as a thief. The reader is not asked to take sides, but instead to observe how the world makes thieves of guardians, and vice versa.A Guardian and a Thief takes place over what is meant to be the last week of Ma living in Kolkata. She, her father and her two-year-old daughter are about to join Ma’s husband in the United States, as the recipients of prized “climate visas”. Floods and extreme heat have turned Kolkata into a city of persistent food shortages. Black marketeers hoard eggs, fruit and vegetables, while fish, previously the cornerstone of Bengali cooking, has vanished altogether. The terrifying word famine is disinterred. This is one of the many ways in which climate change has sent Kolkata forward into the past. While Majumdar’s acclaimed debut,A Burning, laid out the appalling consequences of a young woman’s Facebook post, in A Guardian and a Thief the city appears to be almost entirely smartphone-free.For years, Ma, who sincerely believes herself to be an honest and altruistic person, has got away with stealing food from the homeless shelter that she manages. She has, after all, an old father and an infant daughter to take care of – if she is a thief, it is only because she is a guardian. But then, just as she is about to leave Kolkata behind, a new shelter resident who has observed her theft breaks into her house. Boomba takes not only the stolen food, but her purse, which contains her family’s passports and the climate visas that will open the gates of America.Majumdar writes what Martin Amis dubbed “vow-of-poverty prose”, although in her case it might more accurately be called vow-of-efficiency. This means the eradication of semicolons, run-on-sentences, wordplay and digression; a faultlessly clear third-person voice that dispenses with free indirect style; and a truly minimal degree of social and historical context. All these things are sacrificed for narrative focus.By abjuring so many of the novel’s traditional tools, Majumdar raises the question of why this is a novel and not a play or a filmThere are costs to taking efficiency to this ascetic extent. A Guardian and a Thief has the pace of a thriller, but it derives its drama from the ratcheting up of moral stakes, rather than suspense. By abjuring so many of the novel’s traditional tools, Majumdar can make her choice of form seem arbitrary, raising the question of why this is a novel at all, and not a play or film. Although concerned with moral ambiguity, it seeks at all times to be narratively unambiguous, and to signpost and repeat its ideas for the inattentive reader, just as TV writers are now encouraged to do.But plenty is gained, too. By offering as little cultural and historical exposition as possible, Majumdar evades the narrative clunkiness that inevitably attends attempts to explainIndiato the west. This frees her up not only to tell a story of universal moral interest, but also to deliver a perceptive account of specifically Indian anxieties. She brilliantly renders the helplessness that even privileged Indians feel in the face of western consular officials; the extent to which Indians divided by class simply cannot understand each other; and, above all, how the Indian rich use the claims of family as a justification for riding roughshod over everyone else.If the novel works best as (Indian) moral critique, it is less successful as climate fiction. By structuring the plot around the accidental theft of the family’s passports, Majumdar, at two crucial moments, is compelled to stretch plausibility too far. In both cases, for narrative reasons a character displays a degree of unworldliness that is inconsistent with everything else we know about them, and with what we might reasonably expect of someone in their position.First, Boomba – a young man who has worked for years in the big city – is ignorant of the very existence of passports. When he finds them, he fans himself with one “to see if it served a cooling purpose”. Later, Ma goes to a forger in an attempt to substitute fake passports for the ones that Boomba has stolen. This could, perhaps, be explained by desperation. Boomba’s moment of unworldliness, however, cannot be satisfactorily accounted for.At a pinch, a reader might accept or at any rate pass over these moments. What is harder to accept is the idea that the US, in a world in which large parts of Earth are uninhabitable, might hand out “climate visas” at all. The book pits “some Americans” who are outraged by climate immigration against “other Americans” who welcome it; the implication is that climate visas will be handed out by some presidents and not others. A Guardian and a Thief dramatises, to superb effect, the Indian elite’s great fear: a world in which they are forced to share. The west’s fear of uncontrolled climate immigration, by contrast, is not only not dramatised but trivialised as the concerns of “some”. Those “other Americans” will find here a novel to engage their sympathies, but not trouble their sleep.A Guardian and a Thief by Megha Majumdar is published by Scribner (£16.99).

So I’m creating a home for it: MothershipMon 26 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTShareWhether you’re reading about the impending AI bubble bursting or about the video game industry’s mass layoffs and cancelled projects, 2026 does not feel like a hopeful time for gaming. What’s more, games journalists – as well as all other kinds of journalists – have been losing their jobs at alarming rates, making it difficult to adequately cover these crises. Donald Trump’s White House, meanwhile, is usingvideo game memesas ICE recruitment tools, and game studios arebacking away fromdiversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the wider world’s slide to the right.The manosphereis back, and we’ve lostmainstream feminist websites such as Teen Vogue; bigots everywhere are celebrating what they see as the death of “woke”. Put it all together and we have a dismal stew of doom for someone like me, a queer woman and a feminist who’s been a games journalist and critic since 2007.Everything I just listed off in that paragraph speaks to an urgent need for something different. This is why I’m launching a gender and identity-focused gaming publication called Mothership. It’s independent and worker-owned; it will rely on subscribers’ support to exist. Mothership will focus on reporting on the good and bad of modern-day game-making – alongside investigations, reviews, criticism, and historical deep dives into games and developers who paved the way to now. It will be a website for people who read the news with dread, including gaming news, and worry thatGamergaters got what they always wanted. And it will be a place for readers who wish there was something like a Teen Vogue, but for games (and without a corporate owner to kneecap it).After all, the last two decades have seen a lot of actual, valuable change, and modern games are evidence of that. We exist, now, in a gaming world with more female characters, more non-binary characters, more queer characters, and more characters who don’t fall into rigidly defined gender stereotypes. TheGDC State of the Game Industry survey for 2025found that 66% of surveyed game developers were male, compared with75% in 2020, and 94% in 2009.More people than ever can now see themselves reflected in game characters, and more diverse development teams are creating them. But change has not come easy – and we’ve seen a lot of backlash to this progress. Few websites still in existence are able to cover this backlash while also keeping their reporters safe and motivated to continue.I have dreamed of founding a website like this for a long time; it’s not as if readers haven’t wanted it before now. The problem I saw with the idea was not that people wouldn’t want it, but rather that I didn’t see a good way to pay for it. Journalism has been facing a monetisation crisis since the advent of the internet. It’s hard to convince readers to pay for something they are used to getting for free.But I know the readers are there. In the mid-2010s, I worked for a small “geek girl” feminist website called the Mary Sue, and it was a unique pleasure to write very specific articles for a very specific audience. The Mary Sue relied on advertising income, which meant that all of us had to write up to six articles every weekday; there wasn’t time to spend on investigative reporting, for example, or long-form critical essays. I’m still proud of what we achieved, despite the intensity of those working conditions, not to mention the amount of harassment we faced just for existing. But I always dreamed of working for a place that had the same editorial remit without the harsh working conditions and quotas.Later, I left the Mary Sue and went on to work for Kotaku and then Polygon, both huge games websites where I was writing for broader audiences, rather than the hyper-specific one we catered to at the Mary Sue. As I watched many smaller games websites crumble over the course of the 2010s and 20s, I figured this was the only type of games website that was going to survive. The idea of working for a small, feminist games website – my dream – increasingly looked like an impossible speck of starlight in a far-off galaxy.View image in fullscreenThe logo for Mothership, a newly launched feminist games website.Photograph: Mothership Media LLCBut then, in the summer of 2025, my then-employer Polygon underwent amass layoff and acquisition. We went from a staff of 42 people to just eight. After a particularly disheartening video call with our website’s new owners, I realised I was going to have to quit. Every piece of the dream felt well and truly dead. I had not got into journalism to be taken advantage of by people who saw me and my colleagues as so easily replaceable as to be barely human.Another one of my colleagues at Polygon – Zoe Hannah, games editor – quit as well, for similar reasons. She hit me up with an idea she had for a feminist games website. “You should do it,” I told her. And then I sat there for a moment and thought about it. No,weshould do it! This was what I had wanted to do, before the industry had transformed me into someone so gnarled and jaded that I no longer believed it was even possible.Six months on, after many DMs with former colleagues from Polygon, the Mary Sue and Kotaku, plus other notable writers who’ve covered gender and identity in games – Zoe and I are launching Mothership together, today. We have had the benefit of advice and inspiration from many other independent, worker-owned outlets that have come before us, such asDefector,the Flytrap, andAftermath. Already, we’ve surpassed 1,200 paid subscribers. (Iknewthe readers were there.) And we don’t need millions of them. Mothership is a publication for a very specific audience: the people whodon’tfit the mould of the masculine, hardcore gamer image that marketing and pop culture have been dishing out since the 90s. We want to serve this audience well.I believe our website is a necessity in our current political climate. It should have existed before, when I and millions of other girls who grew up playing games were made to feel out of place by media and advertising that was laser-focused on teenage boys. But it’s not too late for me to make sure it exists now.Explore more on these topicsGamesDigital mediaGame cultureWomenFeminismGendercommentShareReuse this content"

Instead here he is, muscled and strong, wound round a Chinese pole, suspending himself in the air, abs glistening.Ali is also thriving as an artist. His last show, The Chosen Haram, garnered five-star reviews, and he has just officially launched his own circus/theatre company. This new work, Tell Me, follows a woman with an HIV diagnosis, which is something still stigmatised and misunderstood, especially outside the LGBTQ+ community. It is a subject that’s personal to Ali but he doesn’t put himself at the centre. Instead Phoebe Knight is the protagonist, joined by Ali and Jonah Russell, and along with a clever set made from cube-shaped frames that double as poles and trapezes to climb and swing from, they portray a coherent story and evoke some stinging emotions.To contrast with the present day, we are sucked back to the synth-soundtracked 1980s, to the febrility of fear and shame as Aids became public enemy number one, and people with a diagnosis were heartbreakingly shunned by friends and family. This show was originally made as an outdoor performance (premiered at Norfolk and Norwich festival last year) but a black box theatre allows for a darker atmosphere, actually and figuratively.View image in fullscreenTower of strength … Sadiq Ali in Tell Me.Photograph: Alberto Santos BellidoFriendship, revelry, nightlife and sex are played out in movement across the floor and vertically up the poles, until the characters end up facing their demons – rather literally – with Ali dressed in horns and knee-high PVC heelless platforms. The first half of the show feels smart and sharp in terms of theatrical choices; the use of music, sound, set, text and dance, to deftly delineate what’s happening. Once we descend into murkier territory with the devilish minotaur creature, it plateaus for a while.Tell Me is not ultimately a story of triumph or transcendence, it’s one of love, support and acceptance, with some poignant intimate moments. It’s also a well put together piece of theatre, and there is no doubt much more from Ali to come.AtPavilion Theatre, Worthing, on 6 February, andEdinburgh Studio theatre, 9-10 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDanceAids and HIVreviewsShareReuse this content"

They opened with Schumann’s Three Fantasiestücke, Op 73, which is more often the province of clarinettists or cellists, but the full lyrical flood of Schumann’s Romanticism proved to suit the horn even better. It also showed immediately the infinite musical sensibilities of this duo, equally attuned each to the other and matched in virtuosity.Simon Holt’s The Bell was written for them in 2022, its arresting opening – slightly spiky and precisely articulated – giving way to striking exchanges between the instruments with the glistening bell-like sounds at the top of the keyboard offering the perfect foil to the horn’s mellifluous phrases, its final clarion statement an almost defiant gesture.Oliver Leith’s Eeyore, another work originally premiered by Goldscheider and Uttley, did indeed carry the element of humour that his title suggests. Gloomily soulful and lugubrious, any mocking was only affectionate, with the donkey-braying brilliantly realised and the musical argument cogently sustained over the course of the work’s four sections.Scriabin’s Romance for Horn and Piano is a very early work, full of passion and a tantalising if all too brief pointer to the Russian’s future path, while Esa-Pekka Salonen’s Horn Music 1 had all the conviction of a composer for whom, as a hornist himself, the instrument has always been a potent inspiration. This was a dynamic interpretation, with the extended cadenza-like horn solo bringing an added flourish.At the heart of the performance was – like the Schumann – another appropriation, Mahler’s Urlicht. It was a nicely sly reference to the fact that this song, later the fourth movement of his Second Symphony, began life as the last of Mahler’s song-series Des Knaben Wunderhorn (The Boy’s Magic Horn). Goldscheider has more than a touch of magic about his playing and this Urlicht – “Primordial Light” is the translation that seems best to invoke the light the anonymous poet craves – unfolded with such expressive line and lambent glow as to be deeply moving.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

She brims with tales of the grandmother who inspired her love of stories, and of the rest of her family, and also of myriad other children who, like her, are living through war, hunger, displacement and terror inGaza.This is a beguiling yet deeply disturbing solo show performed by co-deviser Sarah Agha, which builds its drama through multiple young voices, based on verbatim accounts from a booklet compiled by Leila Boukarim and Asaf Luzon called A Million Kites: Testimonies and Poems from the Children of Gaza.Produced by Good Chance and written by Elias Matar, A Grain of Sand recounts memories of Israel’s bombing of 2023 and 2024. “I used to live in a big building,” says Renad. Now she is wandering through a razed landscape, alone, looking for her family. So many other children are in the same state of desolation and fear. Maryam remembers seeing her parents scared for the first time as the bombs fell; an eight-year-old is confused to see doctors crying in a hospital; Layan Eid talks of hair-braiding and labneh sandwiches but also describes gunshots that rain down like “heavy rain”.View image in fullscreenA magical-realist phoenix provides a metaphor of rebirth.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSome witness theraid on al-Shifa hospital, others describe Israel’s attacks on schools, refugee camps and churches. It is clear there is no safe space. One dreams of dead children growing back their limbs in heaven, another remembers the words of her father which hang horribly in the air: “Inshallah, one day life will be normal for us. We will travel from one place to another, like humans.”These devastating stories are leavened by a magical realist element that transports us into Palestinian folklore, with the figure of Anqa, an ancient phoenix, at its centre. It is myth but also a metaphor of rebirth for the Palestinian people.Originally commissioned by the London Palestine film festival in 2024 as a live performance, A Grain of Sand has lost none of its power. In fact, the tragedy of it all is compounded: that this state of acute crisis continues for Palestinians in Gaza, that there has been no accountability for the death of so many children. As Renad tells her stories, their terrible realities accrete.

She replaces Prue Leith, who stepped down after nine seasons of judging contestants’ culinary creations,so she could spend summers enjoying her garden, explaining: “I’m 86 for goodness sake!”Lawson will join the programme for its next series, the 17th, which will launch later this year. She will serve alongside Paul Hollywood, who will continue in the role he has held since the baking competition launched on BBC Two in 2010.Lawson says: “I’m uncharacteristically rather lost for words right now! Of course it’s daunting to be following in the footsteps of Prue Leith and Mary Berry before her, great dames both, but I’m also bubbling with excitement.The Great British Bake Offis more than a television programme, it’s a national treasure – and it’s a huge honour to be entrusted with it.”Leith says: “I’m thrilled that Nigella is to experience brilliant Bake Off. She’s sassy, fun and she knows her onions – and her croissants, cake and crumble.”The TV chef has taken a break from British screens in recent years. Her last series, Nigella’s Cook, Eat, Repeat aired on BBC One in 2020, and she has appeared more on Australian television in the years since. She was a judge on the Australian culinary competition My Kitchen Rules in 2022 and 2023, having previously been a guest judge on the country’s version of MasterChef.‘The only woman for the job!’ Nigella Lawson must be the new Bake Off judgeRead moreLawson has worked on Channel 4 before, with her first cooking series Nigella Bites appearing on the station. She was also previously a judge on a culinary show for the broadcaster whenshe appeared on The Taste, in which contestants prepared a single spoon of food for her, Anthony Bourdain and French chef Ludo Lefebvre.She joins The Great British Bake Off at a point when its ratings are far below their peak. On Channel 4 the show has never reached the viewing figures it achieved on BBC One, where it averaged 10 million viewers, butwas nonetheless been a ratings success forthe broadcaster. In recent years, however, numbers have slipped, declining every year since 2020 – bar the 2025 series, which rose by about 600,000 from 2024 to a total of 7.26 million for the first episode of season 16.Channel 4’s Ian Katz said: “We’re incredibly excited about the marriage of two great British icons: Bake Off and Nigella … this summer’s series will be as mouthwatering a prospect as her chocolate Guinness cake.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe Great British Bake OffNigella LawsonFood TVnewsShareReuse this content"

Other sources close to Dunbar confirmed the news to the Guardian, adding that Dunbar had been unwell for some months.Among those paying tribute was the British dub and reggae DJ David Rodigan, who called him a “true icon … one of the greatest drummers of all time who played on literally thousands and thousands of recordings”.Those thousands of sessions were across multiple decades and made with an astonishing range of musical names: stars from the reggae scene such as Black Uhuru, Bunny Wailer and Chaka Demus & Pliers, but also ones from across the pop sphere, from Mick Jagger to Grace Jones, No Doubt and Serge Gainsbourg.View image in fullscreenDunbar with Robbie Shakespeare.Photograph: Lynn Goldsmith/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesBorn Lowell Fillmore Dunbar in Kingston, Jamaica, he started out playing on his school desk and on tin cans. Still in his teens, he and bassistRobbie Shakespeare – who died in 2021– formed the rhythm section of the group the Revolutionaries (also going under other names such as the Aggrovators), who became one of the key backing bands in Jamaican reggae that decade, as well as putting out their own music. Dunbar’s insistent shuffling “rockers” drum pattern – an early showcase for which was on Dave and Ansell Collins’ Double Barrel, a UK No 1 in 1971 and Dunbar’s first appearance on a song – became hugely influential and soon underpinned whole swathes of roots reggae.View image in fullscreenThirteen-time Grammy nominee … Dunbar.Photograph: David Corio/RedfernsA 1978 tour with the Rolling Stones inspired a harder, more energetic sound for albums by the likes of Black Uhuru. By the end of the 70s Dunbar and Shakespeare had earned enough to form their own label, Taxi Records, and as well as releasing a steady stream of albums as a duo, began being courted by stars from outside Jamaica. They played on an iconic trio of Grace Jones albums in the early 1980s – Warm Leatherette, Nightclubbing and Living My Life – and four albums by Serge Gainsbourg as the French vocalist became interested in reggae, plus two by Bob Dylan: Infidels and Empire Burlesque, with Dunbar describing the former as “one of the coolest sessions that we ever worked on”.They also backed Ian Dury, including on confrontational hit Spasticus Autisticus, as well as Joe Cocker, Jimmy Cliff, Gwen Guthrie and more. The Rolling Stones connection endured, with Dunbar playing percussion on Undercover, and drums for Mick Jagger’s solo album She’s the Boss.He and Shakespeare pioneered a bright and melodic take on dancehall with Chaka Demus & Pliers in the early 90s, scoring hits with songs such as Tease Me and Murder She Wrote. Other key later tracks included playing drums on Fugees album The Score; appearing on Simply Red’s successful cover of Night Nurse and Suggs’ cover of Cecilia; and producing two major hits for No Doubt: Underneath it All and Hey Baby. He played on and co-wrote Cheerleader, an international hit for singer Omi in 2014.Dunbar ended up a 13-time Grammy nominee, winning twice.Explore more on these topicsMusicReggaePop and rockJamaicanewsShareReuse this content"

The organisers asked for a 10-minute “respectful” event at sunset on Park City’s Main Streetto memorialise Renee Good, who was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent on 7 January, and Alex Pretti, who was killed on Saturday by an agent of the Department of Homeland Security.Footage of the protest posted by Deadlineshowed participants holding up their lit phones and chanting “love melts ICE” as a small group of law enforcement officials looked on.Deadline reported that Lord of the Rings actor Elijah Wood was among the protesters, and told the publication: “The folks who have been unlawfully gunned down in Minnesota – it’s awful. Here we are at this film festival that is about bringing people together; it’s about telling stories from all over the world. We’re not divided here; we’re coming together.”Notable among figures making statementshas been actor Natalie Portman, who wore “ICE out” and “Be Good” pins while conducting media duties at the festival. Portman also told Deadline: “What’s going on in this country right now is absolutely horrific. What the federal government, Trump’s government, Kristi Noem, ICE – what they’re doing is really the worst of the worst of humanity.”Actor and director Olivia Wilde also commented on the shootings on Saturday,telling Variety: “I’m appalled and sickened. We can’t go another day just sort of accepting this as our new norm. It’s outrageous.

As NERD, they released five albums.Lawyers for Hugo allege that Williams, in his own right a producer for artists including Kendrick Lamar, Ed Sheeran and the Weeknd, has withheld royalties and shares from touring income and merchandising, and that he refused to share documents that would clarify Hugo’s earnings despite repeat demands for financial disclosure. Hugo’s lawyers say the demands were ignored or met only with “limited” and “incomplete” documentation in “a breach of the operating agreement”.They estimate that the earnings due to Hugo from No One Ever Really Dies could exceed “$750k-$1m”.They claim Williams perpetuated a “systematic denial” of Hugo’s rights, alleging that he engaged in “self-dealing, concealed material information and … diverted revenues owed to plaintiff. Such wilful, fraudulent and malicious conduct warrants the imposition of punitive damages.”A representative for Williamstold Billboard magazinethat a standard accounting review was under way. “The lawsuit filed is premature as there may not even be a dispute between the parties.“If the accounting review determines that money is owed, the appropriate party will pay it. Pharrell has consistently acted in good faith. He has great respect for Chad and looks forward to resolving this in a way that honours their shared history.”It is the second lawsuit that Hugo has filed against Williams. In 2024, he accused him of “fraudulently” attempting to control the Neptunes name. The matter is still the subject of a federal trademark tribunal.At the time, representatives for Pharrell told Billboard that he was “surprised” by the filing. “We have reached out on multiple occasions to share in the ownership and administration of the trademark and will continue to make that offer,” they said. “The goal here was to make sure a third party doesn’t get a hold of the trademark and to guarantee Chad and Pharrell share in ownership and administration.” Hugo’s lawyers disputed their claims.Kelis has previously claimed that she was “blatantly lied to and tricked” by the Neptunes over the royalties for her 1999 debut album, Kaleidoscope. “Their argument is: ‘Well, you signed it,’”she told the Guardian in 2000. “I’m like: ‘Yeah, I signed what I was told, and I was too young and too stupid to double-check it.’” Representatives for Williams and Hugo did not respond to her widely publicised comments.In 2022, Beyoncé removed an interpolation of the Kelis song Milkshake from her Renaissance album track Energy after Kelis called it an act of “thievery”. She clarified that she took no issue with Beyoncé: “It’s beyond this song at this point.”Explore more on these topicsPharrell WilliamsThe NeptunesPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

But recent studies show there’s another wayJoel SnapeMon 26 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 04.02 ESTShareUntil pretty recently, the conventional wisdom about building muscle was that it worked via a system you might think of as “tear and repair” – the idea being that working out causes microtears in the muscle fibres, which trigger the body’s repair processes, encouraging the muscles to come back bigger and stronger.That’s why many old-school trainers will tell you that there’s no gain without pain, and why a lot of bodybuilding advice includes increasingly byzantine ways of pushing your biceps and triceps to the point where you can’t do another repetition: the more trauma you can cause, the thinking goes, the more “swole” you can become.To be clear, this has worked for plenty of lifters – especially ones aided by under-the-counter performance enhancers, which can help recovery from even the most arduous workouts. But the current science suggests that there’s a better way to think about things.“The best evidence now suggests that the primary driver of muscle hypertrophy – the technical term for an increase in size of the muscle cells – is mechanical tension,” says Dr Anne Brady, a kinesiology professor who specialises in muscle quality, physical function and body composition. “Muscle damage certainly contributes, but it’s not the main factor. Typically, it’s more of a side-effect.”View image in fullscreenBurn those biceps?Photograph: PeopleImages/Getty ImagesTo explain this a bit more: when you lift a weight that’s heavy enough (or you perform enough repetitions of a movement to reach near-failure, which you’ll recognise from the fact that your reps slow down and feel more “grindy”), the resulting physical tension stretches the membrane that encases your muscle cells. From there, specialised sensors called mechanoreceptors detect that stretch and turn on what’s known as the mTOR pathway, a sort of master regulator that listens to various signals and “decides” whether your body should be building new tissue or breaking down old parts for energy. From there, the mTOR pathway signals to the cell to start muscle protein synthesis (MPS) – the process of adding new protein to the muscle fibres to make them thicker and stronger.You can get a burn from doing enough biceps curls with a pencil but you won’t grow much“A third factor is metabolic stress, which leads to the ‘burn’ that you might feel while lifting,” says Brady. “You can think of that as an amplifier to mechanical tension – it’s a form of cellular signalling which creates a favourable environment for muscle growth.” In other words, feeling your muscles start to ache might mean that you’ve pushed them enough to grow, but it also might not – you can get a burn from doing enough bicepscurls with a pencil in your hand; you won’t grow much because there isn’t enough physical tension to strain your muscle fibres.The second key thing to understand about muscle is that you can build a fair amount of it without adding much extra strength – or, if you’d prefer, get quite a lot stronger without actually getting any larger. “There are two main types of muscle hypertrophy: myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic,” says Brady. “Myofibrillar hypertrophy is an increase in the number of myofibrils – the bundles of tiny filaments that actually contract to lift weights – resulting in increased strength. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is an expansion of the volume of fluid inside the muscle – this results in a larger muscle size without additional strength.”View image in fullscreenHigh tension and metabolic stress …Photograph: FlamingoImages/Getty ImagesThis is how Olympic weightlifters can move enormous weights without jumping up a bodyweight category, and why gymnasts can be stronger in certain movements than bodybuilders who train entirely for aesthetics. Science now suggests that one form of hypertrophy rarely happens without the other, but different types of workout can certainly lead to one style getting priority: in astudy from 2019, young men who worked out for six weeks on a high-volume weightlifting programme seemed to see the largest results from sarcoplasmic hypertrophy: in other words, they got bigger without necessarily getting much stronger. The mosteffectivegrowth seems to happen when you combine the two types of hypertrophy: using a weight heavy enough to create high tension, but performed for enough repetitions to generate significant metabolic stress.What does all this mean for you? First, it means that whether something hurts – either during your workout or in the days afterwards – isn’t necessarily a good marker of its effectiveness. “It has been noted that muscles can grow with minimal soreness, and on the flip side there can be lots of muscle damage with little muscle growth – for example in downhill running,” says Brady. “At the same time, muscle damage can reduce growth if it negatively impacts an individual’s performance when training or training frequency.”View image in fullscreenGetting strongerandbigger?Photograph: Kate Wieser/Getty ImagesWhat does sugar do to your body – and how can you avoid a slump?Read moreIt also means that you don’t need to worry too much about pushing yourself to the limit, or even close to it. “Icoach women in midlife, and always tell them not to major in the minor,” says Brady: in other words, don’t obsess over trivial details. “During resistance training, I’d suggest working to near failure. This can be accomplished across a wide range of repetitions as long as the final few reps are challenging.”What coaches call progressive overload – making the muscles do more work – is still key, but there are lots of ways to come at it: doing more repetitions in each set, using heavier weights, reducing the amount of time you spend resting between sets, and so on. Gradually up the amount you’re doing over weeks or months, and you’ll get both stronger and probably slightly bigger – but please note that you’re unlikely to outgrow your T-shirts unless you’re investing in serious pharmaceutical help.

When I was sickest, and felt unlovable, he reminded me I was lovedJan GraceMon 26 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 11.55 ESTShareJack, the cocker spaniel, was sacked by the police. His career as a detection dog was an utter failure – he was more interested in people than cannabis and made some embarrassing mistakes, including begging for treats from potential offenders rather than alerting officers about drugs.A colleague told me about a police dog that needed a home and so Jack arrived – via police van – at our house. He was lithe, glossy black and animated. He ricocheted around the house, knocking over children and pot plants. He chased rabbits and pheasants over the fields. He ate off the children’s plates and collected shoes. He loved us all indiscriminately and liked to have us where he could see us. If anyone left the room, he’d sigh deeply and follow, remaining close until the pack was back together.View image in fullscreen‘He gave me love and gave me structure’ … Jack.Photograph: Jan GraceAbout a year after Jack arrived, I found out a breast lump the GP had initially thought was nothing was actually cancer. I had surgery and when chemotherapy started, I felt too ill to see friends. The children were at school. I was lonely and, for the first time I could remember, had nothing to do.The pet I’ll never forget: Bosko the great flying cat inspired my art – and delivered me from griefRead moreOn chemo weeks, I was too sick to get out of bed, and lovely friends arrived every morning to walk Jack. When I felt well enough, Jack and I walked over the fields. He was gentle and came back when called. He stopped bringing me rabbits. He never complained about the long days at home where we’d lay on the sofa, both out of work. We watched Star Trek and Pride and Prejudice. He repressed his natural instinct for chaos until the rest of the family came home.Jack gave me a job. He nudged me off the sofa, gave me love and gave me structure. He lay on the bathroom floor with me when I was vomiting and never let me out of his sight. I felt unlovable and he loved me, steadily and without demand.When I was in remission and back at work as an NHS hospital consultant, Jack continued to supervise me closely, including coming out on call with me sometimes. One night, I brought him along while I saw a patient in the police cells. In the station, Jack took one look at the sergeant and sat under a desk, refusing to make eye contact. I don’t think he regretted the loss of his previous career. He’d found another way to make the world a better place.Jack died when he was 12, quietly and without fuss. We scattered his ashes on his favourite beach. It took me a couple of years to stop making a space for him on the sofa.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe pet I'll never forgetPetsDogsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Extra kudos if you got through it without booking a holiday amid the onslaught of sun-soaked adverts, although I confess I’m not tempted. Would I rather spend hours on a plane with 200 strangers who had prosecco for breakfast, or hibernate until spring? I’ll take hibernation, thanks.

On the upside, all the darkness encourages your body to produce plenty of the “sleep hormone” melatonin (nature’s way of telling you to sleep through it). On the downside, lack of sunlight is a key trigger forseasonal affective disorder (Sad)– one ofthe symptoms of which is broken sleep. Never simple, is it?After a year and a half at the Filter and a decade on the perimenopausal insomnia bus, I’ve learned a thing or 40 about getting my 40 winks. Even in high summer, testing the most-hypedsleep aidstaught me new ways to nod off in a heatwave. But while ablackout eye maskand chilledtart cherry juicehelped me sleep in June, winter needs a different approach.Sleeping aunaturel (fibres)View image in fullscreenLumen the cat also approved of the Panda Cloud duvet.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThe most surprising thing I’ve learned while testing cosy bedding, frommemory foam mattress toppers(my favourite: theSimba Hybrid topper) tomicrowaveable weighted blankets(a gift for chilly feet), is that breathability is even more important on cold nights than hot nights. A heat-trapping polyester fleece may help you fall asleep, but in my experience, it’ll soon have you waking up, cooking in your own sweat. At least in summer you can just throw off all the covers.Breathable natural fibres were used in thebest mattresses,duvetsandpillowswe’ve tested this winter. Bamboo, wool and cotton are nature’s temperature regulators, able to keep you warm when sharing a bed under a high-tog duvet but feeling deliciously cool against your skin. In my recent test of thebest duvets,Panda’s bamboo-infused duvetimpressed me so much that I bought one, and it’s only through sheer self-discipline that I’m not wrapped in it right now.I love the relative lightness of the Panda duvet, but you may find aweighted blanketsoothing, especially in winter when its deep hug will keep out every scrap of cold air. The cotton-encasedEmma Hug blankethelped calm my restless legs without trapping heatduring my recent test, but my chilly feet were seduced by the polyester charms of theLifemax heated weighted blanket, which also makes a lovely shoulder wrap. By and large, though, I’d recommend sticking to natural-fibre bedding for sleep.The temperature-regulating power of natural material even works when you’re using anelectric blanket, as I discovered last week when running heat-retention tests on a wool mattress.

They’re still making a regular appearance in our house, from shredded and stir-fried with chilli and spice, to roasted and dressed, as in this salad. And what a salad it is: with a caesar-esque dressing, it is crisp, salty and crunchy, and hits all the right notes. You can bulk it out, if you like, by topping it with a few soft, jammy boiled eggs cut into wedges or some shredded leftover chicken. However, it is pretty perfect as it is, as a light lunch or side.Roast sprout salad with anchovies and parmesanPrep10 minCook35 minServes2as a main500g brussels sprouts, trimmedOlive oil2 tbsp white-wine vinegar, or cider vinegarSea salt andblack pepper125g ciabatta(about ½ loaf)1 small garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped4 anchovy fillets1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped25g parmesan2 little gems, trimmed½ bunch fresh chives, finely choppedHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. Halve the sprouts, put them in a large roasting tray and drizzle with two tablespoons of olive oil and a tablespoon of the vinegar, then season generously. Really massage everything into the sprouts, then pop them in the oven for 15 minutes.Tear the ciabatta into small, bite-size pieces and toss these through the roast sprouts. Drizzle with a little more olive oil, then return to the oven for 10-15 minutes, until everything is crisp, slightly charred around the edges and tender. Remove and cool slightly.Meanwhile, make the dressing. In a mortar, pound the garlic with a pinch of sea salt until creamy, then add the anchovies and keep pounding until they have broken down. Muddle in the chopped shallot, two tablespoons of olive oil and the remaining tablespoon of vinegar, then season with black pepper. Finely grate in half of the parmesan and stir with the pestle, adding a little more olive oil to loosen if need be – you want a thick, creamy dressing.Cut the little gems into thin wedges. Stir the dressing through the sprouts, using your hands to make sure everything is coated, then add the little gem wedges and most of the chopped chives, and toss again. Scatter over the remaining chives, shave the remaining parmesan over the top with a vegetable peeler, and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodSaladVegetablesMain courseSide dishesCheeseFishrecipesShareReuse this content"

First up, some eastern Mediterranean chicken meatballs, flecked with feta and black olives for a sharp, savoury punch. Then a Persian-style saffron chicken and rice; the rice cooks with the chicken, absorbing all the flavours of the sunshine-yellow saffron and crisping up at the edges. Finally, a Korean-inspired chicken and potato traybake in which gochujang and soy create a deeply savoury sauce that elevates a simple midweek meal.Feta-licious chicken meatballs (pictured top)I’m a big fan of chicken meatballs: they are juicy, light and really easy to make. These ones are flavoured with feta, olives and Turkish pepper flakes, and they’re cooked in a rich tomato sauce. Serve them with salad, pasta or a jacket potato, and they’re epic the next day for a simple lunch al desko.Prep15 minCook15 minServes4For the meatballs600g chicken breasts, or minced chicken150g feta50g black pitted olives4 spring onions, trimmed and roughly chopped2garlic cloves,peeled2 tbsp tomato puree2 tsp Turkish pepper flakes1 tsp dried oreganoSalt and pepperFor the sauce680g tomato passata2 tsp Turkish pepper flakes2 tsp dried oregano1 tsp garlic powder50g feta1 small handful finely chopped parsley leavesHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. To make the meatballs, put the chicken breasts (or mince) in a food processor and add all the remaining meatball ingredients and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Blitz smooth, then roll into 16 meatballs.Swirl a few tablespoons of the passata around the base of a 24cm x 32cm roasting tin. Mix the remaining passata with the Turkish pepper flakes, dried oregano, garlic powder and a big pinch of salt and pepper.Arrange the meatballs in the roasting tin, then pour the sauce over the top to cover. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through – cut one in half to test: it should be pale in colour and firm-textured all the way through. If it’s not quite there, return the tin to the oven for a few minutes more, until the meatballs are cooked.Crumble the remaining 50g feta over the top, scatter on the parsley and serve immediately.Seoulful Korean garlic chickenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Poole/Penguin Random HouseThis is a take ondakdoritang, a Korean chicken and potato stew, reimagined as a quick and easy traybake.

Whisk the gochujang, soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, sugar and ginger in a jug.Put the chicken in a large bowl, spoon over three tablespoons of the gochujang sauce and toss to coat. Pour the stock into the jug with the remaining sauce and whisk.Put the onions, garlic, potatoes and chicken in a 30cm x 40cm roasting tin, then pour over the sauce/stock mix. Cover the tin with foil, then roast for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, turn down the heat to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then return the tin to the oven for 30-40 minutes, until the chicken is lovely and crisp and the tops of the potatoes are golden. Scatter on the spring onions and sesame seeds, and serve at once.Persian-style saffron chicken riceView image in fullscreenPerfumed with saffron and cardamom, and with crisp chicken and fluffy rice, this is one of the most exquisite traybakes around. I was inspired by a stunning Persian dish,zereshk polo ba morgh, or saffron-roast chicken with rice and barberries. The OG is all cooked separately, with the chicken in one pot, crisp rice (ortahdig) in another, and barberries candied in sugar syrup in another. Mine, however, has more of a laid-back, throw-it-all-in-the-oven vibe. I love piling on the garnishes for colour and texture – more is more in my opinion – but feel free to scale back if I’ve gone a little overboard.Prep10 minCook55 minServes41 pinchsaffron4garlic cloves, peeled and crushed3 tbsp tomato puree2 tbsp olive oilJuice of 1 orange2 tsp ground coriander½ tsp turmeric¼ tsp ground cinnamonSalt and pepper500ml hot chicken stock1kg skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs250g basmati rice3 cardamom pods, bashed open1 handful of barberries or pomegranate seeds10g pistachios, roughly chopped1 handful coriander leaves300g Greek yoghurt– I use 10% fatHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the saffron in a large bowl, add two tablespoons of just-boiled water, then stir and leave to infuse for a few minutes.Add the garlic, tomato puree, olive oil, orange juice, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon and a very generous pinch each of salt and pepper to the the saffron bowl, then mix to a paste.Whisk half the saffron paste into the stock. Put the chicken thighs in the remaining paste in the bowl and toss to coat.Tip the rice into a 30cm x 40cm roasting tin and pour the stock on top. Add the cardamom pods, then arrange the chicken on top. Cover the tray with foil, bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 20-25 minutes, until the chicken is golden and cooked through and the rice nicely crisp on top.Garnish with the barberries or pomegranate seeds, pistachios and coriander leaves, and serve immediately with yoghurt.These recipes are edited extracts from The Greatest Traybake Cookbook Ever: Weeknight-Friendly Traybakes with Weekend-Worthy Flavours, by John Gregory-Smith, published by Penguin Michael Joseph on 29 January at £25.

The background to your plight is a fall last June that caused a minor head injury. Your hospital consultant wrote in your discharge notes that you should desist from driving for two weeks, and advised you to inform the DVLA. You complied.The DVLA confirmed over the phone that you could drive again once the fortnight was up, and asked you to submit a medical form along with the discharge notes. In due course, you resumed driving without incident.Two months later you received a letter from the DVLA ordering you to stop driving immediately until early December. It insisted you return your licence, and refused to explain what information had prompted the decision.You reapplied for your licence in October, as instructed by the DVLA, so it would be ready in time, but December came and went. Since then you have pleaded in vain for updates. The DVLA knows your terrible circumstances, but it has merely repeated that your application is being processed.I contacted the agency as soon as I read your message. You were called the next day and told that you can now drive. Your daughter died three days later with you at her side.I asked the DVLA what medical evidence had informed the decision to ban you from driving; why, if you were deemed unfit to drive, it waited two months to take action, and why the delay in reissuing your licence. Given how many complaints I receive from drivers left in limbo because of similar delays, I also asked if there was a backlog.The DVLA answered none of these questions. It merely stated that it assesses medical declarations from drivers and takes appropriate action. It says applications can be delayed if information is outstanding, although you were never informed this was the case, and tells me it is introducing a new system that should provide “significant improvements” to drivers with medical conditions.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

But what was once an expensive treatment you’d go to a professional to receive is now becoming widely available in the form of light-up masks you can wear at home.“Reasonable reportsshow that the treatment is good for wound-healing,” says Mosahebi. This is why it is recommended for inflammatory skin conditions such as acne, dermatitis and psoriasis, as it increases circulation, decreases inflammation, and improves cell regeneration.When it comes to preventing wrinkles though, there’s less proof. “One of the things we know that happens as we age is the fibroblast cells become a little bit sleepy. The theory is the light will stimulate them into action to produce collagen, which is something we need for thicker, plumper, less wrinkly skin.” But there’s no substantial evidence to back this up, he says. And if it does work, professional sessions are far more likely to be effective as they’re stronger than the at-home masks.The theory is the light will stimulate cells to produce collagen … but there’s no substantial evidence to back this upIs it true that … taking collagen supplements slows signs of ageing?Read moreMosahebi also warns there is limited research into using red light therapy as a repeated, long-term treatment – something manufacturers encourage with the masks. “We don’t know what happens when people use it in the long term. We don’t know if it actually causes more aged skin because light is the main cause of ageing, or whether it has any effect on skin cancer.”Mosahebi says he believes red light therapy is safe, but that the best way to delay the onset of wrinkles is to make sure your diet is nutritious, drink enough water, exercise regularly, and wear a nourishing moisturiser and high protection sunscreen. If you’re not doing those things, it’s not worth shelling out for a mask.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …BeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dylan Thomas was definitely on to something with his love of walking, and Wales meets a writer’s need to walk and write. I developed a routine of morning writing followed by a stroll along the damp banks of the River Usk through clouds of marsh hair moss, allowing the plot tangles to unknot themselves in the cold Welsh air. I was amazed by how much I got done in a long weekend cut off from distractions, but it was an eerie idyll and I missed having people to bounce ideas off.View image in fullscreenA moment of reflection by Loch Lomond at an Acorn Writing RetreatRewarding myself for reaching the hallowed 50,000-word mark and clutching a patchy story and the beginnings of a credible three-act structure, my next stop was theUrban Writers’ Retreat. I had already taken an online writing course with its founder, Charlie Haynes, and liked the supportive way she worked. So I knew I would be in safe hands for my three-night stay in the expansive Georgian farmhouse near Newton Abbot, Devon, where she hosts her retreats.The setup was what I needed: unfettered time away from life’s admin during which I could immerse myself in the story. While my room had faded country house charm and a desk, I preferred the window seat of the drawing room, where I could look out at the gardens and farm animals as I wrote.There were six guests and we met for meals and to talk about all things writing in the cosy kitchen. Relinquishing the mental load of meal prep in return for herb-crusted salmon, fig and mozzarella salad and homemade cake was one of the greatest pleasures, all the more enjoyable given that Charlie, who prepared much of the food herself, is a notable cook. Even had I not written a word, I would have left feeling restored.My novel had become the Google Docs equivalent of a cupboard door that was opened occasionally then crammed shut before the overwhelm cascaded outMonths later, my novel had slipped down my priority list, becoming the Google Docs equivalent of a cupboard door that was opened occasionally then crammed shut before the messy overwhelm cascaded out.Informed by her PhD experience, Dr Rebecca Maxwell Stuart set upAcorn Writing Retreatsto help writers tackle their unwieldy manuscripts. “Coming on an Acorn retreat allows writers time and opportunity to have conceptual clarity on their projects, but also leave feeling good about themselves,” she says.Amid an expansive Loch Lomond landscape, the Oak Tree Inn in Balmaha was a paradisal setting for a four-day retreat for a diverse group (fiction, academic, nonfiction) of eight writers. This was one of the most structured retreats. We started with some goal setting and sharing our objectives, and there were four writing sessions across the day, including short activities, which were brilliant for jump-starting ideas and energising my writing.View image in fullscreenA bijou cabin at Starcroft Farm near Battle in East Sussex.Photograph: Tom MilnerWe wrote quietly, seated around a horseshoe table. Writing together is strongly encouraged for the duration of the retreat, to foster support and momentum and hold your writing gently to account. Nurture is important to Rebecca’s ethos, and there is optional meditation in the evenings and time to celebrate the small wins of the day.Watching sunlight and shadows race along the lochside hills on our afternoon walks, it was hard not to feel hope in my project and believe my years-long work-in-progress might reach completion.Sometimes it’s the right people at the right time that make a writing break memorable, as I found atRewrite, a retreat for women of colour. The founder, Christina Fonthes, is an author who runs writing and wellbeing programmes in the UK, Costa Rica, Portugal and Thailand, as well as online.Tucked into the writing nook of the cabin, it was impossible not to do my best workThe Brighton weekend retreat I chose was a refreshing opportunity to concentrate on technique. The structured writing sessions focused on helping us find our voice, then we workshopped what we had written and shared what we had developed in an open mic finale. Christina highlights the importance of connection between mind and body, and avoiding the burnout all too common for Black women. A meditative daily yoga practice brought that to life. Discussing the themes of beauty, Blackness and belonging that I explore in my novel in a safe space with other women of colour edged me closer to the final draft.With the end of the novel in sight, I needed solitude and space to write my way to the finish. A wood cabin atStarcroft Farm, overlooking the fringes of Powdermill Wood near Battle in East Sussex, was quietly perfect.Hannah Stuart-Leach, a historian and former travel journalist, and her husband Tom have created the most magical space where every aspect of a writer’s journey has been carefully planned out. Each bijou wood cabin has a desk area, bathroom, kitchenette and a bedroom with a stargazing skylight. There was a pagan air afoot in my cabin: a carefully curated collection of craft books, poetry and witchy tomes (including Hagitude by Sharon Blackie) filled the bookshelf. There was also a box of spells for down time, while the Green Man looked down from a print on the wall.View image in fullscreenThe writer at the Starcroft Farm cabin.Photograph: Tom MilnerThe nicest touch was arriving to find a gift-wrapped copy of Soldier Sailor by Claire Kilroy, specially chosen by the local independentRother Booksafter a brief pre-trip email questionnaire.I chose to work alone, but Starcroft Farm also arranges brilliant regular sessions with writing coaches, one-to-one or in small-group themed retreats. Tucked into the writing nook of the cabin, it was impossible not to do my best work.I finished my novel. The sense of achievement is enormous. And while there’s no substitute for keeping your bum in the seat and getting words on to the page, having a few days of literary luxury every so often with like-minded people certainly made it more fun.TheOld Chapelin Llanfrynach is £487 for three nights.Urban Writers’ Retreathas rooms from £415 for three nights.Acorn Writing Retreats’ all-inclusive rates are £525 for three days, £675 for four(theAcorn Access Fundoffers discounts for marginalised and low-income writers).RewriteinEast Sussexfrom £1,700 for five nights.Starcroft Farmcabins £320 for a two-night independent writing break and £750 for a four-night small-group retreat with coaching, massage and otherextras (the writer was given one night’s stay for this article)Fiona McAuslanhopes to have her debut novel published in 2027Explore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysLearning holidaysScotland holidaysEngland holidaysWales holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At his school swimming lesson, he jumped in and swam – then realised with horror that his feet couldn’t feel the bottom. He recalls his teacher, standing on the side of the pool, shouting at him to “just swim” and his own immobilising fear. “I thought, ‘I can’t. I don’t know what to do.’ I started to panic hard. I thought, ‘She’s going to let me die.’”Warr, 61, has blocked out how he reached safety, but for five decades he refused to go out of his depth again. He lives on the island of Jersey where water is a fact of life – but even when his sons were small, he would only wade a bit, and watch them swim with envy and pride. In contrast, he felt he was “battling the water”.Warr runs atea and coffee businessand also works as a politician; he’s a deputy for the St Helier South district. He doesn’t go on holiday often, but last year he and his wife visited Norway and stayed in a hotel on a lake. The water was murky and dark. There were no shallows. Warr’s wife swam; he dipped in a toe. “I thought, ‘I’m not going in there. I don’t trust myself.’”A few days later, they passed a long zip wire. Warr plays tennis and keeps fit, and “the sense of holding age at bay is strong” for him. “I have this thing in me, which is, if there’s an inadequacy, I want to overcome that.” Warr went on the zip wire, and when he and his wife returned to Jersey, he asked his boys’ old swimming teacher, Sally Minty-Gravett,for lessons. She had repeatedly swum the Channel, so she knew what she was doing.View image in fullscreenDream team … Sally Minty-Gravett and David Warr.Photograph: Courtesy of David WarrThey met at the bottom of a slipway. Warr put on goggles and a hat. “All the gear, and no idea.” In the first lesson, he practised floating. After a few sessions, he became more confident, but he still couldn’t go out of his depth.When Minty-Gravett asked him to jump off the slipway into the deep, it was “the most fearful moment … Here I come – you can kill me now, kind of thing,” he says.“Sally said: ‘David, why are you so worried about being out of your depth? You should maybe lie on a couch with someone and discuss it.’”Warr grew up in Kilkenny, Ireland. But at 11, he moved with his father and brother to England. “Sadly, my mum passed away,” he says. The swimming pool incident happened soon afterwards, at his new school. Before long, he was moved to a boarding school – “basically, popped out of the way somewhere”.The topic of his mother’s death never came up, until he caught chickenpox and “got chatting to the school nurse”. When he told her about his mother, “she was absolutely shocked”. But there was no grief counselling. “I internalised stuff, then explained it away to myself.”“I feel this is something I’ve got to confront myself. I can’t explain the fear to anybody else,” he told Minty-Gravett. He jumped into the deep water. “And I bounced back up to the surface, kicked around for a bit, and thought, ‘What now?’” Minty-Gravett reminded him to float. That when he couldn’t swim, he could float. “And I then managed to creep along the side of the slipway.”“Sally’s commentary was, ‘David, the sea is not trying to kill you. Let the water support you … It’s holding you, it’s embracing you.’ I’d never thought of that concept.”Warr has learned that he doesn’t need to feel the ground beneath his feet to feel safe. “No matter how fearful you become, the loss of your mum at a young age – that’s the abyss. Nothing else is ever as traumatic.”Warr has since swum out to a boat, accompanied by Minty-Gravett, and completed lengths of the local pool. While swimming, he has seen the sunrise and his island from a different perspective. He’s seen the small-boat fishers return with their catch, and the wild swimmers. “There are people who walk out of their houses and jump straight in the sea.” He has found “a new connection” with his home. The shoreline, he says, “is teeming with life”.Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60SwimmingHealth & wellbeingFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Once contractors have finished, his company plans to open a datacentre, reinventing a site from the first Industrial Revolution for the next.“As one industry closes, Warrington has been quite good at opening new ones – and we hope datacentres is one of those new spaces.”A director of a local property firm, Dante Group, he knows the blue corrugated-metal factory looming over Bank Quay station is a well-known local landmark on theCheshireskyline. Alongside wire, beer and gin, soap helped to power Warrington’s industrial development. But few will miss it.“There’s a mentality here around of just getting on with it. We’re trying to do big things here if we can.”View image in fullscreenCarl Oates, a director of Dante Group, says the mentality in Warrington is ‘just getting on with it’.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn an age of stalling economic progress, Britain could do with a few more towns like Warrington. According toa report published on Monday by the Centre for Cities, the town on the Mersey, between Manchester and Liverpool, has enjoyed economic growth 2.2 times faster than the national average since 2013.If this growth had been replicated nationwide, the thinktank says the average UK urban resident would have had £3,200 more in their pocket, and the British economy would be 4% larger – enough to undo the economic damage from Brexit.“Increasing living standards at more than twice the national average is a significant achievement, and Warrington shows what sustained, place-based growth can deliver,” says Andrew Carter, the Centre for Cities chief executive. “These places offer practical lessons for how growth can be unlocked elsewhere.”That Warrington should be an economic template could raise eyebrows. At the heart of the post-industrial north-west of England, it often gets lumped in with the “red wall” towns of the M62 rugby league belt, where living standards more generally have gone sideways at best.As the first thing visitors see at Bank Quay, the rusting soap factory Oates is dismantling does little to scrub any bias away.View image in fullscreenStephen Fitzsimons of Warrington Chamber of Commerce says he is ‘quite pleased’ the soap factory is coming down.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“When people come in [by train] and see that horrible blue building they go: ‘Yeah, I was right: dirty manufacturing town,’” says Stephen Fitzsimons, chief executive of Warrington Chamber of Commerce. “But it really isn’t. It’s been a long time since it was. We are quite pleased [the factory] is coming down.”These are preconceptions I know more about than most: Warrington is my home town.As a teenager, if anyone had told me I was growing up in a model of economic prosperity I probably would have laughed. Things were not at all bad – but we often felt a few paces behind Manchester and Liverpool, never mind London. The proliferation of boarded-up shops in the town centre suggest room for progress. But I can still tell Warrington is doing something right.According to the Centre for Cities, this is the most prosperous town in northern England, as the only urban location out of more than a dozen in the region analysed by the thinktank where workplace wages are above the UK average.View image in fullscreenCarl Oates, the director of Dante Group, which is demolishing the Unilever factory site alongside Warrington Bank Quay station to build an AI datacentre.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianPart of its success is down to its position. Plotted on a map, Warrington’s transport connections resemble the distinctive British Raildouble arrowlogo: “You’ve got three motorways [M6, 56 and 62]; the west coast mainline; two railways east to west; the ship canal, and two airports.“Now, the airports – Warrington East and Warrington West – for some reason, they insist on calling themselves Manchester and Liverpool. We don’t know why,” Fitzsimons jokes. “But if you’re in a European city and your airport is 20 minutes outside the centre, that’s in your city, isn’t it? Well, we have two of them.”Locals hope this month’s £45bn governmentcommitment to build Northern Powerhouse rail– including the redevelopment of Bank Quay station with low-level platforms for a new Liverpool-Manchester line – will provide another economic boost.“It will be huge for the town,” says Charlotte Nichols, one of its two Labour MPs. “One thing I hate is when people’s only experience of Warrington is looking out of the window at Bank Quay. It’s long overdue some TLC.“I want us to have something there that is an advert for the town that we are.”Good transport links have helped the town to attract investment for decades. Ikea (where I had a part-time job as a teenager) picked Warrington for its first UK store in 1987. In recent years the logistics sector has boomed, including at the vast Omega development straddling the M62.Another quietly booming sector is nuclear. A jewel in Warrington’s crown – kept relatively under wraps given the secretive history of atomic energy – it supports more than 6,000 highly skilled jobs. Its presence is down to the government picking a wartime munitions factory in the town for the base of Britain’s nuclear programme in 1946.Sellafield, the decommissioning plant, has its headquarters here as a consequence, rather than its main site 100 miles north on the Cumbrian coast.graphNichols says this mix of industries helped Warrington avoid the worst of deindustrialisation, which hit nearby towns like Wigan, St Helens and Leigh much harder. “When there has been a decline in one area – such as coal or steel, for example – there has been a pickup somewhere else.”According to the Centre for Cities, the nuclear cluster has helped to attract other fast-growing industries, including cyber and cloud-computing. The local share of knowledge-intensive jobs has doubled in the past decade – faster than anywhere else in Britain – leaving Warrington with the same concentration of cutting-edge firms as Oxford.“If you took the whole economy and plonked us in the south-east, we wouldn’t look out of place,” says Fitzsimons. “It is a southern economy in the north of England.”Walking through the condemned Unilever site, Oates says his datacentre will contribute further. “Warrington has long been known as an industrial town with an eye for innovation.”It will, however, only employ a handful of staff when built, compared with the 116 jobs lost at the washing powder factory.Warrington has wide local inequalities – particularly between the more affluent Cheshire suburbs to the south, and the poorer north in what used to be Lancashire.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage’s Reform UK is predicted to win comfortably in Warrington at the next general election.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFood bank use has risen bymore than 200% since 2019, a third of children live in poverty, and almost one in six people require debt advice.To support the local economy the council has taken an activist, yet at times controversial, approach: racking up debts of £1.5bnto fund a high-stakes investment spree.The Labour-led council argues the debts financed revenue-generating assets – offsetting a decade of Tory austerity. But critics say councillors went too far. Amid recentfinancial troubles for councils nationwide, the government sent in a team of envoys to rein things in.Hans Mundry, who took over as council leader in 2023, says debt levels have come down. “Everyone else told us it went too far. So when I came in, that was my job to try to put things right. And we’ve been turning the corner.”However, the Centre for Cities praised the authority for its investments in Birchwood Park, where the nuclear cluster is based, and Omega. The council-funded regeneration of Time Square and the old 1970s market in the town centre are award-winning. It also applauded councillors for releasing greenbelt land for residential development; helping to keep housing costs down.Sipping a cappuccino in the market’s Cookhouse food hall, Fitzsimons says the economy has benefited. “For public-private working, Warrington is really, really strong. It [the investments] helped to bring businesses here,” he says.“It was not ideal, but all local authorities were put in a position where they had these funding black holes. They had to do something – and Warrington went on the front foot.”Local leaders hope Warrington will benefit from more freedom under the government’s devolution agenda: a new Cheshire and Warrington combined authority is planned this year, with mayoral elections taking place in 2027.View image in fullscreenHans Mundry, the leader of Warrington borough council, at the town hall. Councillors have been praised for freeing greenbelt land for residential development.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe view is that Manchester and Liverpool have benefited from their mayors;Andy Burnham(who grew up in the same Warrington suburb as me), andSteve Rotheram. But the town in the middle has been overlooked. The disappointment was only compounded by the last government’s levelling up promise, which many locals feel amounted to little more than lip service.“We all know the investment hasn’t been put in,” saysSteve Purdham, a serial entrepreneur who chairs the incoming combined authority’s business advisory board. “For big ideas – like theNorthern Arc, or transportation between Liverpool and Manchester – you need very vocal mayors like Andy and Steve.”The trouble for the town’s current Labour representatives is they could be mustered out. Nigel Farage’s Reform UKis predicted to win here comfortablyat the next general election. Support for rightwing populism is clear from several of the town’s roundabouts, where St George’s cross flags and union jacks flutter – including outside Nichols’s office in the suburb of Orford.Mundry says some locals see the town’s flaws more readily than its progress. “It’s a natural thing – like when you go on holiday. You come back after a wonderful two weeks away, and you remember the two things that went wrong.”Nichols says voters are right to be frustrated, despite Warrington’s economic outperformance. Labour promised change. “It’s not unreasonable for people to expect that [change] quicker than they’ve seen it,” she says.“We’re doing better than a lot of places, and that much is true. But we’re still not where anyone would want us to be.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsCheshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said he believed everyone else on the boat, which had departed fromTunisiaon 20 January, had died, according to Alarm Phone, an organisation running a hotline for people in distress at sea.In a separate tragedy last week, one-year-old twin girls from Guinea are presumed to have died off the coast of the Sicilian island of Lampedusa after an overcrowded boat they were travelling on was battered by Cyclone Harry, according to the Italy unit forUnicef’s migrant and refugee response.Italy’s coastguard estimates that 380 others who set sail from Tunisia during the cyclone, which generated huge waves in the Mediterranean, might also have drowned. The coastguard has been searching for eight vessels that had been launched by people smugglers from the Tunisian port city of Sfax during the past 10 days despite the treacherous conditions.According to figures from Italy’s interior ministry, 66,296 people arrived by boat on Italian coastlines during 2025, representing a slight dip on the previous year but about half the number of arrivals in 2023, when Italy’s far-right government either reinforced or enacted deals withLibyaand Tunisia to stem the flow.There are fewer NGO rescue ships operating in the Mediterranean owing to a crackdown by the Italian government, including fines and a mandate to disembark people rescued at distant ports rather than bringing them to ones that are closer, such as in Sicily.Despite the hardline measures, people still attempt the high-risk journey from northAfricain search of refuge in Europe.Italy is one of the main landing points, with the central Mediterranean route considered one of the world’s most dangerous. The UN’s International Organization forMigrationhas registered at least 25,600 deaths and disappearances among people attempting the crossing since 2014.

The rivers have connected with all areas where there is water,” Bongece was quoted as saying by local media last week. One person was killed by a crocodile in Maputo, in the town of Moamba, and two in neighbouring Gaza province, officials said.Southern Africa has been hit by increasingly extreme weather in recent years as the climate crisis has worsened, veering betweenrecord-breaking droughts,cyclonesand extreme rainfall.The death toll in Mozambique is expected to rise. Officials said the flooding was the worst in the country since 2000, when about 700 people were killed. Almost 400,000 people have been displaced, with manyrescued by helicopterfrom trees and rooftops.View image in fullscreenFlood waters cover the Chibuto-Chaimite road in Gaza province, Mozambique.Photograph: APAlthough it has not rained for several days, flood waters are still rising in some areas as water continues to flow across the border from South Africa.

The tally made Win the second-largest party in parliament, securing Mohamed’s election even as a magistrate’s court hears state arguments for his extradition to the US.Mohamed and his father, Nazar Mohamed, wereindicted last year in Florida on federal charges of gold smuggling and money laundering.The indictments came just over a year after the US treasury department also sanctioned the duo for allegedly smuggling more than 10,000 kilograms (22,000 pounds) of gold to the US from Guyana, and evading more than $50m in taxes.The case has underscored persistent government corruption in the oil-rich South American country.The family had been among Guyana’s largest gold buyers and exporters. They also ran one of the most successful foreign exchange outlets and possess extensive real estate holdings. Authorities have since shuttered all their businesses and commercial bank accounts once the sanctions were announced.Monday’s brief session, attended exclusively by opposition lawmakers, took place amid simmering pressure from western countries and civil society groups, which had accused authorities of delaying calling a parliamentary session to allow his election. Until Monday, parliament had met only once since its dissolution in July ahead of the September general elections.Addressing the possibility that he and his father could be extradited, Mohamed said that “a person is innocent until proven guilty”.He contended that efforts to exile him have much to do with the fact that WIN is opposing the ruling People’s Progressive Party (PPP) with success, noting that “that is why they are fighting me down”.“I announced my candidacy because of the people of this country,” he said. “The people asked me. I would not have had any court issues if I did not contest this election. I am ready to serve the people of this country,” he told reporters outside parliament.The house speaker, Manzoor Nadir, publicly expressed his unease with Mohamed’s election, describing himself as being in a “difficult position” for having to oversee the appointment of a fugitive as the nation’s opposition leader. He nevertheless chaired Monday’s brief proceedings, and ultimately congratulated Mohamed on his victory.Explore more on these topicsGuyanaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They are members of the Brazilian soy producers’ association Abiove, which recently removed its name from theofficial websiteof the soy moratorium.Without their participation, conservation groupswarn of a free-for-all raceto clear land in the Amazon biome despite scientific warnings that destruction of the world’s biggest tropical rainforest is approaching a point of no return. Supporters of the moratorium say its loss could open up an area the size of Portugal unless alternative measures are put in place.The letter states: “We are deeply disappointed to see that Abiove, and your company, has now voluntarily withdrawn from the moratorium. Stepping back risks weakening existing deterrents to deforestation, undermines future efforts to develop collaborative protection agreements, and threatens efforts to secure the sustainability of your investments in Brazilian soy production in the face of accelerated climate change.”Soy is one of the most widely grown crops in Brazil and posed a huge deforestation threat to theAmazon rainforestuntil stakeholders voluntarily agreed in 2006 to impose a moratorium and no longer source it from the region.The retailers behind the letter, which also include Lidl, Aldi, Morrisons, Marks & Spencer and the Co-op, say they will continue to apply the key principle of the soy moratorium – not to source the grain for Amazon land cleared after 2008 – and urge the traders and producers to clarify whether they still adhere to previous commitments on the climate and environment and are able to make assurances about the reporting, monitoring and verification of their supply chains.Under this voluntary agreement, any detection of soya beans planted on areas deforested after 2008 would result in the farm being blocked from supply chains, regardless of whether the land clearance was legal in Brazil. In the two decades since, this has prevented an estimated 17,000 sq km (6,564 sq miles) of deforestation.In the past two years, the moratorium has come under fierce attack from Brazil’s powerful agribusiness lobby, particularly in the soy-producing heartland of Mato Grosso where state legislatorsrevoked tax incentivesfor companies engaged in the agreement. Brazil has threatened to penalise grain traders for involvement in the moratorium on the grounds that it involves the sharing among competitors of commercially sensitive information, which poses monopoly risks.This appears to be a fig leaf as Mato Grosso’s subsidies were modest, and the administrative council said traders could have continued to apply the 2008 cutoff date independently. However, these firms backed out of a globally significant moratorium, in line with a broader US-led trend of major corporations welching on commitments to environmental and social governance.Europe consumes 10% of the world’s soya bean production. In the letter, the retailers say they need a substitute for the moratorium to avoid supply chain uncertainty and a backlash from consumers. Will Schreiber, a director at the Retail Soy Group, said: “There needs to be some sort of agreement. We need credible action to avoid fragmentation. If there are just guidelines, some soy producers will make money from destruction.”Cargill,Bunge,ADMandCofcohave their own sustainable supply chain policies against deforestation, but without the moratorium there is a risk they will pursue different paths using separate criteria. Aninvestigation by Reporter Brazilfound that Cargill had already weakened its no-deforestation commitment by moving the cutoff date in some documentation to 2020.Conservation groups includingWWFand Greenpeace have said land speculators are already moving into the Amazon in the expectation that the 2008 cutoff date will be moved, which will reward them for destruction.Explore more on these topicsAmazon rainforestDeforestationFoodFarmingBrazilAmericasSupermarketsnewsShareReuse this content"

Staff and families typically learn of closures early in the morning.The snow caused more 430 collisions in Toronto and another 200 in the surrounding areas, including one fatality.Police warned drivers that roadside banks of snow, created by snowplows could lead to cars entering “launch-type angle” and flying off the highway. In Toronto’s downtown core, drivers were still facing challenging conditions on residential streets.The city’s transit system, used by more than 1 million people each day, was hit with multiple delays and closures. On one major route, a streetcar derailed and subways were unable to traverse sections of track that were above ground and received significant snowfall.Toronto’s city manager said staff would prioritize main roadways and it would be days before residential streets and sidewalks were cleared. In addition to snowplows, the city had workers using shovels.“This is going to be a plowing day, and then we’re going to have to shift into removal time once we get through today and into tomorrow,” said Paul Johnson. Residents can use the city’s GPS tracking tool,PlowTO, to follow snowplows and see which streets have been cleared.South of the border, snow cancelled flights in the US and ice storms brought power outages and hazardous roads. At least 13 weather-related deaths have been reported.Still, the snowfall has been eagerly embraced by Toronto residents, some of whom took to skiing along quiet streets on a sunny morning. Children, sleds and shovels in hand, surveyed the extent of the storm enjoying both – a record snowfall and a long weekend.CP24 meteorologist Bill Coulter said Toronto’s location along the shores of Lake Ontario was a key ingredient for the snow, which far exceeded initial predictions.The “monster” was the result from Arctic air colliding with moist air from the tropics, with the northern fringes holding the most snow. “What a winter wallop for Toronto,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTorontoSnowCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Ten people died at the scene and one died later at a hospital.A woman and a child were among 12 people injured in what Prieto called a “regrettable and cowardly” attack. He said the attack was part of a crimewave in the city and appealed to the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, for help to control the violence.The state prosecutor’s office said it was investigating and coordinating with federal authorities to reinforce security in the area.View image in fullscreenA Mexican Red Cross team at the scene of the attack.Photograph: EPAGuanajuato has been for many years one of themost violent regionsin the country, owing to turf wars between rival cartels. On Saturday, five people were killed in two separate attacks near Salamanca, Prieto said.Salamanca is also home to one of seven refineries operated in Mexico by the state oil company Pemex, and fuel theft is responsible for one of Mexico’s largest criminal economies.Prieto said: “This incident adds to a wave of violence that we are sadly experiencing in the state, and particularly in Salamanca. Unfortunately, criminal groups are trying to subjugate the authorities, which they will not achieve.”Guanajuato borders Jalisco, the capital of which, Guadalajara, is one of the host cities for this year’s men’s football World Cup.The Guanajuato governor, Libia Dennise, called the attack “unacceptable” in a statement on social media and said security in the state had been reinforced, without providing details.Sheinbaum, when asked at her regular press conference on Monday morning for information about the attack, deferred to the state attorney general’s office, which said it was coordinating efforts with municipal, state and federal authorities to strengthen security in the area, protect people and find the perpetrators.Prieto vowed in his Facebook remarks: “Those responsible will be found.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They had all tried to request refuge at the US-Mexico border but were quickly removed from American soil after Trump returned to the White House and effectively closed the US asylum system. In the face of a variety of political difficulties with deporting them to their native countries, the Trump administration sent them toCosta Rica, as he did others to Panama.Among the deportees toCosta Ricawas Alexander, a 37-year-old Russian man, his wife and their young son, who remain there and are trying to come to terms with how they were handled by the Trump administration. They are also fighting for justice from the Central American authorities for putting them in detention after they arrived from the US. His real name is being withheld by the Guardian and his wife and son’s names are not being disclosed, to keep the family safe from the Russian government.“They threw us out like baggage,” Alexander said of the US, in an interview with the Guardian in Costa Rica.Already bewildered at being flown to, from their point of view, a mystery country, Alexander and his family were then horrified that they and the other deportees from the US were locked up for two months in Costa Rica, which Human Rights Watch at the timecalled“reprehensible”.The Costa Rican government had claimed it would be a safe haven for those deported and would act as a bridge, helping people return to their home countries – even though many of the people had fled danger in the first place. Alexander knew that not only had he escaped political risk in Putin’s Russia but that if he went back he faced a high risk of beingsent straightto the frontline inUkraine.The family had left Russia in a hurry after he flagged alleged election irregularities to people who had been working with thelateopposition leader,Alexei Navalny, he said, hoping to find sanctuary in the US.They flew to Turkey then Mexico in the spring of 2024, while Joe Biden was still in the White House, and managed to secure an asylum appointment with the US authorities that was scheduled for 2 February, 2025 in California. But after Trump returned to the White House last January the appointment was abruptly canceled. The family crossed the border into the US to request help anyway but they were arrested, detained and ultimately deported.They were initially detained in the US, a miserable experience, then flown out involuntarily to Costa Rica. They didn’t even know where that was on a map, Alexander said.This was just one of many high-profile scandals from the earliest days of the second Trump administration as it unleashed its anti-immigration and mass deportation agenda.It was part of a Trump mission to get more people out of the US, deporting some migrants and asylum-seekers to so-called “third countries” willing to receive them if the US has trouble deporting them back directly to where they came from.In Central America alone, five countries – Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama – agreed to US requests to receive deportees from other nations.Alexander said he and his family had been living in St Petersburg, where he worked as a fitness coach. In 2018 he became interested in how elections function and became a poll worker.He collected ballots, mostly on behalf of elderly people who were unable to travel to voting sites. But, he said, during Russia’s 2020 presidential election he noticed that many ballots had already been filled out in advance and placed in some of the containers he was supposed to fill with the ballots of elderly and disabled individuals.By the time the 2024 elections came around, Alexander said he could no longer stay silent. He filmed the irregularities he said he had witnessed and attempted to leak the video to a source associated with Navalny, who hadrecently diedin Russian government custody. But his action was discovered by the authorities, he said, and two Russian soldiers took him to a room in the facility where he worked as a poll worker and forcefully confiscated his phone.The Guardian has verified that Alexander was a poll worker but is not able to independently verify his interactions with the Russian authorities.The family decided they must leave. After eventually reaching the border between Mexico and California,they rented a room and downloaded a Biden-era phone app, known as CBPOne, that migrants could use at the time to try for an appointment in the US to ask for asylum. It was a highly imperfect system and some asylum seekers waited many months trying every day to get one of the rationed appointments. But it was a legal system, at least. And eventually, Alexander got lucky, or so he thought at the time.“We had an appointment for 2 February 2025 in Calexico, California, but on 20 January, a couple hours after Trump’s inauguration, it [the CBPOne system]was cancelled. So we drove to the border anyway, gave ourselves up to the American officers and showed our passports. But they ignored our requests for asylum,” he said.Not only that, Alexander and his wife were handcuffed in front of their little boy and transferred to the Otay Mesa detention facility in California. Alexander was separated from his wife and boy and they were all held for one month. Then the Trump administration put them on a military plane to Arizona and then another plane. Terrified, they had no idea where they were being taken. It turned out to be Costa Rica.There, the frightened family were escorted by Costa Rican national police and transported to a secure migrant care center, also known as Catem, located in Puntarenas, six hours away from San José, the country’s capital.“In the first weeks I lost 15 kilos and my family was sick, so I started asking questions like ‘why didn’t we have freedom? Where were our passports?’ One day my son got an inflammation in his teeth and, through organizations, he was sent to a dentist that took a tooth out – without anesthesia,” Alexander said. The boy remains traumatized from the experience, he added.The Guardian spoke last month to Monserrat Ruiz Guevara, a member of the Costa Rican legislative assembly, who said that at the time there had been concern in the governing body about how long the 200 migrants were going to stay at Catem.“We wanted to see if their rights were being met but we realized that Catem didn’t have the right infrastructure for these migrants, including children and pregnant women. They were sleeping in poor conditions and they weren’t used to eating the food they were given,” said Ruiz Guevara, who visited the detention center in March last year with other Costa Rican lawmakers.“Costa Rica has always been an advocate for human rights. It has always been a just country and now it’s becoming a laboratory. Costa Rica can’t be a warehouse for people,” he added.In June last year, Costa Rica’s constitutional branch of the country’s supreme courtruled thatthe Costa Rican governmenthad violatedthe rights of Alexander’s family and the other migrants, breaching their right to personal liberty, and declared that the deportees should be released. The ruling also said the government should determine what forms of assistance the asylum seekers needed, including education, housing and health care – and that they should be entitled to compensation.The Costa Rican government did release the people but did not provide any compensation and still has not, advocates say. Lawyers with the Global Strategic Litigation Council, a legal advocacy and immigrant rights group, sued the Costa Rican government along with other organizations on behalf of the migrants, including Alexander and his family, over their detention..Alexander’s family, including his son, now eight, are now undergoing psychological examinations to assess the impact on them of being at Catem, according to Natasha Perez, a lawyer with Global Council.Ironically, the family is understood to be among only about seven people deported from the US on that flight to still be in Costa Rica, according to Perez. The whereabouts of the others is unclear, but they almost certainly don’t know that they are entitled to demand compensation because of their treatment.The Costa Rican government’s migration agency has pushed back on the court’s ruling and on complaints from the asylum seekers.“I strongly opposed the constitutional court’s ruling. There were days that we restricted their [the deported migrants’] movements, but we immediately brought the situation under control. They were treated with dignity, they received medical attention and were fed. It seems to us that the constitutional court focused on its political interests in order to undermine the process the government followed with these migrants,” said Omer Badilla, the director of the national migration agency, in an interview with the Guardian.In the US, Democratic lawmakerssent a letterto the homeland security, state and defense departments last September demanding “details about the Trump administration’s third-country deportation practices, which may violate US and international law”.SenatorElizabeth Warrenhad signed a letter last September from lawmakers demanding “details about the Trump administration’s third-country deportation practices, which may violate US and international law”.The White House never responded to the letter, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.Warren sent a further statement to the Guardian this month saying: “Deporting people to countries they have no connection to is not legal immigration enforcement – it’s a violation of immigration law and due process. What is the Trump administration offering countries in exchange for accepting people not from those countries? How will it make sure people don’t face persecution or torture in these countries?”Lawyers and independent human rights organizations said Central American leaders have agreed to collaborate with the Trump administration’s hardline immigration agendadue to threatsof tariffs, visa sanctions and other measures.Just before the deportations from the US last February, Costa Rican president Rodrigo Chavessaidat a news conference: “We’re helping our powerful economic brother in the north, because if [the US] imposes a tax on our export zones, we’re screwed. I don’t think they’ll do it, thank God ... love is repaid with love … 200 will come, we treat them well and they will leave.”Chaves’s presidential term will come to an end after elections scheduled for 1 February. Despite several requests, Costa Rica’s migration agency did not respond to inquiries about whether the country will receive more deportees from the US in the future.Meanwhile, Alexander and his wife and son are trying to make the best of things there.Amid increasing reportsof Costa Rican federal officers questioning foreign nationals in public places about their immigration status, the family was recently granted “humanitarian” permits for a year with the possibility of an extension, allowing them to live and work legally in the country.Post-detention, the family found refuge near Monteverde, a rainforest region in central Costa Rica, at a Quaker community that dates back to the 1950s.Alexander is back working as a fitness coach, the same job he had in Russia before becoming a poll worker. His wife has also found full time work, too, and they son is enrolled in school.“We are going to stay in Monteverde because we got jobs. My wife works 11 hours a day four times a week and I work at the gym. I still don’t fully speak the language, but this is the best for us now,” he said, speaking at the gym where he works.However, the hurt about their treatment by the US has not gone away.“Don’t forget, they deported us illegally,” he said.“They threw us out like baggage to a country with a language we don’t speak. And no one was held accountable for this.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationCosta RicaRussiaUkraineAmericasEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As vice-chair of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the ruling body of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), he is the second-most powerful person in China’s military, after Xi, the commander-in-chief.But on Saturday, China’s defence ministryannouncedthat Zhang and Liu Zhenli, another CMC member, were under investigation for “suspected serious violations of discipline and law”, party-speak for corruption.Zhang and Liu have not been formally removed from the party or the commission, but being placed under investigation is all but certain to lead to those outcomes.“This is easily the most significant PLA purge in the post-Mao era,” said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society thinktank. “It’s hard to overstate how rare this is … it would be like arresting the chair of the US joint chiefs of staff for corruption.”View image in fullscreenZhang Youxia at a naval symposium in Qingdao in April 2024.Photograph: Florence Lo/ReutersA Sunday editorial in the PLA’s official newspaper laid out the charges against Zhang and Liu. The men allegedly “seriously betrayed the trust and expectations” of the party and the CMC and “fostered political and corruption problems that undermined the party’s absolute leadership over the military”.Precise details of the allegations have not been revealed, but the editorial suggests that political problems were a factor as well as corruption.Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore, said Zhang’s recent appearance alongside Xi and his nomination to the CMC at the 20th party congress in 2022, when he was past the normal retirement age, indicated that he was a trusted figure until relatively recently. “Corruption does not just happen overnight,” Wu said.Zhang is the most senior in astring of top PLA officialswho have been defenestrated in recent years, includingLi Shangfu, the former defence minister, who was kicked off the CMC in 2023 and expelled from the party in 2024. The Wall Street Journal reported that Zhang’s downfall was linked to the fact that he had promoted Li.Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University and a former senior CIA analyst, said a power struggle was a more likely explanation than corruption. The purge “isn’t about corruption, it isn’t about leaking secrets, it is about a general that became too powerful”, he said.graphic depicting the leadership of the CMCWhatever the reason for Zhang’s fall from grace, one thing is certain: Xi wants him gone.“The fact that Xi is purging his right-hand man in the military is a shocking development, which suggests Zhang was guilty of a significant betrayal of Xi’s trust,” Thomas said.Zhang was once considered to be one of Xi’s closest military allies. He is a fellow Communist party “princeling”, the son of revolutionaries who served under Mao Zedong. He is one of the few generals to have seen active combat as a frontline officer during China’s conflict with Vietnam in 1978.These credentials, and the fact Xi handpicked him to serve on the CMC, might have suggested a degree of political protection.But Xi seems determined to prove otherwise. “For Xi, there’s nothing more important than strengthening party discipline and ensuring it does not go the same way as the Soviet Communist party, which in his view was rendered ineffective by corruption,” said Thomas. “No one is safe in Beijing because Xi puts the party above any individual.”The party’s control of the armed forces is central to its, and therefore Xi’s, grip on power. That means that Xi is willing to assert his authority at all costs, even if the result is a somewhat absurd CMC lineup effectively down to two people: Xi himself and the CMC’s anti-corruption chief, Zhang Shengmin.View image in fullscreenZhang Shengmin at the opening session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing in March 2025.Photograph: Florence Lo/ReutersFor western analysts, the biggest question is what it means for China’s military buildup, and particularly its readiness to launch an assault on Taiwan. US intelligence believes Xi has ordered the military to be ready to win a fight for it by 2027, making this a crucial year for modernisation. Unification with the self-governing island which Beijing claims as its territory is one of Xi’s main priorities and he has not ruled out the use of force to achieve it.Some argue that the purges make an attack on Taiwan less likely, at least in the short term, because the army does not have the high level decision-making capacity to launch a sophisticated operation. “It gives the US military more time to prepare for a Taiwan conflict,” said Wilder.Others caution that the ousted men could be replaced by a younger, more aggressive lineup of officers who are unlikely to question their leader.Lyle Goldstein, the director of the Asia programme at Defense Priorities, a US foreign policy thinktank, noted that China had unveiled a suite of powerful new weapons at its military parade in September, a sabre-rattling display of bravado.“I think it would be a major mistake to assume that the Chinese military lacks capable senior officers or that it is less likely to move against Taiwan due to this recent shake-up of the CMC,” he said.One aspect widely agreed on is that the investigations will not end with Zhang and Liu. Scholars of the Chinese Communist party describe corruption as a feature of the system, not a bug. Zhang and Liu are likely to be interrogated about whatever offences they are specifically accused of, which will throw up more names. “More arrests are likely,” Wu said.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

Rescuers saved hundreds more, while a fleet of coastguard and naval ships searched for those still missing.Coastguard officials said the cargo and passenger ferry apparently encountered technical problems and sank after midnight. The steel-hulled vessel abruptly tilted to one side and took on water, hurling people into the sea in the darkness, according to a rescued passenger who lost his six-month-old baby.“My wife lost hold of our baby and all of us got separated at sea,” a distraught Mohamad Khan told a volunteer rescuer, Gamar Alih, who posted a video of Khan’s remarks on Facebook.View image in fullscreenScreengrab from video footage shows rescuers assisting survivors at the port in Isabela, Basilan province.Photograph: Governor Mujiv Hataman/AFP/Getty ImagesHe said he and his wife, who had been holding their child, were rescued, but the baby drowned. His wife wept by his side as Khan recounted their ordeal.The M/V Trisha Kerstin 3 was sailing in good weather from the port city of Zamboanga to southern Jolo island in Sulu province with 332 passengers and 27 crew members. It sank about a nautical mile (nearly 2km) from the island village of Baluk-baluk in Basilan province, the coastguard commander Romel Dua told the Associated Press.‘I’m afraid for our children’: living with the climate crisis in the Philippines – in picturesRead more“There were two coastguard safety officers onboard and they were the first to call and alert us to deploy rescue vessels,” Dua said, adding that the two safety marshals survived.Rescuers saved at least 316 passengers and crew members, and retrieved 18 bodies, officials said. Coastguard and navy ships, along with a surveillance plane, an air force Black Hawk helicopter and fleets of fishing boats carried out search and rescue operations for about two dozen people believed missing off Basilan, Dua said.The cause of the ferry sinking was not immediately clear and there would be an investigation, Dua said. The coastguard had cleared the ferry before it left the Zamboanga port, and there was no sign of overloading, he said.Local media reported that up to 15 passengers on the ship’s manifest decided not to board at the last minute and refunded their fare. If confirmed, that would reduce the number of missing, Dua said.Alih, a village councillor from Zamboanga city, told AP that he volunteered to help in the search and rescue because some of his relatives were among the ferry passengers. They all survived.The Basilan governor, Mujiv Hataman, said several passengers and two bodies were brought to Isabela, the provincial capital, where he and ambulance vans waited.Sea accidents are common in the Philippine archipelago because of frequent storms, badly maintained vessels, overcrowding and spotty enforcement of safety regulations, especially in remote provinces.In December 1987, the ferry Doña Paz sank after colliding with a fuel tanker in the central Philippines, killing more than 4,300 people in the world’s deadliest peacetime maritime disaster.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesAsia PacificWater transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Second only to Xi in the military command structure, Zhang has long been seen as the Chinese president’s closest military ally.The defenceministry announced on Saturday that Zhang and Liu Zhenli, chief of staff of the CMC’s joint staff department, were under investigation.An editorial published in the army newspaper Liberation Army Daily on Sunday said that Zhang and Liu “seriously betrayed the trust and expectations” of the Communist party and the CMC, and “fostered political and corruption problems that undermined the party’s absolute leadership over the military and threatened the party’s ruling foundation”.The Wall Street Journalreported that Zhang was accused of leaking informationabout the country’s nuclear weapons programme to the US and accepting bribes for official acts, including the promotion of an officer to defence minister, citing people familiar with a high-level briefing on the allegations.View image in fullscreenCentral Military Commission member Liu Zhenli in BeijingPhotograph: Florence Lo/ReutersThe Guardian was unable to independently verify the reports.Zhang is also a member of the elite politburo of the ruling Communist party and is one of just a few leading officers with combat experience. Aged 75, Zhang was retained in the military leadership by Xi past the normal age of retirement, indicating a high level of trust in the general that he has now purged.The military was one of the main targets of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi in 2012. That drive reached the upper echelons of the PLA in 2023 when the elite Rocket Force was targeted.Table showing purge of CMC figures since 2022The scalping of a figure as senior as Zhang in Xi’s anti-graft campaign raises questions about the stability of China’s military leadership at a moment when it is under scrutiny from western observers about its readiness and willingness to launch an assault onTaiwan, which could bring it into conflict with the US in the Indo-Pacific.Lyle Goldstein, director of the Asia programme at Defense Priorities, a foreign policy thinktank, said the purge “raises larger issues about political stability in a rising, nuclear superpower”.“It could be seen by many as reflecting poor judgment about some of [Xi’s] prior appointments,” Goldstein said.Of the seven men appointed to the CMC at the20th party congressin 2022, only two remain untouched by anti-corruption investigations: Xi himself, and Zhang Shengmin, the CMC’s anti-graft officer.The co-vice chair of the CMC, He Weidong, was expelled from the party and PLA in October last year for corruption.View image in fullscreenZhang Youxia, front, swearing an oath with members of the Central Military Commission at the National People’s Congress in Beijing in 2023.Photograph: ReutersForeign diplomats and security analysts are watching developments closely, given Zhang’s closeness to Xi and the importance of the commission’s work in terms of command as well as the PLA’s ongoing military modernisation and posture.WhileChinahas not fought a war in decades, it is taking an increasingly muscular line in the disputed East China Sea and South China Sea, as well as over the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which is claimed by China. Beijing staged thelargest military exercisesto date around Taiwan late last year.Malfunctions, overreactions and a steep learning curve: wargaming a Chinese attack on TaiwanRead moreThe Singapore-based China security scholar James Char said the military’s daily operations could carry on as normal despite the purges.“China’s military modernisers will continue to push for the two goals Xi has set for the PLA – namely, 2035 to basically complete its modernisation and 2049 to become a world-class armed forces,” said Char, a scholar at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies.Eight top generals were expelled from the Communist party on graft charges in October 2025, including He Weidong. Two former defence ministers were also purged from the ruling party in recent years for corruption. The crackdown is slowing procurement of advanced weaponry and hitting the revenues of some of China’s biggest defence firms.Born in Beijing, Zhang joined the army in 1968, rising through the ranks and joining the CMC in late 2012 as the PLA’s modernisation drive gathered pace.He fought in Vietnam in a brief but bloody border war in 1979 that China launched in punishment for Vietnam invading Cambodia the previous year and ousting the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge.Zhang was sent to the frontlines to fight the Vietnamese and was quickly promoted, according to state media. He also fought in another border clash with Vietnam in 1984 as the conflict rumbled on.“During the battle, whether attacking or defending, Zhang Youxia performed excellently,” the official China Youth Daily wrote in a 2017 piece entitled These Chinese generals have killed the enemy on the battlefield.Some China scholars have noted that Zhang emerged from the conflict an avowed moderniser in terms of military tactics, weapons and the need for a better trained force.Explore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingTaiwanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

So what’s in it?Read more“If someone wants to come to Australia they should apply for the right visa and come for the right reason,” Burke told Guardian Australia in a statement.In response to the decision, Yahood took to social media overnight to accuse Labor of “tyranny”, insisting his spirits remained high despite the block.“This is not a story about me whatsoever,” he said. “This is a story about government overreaching.“This is a story about tyranny, censorship and control. We cannot allow it.”Yahood has made multiple posts on X, formerly Twitter, calling Islam a “murderous ideology”, a “disgusting ideology”, and claiming Islam “cannot be trusted to simply ‘co-exist’”. On 6 November, he wrote on X: “It’s time to ban Islam. It’s time to stop being tolerant of those that are not tolerant of us.”Yahood, who grew up in the United Kingdom and recently moved to Israel, was due to run a series of “self defence workshops” and launch his “peace through strength” campaign.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe AJA has criticised the cancellation of Yahood’s visa, and said he was scheduled to speak to the AJA in major synagogues and to other organisations across Australia.“Sammy is the latest Jew to have his visa cancelled by this government. As in other cases, they wait until the last minute,” the organisation wrote on X.“Parliament just voted to increase the powers of Toby [sic] Burke to cancel visas as an apparent response to support the Jewish community following the Bondi massacre.”The AJA described one event, due to be held in Melbourne, as “a unique introductory session to self defence. Working through physical exercises to learn essential techniques and principles for personal safety. Let’s take accountability for our security together.”Another event, also scheduled in Melbourne on 28 January, said the event was “empowering Jews to stand unapologetically strong”.Yahood confirmed his visa had been cancelled in an Instagram post, and said he was still flying to United Arab Emirates and “working to sort”. He said his fiancee, who was attending the events with him, will continue to travel to Australia.Burke recently barred the entry of far-right Israeli politicianSimcha Rothman, who was scheduled to appear at events also organised by the AJA. Rothman has described Palestinian children in Gaza as “enemies” and called for Israel’s total control of the West Bank.The home affairs minister has also barred the entry of other personalities and politicians with a history of controversial or offensive statements, including therapper Kanye West, and the former Israeli ministerAyelet Shaked.The cancellation, which was made under existing laws, comes just one week after the federalgovernment passed new legislationthat increases the grounds the home affairs minister can use to reject or cancel a visa. The minister could prevent an individual coming to Australia if they believe a person has engaged inhate, vilification or extremist conductunder the character test.Yahood was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsTony BurkeAustralian security and counter-terrorismFreedom of speechAustralian lawnewsShareReuse this content"

The fire danger rating on Tuesday was extreme.Australia news live: out-of-control Victorian bushfire threatens towns as intense heatwave moves eastRead moreVictoria faced both heat and fire emergencies, Country Fire Authority chief officer, Jason Heffernan, said. Tuesday was “not a day for complacency”, he said, urging people to restrict any unnecessary travel.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWith six major fires burning across the state, the high to extreme fire conditions would increase the risk of fire spread. Authorities were particularly concerned about the Carlisle River fire in the Otways, which may pose a serious threat to homes, properties and lives. A statewide total fire ban was in place.Fire danger was extreme across much ofSouth Australia, including the eastern Eyre peninsula, mid north, Mount Lofty ranges, Yorke Peninsula, Kangaroo Island, Riverland, Murraylands and across the south-east. Total fire bans were in place for those districts.Heffernan told the ABC it would be a challenging day for not only firefighters, but for Victorians generally.Four zones around the Carlisle River fire have been asked toevacuate immediately. Heffernan said the biggest bushfire danger would come in the afternoon on Tuesday.“We do expect that fire will run today under the conditions, those hot northerly winds, but it’s the change that’s going to come through about 5pm with some really punchy winds, that is likely to do most of the damage and drive that fire further into the Otways,” he said.“Today is a day not to be complacent. Whilst we are focus on the Walwa and the Carlisle River fire, to be frank, the state is very, very dry. Any fire that takes hold will be a challenge for community.”He said communities should take care to look after elderly people, young and infirm amid the heatwave.January and all-time records were expected to tumble in parts of eastern South Australia and across Victoria on Tuesday, with temperatures approaching 50C across inland areas, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.Ouyen and Mildura in north-west Victoria were forecast to reach 49C. Mildura recorded 41.7C at 10:40am.Ouyen got close to the record just two weeks ago, peaking at 47.5C on Thursday 8 January. Tuesday is the fifth day in a row that temperatures there will exceed 40C – and another four days over 40C are expected to follow, totalling a possible nine full days of extreme 40C+ temperatures.View image in fullscreenThe town of Ouyen early on Tuesday morning.Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianFor many in Victoria the heatwave would be difficult to fathom, senior meteorologist Jonathan How said. Anything above 48C was extremely rare for the state.Maximum temperatures of 45C were forecast for Melbourne, up to 20 degrees above average, and the hottest day for the city since Black Saturday saw temperatures reach 46.4C. Play would continue at the Australian Open, following extreme heat protocols.On Monday, the heatwave sawAdelaidereach 44.7C just after 5pm, the city’s hottest day since 2019, and as high as 46.5C in the northern suburb of Elizabeth. Ceduna on the Eyre Peninsula hit a scorching 49.5C, the town’s highest temperature recorded in 84 years of data.There was little relief overnight for Adelaide, which saw a minimum temperature of 34.1C – the city’s hottest night on record. Residents woke to 35C at 6am.By 10am, the temperature had risen to 41C, while Roseworthy, north of the city, was 43.8C.Victoria’s chief health officer, Dr Caroline McElnay, said prolonged heat, together with high overnight temperatures, posed an increasedrisk of heat-related illness.“Heat‑related illness can come on quickly, so it’s important to know the warning signs,” McElnay said.Heat is Australia’s ‘silent killer’. Here are the symptoms to watch out forRead more“The telltale symptoms include heavy sweating, dizziness, nausea, headache, pale or clammy skin, or feeling unusually weak or confused. If someone shows signs of heatstroke, such as very high body temperature, red hot skin, confusion or loss of consciousness, call Triple Zero (000) immediately.”The City of Melbourne was ready to provide “cool kits” containing cooling towels, water, handheld fans and rehydration solution to vulnerable people.A cool change was forecast to bring some relief for coastal areas of South Australia and Victoria, reaching Adelaide just after lunch on Tuesday and Melbourne by about 8-9pm in the evening.But for inland areas across Victoria, SA andNew South Wales, the severe-to-extreme heat, with temperatures in the mid-to-high 40s, was expected to persist into next weekend.Dubbo, NSW also recorded a January record, reaching 46.1C at the airport on Monday. More records could be broken on Wednesday as the heat moved into inland and western NSW and north-east Victoria.The heat tomorrow “will very much take centre stage across inland parts of New South Wales”, How said.Australia’s energy market operator said the power grid was prepared with sufficient generation to meet increased demand due to the heat. Network company Powercor urged households to prepare by charging phones and other devices, in case of localised outages due to the bushfires or extreme weather.It was Australia’s second major heatwave for January, and came off the back of one early in January, which analysts said was made five times more likelydue to global heating.The climate crisis hasincreased the frequency and severityof extreme weather events, including heatwaves and bushfires.Hotter-than-average days and nights were expected to continue until April for much of the country, according to the latest long-range forecast.

She knew that,” she said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailTodd James, Piper’s father, said on Monday he didn’t think Piper would have supported killing the animals “because of a mistake that she made to put herself in that vulnerable position”.But he said “for the safety of the island … maybe that pack needed to be euthanised, but not because of Piper, but because of the way they’ve been behaving”.The Queensland coroner is still to determine the cause of death, buta court spokesperson saida preliminary assessment of the autopsy “found physical evidence consistent with drowning and injuries consistent with dingo bites”.Canadian backpacker’s death poses question for Queensland’s K’gari: can dingoes and tourists coexist?Read moreThere were “pre-mortem dingo bite marks” that were not likely to have caused her immediate death, as well as “extensive” postmortem bite marks.James had gone out early and alone for a swim on 19 January. Her body was found by passersby surrounded by a dingo pack near the Maheno shipwreck.The tragedy is the latest in a string of incidents involving dingoes and tourists on the world heritage-listed sand island and the first death since nine-year-old Clinton Gage was killed by two dingoes in 2001. That tragedy saw 32 dingoes culled.Dr Kylie Cairns, an expert on dingo genetics at the University of New South Wales, said she was “disheartened, disappointed and frustrated” by the government’s decision to kill the pack after the latest death.“I feel like the scientific evidence on this population [of dingoes] is not being used in the decision-making,” she said.mapK’gari’s isolated dingo population – likely present for thousands of years – has low genetic diversity and high levels of inbreeding, said Cairns.With only between 70 and 200 dingoes living on the island, she said “removing 10 is quite significant. That can have a disproportionately large impact”.“At the moment [the dingoes] seem to be coping with this high level of inbreeding, but when you have a genetically constrained population it does not take much to push them into an extinction vortex.”She said a lack of genetic diversity meant K’gari’s dingoes were already susceptible to disease. Further reductions could risk pups being born with disfigurement and mothers suffering stillbirths.“We’re at the point where we could start to see some of these things,” she said.Killing a pack could see an increase in movement of other dingo family groups that would claim the vacant territory.“We are punishing animals for doing what wild animals do in a way that likely won’t help people in the future,” she said.Advisers havepreviously expressed deep concern that K’gari– the world’s largest sand island, formerly known as Fraser Island – was being damaged by overtourism. The Crisafulli government has ruled out capping visitor numbers.Dr Bradley Smith, an expert on interactions and conflict between dingoes and humans at CentralQueenslandUniversity, said killing the dingo pack was a “kneejerk reaction” and was “dumb management”.“It gets cheap political points and makes people feel better, but culling never fixes an underlying problem,” he said.“This is a people problem. You have to fix how people behave. You can’t stop a dingo being a dingo, but you can change how humans behave.”The Queensland government has said rangers had seen the pack of dingoes involved in further “aggressive behaviour” since the tragedy last week, and the decision to kill them was “informed and in the public interest”.Smith said male dingoes on the island were now looking to breed and their testosterone levels were elevated, making them behave more aggressively.“[Rangers] would not see this behaviour [from those dingoes] in a few months time. It is cyclical,” he said.The Queensland environment minister, Andrew Powell, who is also the tourism minister, has said he backed the advice from park rangers that killing the pack was “appropriate for public safety”.Explore more on these topicsK'gari (Fraser Island)QueenslandWildlifeMammalsQueensland politicsAnimal behaviournewsShareReuse this content"

The four men on board – three Colombians and a Venezuelan – were arrested.“The vessel, which had come from Latin America and was crewed by four foreign nationals, was carrying 300 bales of cocaine,” the Portuguese police said in a statement. “The interception of the semi-submersible occurred at sea, approximately 230 nautical miles from the Azores, under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions due to the current adverse weather conditions.”A police spokesperson told Agence France-Presse that the operation had resulted in “the biggest seizure of cocaine ever in Portugal”. According to Portuguese media reports, the impounded drugs could be worth up to €600m (£520m).In March last year, Portuguese police located and intercepted another narco-sub off the Azores that wasferrying almost 6.5 tonnes of cocaineto Europe.1:34Inside 'narco-submarine' used by South American drug lords to carry cocaine across ocean – videoAlthough semi-submersible vehicleshave been used regularly in Colombiaand other parts of South and Central America since the 1980s, they were not detected in European waters until 2006, whenan abandoned subwas found in an estuary in the north-west Spanish region of Galicia.Thefirst full-laden narco-sub found in European waters was recovered from an inlet in Galiciain 2019, where it had been scuttled along with its cargo of three tonnes of cocaine.Four months ago, Spanish police seized3.6 tonnes of cocainethat had been brought to Galicia by narco-sub.Inan interview with the Guardianlast month, the head of the central narcotics brigade of Spain’s National police said plummeting cocaine prices were leading drug gangs to reuse the narco-subs they would once have ditched at the end of a one-way journey from South America.“The price of the merchandise is really, really low, so the organisations have, logically, had a rethink,” said Alberto Morales. “Rather than sink them, what they do now is unload the merchandise and set up a refuelling platform at sea so that the semi-submersibles can head back to the countries they came from and make as many journeys as possible.”Spanish police on Monday separately announced they had dismantled a massive and highly sophisticated cocaine smuggling operation that used powerful speed boats and offshore bases in the Atlantic to bring more than 57 tonnes of the drug into Europe over the past year.The year-long investigation, led by the National police, has resulted in 105 arrests and the confiscation of 10.4 tonnes of cocaine and the seizure of 30 boats.Officers discovered that gang members based in southern Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and Morocco were using the cover of dark to set off in speedboats and rendezvous with supply and storage ships. The drugs were loaded on to the speedboats, some of which had a speed of 40 knots, and brought back to mainland Spain and the Canaries.“They created real aquatic platforms where drivers would remain at sea for over a month at a time, carrying out several successive operations,” the force said in a statement.“They had their own fuel storage facilities, with evidence showing the use of over 100,000 litres. Smaller vessels were responsible for supplying gasoline, provisions, communication equipment, and even clothing for the couriers who escorted the drugs from the mother ship to our country.”Investigators also discovered the lengths to which the gang was prepared to go to in order to keep its activities secret: the family of one member who died was paid €12m to “guarantee their silence and avoid any suspicion of criminal activities”.Explore more on these topicsPortugalDrugs tradeDrugsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The order was due to expire at 8am on Monday but was extended for two days.UK far-right activists have been travelling to northern France withincreasing frequencyin recent months with a declared intention of stopping small boats from crossing the Channel, something they say French and UK governments have failed to do.In 2025, more than 40,000 people crossed the Channel in small boats, and so far in 2026 another 931 people have made the journey.On visits toFrance, far-right agitators have posted footage of themselves slashing dinghies and confronting migrants.According to François-Xavier Lauch, the prefect of Boulogne-sur-Mer in the Pas-de-Calais prefecture, two unnamed individuals were arrested while broadcasting live videos from the French coast that allegedly contained discriminatory remarks and suggested their potential involvement in Operation Overlord.They were taken into custody near the northern town of Calais on Sunday evening, Lauch said.Police sources told Le Monde that the men, aged 35 and 53, had been recording content likely to incite hatred live on a YouTube channel.Lauch said the French authorities would take strict administrative measures against them, including issuing an order to leave French territory based on the threat to public order, with a view to their return to their country of origin.The Boulogne-sur-Mer prosecutor Cécile Gressier said the men were placed in police custody for inciting hatred and participating in a group with the aim of preparing acts of violence, based on comments made on social media.She said these were the first arrests of British far-right activists in France on these grounds, adding that they were not accused of violence against individuals.The two men were not among the10 far-right activists bannedfrom French territory since mid-January by the interior ministry on charges of “violent actions” against migrants in northern France.Operation Overlord was initially part of Raise the Colours but has now been taken over by Daniel Thomas, an associate of Tommy Robinson. The Raise the Colours account on X said on Saturday it had nothing to do with the operation led by Thomas.Explore more on these topicsUK newsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He recently effectivelyaccused them of skivingby falsely calling in sick, criticising the relative ease with which sicknotes could be obtained from GPs over the phone.The part-time work motion foresees exemptions for people raising children, caring for relatives or pursuing professional development through training. Those who choose to work part-time and are not in those categories, however, should no longer be allowed to take the part-time option, it says.Connemann has already received pushback from within her own party, with Dennis Radtke, the chair of the CDU’s social wing, accusing the business group of getting its priorities wrong.“Such a restriction amounts to putting the cart before the horse,” he told Funke media group. He said he would like to see more people who were in part-time work enter or return to full-time employment, but that for many it was perceived as a trap, with employers often unhelpfully inflexible over the hours needing to be worked, people getting paid less and facing restrictions over career development.Radtke said childcare and care of elderly people had to improve in order to create the conditions for those who wanted to work to do so. But restricting the right to part-time work to caregivers or parents would mean defining the level of care and age of children up to which such care was necessary, when “this can and should be decided by every family individually”, he added.IG Metall, the powerful metalworkers’ union, also voiced concerns. “The problem is not a lack of willingness or performance, but inadequate conditions” for those who cannot work full time, said the union’s boss, Christiane Benner.According to Germany’s Institute for Employment Research (IAB), the part-time employment rate in the country increased to just over 40% in the third quarter of 2025, in part due to a rise in employment in sectors such as health, social services, education and teaching, and a drop in employment in the manufacturing sector, where full-time work is more usual.This compares with about 24% in the UK as of 2025, and just under 18% in France in 2024. Of these people, in Germany 76% of part-time workers are women, similar to the UK and France.Last year the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the German economy suffered in part because women and older people were not adequately integrated into the workplace.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzWork & careersEuropeWork-life balancenewsShareReuse this content"

He was the last of 251 people captured that day still held in the territory.“With this, all hostages have been returned from the Gaza Strip to the state of Israel,” the Israeli military said in a statement.Gvili, 24, a member of an elite police unit, was killed defending Kibbutz Alumim. He was on medical leave after dislocating his shoulder in a motorcycling accident but when news of the attack began filtering out he put on his uniform and went to support the military.In Israel, Gvili’s father stood in front of the coffin and said: “You had the option to stay home but you said to me: ‘Father, I’m not going to leave my friends to fight alone.’“You came out, and you need to see the honour you have here, all the people who brought you. All the police are here with you, the entire army is here with you, the entire nation is here with you. I’m proud of you, my son,” he said, in comments reported by the BBC.Rani Gvili’s sister Shira earlier told the Hostages and Missing Families Forum: “I feel an insane sense of relief. I feel relieved. I am sad. I’m very sad that it ended this way, but it had to end at some point. I am so happy he’s coming back home.”The handover of the body marks the completion of a key initial demand of Donald Trump’s ceasefire plan for Gaza. It should open the way for progress in its second stage, which the US announced was under way earlier this month.Key Trump aides last week laid out an extremely ambitious plan for Gaza, with his son-in-law, Jared Kusher, describing it as a blueprint for “catastrophic success”. It envisages a unified Palestinian-run Gaza, which represents a rebuff to the aims of Israeli extremists, including some in the governing coalition, who have sought thedeportation of Gaza’s populationand the building of Israeli settlements in its place.The plan’s success will depend largely on whether Trump and his “board of peace” have the determination to implement the plan, overcoming Israeli objections and obstruction. That includes whether a mechanism can be created inside Gaza to oversee the disarming of Hamas, with potential contributors to a proposed international security force ruling out any direct confrontation with the militant group.After the return of Gvili’s body was announced, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told lawmakers that the next step for Gaza would be not the reconstruction promised by Kushner but instead “the disarmament of Hamas and the demilitarisation of the Gaza Strip”, Haaretz reported.Israel had said the vital Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt would reopen when Gvili’s body had been returned. It has been closed since Israeli troops seized control of it in May 2024. But it will only be open to pedestrians, so this will not ease shortages of food and shelter aid, medicine and other basic humanitarian goods in Gaza, and Israel will retain full control of everyone who enters and leaves, Israeli media reported.‘Bloodshed was supposed to stop’: no sign of normal life as Gaza’s killing and misery grind onRead moreAlthough the ceasefire reduced the number of attacks inside Gaza, Israeli forces have killed nearly 500 Palestinians since it came into force. The lack of shelter and aid mean hunger is still widespread and at least eight children have died from hypothermia.The return of Gvili’s remains marks the end of a long public campaign to bring back the living and the dead, including some who had been captured before 2023.Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said in a statement: “After many difficult years, for the first time since 2014 there are no Israeli citizens held hostage in Gaza. An entire nation prayed and waited for this moment.”Israel keeps thebodiesof Palestinians to use as leverage, including detainees whodiedwithout being charged or tried andchildrenkilled by Israeli forces. Under the terms of Trump’s deal, Israel agreed to hand over the remains of 15 Palestinians for each body returned from Gaza.Many Israeli campaigners have been shifting focus as the final bodies were returned, demanding an independent inquiry into the 7 October 2023 attack and the war that followed.Protesters and some returned hostages and their relatives have accused Netanyahu of sabotaging ceasefire deals that could have brought their loved ones back sooner and prolonging the war to protect his political career.Of 166 people who came back from Gaza alive, the vast majority were freed in ceasefire deals. Eight were released by Israeli military operations.Of the dead, some were killed before they were taken to Gaza, some were killed by their captors, some by Israeli forces and some died of uncertain causes in captivity.Gvili’s body was found in a cemetery in northern Gaza inside theIsraeli-controlledarea behind the “yellow line”, the military said.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is by no means certain that further US attacks on Iran will reignite the street protests, as many Iranians opposed to the clerical leadership in power since 1979 are also opposed to externally imposed regime change.Trump says US ‘armada’ heading to Middle East as Iran death toll put above 5,000Read moreWith no signs of a diplomatic breakthrough imminent, the Iranian stock market suffered a record daily fall on Monday. Regional powers including the United Arab Emirates declared they will not allow their airspace or territorial waters to be used to mount an attack on Iran but the presence of the carrier strike group in the Mediterranean means permission will not be needed from many third parties for an attack. Over the weekend, theUS militaryannounced that it would carry out an exercise in the region “to demonstrate the ability to deploy, disperse, and sustain combat airpower”.View image in fullscreenSailors prepare a Boeing EA-18G Growler on the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Indian Ocean on 21 January.Photograph: Seaman Daniel Kimmelman/US Navy/APAny such attack will not be designed to weaken Iran’s already shattered nuclear programme, the chief target of the 12-day war in June, but to target Iran’s political leadership and bring the protesters angered by falling living standards back into the streets. Inflation in the last month reached 60%, new official figures showed.Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, claimed the US was trying to destroy Iran’s social cohesion before an attack. He said Donald Trump’s effort to portray “the country as being in a state of emergency is itself a form of warfare, and this is exactly what the enemies are seeking to achieve. The rioters constitute an urban group with terrorist-like characteristics. When they rush toward military and police centres to obtain weapons, it indicates that they are seeking to provoke a civil war. This time, the US tactic is to first break public cohesion and only then carry out a military attack.”Trump has pulled back from the brink on Iran – for now | Mohamad BazziRead moreIran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmail Baghaei, speaking at his weekly press conference said it was a lie to suggest that the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in touch with the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, to discuss a possible diplomatic deal.Witkoff has recently been raising his demands to include the return of UN weapons inspectors, the removal of all Iranian highly enriched uranium and curtailment of Iran’s missile programme.Baghaei added that Iran’s armed forces are “carefully monitoring every movement” and warned that sending forces and making threats “goes against the principles of the international system” and threatened that “if these principles are violated, insecurity will befall everyone”. He then said “we will give a comprehensive and regrettable response to any aggression”.Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, the chief justice, called for Iran not to return to the negotiating table.Trump held off from an attack on Iran a fortnight ago in the midst of the protests fearing he had not been offered decisive options to remove the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, from power or a detailed battle plan for how Israel would be protected from Iranian reprisals. Many Iranians resent Trump’s failure so far to hold good on his promise to come to the help of the protesters. The US administration remains divided whether to push for what amounts to regime change in a country of 90 million people.Estimates of the death toll continue to vary massively but one of the most respected human rights groups, the Human Rights Activists news agency, said the number of deaths of protesters had reached 5,419. The group was still investigating a further 17,000 fatalities.The United Nations special rapporteur on Iran, Mai Sato, who is also a professor at Birkbeck in London, said she could not verify the figures. She claimed families were facing demands for ransoms of $5,000 to $7,000 to retrieve the bodies of loved ones, a claim denied by the Iranian government, Internet access has been throttled since 8 January, and the communications department said business could not tolerate an outage for more than 20 days.In Europe the Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said he would be recommending to the EU foreign affairs council the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps be labelled a proscribed organisation in Europe.Explore more on these topicsIranUS militaryIsraelUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It affirms that standing up for the truth, no matter how powerful the opponent, is worth the struggle. No amount of money can undo what I have suffered, but I hope the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will now do the right thing and comply with this judgment, without the need for further enforcement action.”Saudi Arabia had sought to have the case dismissed on grounds of state immunity but that argument was rejected by the high court in 2022. After losing an appeal, the kingdom took no further part in the proceedings.The ruling marks a rare legal setback for Saudi Arabia. A US lawsuit accusing the crown princeMohammed bin Salmanof conspiring to kill the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was dismissed on the basis that he was entitled to sovereign immunity, despite the judge finding “credible allegations” that he wasinvolved in the murder.Saini described Saudi Arabia’s actions towards al-Masarir, who has lived in England since 2003, as “grossly intrusive” and unjustified.It was established that his mobile devices had been infected with Pegasus spyware, manufactured by the Israeli company NSO Group, after analysis by the Citizen Lab in 2018.He began legal action the following year.The judge said there had been “exceptionally grave invasions of his privacy. It effectively converted these smartphones into ‘bugging’ devices which secretly transmitted huge amounts of his data and information on every aspect of his life to a hostile state.”The court heard that seven years after being targeted, al-Masarir continues to experience severe depression, is unable to work or perform many basic day-to-day activities and rarely leaves his home.Sapna Malik, a partner at Leigh Day law firm, which represented al-Masarir, said the judgment “vindicates our client for seeking to hold the KSA to account. The grossly intrusive conduct, by which huge amounts of our client’s data and information on every aspect of his life were secretly transmitted to it, has had a profound and long lasting impact on him.”Ron Deibert, the founder and a director of the Citizen Lab, said: “For years, victims of targeted espionage and transnational repression have lacked an avenue for justice. Thankfully, the United Kingdom’s courts have provided just such an avenue. We applaud the judgment wholeheartedly.“Ghanem’s experiences mirror those experienced by citizens the world over – being targeted by autocratic governments armed with sophisticated mercenary spyware tools whose aim is to hack, track and ultimately silence their voices.”Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaMiddle East and north AfricaEspionageHackingLondonJournalist safetynewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities allege that after his snowboarding career, Wedding “turned to a life of crime” as a narcotics trafficker and led an organization that moved cocaine from South America to the US andCanada.He is also accused of directing the “drug-related” murders of two members of a family in Ontario in 2023, the 2024 murder of another victim in Canada over a drug debt and the January 2025 murder of an associate, and FBI witness, in Colombia.During his first appearance in court in Santa Ana on Monday, Wedding pleaded not guilty to 17 felony charges laid out in two indictments. He will remain jailed without bond as ordered by the US magistrate judge John D Early.Ryan Wedding’s journey from Olympic snowboarder to alleged cocaine kingpinRead moreThere was a reward of up to $15m for information leading to his arrest. Wedding, who was wanted by theFBIand the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), was taken into custody last week after reportedly surrendering at the US embassy in Mexico, Mexican authorities announced.However, Anthony Colombo, Wedding’s attorney, told reporters after the arraignment that his client had not surrendered and was apprehended,CBC reported.“The indictments are not evidence, they’re just an accusation,” he said, adding that Wedding was in “good spirits” and “mentally tough”, according to the outlet.Wedding allegedly worked with the Sinaloa cartel and oversaw an illegal drug operation that generated more than $1bn a year. His alleged enterprise was said to be the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, according to a separate 2024 indictment from his home country.At a press conference on Friday, Kash Patel, the FBI director, compared Wedding with Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman and Pablo Escobar, describing him as the “largest narco-trafficker in modern times”.“This individual and his organization and the Sinaloa Cartel poured narcotics into the streets of North America, and killed too many of our youth and corrupted too many of our citizens,” Patel said. “That ends today.”US authorities have said that Wedding’s operation trafficked some 60 tons of cocaine a year, but that figure does not appear in the indictment, and security experts have expressed skepticism about the comparisons to El Chapo.“There’s no indication [Wedding] controls territory, nor that he’s at the head of an armed militia, nor that he’s a major player politically,” Stephen Woodman, a security analyst in Guadalajara, Mexico,told the Guardianlast week.The next court date in the case is 11 February, according to a statement provided by the US attorney’s office for the central district of California. His trial is scheduled to begin 24 March.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS crimeWest CoastDrugs tradeCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

But that work has been produced under a cloud of uncertainty and rumors of widespread job cuts.Those long-rumored cuts now appear to be close, with staffers expecting the ax to drop in early February – though nothing is certain. Inside the Post, staffers have tossed around estimates of potential cuts, with most exceeding 100, which would represent more than 10% of the newsroom–but no one really knows how widespread the cuts will be – or in fact if they will happen at all. The sections most likely to be affected by the cuts include sports, metro and foreign, according to staffers who spoke with the Guardian.On Sunday morning, members of the foreign staff, concerned that the section could be decimated by cuts, sent a letter to the Post’s billionaire owner,Jeff Bezos, urging him to change course and conveying the significance of international reporting for the institution – and for the public interest. Approximately 60 people signed the letter.“We urge you to consider how the proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance – not the shared success that remains attainable,” the staffers wrote in the letter, reviewed by the Guardian butfirst reported by the New York Times. The signatories, which included many of the paper’s most prominent international journalists, said they were open to “finding ways to reduce our costs even further” in discussion with management – “while retaining as many jobs as we can”.“We know what happens when newspapers slash their international sections: they lose reach and they lose relevance,” the staffers wrote.On Friday night, in one of the first tangible actions suggesting how dire the paper’s financial situation might be, the managing editor, Kimi Yoshino,sent a memoto the sports department informing them that the Post would not be sending anyone to Italy to cover the upcoming Winter Olympics. “We realize this decision and its timing will be disappointing to many of you,” Yoshino wrote in the memo, which was obtained by the Guardian. (The Post had already spent about $80,000 on accommodations,according to the Times, making the decision even more baffling for some at the paper.)“It’s all very confusing and no one knows anything,” said one Post staffer who was not authorized to comment. “The anxiety is so sad.”Several staffers said the persistent rumors about impending layoffs had been a distraction during an extremely challenging news cycle, with some suggesting that the Post should not be dragging out the process. “[It’s] safe to say most people aren’t thinking of filing right now,” a second Post staffer said.The Post has not confirmed that any cuts are coming, and a spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about them. But it would be just the latest instance of cost-cutting at the publication, which has offered rounds of buyouts to employeesin 2023and 2025, and has also done targeted layoffs of specific teams. In fall 2024, the Postlaid off 54 employeesfrom the division responsible for its proprietary publishing software. In January 2025,the Post laid offabout 4% of staffers – “fewer than 100 people” – as part of a strategy to “[transform] to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are.”The newsroom, however, has largely been protected from layoffs, though many journalists accepted buyouts or left for other jobs – or new endeavors. All told, several hundred employees have left the company over the last few years, a significant level of turnover. (This reporter worked at the Post from 2020 to 2025.)Despite the uncertainty, the newsroom has continued churning out ambitious pieces. The paper’s foreign coverage has included in-depth stories aboutthe impact of USAID cuts on rape survivorsin eastern Congo;about Russian missile strikes in Ukraine; andabout a man who sailed around the worldwhile battling gastrointestinal cancer.Senior media figures have warned that cuts to the newsroom would have consequences.“Its stellar international reporting is part of the heart and soul of a great newspaper,” wrote David E Sanger, Times White House and national security correspondent,in a post on X on Sunday. “And its international reporting not only makes Post readers smarter, it makes its competitors better – and thus American journalism better.”Post veterans, and some current staffers, expressed alarm on social media over the weekend at the paper’s decision to not send anyone to cover the Olympics, considering some of the excellent coverage it has published in the past.“I was the Washington Post’s Olympics beat writer from 1988-96,” wrote veteran sports columnist Christine Brennanin a post on X. “Tonight I’m thinking about my talented friends and colleagues at the Post who were getting ready to travel to Italy to tell the important stories of the Winter Olympics. This is just a stunning and awful development.”“Holy shit,”wrote Mike Wise, a sports writer who worked at the Post from 2004 to 2015. “That sports section is where I found my voice, where I covered 4 Olympic Games – 2 of them the Winter Olympics. My colleagues were some of the best and brightest in all of journalism. Jesus.”Dan Diamond, a White House reporter for the Post,called the news“difficult to read”.Some current and former Post staffers who spoke with the Guardian conveyed a sense that Bezos, who acquired the Post in 2013 from family ownership, is missing in action. Notably, Bezos did not comment afterFBI agents raideda Post reporter’s home on 14 January – though the Post’s top editor, Matt Murray, and publisher, Will Lewis, spoke out. (Emails sent to Bezos and a representative at Amazon were not returned.)The rumored cuts also come at a time when the company that Bezos founded, Amazon, is reportedly spending lavishly to promote a documentary on Melania Trump that its MGM Studioshad already paid $40mto acquire. The online publication Puckreported on Fridaythat the company additionally plans to spend $35m to market the film and bring it to theaters – though it is not expected to be a blockbuster.Internal frustration has also centered on Lewis, who was brought in by Bezos in the fall of 2023 to help turn things around financially after a successful stint as publisher at the Wall Street Journal. Instead, the Post continues to lose a significant amount of money, leading to persistent questions about how long Lewis can last atop the paper – though Bezos has given no indication that a change is coming. A key endeavor championed by Lewis, the Post’s so-called “third newsroom” devoted to new initiatives and digital formats, largely disbanded last year.“There is a creeping dread in the building that Bezos is dragging us to the edge from which there will be no easy return. Or, no return at all,” a third current Post staffer said, suggesting that Lewis’s job should be in jeopardy. “All of us in the newsroom have been diligently pursuing the most challenging stories, holding powerful people to account, and crafting rich, deep narratives, whether in text or video or any other format, and whether in metro, sports, foreign, politics or investigative. But what, exactly, has Will Lewis done?”Explore more on these topicsWashington PostNewspapersJeff BezosUS politicsShareReuse this content"

However, this spooked international investors, who fear the campaign promise will have the same effect as Liz Truss’s 2022 mini-budget in the UK. Japan has $9tn of debt – equivalent to 230% of its economy – and the highest among G7 countries.On Monday, the yen recovered some of its value against the dollar after speculation that the US Federal Reserve had used some of its vast resources to buy the Japanese currency.Miller, a former head of fixed income at investment giant BlackRock, said the latest lift in gold came on rising concerns that Trump’s administration would take steps to weaken the world’s most important currency, the US dollar. “If the Federal Reserve is doing this on behalf of the US Treasury, they’re only doing it for one reason: they think the US dollar is too high,” he said.Key voiceswithin the US administration have long suggested they would like a weaker the dollar to help revitalise the US domestic manufacturing base. A weaker dollar would undermine the value of US mainstay assets such as Treasury bonds, which has burnished gold’s allure as the ultimate store of value.Fed officials are to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to consider their next move on interest rates amid mounting pressure from the White House to reduce the cost of borrowing at a faster pace than expected by financial markets.The US central bank is expected to hold rates at a range of 3.5% to 3.75% this week, but could use some of its vast resources to buy yen to support the currency and at the same time weakening the dollar. The dollar lost almost 10% of its value against a basket of international currencies last year. It expected to continue falling in value in 2026 as the Fed accelerates cuts to interest rates.Explore more on these topicsGoldCommoditiesDollarTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But in the biggest game of his career, he delivered the performance of a lifetimeMelissa JacobsMon 26 Jan 2026 03.15 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 11.17 ESTShareMoments after clinching a Super Bowl berth, Sam Darnold strolled over for his obligatory television interview. He was thrilled; the Seattle Seahawks had justtoppled the Los Angeles Rams in a 31-27 thriller. But he was also measured. Unlike receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who would follow and was teeming with emotion, Darnold simply spoke about his love for his teammates. And when asked about his improbable journey, he replied, “I haven’t really thought about it that much.”He may not have, but the rest of us have. And whether Darnold likes it or not, his comeback story will be the prevailing storyline of Super Bowl 60. How can it not, especially after the quarterback saved what may have been the best performance of his life for Seattle’s third, and most important, tilt with the Rams this season.He completed 25 of his 36 passing attempts for 346 passing yards, three touchdowns and no turnovers, but those stats are just one part of the story. It was Darnold’s decision-making under pressure, lack of mistakes, and execution of Klint Kubiak’s aggressive play calls that are the key reasons Seattle will be playing for the Lombardi Trophy.Per NextGenStats, Darnold was the first NFL quarterback to throw three touchdowns under pressure in a playoff game. In his previous two meetings with the Rams this season, Darnold had thrown zero touchdowns and three interceptions under pressure. That contrast is a microcosm of Darnold’s career.Sam Darnold statsIn two weeks, Darnold will not only take the field as a starting quarterback on football’s biggest stage, but he’ll also return to Levi’s Stadium. San Francisco is one of Darnold’s many former homes, and it was also the start of his career resurrection.Before San Francisco, Darnold was just another failed Jets quarterback. The third overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft, he was plagued by turnovers and crumbled under a dysfunctional franchise that didn’t give him much of a supporting cast. Darnold’s most memorable moment with New York was a live mic recording him sayinghe was “seeing ghosts”during a blowout loss to the New England Patriots. Darnold was eventually shipped off to Carolina and New York would turn to another young quarterback, Zach Wilson, who would also be crushed by the Jets’ misery machine.Darnold’s two-year Carolina tenure was marked by injuries and turnovers, including 16 interceptions in 18 games. He wasn’t exactly atop any free-agent lists but he chose to join San Francisco as a backup to Brock Purdy in 2023.Darnold was only in San Francisco for a season but it changed his career. He recentlygushed about studying under Kyle Shanahan’s system. San Francisco is also where Darnold bonded with Kubiak, who was the 49ers’ passing game coordinator that season. He didn’t play much – most of his time came in a meaningless Week 18 game – but it was enough for the Vikings to sign him as a bridge quarterback for rookie JJ McCarthy at the start of last season. Still a laughing stock in many NFL circles, Darnold’s time as a starter was predicted to be short lived. Until McCarthy suffered a season-ending injury.All Darnold did in Minnesota was put up an MVP-caliber season, throwing for 4,000 yards, 35 touchdowns and a 102.5 passer rating. Yes, having the brilliant Justin Jefferson as his No 1 receiver helped, but Darnold displayed more fire and confidence than he had in any of his previous stops. His fairytale season came to a crashing halt in last year’s wildcard loss to the Rams. The pumpkin came in the form of nine sacks and two turnovers, and the general consensus was that although Darnold had improved, he would always wilt in the biggest moments.When Minnesota decided to turn their focus back to McCarthy, the Seahawks ignored predictions of Darnold’s doom loop. In fact, they treated him like a legitimate starting quarterback with a three-year, $100m contract. And “Ginger Cuz” – asone famous Seahawks alumnus dubbed him– was thrilled to be reunited with Kubiak, now the offensive coordinator in Seattle. “Just being able to work with Klint, having talked with Klint a ton in San Francisco about what we like and dislike. We have so much in common when it comes to football,” Darnold said upon signing with the Seahawks.While his regular season numbers didn’t jump off the page as much as they did in Minnesota, he led an efficient, balanced offense that earned the No 1 seed. And now, not only are the Seahawks headed to the Super Bowl, they are there because Darnold balled out when it mattered most. Seattle didn’t win in spite of Darnold on Sunday, they wonbecauseof him.Maybe Darnold doesn’t think much about his eight-year, five-team journey. Or about the fact that among 2018’s quarterback draft class it is he, and notNFLMVPs Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen, who has led a team to the Super Bowl.If he did, he may not believe it was possible.Co-MVPs of the weekNew England’s entire defense.To call the Pats chippy entering the AFC championship game in Denver would be an understatement. All they’ve heard this postseason is the greatness of their opponents. But after another dominating performance, the Patriots defense is no longer sneaky good. They were otherworldly on Sunday, holding Denver tojust 181 total yardsina 10-7 winto clinch New England’s first Super Bowl berth in seven years. New England’s defensive mastery was needed as Drake Maye struggled with the windy weather turning into an all-out blizzard.View image in fullscreenChristian Gonzalez celebrates a crucial interception against the Broncos.Photograph: Garrett W Ellwood/APThe Patriots manhandled Denver’s o-line, hitting quarterback Jarrett Stidham seven times and collecting three sacks. Cornerback Christian Gonzalez, responsible for one of those sacks, also grabbed a key interception.In three games this postseason, New England have forced eight turnovers, and only allowed two touchdowns and 26 points. This defense, an impressive combination of homegrown talent such as Gonzalez and Christian Barmore alongside key free agent pickups that include Milton Williams and Carlton Davis III, is no longer a secret.Stat of the week332.That’s the number of receiving yards put up by Puka Nacua this postseason. Nacua was excellent again for the Rams on Sunday, picking up 165 yards from nine receptions. His chemistry with Matthew Stafford remains excellent and helps propel the Rams offense. Stafford turns 38 in February, and Nacua will play a crucial role in deciding how long he keeps on playing. Meanwhile, Nacua’s fellow Rams receiver Davante Adams had tears in his eyes after the loss: he is 0-5 in conference games after Sunday’s defeat. “It’s tough to focus [on the future] right now,” he said.View image in fullscreenPuka Nacua celebrates his touchdown against the Seahawks.Photograph: John Froschauer/APVideo of the weekDenver had fourth-and-one on the New England 14 in the second quarter, and sure, analytics may tell you to go for it. But not when you’re trying to eke out points with a backup quarterback who hadn’t thrown a real pass in two years. Not when you have a shot at going up 10-0 with your defense playing lights out. Not when your opponent’s defense has been dominant this postseason. And not when the forecast is for snow, which will make points much harder to come by.Perhaps worse than Sean Payton’s decision to go for it in pre-blizzard conditions was his play-action bootleg call. The Broncos were averaging 3.3 yards per carry at that point and not exactly sporting Josh Allen under center.“There’ll always be second thoughts,” Paytontold reportersafter the game.

Owner Terry Pegula and GM Brandon Beane held a disastrous midweek press conference that featuredthrowing rookie wideout Keon Colemanunder the bus, admitting to players learning of Sean McDermott’s firing through the media, and Pegula unable to answer how he evaluates coaching v roster construction. Why did he fire McDermott and not Beane? Then the duo joined with Allen tointerview Philip Rivers, who appeared to be an actual candidate to replace McDermott before reportedly withdrawing from consideration on Monday. Then again, at least one Pegulais having a good week.Former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel cancelled his Bills interview, as well as a second interview with the Browns, toreportedly take the Chargers’ offensive coordinator job. According tothe Athletic’s Dianna Russini, McDaniel told coaches in the NFL that “he is moving west and taking the job to coach Justin Herbert”. But no deal has been signed, and McDaniel is still reportedly in the mix for the Raiders job.In a departure from hotshot hires, Mike McCarthy was named just the Steelers’ fourth head coach since 1969.

Josh Allen and Justin Herbert are the other quarterbacks representing the AFC at the Pro Bowl Games, which will take place in the run-up to the Super Bowl.Other AFC quarterbacks who could have challenged Sanders for a place in the Pro Bowl are either injured (Patrick Mahomes) or spent lengthy spells on the sidelines (Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow). However, there appears to be no place for Trevor Lawrence, despite the Jaguars quarterback leading his team to the playoffs and enjoying the best season of his career so far.Pro Bowl selections are decided between an equal weighting of votes from players, coaches and fans. Sanders, who was drafted with the 144th overall pick, received large numbers of votes from fans, which may help explain his call-up.Explore more on these topicsCleveland BrownsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

There are already a few videos on social media, depicting multiple angles of the grotesque scene. This killing,like the one before, has felt inevitable – because of the actions of the federal government, and in spite of the diligence and peaceful pushback by you and your neighbors.For more than a decade, watching soccer has been a staple of your Saturday routine, as it is for millions of others. Given that, it was hard not to think abouta prize awardedby the sport’s most powerful organization just eight weeks prior, to the president overseeing and encouraging all of this. You know, the medal meant to reward “exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace.” Plenty of peoplehave been jokingabout this “honor” online since the day it was announced. You were among them in December. Today, you find it hard to laugh.You get a push notification half an hour later: a member of your Premier League fantasy team scored. You forgot to update your lineups, what with everything going on around you. The goalscorer was left on your bench. Once, this would have registered as a palpable, if minor, annoyance. Today, it barely registers as anything at all. You quickly close the notification and tune in to the local news.The next kickoff approaches, in which your favorite team is about to play the defending champions. It’s a big one. Twenty minutes into the game, you mute it and load a stream of another press conference held by Jacob Frey, the mayor ofMinneapolis, and Brian O’Hara, the city’s police chief. It’s all too similar to the media briefing they delivered just 17 days earlier, after Renee Good was also brutally killed by ICE. Once again, they plead for the only action that will truly defuse what has become an impossibly tense new normal. They beg for ICE to leave us alone.‘Alex Pretti was murdered’: NBA’s Haliburton among sports stars to condemn Minnesota killingRead moreThe press conference wraps, and you look up to find that your boys are 2-0 up. The stadium is delirious. You might have been too, under different circumstances. Today, you haven’t heard a decibel of the crowd noise or a syllable of Peter Drury’s poetic reactions. You can’t bring yourself to go back and watch the replay to fill those gaps. Those goals are now forever associated with the sobering details of a senseless death. After 90 minutes, your team has pulled off the biggest upset of the weekendon the final kick of the game. Another day’s dose of euphoria doesn’t even register.There’s another game at 4.30pm – this one a little closer to home. The US women’s national team has built a proud reputation; an international powerhouse thatadvocates for progress and against violence. You wonder if they’ll find a way to acknowledge what’s happening in Minnesota, a state they’ve visited with increasing frequency since the opening of Allianz Field in Saint Paul.There are no black armbands of quiet support from the team. There’s no statement, or moment of silence, or acknowledgement before the national anthem. Eventhe gun lobby took time to criticizehow Trump’s camp justified the killing by turning the victim’s second amendment rights against him. So when thefourth goal goes in, and its scorer hustles toward the camera to try creatinga viral celebration for social media, you decide you can catch up on the final 35 minutes later. You decide this even though it’s the last meaningful soccer of the day, about a month before the domestic season kicks off in earnest.You and your partner’s favorite bar and its dart boards will go unvisited this evening. Keeping up with your shows has been pushed off the priority list entirely. These days, time together often means grabbing a coffee, or a water bottle at later hours, and slowly driving around in areas that have requested neighborhood patrol as community observers.You’re in group chats on platforms you had previously used to talk with sources. Nobody shares their real name, nor should they. You’re in constant contact with people who rename themselves after produce, minerals, and neighborhood landmarks. These are the people you trust most and are desperate to help protect.It haunts you that the first two victims – may they please be the only two – in your community were both 37 years old at the time of their senseless deaths. In less than a month, you’ll turn 32. You’re left to ruminate on realities that you hadn’t really dwelled on much until your own government began its occupation. Before, you thought of these ages primarily as those when soccer players might retire – or start thinking about it.It’s difficult to discuss this with your friends who have either moved away fromMinnesotaor who have never lived here at all.You watch the evening news, and the anchors deliver a statement from Michael and Susan Pretti, the parents of the man – now known to be VA nurse Alex Pretti – whose life ended far too soon and far too needlessly. It pushes back against false statements about him and the events leading to his death, disseminated by some of the most powerful people in the country. “Please get the truth out about our son,” the statement says in closing. “He was a good man.”Your professional instincts kick in, and you notice the Prettis’ statement hasn’t yet reached social media, and rush to transcribe and post it. It feels productive, helping them spread their message. Within an hour, it’s the most read and most shared post you’ve had on the platform – bigger than anything related to soccer, which is most of what you talk about on there.You get back into snow pants and boots and tear open another pack of hand warmers. You stand with your neighbors in subzero conditions after sunset, holding candles, acknowledging the morning’s horrors but stressing the value of this community, of fighting technologically enabled isolation. Your ability to gather in public parks reminds you that you can resist this isolation. It’s shared strength when needed most.A few years ago, sitting in freezing conditions like theserendered you unable to do your jobof covering a World Cup qualifier. Today, there’s no place you’d rather be than this city park.You anticipate the next day will be similar, even if nobody is killed. The past few weeks have introduced group chats and patrol drives and dutiful observation into your new daily routine. You stare at every car that drives past your window with longer gazes and greater scrutiny. Your camera roll, long teeming with pet photos, is now dominated by videos soundtracked by plastic whistles.On Sunday, you wake up to news that Trump’s attorney general hasissued a list of demandsif ICE’s grip on your state is to be loosened. Immediately below the letter on your social feed, the USWNT hasposted another angleof the fourth goal’s viral celebration. One of these feels far more important than the other.Explore more on these topicsFootballMinnesota ICE shootingUS sportsMinnesotaMinneapoliscommentShareReuse this content"

A point apiece reflected a dominant half apiece, though both managers felt they could have had more.Everton v Leeds United: Premier League – liveRead moreHaving failed to score in his first 16 appearances for Everton, or from his first 15 attempts on goal, Barry made it five goals in his past 10 attempts with a superb finish to puncture a fine away display by Leeds.Daniel Farke’s visitors, under pressure following weekend wins for relegation rivals Nottingham Forest and West Ham, were vastly superior in the first half and deservedly led through James Justin.Moyes’s half‑time changes – in personnel and formation – sparked a huge and necessary improvement from the hosts, but the Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlow had not been seriously tested until Barry took centre stage.“I’m really pleased for Thierno,” Moyes said. “There are a lot of strikers in the Premier League who cost a lot of money and it has not been easy for them, either. He is a young French under-21 international who is finding his way and just beginning to get settled in. He’s getting used to the whole club, the intensity of the league and while we’ve not been creating as many chances recently he’s getting a few goals. His goal was textbook.”Everton marked the recent death of Tommy Wright with a period of applause before kick‑off. Wright, considered one of the club’s finest full‑backs, won the FA Cup with his boyhood team in 1966, the league championship in 1970 and also represented England at the World Cup in Mexico that year.Leeds made by far the stronger start, however, with the movement of Farke’s midfield five and Brenden Aaronson constantly dragging Everton out of shape. Dominic Calvert‑Lewin, who received applause and some half-hearted boos when facing his former club for the first time since leaving on a free transfer, had an early chance saved by Jordan Pickford, while Jayden Bogle and Ilia Gruev also threatened.View image in fullscreenLeeds’s James Justin slots home the opening goal of the game past Everton’s Jordan Pickford.Photograph: Matt McNulty/Getty ImagesThe visitors’ eventual lead came as no surprise. Leeds carved open Everton with a flowing move down their right in which Iliman Ndiaye, James Garner and Vitalii Mykolenko all came off second best in the challenge. Anton Stach swept in a low cross that evaded both Calvert‑Lewin and the covering James Tarkowski but rolled perfectly for Justin as he arrived at the back post. With Aaronson sensibly getting out of the wing‑back’s way, Justin placed a clinical finish beyond the exposed Pickford.Calvert-Lewin was centimetres away from doubling the visitors’ advantage moments later. The opportunity came from another Leeds move down the right with Aaronson finding Bogle, who crossed towards the near post. The former Everton striker connected well with an awkward delivery but his attempt cannoned off a post from close range.Moyes had no option but to make changes for the second half. Jarrad Branthwaite was introduced for his first appearance of an injury-plagued season, while Kiernan Dewsbury‑Hall also returned from injury as the Everton manager matched Farke’s 3-5-2 formation. The anonymous Dwight McNeil and Harrison Armstrong made way.Moyes’s switches had the effect he desired, with Everton enjoying far more possession and finally troubling Leeds. The previously unemployed Darlow came to Leeds’s rescue when tipping away an improvised effort from Barry, who attempted to curl a shot inside the far corner with the outside of his foot. It was an excellent save by the Leeds goalkeeper but he was powerless to prevent Barry equalising with his – and Everton’s – second shot on target.The second half turned into a role reversal of the first and the home side’s constant probing led to reward when Dewsbury-Hall released Idrissa Gueye. The midfielder played a low cross to the near post where Barry stole in ahead of Sebastiaan Bornauw to flick a superb finish into the roof of Darlow’s net.In another repeat of the first half, Everton struck the woodwork moments after scoring when Gueye hit the crossbar from the edge of the area. Moyes made another positive substitution when replacing Nathan Patterson with Tyler Dibling, who could have clinched victory late on but opted to cross when he should have shot for the far corner.Farke said: “It is a really good point for us on the road. We were outstanding in the first half, it was one of our best performances, and we should have scored a second when Dom hit the post. It was obvious Everton would eventually show up but we didn’t allow them many chances. We have to respect it’s tough at their place so we take the point and move on.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Maybe that 3-4-2-1 might not be the answer for this Manchester United team? Perish the thought. The club’s recently sacked manager was clear that not even the pope would make him change – presumably because Leo XIV is also a big fan of three centre-halves. Saying that, Amorim did come close to losing his religion towards the bitter end, however brief and unconvincing his dalliance with a back four was. He reverted to a three forhis final game at Leedsin early January.As the dust settles on Michael Carrick’s second thrilling win as the United interim manager in two matches,the last-gasp triumph at Arsenalfollowingthe home win against Manchester City, it is a moment, first and foremost, for the club’s supporters to savour.Arteta’s team of ruthless cyborgs malfunction in way that is all too human | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThe bedlam in the away enclosure at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday after Matheus Cunha’s 87th-minute winner made all of those present feel lighter. Ditto the celebrations upon the full-time whistle. The songs for Carrick. For Casemiro, too,who was once again excellent in midfield. Even Sir Jim Ratcliffe looked ready to accept an invitation for a post-match interview before pulling back and pointing at the smile on his face. “This is all you need to know,” was the gist from the minority owner.The basis for the result, as it had been against City, was United’s assurance on the ball; the bursts of quick, direct passing to get them out of tight spots and up the field. They were not as pronounced as in the derby, which was a game the players enjoyed more, but they were there as Carrick’s team recovered from an opening half-hour when they were under the cosh.Witness the interchanges between Patrick Dorgu and Bruno Fernandes before the former lashed home the long-range drive for 2-1. Or when Kobbie Mainoo took one touch after a short pass from Fernandes before swiftly moving the ball up and past Declan Rice for Cunha, who ran on to produce another emphatic finish from distance.It was difficult not to link it to something basic. Under Carrick, it has not been Fernandes or Mainoo plus the extra defender. It has been both of them – together with Casemiro – with a man fewer at the back. Darren Fletcher played the 4-2-3-1 with Fernandes in the No 10 role when he took charge against Burnley and Brighton after Amorim’s departure, the latter in the FA Cup. United dominated against Burnley only to find a way to draw and it was a slog in the defeat against Brighton.View image in fullscreenMatheus Cunha (right) wheels away alongside Diogo Dalot (centre) and Kobbie Mainoo after scoring a spectacular winner for United.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersCarrick has got it to work and it has been easy to fixate on Mainoo’s comeback after his deep freeze under Amorim. There is a reason why Mainoo is loved by United fans and it is not only because he is a local boy and academy product. It is because of his nervelessness on the ball, his ability to receive – especially under pressure – and make a move, maybe a shoulder drop or sharp turn, and get the team forward, either with a dribble or a secure pass.Amorim’s frustration will be that there were signs of progress under him this season. The buildup play from the back was effective, at times; faster and more direct. The patterns could be attractive, especially when Fernandes was drilling his first-time passes. It was just that his team let themselves down so often in both boxes. The inconsistency was maddening, best reflected by the statistic that showed Amorim won back‑to‑back league matches only in one short spell – the three‑game run last October that featured victories against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.Carrick has won two in a row; they were not smash and grabs, either. He is now confronted by a fresh challenge. Can he do it on a lazy Old Trafford lunchtime against Fulham on Sunday? Perversely, Amorim did not struggle in the very biggest matches against Liverpool, City and Arsenal. His record in all competitions against them read: W3 D3 L3. In other words, six positive results out of nine.It was against less storied opponents such as Fulham where the problems came. When Amorim’s team played them at Old Trafford last season, they exited the FA Cup on penalties. United will be the favourites to win this time, just as they will be in the four fixtures that follow: Tottenham at home, West Ham and Everton away, and Crystal Palace at home. Amorim’s record against those clubs in all competitions? W3 D4 L7.“In the coming weeks, when people expect more from us and we are the favourites to win, you also have to pull through,” Senne Lammens, the United goalkeeper, said. “They are sometimes the most difficult games, the ones you have to win.“We know we can play against those better teams so now we have to do it against those teams who are maybe a bit more difficult to play against … [when] we play against low blocks. If you want to be a great team, you have to win against those teams as well.”Apart from the formation and Mainoo, what has Carrick done to enjoy such a bolt from the blocks? It is impossible to ignore Dorgu, who he has played on the wing rather than at left-back – as Amorim did towards the end of his tenure.It was a bold move to start Dorgu ahead of Cunha against City but one that was more than vindicated, with Dorgu starring and scoring. There was no debate about him keeping his place at Arsenal. It will be interesting to see if Carrick brings back Cunha against Fulham.View image in fullscreenSenne Lammens, the United goalkeeper, feels Carrick’s biggest strength has been ‘sticking to the basics’.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersCarrick has pushed savvy backroom staff appointments, including that of the assistant coach, Steve Holland – a boyhood United fan, who used to follow the team home and away. Carrick has also benefited from the club’s less than crowded schedule. It is an embarrassment that United will play only 40 games this season owing to cup exits and no European football. Carrick, at least, has had time on the training pitch.There has been no silver bullet. Rather it feels like a case of a manager doing sensible things, including getting a system to fit his players. “I’ve got to be honest … there’s not that many special things he did,” Lammens said.“It’s just like sticking to the basics. Football is basics. If you do the basics well, then our quality comes out. Tactically, we are standing right. We are defending good together and as a team. If you fight as a team and keep believing then you can win.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedMichael CarrickRuben AmorimfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His four years in English football have been mixed but he may yet go out on a high. At one point in his first season, such as his performance in the2023 League Cup final, he was hailed as the club’s best signing since Eric Cantona. He never lived up to that billing, the accusation that United had overpaid for someone who left his legs in Madrid. At the Emirates in 2026, just as against Manchester City the previous week, he showed his muscle memory endures. Kobbie Mainoo is a project player for Michael Carrick. Mainoo can learn much in his remaining months alongside Casemiro, who completed the 90 minutes at Arsenal and retained his influence. United are linked with younger midfielders in Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson. They may now have something to live up to.John BrewinMatch report:Arsenal 2-3 Manchester United2Arsenal lose their concentrationAfter months of laser focus, it was a shock to the system to see Arsenal give such an error-strewn performance againstManchester United. They took their eye off the ball the moment they took a first-half lead, twice allowing Bruno Fernandes to get a sight of goal thanks to loose defending before Martín Zubimendi’s underhit back pass teed up Bryan Mbeumo to equalise. For Zubimendi, the embodiment of reliability this season, to make such a horrible error summed up Arsenal’s day. The second half was a mess of mistimed runs, mis-hit passes and clumsy touches and, while United triumphed thanks to spectacular efforts from Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha, Arsenal’s nervous energy was an unwelcome throwback to less convincing seasons. This was their first home defeat of the campaign, the first time they have conceded three goals in a game in more than two years, their only loss this season after going ahead and a first league defeat to United at home since 2017. With Arsenal’s lead at the top trimmed to four points, there is no time for navel-gazing. They have to put things right next weekend at Leeds.Will Magee3Newcastle are short of creativityUnai Emery came over all coy in the face of suggestions that hisAston Villaside might be title contenders but Eddie Howe was left to reflect on the consequences of Sunday’s damaging 2-0 home defeat to Aston Villa. Newcastle’s manager was asked if he lacked a creator of the quality of Morgan Rogers or Emi Buendía and he did not demur. “I think when you lose like we did today, there’s a valid argument for everything,” said Howe, who invested the best part of £180m in the attacking skills of Nick Woltemade, Yoane Wissa and Anthony Elanga last summer. “Everyone wants to change something. But we have the players that we have, and we have to find a solution with those players. There’s no point me thinking we need another type of player at this moment because it’s not going to happen. The next chance we’ll really have to change the squad will be the summer. It’s about getting the best out of the players we have.” Over to you Eddie. How about deploying Woltemade as a No 10?Louise TaylorMatch report:Newcastle 0-2 Aston VillaView image in fullscreenCould Eddie Howe use Nick Woltemade as a playmaker?Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters4Kolo Muani is not trusted at SpursWhen Tottenham were chasing the game against Burnley, Thomas Frank was wondering how to change things with substitutions. Amid injury problems, his options were limited but he had Randal Kolo Muani available, the 27-year-old striker with 31 France caps and nine international goals to his name, making him almost perfect in a difficult moment. Such has been the lamentable nature of his loan spell that has accrued zero goals in 15Premier Leagueappearances, Frank left him sitting in the freezing Lancashire cold. If he is not deemed suitable in these moments, then keeping him on the books seems pointless for player and club. Freeing up his wages by sending him back to Paris Saint-Germain would be helpful in the transfer market. Kolo Muani’s only hope of turning things around in England looks like a change in head coach, which isn’t too far-fetched, but like Frank, he does not have the backing of the fans.Will UnwinMatch report:Burnley 2-2 Tottenham5Guéhi settles in nicely at CityMarc Guéhi’s Manchester City debut ended with him being embraced by Nico O’Reilly, after the centre-back denied Wolves a late strike, ensured a clean sheet, and showed a firm bond already with his new side. The defender’s£20m move from Crystal Palacecame, in part, after advice from two England and now City team-mates. “Yeah – Phil Foden and John Stones, conversations with the manager, conversations with Hugo Viana [the director of football],” he said. One colleague who may leave in the summer is Bernardo Silva, according to Pep Guardiola. “We spoke a lot with Bernie and Bernie has to decide the best for him, his family. Whatever happens he will remain one of the greatest players of this club.”Jamie JacksonMatch report:Manchester City 2-0 WolvesView image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi (right) with his new teammate Nico O’Reilly as Manchester City kept a clean sheet.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPA6Palace throw Canvot in the deep endCrystal Palace have enjoyed success from their policy of developing potential but the case of Jaydee Canvot shows how risky that can be. The 19-year-old joined in the summer for big money, having only recently made his breakthrough into Toulouse’s first team, and has found himself thrown in at the deep end after Marc Guéhi was sold toManchester City. A poor back pass gifted Chelsea their opening goal in Sunday’s disappointing defeat that made it 11 games without a win in all competitions for Palace. Canvot also gave away a penalty and was taken off. The French defender needs more time to develop away from the spotlight and Oliver Glasner will be relieved to have Chadi Riad back in contention after a long-term knee injury, although another experienced defender has to be a priority this month if Palace are to stop their slide.Ed AaronsMatch report:Crystal Palace 1-3 Chelsea7Wilson and Silva keep stummWith 17 goal involvements in 17 games for club and country since the start of November, Harry Wilson is, as his manager Marco Silva said, “in the best moment of his career”. No Premier League player is outperforming xG as strongly as the Welshman. Wilson’s talent has been apparent since his time in theLiverpoolacademy, his shooting prowess always his strongest suit. At 28, now an experienced senior player, consistency is being paired with ability. He is supplying his trademark spectacular goals on a regular basis. His stoppage-time free-kick rubbed out a decent performance for Brighton – the visitors’ defeat was, in Silva’s view, “harsh”. Wilson’s Fulham contract expires in June and he is reported to be waiting on Silva’s decision on his own future. Silva, a candidate for the Tottenham job that went to Thomas Frank last summer, is keeping his intentions to himself, though he has not hidden his disappointment at Fulham’s lack of spending. Craven Cottage would sorely miss both player and manager.JBMatch report:Fulham 2-1 Brighton8Dyche takes aims at … towels?Sean Dyche declared a war on towels after Forest’s win atBrentford. “Why don’t the Premier League go: ‘No towels, just get on with the game?’” he said. “Just say no towels. Dead easy, isn’t it? Not rocket science, you know? Why make it more complicated?” Spectators frustrated by this season’s many delays and interruptions, including the endless wiping of balls before long throws, might be inclined to agree. But it should be observed that Dyche was not accusing his opponents on the day of being pro-towel, and there were no towels in use at the Gtech Stadium. Dyche’s crusade against time-wasting was most likely a traditional case of deflection. Brentford’s support were on at Forest players for time-wasting from the start of Sunday’s match and Keith Andrews afterwards accused Forest of taking “an eternity” with every restart, something Dyche did not deny. “All managers will use whatever they can to their advantage”, the Forest manager admitted. “That’s the way it is.”Paul MacInnesMatch report:Brentford 0-2 Nottingham ForestView image in fullscreenA furious Sean Dyche mistakenly thinks he spots a towel at the Gtech Community Stadium.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA9Hill rises to Liverpool challengeJust as it seemed Bournemouth may have sold one player too many and with the threat of being dragged into a relegation fight looming large, Andoni Iraola’s side turned in a typically fearless performance to topple the champions.Antoine Semenyo’s £62.5m record sale to Manchester Citythis month means, across the past seven months, the Cherries have sold three players to the past three winners of the Champions League, plus Milos Kerkez to Liverpool. Adrien Truffert, Kerkez’s replacement from Rennes, negated Mohamed Salah but arguably Bournemouth’s best performer was James Hill, another star in the making. The 24-year-old was outstanding in defence but also set up his team’s second goal and it was his long throw that led to Amine Adli’s winner. A £1m buy from Fleetwood Town amid interest from Barcelona in 2022, Hill has seized his opportunity, shining as a No 6, right-back and at centre-back and keeping £34m signing Bafodé Diakité out of the team.Ben FisherMatch report:Bournemouth 3-2 Liverpool10Does Paquetá’s exit suit all parties?Nuno Espírito Santo talks about rebalancing West Ham’s squad. Niclas Füllkrug, Luis Guilherme, Callum Marshall, Andy Irving and George Earthy have left the club this month. Guido Rodríguez is on his way to Valencia, underlining the wasted money at West Ham down the years. The biggest question, though, remains how the Lucas Paquetá situation plays out. He wants to return to Brazil to play for Flamengo but West Ham are reluctant sellers. They fear that losing the Brazilian now would hurt their push to stay up. However, Paquetá’s absence with a minor back problem has coincided with West Ham winning their past three games. Nuno needs players who want to be there. West Ham are in a fight and need absolute commitment. Nuno expects Paquetá to play for the club again. However, West Ham need to work out if there is any benefit to making the midfielder stay.Jacob SteinbergMatch report:West Ham 3-1 SunderlandPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal2325502Man City2326463Aston Villa2310464Man Utd237385Chelsea2314376Liverpool233367Fulham230348Brentford233339Newcastle2333310Sunderland23-23311Everton22-13212Brighton2323013AFC Bournemouth23-53014Tottenham Hotspur2322815Crystal Palace23-42816Leeds22-72517Nottm Forest23-112518West Ham23-182019Burnley23-191520Wolverhampton23-288Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballArsenalManchester UnitedNewcastle UnitedAston VillaBurnleyTottenham HotspurfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Considered one of the outstanding players of his generation, his representatives had appeared to agree a new contract withBarcelona, due to be signed after his birthday, but he informed the head coach, Hansi Flick, of his decision to depart the same week.European football: Lamine Yamal’s stunning strike caps Barcelona win over Real OviedoRead moreAlthough he has €6m (£5.2m) buyout clause, PSG are understood to have agreed a fee over €8m (£6.9m) as a gesture of goodwill at the end of a process that has angered Barcelona. When the subject was raised with Flick during the pre-match press conference before Barcelona played Real Sociedad a week ago, he first refused to talk about it until the deal was officially done. But, having just been informed of the player’s decision, he ended up allowing his frustration to show.“I put a lot of effort in the young players and helping them improve but there are a lot of people around them,” Flick said. “There are footballers who are 17 or 18 but who have people who make decisions. I don’t want to say more.”Flick had promoted Dro to the first team squad and handed him his debut at 17 but opportunities were few. He departs having played just 148 minutes across five games. Under Luis Enrique, whose 4-3-3 formation theoretically suits Dro more than Flick’s 4-2-3-1, there are hopes that he will get more minutes at PSG.“It’s an unpleasant situation,” Laporta told Catalan radio. “We had agreed a new situation with Dro for when he turned 18 and surprisingly his agent informed us that he couldn’t fulfil what had been agreed.”Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowBarcelonaParis Saint-GermainEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Liverpool had been on a 13-game unbeaten run before Saturday’sdefeat to Bournemouth, but nobody could claim a string of results that included home draws with all three promoted clubs was convincing. Spurs had won just two of their 13 league games before Saturday’saway draw at Burnley, which was salvaged only thanks to an injury-time goal from Cristian Romero.For both, European competition had offered some relief – Liverpool looked very good in a 3-0 winaway to Marseillewhile Spurs, at least in the first half, produced probably their best performance since August inbeating Borussia Dortmund2-0 – but the sad truth is that the vast majority of European sides these days simply cannot live with the physicality of the Premier League. That’s not to say that Bournemouth or Burnley are better than Marseille or Dortmund, but it is to say that the challenge they pose a Premier League side is less.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreThe situations at the two clubs are different, obviously: Arne Slot won the league title last season, while Thomas Frank was brought in from Brentford, inheriting the complicated legacy of a Tottenham team that had won the Europa League but finished 17th in thePremier League. But Liverpool and Tottenham face a very modern problem: what to do if it seems like your manager has run out of steam in midseason. Who comes in next? Who is both of the requisite level and currently available?There is a further complication this season with the World Cup, after which a number of high-level managers will be released into the market. Clubs cannot realistically do a deal with any before the tournament, both for fear of being accused of disrupting a country’s preparations (risking the sort of furore thatconsumed the Spain manager Julen Lopeteguiwhen he accepted the Real Madrid job in 2018) and of an embarrassing World Cup exit that could undermine the manager’s political capital before he begins. But wait until after the tournament and it’s only a month until the Premier League season starts.Say you’re a promising young manager. You’ve done well at a mid-sized club, outperforming your wage budget to finish eighth or ninth. Why would you jump ship now? Football is no longer a game in which a new face can suddenly elevate a group of players. New ideas take time to instill. A manager will probably ideally want three or four signings to help mould the squad towards his vision. Pragmatist managers capable of working with what they’re given – a Fabio Capello, a Carlo Ancelotti, a Max Allegri – are thin on the ground at the top end of the modern game. Move in January or February and not only might you be missing out on a run in the FA Cup or Europe, but the risk is that you inherit an unsteady ship and, by the time you’ve had a chance to right it, your reputation is already shot. Manchester United’sex-manager Ruben Amorimis by no means the only manager to fall foul of what might be termed theJan Siewertprinciple. Better for that aspiring manager to wait till the summer when he may have the pick of three or four jobs.A Saturday and a state killing: soccer as Minnesota is torn apart | Jeff RueterRead moreBut imagine things have got so bad for a major club that it’s decided that the best chance of qualifying for the Champions League or having a decent crack at the Cup or Europe is to replace the incumbent. What can you do? The only option is to turn to an interim, which raises the potential complication of the interim (often a beloved former player) doing too well and creating a clamour for his appointment, making life harder for whoever is ultimately appointed. If results simply stabilise, though, then the season is effectively written off. Ryan Mason was sacked by West Brom earlier this month, which must have sent a tremor through Spurs fans: to finish a third season in six years under an interim Mason really would be a sign of failure.A club may as well stick with the devil it knows. Crystal Palace apparently decided to do so with Oliver Glasner, who hasannounced he will leave in the summerand is evidently unhappy at his best players being sold.Frank has seemed dwarfed by the demands of the Tottenham job; he speaks like a mid-table manager and that is not a tune Spurs fans want to hear. But equally, he has been unfortunate with injuries, especially in forward areas, and that has compounded existing issues by reducing confidence. Perhaps green shoots will begin to emerge but it’s very hard to see him being in charge at the beginning of next season.And Slot has struggled to deal with the influx of new signings that have left him with an unbalanced squad.Liverpoolhave difficulty with attacking low blocks and defending set plays. A run in the Champions League could yet change perceptions. The danger for Slot will come if it looks like Liverpool may not qualify for next season’s Champions League.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Leeds have had a bid for Strand Larsen rejected in this transfer window, which closes next Monday.Villa were also interested in Mateta but are pursuing a deal to re-sign their former loanee Tammy Abraham, who travelled to England for a medical at the weekend.

He didn’t get involved unless he really had to, he let play flow and he’s rightly received plaudits for that. At the end, everyone was talking about the game, not the referee, and that’s all you can really ask for.The biggest shout involved Harry Maguire, whose arm stopped Mikel Merino’s shot in the area when United were 2-1 up. I didn’t think this was a handball offence. Maguire was going to ground making a challenge and his outstretched arm was there as support. He didn’t make his body unnaturally bigger; it was a normal action. Where do you expect him to put his arm otherwise?The decision was correctly made on the field by Pawson and checked very quickly by the video assistant referee, Paul Tierney. It didn’t look like a penalty kick or feel like a penalty kick, especially in accordance with the laws of the game.It’s the same when you look at Patrick Dorguin the run-up to his goal. People were trying to look for a handball when there wasn’t one. The ball touches his thigh and not his arm as he takes it into his stride. There’s no evidence to suggest it was handball and a good goal was quite rightly allowed.Darren England was the referee forCrystal Palace’s home fixture against Chelseaand awarded a penalty for handball, with an interpretation we don’t see very often. The Palace defender Jaydee Canvot clearly stopped a João Pedro shot from going in with his arm. From his position, England probably can’t see the handball. The VAR, Matt Donohue, does and recommends a review. England then reviews at the monitor, awards a penalty for an accidental handball and gives a yellow card to Canvot.View image in fullscreenJoão Pedro (left) unleashes a shot that hits Jaydee Canvot on the arm.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAThis has created a bit of noise because we don’t see it very often. When the officials deem a player has denied the opposing team a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity by a non-deliberate handball, the referee should award a penalty and a yellow rather than a red card, which has been the case since before the 2024-25 season. This is what England did.Farai Hallam made his debut as a Premier League referee on Saturday and what a day he had. He refereedManchester City’s match against Wolvesreally well. The biggest incident was another potential handball, this time by the Wolves defender Yerson Mosquera. The ball struck his outstretched left arm as Omar Marmoush tried to scoop it behind him. Hallam left it alone, but the VAR felt it was a handball offence and recommended a review.You can see, as Mosquera is running, that his arms are where you would expect them to be and the ball strikes him close to the elbow. Hallam went to the monitor and stayed with his on-field decision and I agree with him.What I really liked was that Hallam, even though it was his first Premier League game, took his time. He is a product of the Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO) development group, formed as part of the elite referee development programme, and a former academy footballer with Stevenage who played professionally in England and Spain.Handball will always cause debate and discussion, but in the Premier League we are seeing a mature approach to the laws owing to PGMO’s high-threshold approach. I can recall only a handful of decisions this season where people have been penalised for it. There’s generally an acceptance within the English game when it comes to the agreed position on how to interpret this law.In different competitions around the world you will see a different interpretation, including in Uefa competitions such as the Champions League where handball is judged much more literally. But I’m a little bit old-fashioned: I want a handball to be clear. I don’t want to have to persuade you, I want people to see it and say: that’s a handball. ThinkThierry Henry for France against the Republic of Ireland.That’s how I want it, but you have situations where the ball can strike anywhere in the penalty area on any part of the body and everybody appeals.Chris Foy is a former Premier League refereeExplore more on these topicsRefereesLaws of footballcommentShareReuse this content"

The demand was made in open letter also addressed to the presidents of Fifa’s 200-plus national associations.Among its 20 signatories are Ali Karimi, who played 127 times forIran, and three other former full internationals. The list also includes a coach, a referee and sports journalists.Sepp Blatter suggests fans should not travel to US for World CupRead moreThe letter says a “nationwide, popular, and civic movement” has been met by the Iranian authorities with “systematic repression, mass killings, and actions that constitute clear instances of crimes against humanity and war crimes”.Amongthousands killed in protests this month– the letter refers to information and reports that put the death toll at more than 18,000, though some estimates are even higher – were what the letter describes as “a significant number of members of the football community”. It names among them Mojtaba Tarshiz, a former top-division player, who had two young children.Other victims listed include Saba Rashtian, a women’s football assistant referee, the youth coach Mehdi Lavasani, the footballers Amirhossein Mohammadzadeh and Ribin Moradi, and Mohammad Hajipour, a goalkeeper for Iran’s beach soccer team.View image in fullscreenIranians attend an anti-government protest in Tehran.Photograph: APThe letter also raises concern over the fate of Amirhassan Ghaderzadeh, a 19-year-old player with Sepahan Isfahan. His family has reportedly been told he faces an imminent risk of execution because of his participation in protests. His case was condemned by the US state department last week after being highlighted by Amnesty International.Signatories of the letter, who include a second Iran player picked for the World Cup in Bakhtiar Rahmani, saya nationwide shutdown of internet and telephone communicationshas made it difficult to verify deaths and arrests. They say several members of the football community have been arrested upon entering Iran for expressing their opinions and have had their passports confiscated.Addressing Infantino, the letter says: “Football, as the most influential social phenomenon in the world, cannot and must not remain silent in the face of executions, killings, arbitrary arrests, and threats against athletes.”The group call on Fifa and the national football federations to publicly condemn those actions, demand an immediate halt, use all available legal and disciplinary mechanisms to protect Iranian football figures and “affirm that peaceful protest and the expression of personal opinions are fundamental human rights”.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right: Saba Rashtian, Amirhossein Mohammadzadeh, Ribin Moradi, Mehdi Lavasani, Mojtaba Tarshiz.Photograph: Voices of IranThe letter concludes: “Silence in the face of these crimes amounts to abandoning the very principles that global football claims to defend.”Fifa has been approached for comment.Karimi has become one of the most prominent sporting voicessupporting Iran’s protest movement. In 2022, he accused the authorities of trying to kidnap him and claimed his family had been threatened after he publicly supported anti-government protests. Karimi, who played for Bayern Munich, moved to the US in 2023 after Iranian security forces briefly seized his family home.Karimi said Iranians had paid “heavy prices, such as their lives and their freedom” for basic rights over decades and that his aim was to ensure the international community hears about the crimes being committed.View image in fullscreenA protester wears a T-shirt with Ali Karimi’s name during a demonstration in Germany in 2022.Photograph: Zuma Press Inc/Alamy“I have always considered myself one of the people,” he said. “Now that our country is going through one of its most sensitive and sorrowful periods, the least I can do is be the voice of my people.”Karimi said the protesters were “more hopeful than ever” and that “freedom and democracy through the ballot box” were what they wanted. “We witnessed the mass killing of people, the real numbers of which are far higher than the figures that are announced.”At least 22 athletes from other sports, including basketball, rock climbing, wrestling and taekwondo, have been killed for taking part in the protests. Massoud Zatparvar, a two-time World Classic Bodybuilding champion, died during protests in the city of Rasht in Gilan province in northwestern Iran. “We only want our rights, the voice that has been stifled for 40 years must be shouted out,” he wrote in his last Instagram post on an account since deleted.It is understood Iranian authorities are using CCTV footage from shops to compile evidence against those who took part in the protests. The deaths of prominent athletes are often given widespread coverage in the state-run media.“All they try to do is to create fear,” said one source in Iran who did not want to be named. “They want to say: ‘This is what we do to the athletes, this is what we do to the celebrities, this is what we do to the biggest names. What do you think we can do to you?’”Explore more on these topicsFootballIranFifanewsShareReuse this content"

You’re as beautiful as a goal in the 90th minute, the graffiti goes, and this was as beautiful as it gets until it got better. The board had gone up at the Ciutat de Valencia stadium on Friday night when Elche embarked upon a move that could have come from a cartoon or a console, the final scene in a film. Escape to Victory only more so, it started the wayMichael Caine planned it, all arrows and crosses andping-ping-ping, and finishedthe way Pelé actually played it: a picture of perfection which earned them a 2-2 draw in the derby at Levante. Or so it goes.From one end to the other Elche had gone, the edge of their area to the heart of Levante’s. There had been a dribble out, a dozen passes, a touch for all of them. A superb assist, three defenders sent the wrong way. And then, two minutes into added time, the finish, Adam Boayar’s astonishing overhead kick sailing into the corner to complete a goal so good it was silly, so pristine as to be almost surreal. As the Ciutat fell silent, teammates piled on and fans in the away corner didn’t so much celebrate as put their hands over their mouths and try not to laugh, barely able to believe this.Serie A’s ‘mega tie-breaker’ leaves Inter clear but Juve catch the eye again | Nicky BandiniRead moreJust you wait. Because if this was the best goal of the season, it wasn’t the best moment of the night, let alone the weekend. Because if there’s one thing more beautiful than a goal in the 92nd minute it is a goal in the 96th, however ugly it actually is, and Levante’s fans hardly had time to turn and head for the exits before they were turning back again.“That’s what makes this sport so wonderful … and so cruel,” former Levante coach Luis García had said when Boayar scored, the home side seemingly denied a victory they had deserved almost as much as they needed it, but still refusing to declare this definitive. “Look, look, look, look ... see?!” he said when a long throw, a corner and a header from Alan Matturrosaw them take it back again.Now, 3-2 up, everyone exploded. Suddenly there were people running everywhere, nowhere to go except wild. Some went left, some right. They came from the bench to the pitch and the pitch to the bench. On the touchline, coach Luis Castro flew up the line, arms out like a little boy being an airplane. Piles of players appeared all over the place. Maty Ryan arrived from his goal to leap on board. Somewhere in the chaos, someone appeared on crutches. People tumbled down terraces. Matturro, who had been criticised last week for sidling up to Kylian Mbappé before he took a penalty against them at the Bernabéu and joking “[Ryan] thinks he’s Dibu”, now looked at the camera and drew a heart.They had done it, at last. Having gone down an early goal, at half-time the manager had told Levante’s players that if they kept playing like this they would win but that promise was about to be broken by a goal of implausible perfection and from nowhere. They had 26 shots to three and nine corners to one. Their best chance had been cleared off the line accidentally and by their own player, poor Karl Etta Eyong, the striker who has not scored since October, almost wiped out by the ball getting whacked straight at him. And they had gone into added time 2-1 up,thisclose to winning their first home game of the season. “And then,” said Pablo Martínez, “they go and score an overhead kick on 90-something.” That could have finished them, fatalism flooding in; instead, they found a way back.“I’m glad it was Matturro: it hasn’t been an easy week for him,” Castro said. “What I liked most is that after the 2-2, the players didn’t give in; they believed so much that they managed to get the win. There was a lot of emotion. We had to stay calm but with the goal, the emotion was let out.”View image in fullscreenMayhem for Levante after their late winner.Photograph: Ana Escobar/EPAHope, above all. Victory took Levante within three points of safety, with a game in hand. Which doesn’t sound like much, but something has shifted. When in November Levante sacked Julián Calero, the policeman on leave who was the first on the scene at the Atocha train bombings, they were 19th, level with Real Oviedo. A newly-promoted team, mostly they had competed but the results were poor: on nine points from 14 games, they were three off Girona, Osasuna and safety, four from Mallorca and five from Valencia. Under Del Moral and Iborra, the interim coaches, it didn’t get better: a defeat against Osasuna and a late draw at Real Sociedad saw them six points from safety. Within an hour of the final whistle that night, the new appointment was announced.Few had heard of Castro. “I started at the bottom coaching five-year-olds,” he said, “and I have built a nice story; I come from the people. My life and personality are similar to Levante’s: there have been difficult moments, they’ve had to fight against the tide, but with togetherness have achieved things.” He said he had studied Levante’s history and knew about them, a team that have been to Europe but never finished above rivals Valencia and had to wait 86 years for their one cup success – in the Republican zone during the civil war – to be recognised. They knew a little less about the coach who had won the Uefa Youth League with Benfica’s U19s, and had overachieved in France, saving Dunkerque. But, he promised they were going to attack, and so they did.The first day they beat Sevilla 3-0. “We always went for more,” the coach said. Then came a draw against Espanyol, a 2-0 loss at Real Madrid, and now this. Two wins and a draw in four; as many victories as in the previous 16 games put together. “These three points literally give you life,” one report had it. Two points away with a game in hand, safety was within touching distance.But hope lasts only as long as others let it, and beauty was everywhere. If Levante went from 14 points to 17, 3km south the following afternoon it happened again: same scenes, same explosion of joy, same hope returning. Same “cinema ending” according to the city’s sports paper, Super Deporte. Same fatalism suddenly blown away. Same resistance, same satisfaction from the coach too: “We didn’t give in at 2-2,” Carlos Corberán said. One-nil up and 2-1 up, Valencia had seen Espanyol equalise with 11 minutes to go. Yet they too found a way back, or rather were gifted one.It came thanks to what have come to be calledpenaltitosor little penalties, which would be fine, only it makes it sound like they are penalties at all. On 91.42, Lucas Beltrán ran into Ruben Suárez, injuring the defender, and getting a spot kick for it. “I don’t know if they went to the VAR; maybe they went to the bar in the north stand or in the south stand; I don’t know what the VAR is for,” Espanyol’s coach Manolo González said. And while he admitted that if you complain when you’ve lost it seems like it’sbecauseyou lost, he wasn’t wrong. Largie Ramazani, who had come on with five minutes to go, didn’t care,rolling in on 93.49and running off to back flip in front of the fans.View image in fullscreenLargie Ramazani takes to the air as jubilant Valencia fans watch on.Photograph: Ana Escobar/EPAThis was Valencia’s latest winning goal this century. It was also their second win a row after a run of one in 14. Last week it came on 84; now it was 10 minutes later. Seven of their last 10 games have seen them get winners or (mostly equalisers) in the last 11 minutes. “This is the kind of [win that] gives you your breath back, taking the team out of this permanent state of doubt,” Super Deporte insisted. “Sometimes salvation starts with a game like this. It’s not the end of the road but it could be the beginning.”Only they, like Levante, were not alone. In the game before, Osasuna scored via an own goal on 90.44 (and again on 93.41)to beat Rayo 3-1; last week they had defeated Oviedo on 93. If survival is about the games against direct rivals, just as Roger Federer notedthat he only won 54% of his points, then they are choosing well, scoring decisive goals after 90 minutes against Rayo, Oviedo, Mallorca and Getafe. Breathing room earned, it still isn’t done, their coach warned. “If we get cocky, you’ll take a hit: we’ve been there and it’s very hard,” Alesio Lisci said.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowLevante 3-2 Elche, Rayo Vallecano 1-3 Osasuna, Valencia 3-2 Espanyol, Sevilla 2-1 Athletic Bilbao, Villarreal 0-2 Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid 3-0 Mallorca, Barcelona 3-0 Real Oviedo, Real Sociedad 3-1 Celta Vigo, Alavés 2-1 Real BetisWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That goes for just about everyone, half the league still not safe. This was a weekend which started with Levante moving within touching distance of safety, only for safety to take a step away again; in which Sevilla beat Athletic to go alongside a 90th-minute equaliser last Monday; and in which Alavés slipped into the bottom three only to climb out again by beating Betis. One in which three different teams occupied the final relegation place and which has left four points between the 10 teams from Osasuna in ninth and the relegation zone. Three points, a single win, separates Elche in 10th and the drop, setting up a season that promises to run to the last, most beautiful minute of the final week.PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona2135522Real Madrid2128513Atletico Madrid2121444Villarreal2016415Espanyol210346Real Betis217327Celta Vigo216328Real Sociedad210279Osasuna21-12510Elche2102411Sevilla21-52412Athletic Bilbao21-102413Girona20-142414Valencia21-112315Alaves21-82216Rayo Vallecano21-112217Mallorca21-92118Getafe20-112119Levante20-101720Oviedo21-2313Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Itoje was absent from the official Six Nations championship launch in Edinburgh on Monday and is not expected to join his squad until Wednesday evening.With the tournament commencing on Thursday week every team is scrambling to be ready, but the Saracens lock has been given permission to miss the start of the training block in Girona this week.RFU targets transport revamp and undercover police to sway Twickenham residents over concert planRead more“He is in Nigeria for the funeral of his mother and we are all deeply saddened for him,” said Steve Borthwick, whose side open their campaign at home against Wales on Saturday week.“When I have talked to him I sense emotionally he has found it very tough, very challenging. I also sense from him that his family all going to Nigeria for the funeral is an important aspect for him. I know he will be looking forward to rejoining us and we look forward to having him back.”Itoje’s captaincy duties at the launch, held at the top of the Royal Mile near Edinburgh Castle, were undertaken by his longtime teammate Jamie George who, just two years ago, led England at Murrayfieldthe week after his own mother died of cancer. “We’ve spoken a lot,” he said. “The parallels are scary, really. It’s heartbreaking news. I know how much of a difficult time he’s going through.“My biggest message to him was to make sure he gives himself enough time to grieve and to process things. He’s had a good opportunity to do that and is only going to come back when he’s fully ready to give everything of himself to the squad.“He’s in Nigeria at the minute but he’ll be back ready to give all of himself to the team and be successful to make the rest of his family very proud. We’re all determined to do that for him, too.”Such situations clearly put into perspective minor details such as a game of rugby, but this year most of the teams are encountering varying degrees of untimely disruption. France, for example, have just lost their prop Uini Atonio and flanker Paul Boudehent to injuries, with the Toulouse pair Georges-Henri Colombe and Alexandre Roumat added to the squad as replacements.Ireland, who begin their campaign against France, also have worrying front-row problems, particularly at loosehead prop where Andrew Porter, Paddy McCarthy and Jack Boyle are injured, prompting a call-up for Connacht’s uncapped 20-year-old Billy Bohan. Further injuries in such a key area would be seriously problematic given the power of the French pack. As the captain, Caelan Doris, drily put it, an opening night in Paris “definitely sharpens the mind”.Antoine Dupont, similarly, has urged his players “to be ready” for their entrance next Thursday, the fixture having been brought forward to avoid a clash with the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics.The Wales captain, Dewi Lake, meanwhile, says his side will be bringing “sheer fight and will” against England, despite the uncertainty aboutthe future shape of the Welsh domestic game.Borthwick, though, is braced primarily for a barrage of high balls, suggesting the hosts are anticipating “50 kicks” from a side hoping to apply aerial pressure and feast off the scraps. Either way, the head coach will not necessarily be reshaping his entire tactical approach to suit the recently released Rugby Football Union strategic plan, which specifically urges the national team not only to be consistent major title winners “but to do so in a way that inspires future generations”.Borthwich said: “We want to win every game we go into. Very clearly we want to win the World Cup in 2027. I want the players to attack this tournament and come with an attitude to play fast and to play brave.”Bullish Borthwick tells England to target Six Nations triumph in ParisRead moreEngland, meanwhile, may split their summer tour resources to maximise their prospects of victory in their inaugural Nations Championship games in South Africa and Argentina in July. With Tests in Johannesburg and Santiago del Estero either side of a Test against Fiji scheduled to be staged in the north of England, it is possible several senior England players will head straight on to Buenos Aires rather than fly back to the UK.“It’s one of the considerations I have right now,” Borthwick said. “We are looking at how we manage that.”An England XV is also due to play a French XV in Vannes on Friday 19 June.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamMaro ItojeSix Nations 2026Six NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Our intention is to run Thursday and Friday,” the statement read.While not a major setback, it will be of concern, perhaps indicating there is still considerable work to be done on the AMR26, the first car to be designed for the team by Adrian Newey, who has also now taken over as team principal. The drivers Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll will now have at best two days between them behind the wheel in the first test.Under the ownership of Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin have invested hugely, including building an entirely new factory complex and wind tunnel at Silverstone with no little optimism that the new rules and Newey’s impact would prove a stepping stone toward the front of the grid.View image in fullscreenLiam Lawson, of Racing Bulls, on the first day of testing in Barcelona.Photograph: Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty ImagesNo reasons were given for the delay in coming to the track but, at the launch for the team’s Honda engines in Tokyo last week, senior figures at the Japanese manufacturer were expressing concern that their power unit was not where they required it to be with the season to start in Melbourne on 8 March.Seven teams did take to the track on Monday: Mercedes, Audi, Alpine, Cadillac, Racing Bulls, Haas and Red Bull. Ferrari are due to make their first laps on Tuesday and last year’s drivers’ and constructors’ champions, McLaren, have yet to confirm whether they will open their account on Tuesday or Wednesday.The test is taking place behind closed doors in Barcelona and the priority for teams is to put mileage on the cars and engines in what is being called a “shakedown” before two further tests in Bahrain. Information being released is extremely limited but it was noticeable that all seven teams did complete laps in to double figures, a strong start after such a major regulation change, with Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli clocking up more than 20 in the opening two hours.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Aston MartinFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The council also determined in October that a limit of three concerts – and only one not on a Saturday – would remain as part of its new licence amid considerable opposition from residents.Borthwick’s task is to strike the right balance with thriving England ready for takeoff | Robert KitsonRead moreOn Tuesday, the RFU will seek to convince residents at a drop-in session where new plans will be revealed. It is understood they include a revamp of Twickenham station which could double the number of passengers per train and the presence of “plain clothes officers” – including a mix of police and stewards – and the introduction of “civil enforcement officers” in an effort to tackle antisocial behaviour.The RFU intends to resubmit planning and licensing applications – after local elections have taken place in May – and is optimistic that previous hurdles can be overcome.In November the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, said: “We’ve laid out very clearly for [Richmond council] what it means for us. Those events are essential for us if we’re to reinvest in the stadium and the stadium needs reinvestment to keep pace with other stadiums. It’s not a grandstanding negotiation tactic. We need those in order to justify the investment into the stadium. They understand that. They want us to stay. And our plan A is to stay. We contribute over £90m to the local economy and well over £100m to the greater London economy. They want us to stay here but purely from a financial validity point, it’s essential we get those extra events. I’m confident.”Last year the RFU submitted written evidence to a culture, media and sport committee inquiry, citing “several millions of pounds” in lost revenue due to closures or restrictions because of engineering works, highlighting the overreliance on the rail station on matchdays. Around 38,000 spectators use Twickenham rail station – 45% of attendees – leading to road closures of up to three and a half hours after matches have finished. It is understood that only around 2% use the district and Piccadilly Tube lines from Richmond and Hounslow East, respectively. Through better education and the use of LED signage, the union is hoping to increase that to around 10%.As revealed in October, the RFU’s plans to host more concerts hit a setback when Richmond council decided to keep the limit of three a year, including, significantly, only one not on a Saturday. The most up to date planning permission also allows for only three a year but does not restrict on what days of the week they can be. Sweeney has previously lamented how “we could have had Beyoncé but she wanted three nights and we are only allowed two nights consecutively”.View image in fullscreenEngland fans at a crowded Twickenham station which the RFU hopes to ease with upgrades and new queueing plansPhotograph: PA Images/AlamyAt the licensing subcommittee meeting, 192 representations were heard against the RFU’s proposal, 13 in favour. Much of the opposition centres around antisocial behaviour and,as revealed previously, the RFU has gone as far to suggest the use of “anti-pee paint”, which would leave public offenders “covered in their own urine”. Introducing undercover officers is an attempt to further tackle antisocial behaviour, while there are also plans to use temporary barriers in local alleyways to prevent unauthorised access and to ensure fixed penalty notices are issued to offenders.The RFU’s application is running in two parallel parts: licensing and planning. In effect, the union failed with its licensing application while in its exploratory planning application, Richmond council determined that further investigation was needed, in the main due to transport concerns. The RFU is seeking to address those concerns with an overhaul of the queueing system at Twickenham rail station which could shorten the length of road closures, better dialogue with South West Trains and more efficient use of other transport networks before resubmitting its applications.The union is frustrated that venues such as Wembley and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium are able to stage lucrative concerts because of looser restrictions on non-sporting events.Sweeney has previously hinted that the RFU could leave Twickenhamand move to either Milton Keynes or Birmingham if the union does not get its wish over more concerts.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionRugby Football UnionEngland rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Keys’s performance, she said, had prompted her to predict accurately to their mutual friends thatKeys would win the Australian Opentwo weeks later.It is normal for players to discuss future opponents, but they do not usually do so in conversation together. With a chuckle, Keys said: “Jess is like, ‘I hope I don’t see that level [tomorrow].’”Iva Jovic walking in Venus Williams’ footsteps with Melbourne quarter-final dateRead moreShe did not. Keys’s time here came to a difficult end in the fourth round as the defending champion and ninth seed was crushed under the weight of her hefty unforced error count and a spotless performance from Pegula, the sixth seed, who marched into the quarter-finals with a 6-3, 6-4 win.This was, in some ways, a historic match on Rod Laver Arena: the first grand slam singles match between two podcast co-hosts.Keys and Pegula, one year apart at 30 and 31 years old respectively, are close friends who have known each other for nearly two decades. Although this was only their fourth WTA meeting, with the head‑to‑head now 2-2, they have trained together hundreds of times. Last August, they converted their friendship and success into a podcast,The Player’s Box, which they co-host alongside the 2021 Australian Open finalist Jennifer Brady and Desirae Krawczyk, a four-time mixed doubles slam champion.Women’s tennis is known for its fierce competitiveness, which can lead to unfriendly relations between some of its top players. This is part of the sport’s attraction for many fans, the understanding that players will fight desperately in matches without fear of offending their adversaries.This matchup, however, is reflective of the friendlier side of the sport and it is impressive how some can compartmentalise their friendships, fighting fiercely during their matches but not allowing the outcome to affect their personal relationships.View image in fullscreenMadison Keys had a tough day on the court facing her friend and compatriot Jessica Pegula.Photograph: Daniel Kopatsch/Getty Images“As players, it’s not that deep,” Pegula said. “We’ve been doing it for so long. We could be friends and laughing till the moment we walk on the court. Then in that moment we both want to win and we both are competitors. We’re going to do whatever we can to get the W. The moment it’s over, you’re back to being friends.”The buildup to this match has been particularly amusing. After their third-round victories, Keys and Pegula came up with forfeits for whoever lost. Pegula, whose billionaire family owns the Buffalo Bills NFL team, would have had to wear a Kansas City Chiefs jersey with the names of Travis Kelce and his fiancee, Taylor Swift, on the back if she had lost.Unfortunately for Keys, once she digests the end of her title defence, she will have to eat apple pie with melted cheddar cheese on top, a dessert enjoyed by the Pegula family. “She tried to make it sound like it was the most normal thing ever and we were all just disgusted. She tried to double down and said: ‘No, it’s amazing,’” Keys said.The latest Player’s Box episode was scheduled to be filmed on Sunday afternoon, long before they realised they might be playing each other. The two discussed the origin of their friendship and the different paths they took in their formative years, but they also gave their thoughts on the match ahead.View image in fullscreenWith the match over Jessica Pegula and Madison Keys quickly went from rivals back to friends.Photograph: Rob Prezioso/AAPIt included some light trash talk. At one point, Keys described watching videos of Pegula to scout her game: “You missed a hack slice forehand and you were so annoyed. I was like, ‘ha-ha’.”The moment they stepped on the court, all jokes came to an end. It was clear from the beginning that Keys was completely off, unable to play freely through her tension. Although she can blow anyone off the court with the force of her serve and ground strokes, she also regularly beats herself. This match showcased the worst of Keys, who took wild cuts at the ball and sprayed unforced errors from all parts of the courts.Home hope De Minaur destroys Bublik at Australian Open to set up Alcaraz showdownRead moreWhile her opponent floundered, Pegula was tidy and polished as ever. She returned Keys’s devastating serve with depth and consistency, she took the ball early and forced Keys into difficult positions by deflecting her pace and moving the ball well. Most of all, she offered Keys few mistakes, striking 13 unforced errors to Keys’s count of 28. In the first set, she hit four.Pegula has not dropped a set here. Now a nine-time grand slam quarter-finalist, she continues to put herself in contention for the big titles with regular deep runs. In this incredibly competitive period at the top, however, her greatest challenge is converting her consistency into a grand slam triumph.The contest ended with a 14th miserable forehand unforced error from Keys, which elicited a rare bark of “c’mon’” from a typically placid Pegula.By the time they walked up to the net, though, the two had already ceased viewing their opponent as an adversary. They greeted each other with smiles and embraced in a warm hug before departing as friends again.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenTennisAustralia sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the next play, Darnold connected with Jake Bobo for a 17-yard touchdown.Darnold, who struggled in his playoff debut last season with the Minnesota Vikings, played through an oblique injury and completed 25 of 36 passes for 346 yards with no turnovers. Jaxon Smith-Njigba had 153 yards receiving and a touchdown on 10 catches.“I told my team, I’m going to do whatever it takes. Whatever y’all ask of me, I’m gonna get it done, whatever that might be,” said Smith-Njigba, the NFL’s leading receiver in the regular season. “And that’s what you saw today. You just saw grit, determination, you saw passion out there and you saw a group, a collective, going out there and getting the job done.”The Seahawks led 31-20 late in the third quarter on Darnold’s 13-yard TD pass to Cooper Kupp, but the Rams got back into the game when Seahawks cornerback Riq Woolen was flagged for taunting after breaking up a pass to Nacua on third-and-12, giving Los Angeles a first down. On the next play, Stafford threw at Woolen again, and Nacua beat him in the corner of the end zone for a 34-yard touchdown.The Rams forced a punt on Seattle’s next possession and went on a 14-play, 84-yard drive that came up empty thanks to Witherspoon’s pass breakup.Seattle stayed aggressive on three final possession, with Darnold throwing for three first downs to run out most of the clock.Davante Adams and Kyren Williams had receiving TDs for the Rams, and Kenneth Walker III rushed for a score for the Seahawks.Explore more on these topicsNFLLos Angeles RamsSeattle SeahawksWest CoastUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

With many people now pushing for teenagers to be kept off tech platforms, her father explains why he backs a different approachMon 26 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareIan Russell describes his life as being split into two parts: before and after 20 November 2017, the day his youngest daughter, Molly, took her own life as a result of depression and negative social media content. “Our life before Molly’s death was very ordinary. Unremarkable,” he says. He was a television producer and director, married with three daughters. “We lived in an ordinary London suburb, in an ordinary semi-detached house, the children went to ordinary schools.” The weekend before Molly’s death, they had a celebration for all three girls’ birthdays, which are in November. One was turning 21, another 18 and Molly was soon to be 15. “And I remember being in the kitchen of a house full of friends and family and thinking, ‘This is so good. I’ve never been so happy,’” he says. “That was on a Saturday night and the following Tuesday morning, everything was different.”The second part of Russell’s life has been not only grief and trauma, but also a commitment to discovering and exposing the truth about the online content that contributed to Molly’s death, and campaigning to prevent others falling prey to the same harms. Both elements lasted far longer than he anticipated. It took nearly five years to get enough information out of social media companies foran inquest to concludethat Molly died “from an act of self-harm while suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content”. As for the campaigning, theMolly Rose Foundationprovides support, conducts research and raises awareness of online harms, and Russell has been an omnipresent spokesperson on these issues.He has been busier than ever lately. We meet at a London hotel, a few hours before the House of Lords vote on an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill that would ban access to social media for under-16s. The amendment was expected to pass – and it did, by 261 votes to 150. Keir Starmer’s government is in favour of a consultation, and a pause to see howAustralia’s trailblazingunfolds. But a UK ban has had widespread support, from Conservatives, includingKemi Badenoch, as well as more than60 Labour MPs,bereaved relativesof children whose deaths were social media-related, celebrities, campaign groups and, it seems, the public – aYouGov poll in Decemberfound that 74% of British adults were in favour.Russell, however, is not in favour of such a ban. Last Sunday he co-signed a joint statement, alongside the NSPCC, Full Fact, the 5 Rights Foundation and others,arguing that“blanket bans on social media would fail to deliver the improvement in children’s safety and wellbeing that they so urgently need”.View image in fullscreenIan Russell, photographed at the Zetter Clerkenwell.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAn inconvenient split seems to have opened up, at a time when online harms and social media companies are finally in the spotlight. But if anyone has spent time weighing up this issue, it’s Russell, and he doesn’t seem like someone looking for controversy. “As a person, I need to gather information and process it before I can come to a conclusion,” he says. “I often find myself at meetings hearing what’s being said, and it can be difficult to contribute because I haven’t formed my opinions yet.” But on this issue he’s firm in his conviction, even if others find it difficult to understand. “We’re in danger of trying to move too fast and trying to find quick-fix solutions,” he says. “If there were quick-fix solutions, honestly, we would have found them.”The core arguments laid out by Russell and other opponents of a ban will be familiar to followers of this debate: that children will seek more dangerous alternatives; that they will find ways to circumvent age limits; that they will face a “cliff edge” when they turn 16 and are thrown into the “high-risk” world of social media; that some groups, such as LGBTQ+ and neurodiverse children, will be deprived of valuable online sources of support and connection.But Russell’s position also hinges onthe Online Safety Act, which is just starting to do what it’s supposed to, he argues. The legislation, passed in 2023, obliges online platforms to conduct robust age verification and prevent harmful content reaching children. It also gives the government and Ofcom, the independent media regulator, powers to fine or even take down platforms not playing by the rules. Molly’s death, and Russell’s campaigning, helped push the act through.Russell admits progress has been slow. “It took five years of parliamentary debate to put the Online Safety Act on the books. It’s taken Ofcom more than two years, but they are now implementing and enforcing that act. It’s too long, but we have literally just arrived at a place, after all that time, when the platforms, in order to operate in the UK, if their services are likely to be used by children, have to take steps to ensure the safety of those children.”The recent furore overElon Musk’s X and Grokis a good illustration, he says. The integration of Grok AI tools that could manipulate images of women, and even children, to remove their clothing, into X – effectively making a tool for creating deepfake child sexual abuse images widely available – horrified pretty much everyone, Russell included. “I don’t understand how X and Elon Musk can even begin to think that that was acceptable,” he says. “Hideous, wrong, disgraceful. But what was the reaction in the UK to that?” After the issue became known, Ofcomopened a formal investigation into X, acting under the powers of the Online Safety Act. Starmer and technology secretary Liz Kendall said they would support Ofcom if it chose to fine or block ​X. Within days, Muskmade a U-turnand removed the software from his platform.View image in fullscreenMolly Russell at 11.Photograph: The Russell familyThe Online Safety Act did what a social media ban couldn’t, Russell argues. “If a platform is behaving in an appalling, unsatisfactory, abysmally unsafe manner, it shouldn’t be in this country … A ban [for under-16s] removes the impetus to do that. In fact, what it’s likely to do is have a really chilling effect on the Online Safety Act.”He’s not arguing that the legislation is perfect –X was still allowing some usersto post sexualised images generated by Grok after Musk’s U-turn, it took weeks for Ofcom to act, and X escaped censure for what many still consider an egregious offence – “but it’s there to be built on. You don’t get anything right the first time … You also have to accept that the development of tech moves so fast, you’re going to constantly have to be amending it and looking at it and updating it. We have to be thinking ahead of the tech crowd.”A common argument in favour of a social media ban for under-16s is the alcohol analogy. We don’t sanction selling alcohol to minors because it is potentially harmful. Sure, some kids might find a way around it, like getting a fake driving licence, but as a society we’ve put down a marker that you have to be a certain age to drink. Shouldn’t it be the same with social media?Russell is in favour of regulation, but says it should be sensible and proportionate. He counters with another offline analogy: cars and road traffic. “There will be casualties. It’s sad and tragic when it happens, and we accept that. We don’t say: children under 16 shouldn’t ride in cars to protect them. We say children under 12 should always be in a car seat. We say that everyone in a car, however old, should wear a seatbelt. The industry is compelled to comply with safety measures … We don’t blanket ban 16-year-olds from road travel.”We do ban them from driving though, I point out. “I’m not saying we should let 16-year-olds on platforms that encourage irresponsible behaviour. I’m saying we should let 16-year-olds on platforms that are safe for 16-year-olds.”Age classification should be on a platform-by-platform basis, in Russell’s view: “If there was a platform that was really safe, really good, and connected people and did all the good things that social media could do, we could say 13 is fine.” Some other platforms might be rated 16 or 18, say. “If you were to differentiate like that, you would then drive platforms who wanted to attract younger people [to] start inventing safer things.”Some might say social media companies have had every chance to do this already. Instead, despite having been repeatedly confronted with evidence of the harms they have caused, they have routinely denied and evaded accountability, and even scaled down their internal checks and balances. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, apologised to parents of social media victims at a Senate hearing in January 2024, but a year later, following Donald Trump’s re-election, he announced that Instagram, Facebook and Threads would begetting rid of factcheckers, even if, he admitted, “it means we’re gonna catch less bad stuff”.View image in fullscreenIan Russell outside Barnet coroner’s court after the inquest into Molly’s death, September 2022.Photograph: Joshua Bratt/PA“I don’t trust the platforms at all,” Russell agrees. “You certainly can’t judge a social media platform by what it says; you can only judge by what it does.” And again, he argues, the Online Safety Act is a better weapon to keep them in line. “If you’ve got an effective regulator and strong regulation, then you could go, ‘You’re not doing what you’re telling us you’re doing. You’re not living up to your risk assessment. You’ve got three months to fix it, or you’re out.’ That’s the sort of thing that will make a difference.”Russell has good reason not to trust the platforms, especiallyMeta. After Molly’s death, Russell and his family were shocked and confused, until they began to look into her online activity. “We discovered, in a really painful way, because we could see it in her social media accounts, the content that had been fed to her by the platforms.” The feedback loop of the algorithm had served her more and more disturbing content: graphic images and videos relating to suicide, self-harm and depression, often set to music, flashing slogans like “Fat. Ugly. Worthless. Suicidal.” Even a consultant psychiatrist at the inquest into Molly’s death said that they’d had trouble sleeping after viewing it. “That discovery of this awful, nihilistic world in which she was drip-fed largely black-and-white, depressive content, that led her to the place where she thought that the only way forward was to end her life, was horrifying,” Russell says.Initially, they reported their findings toInstagram, he recalls. “We thought that they’d say, ‘Thank you for reporting this horrible content. We’ll take it down.’” Instead they received replies along the lines of “this doesn’t infringe our community guidelines”.Getting a complete picture of Molly’s online activity was a long, difficult, painful process. Cooperation from the tech companies was minimal, but Andrew Walker, the senior coroner at the inquest, was tenacious.Pinterest, which had algorithmically sent harmful content to Molly, complied. Twitter (now X) allowed Russell to download the data from Molly’s account, which wasn’t that helpful without the background context. Meta initially supplied tens of thousands of pages of data, which was all but unsearchable. After more demands, delays and ultimatums, eventually, five years after Molly’s death, Meta found an additional 50 lever-arch files of evidence. “Within that evidence was some of the most harmful content that Molly had seen, which completed the picture.” In her final six months, Molly had been exposed to 2,100 pieces of harmful content on Instagram alone. There were only 12 days in that period when she doesn’t seem to have interacted with harmful content on the platform.A new documentary premiering next month,Molly vs The Machines, combines verbatim reconstructions of moments from the inquest (such as when one Meta executive disputed whether the content Molly was consuming was really harmful at all) and interviews with Russell and Molly’s schoolfriends with a broader critique of big tech and surveillance capitalism: infinite scrolling, engagement-seeking algorithms, misinformation, polarisation – this is not just a problem for teenagers, Russell points out. “There’s an online harm working at the global level, and there’s an online harm working at the personal level that Molly experienced. The two are so interconnected, and we need to collectively work to pull that together.”View image in fullscreenRussell in Molly vs The Machines.Photograph: Publicity imageThe fact that this debate has become polarised is, if not a direct consequence, then at least a reflection of how social media tends to drag every subject to its extremes. The politicisation of the issue is equally unhelpful in this regard: the Lords amendment (which now returns to the House of Commons for consideration) was led by the Tories, and is being seen as a defeat for Starmer’s government. Lady Kidron described Starmer’s stance as “the very epitome of party before country”.But Russell is all for finding middle ground. “I know it will suit many people to divide the cake and say there’s pro-ban and there’s anti-ban. And they can try to set us against each other if they want, and that might work in some cases. In my case, I’ll never be against anyone; I always want to hear their arguments. The division shouldn’t be there; the division should be: people who want the world to be safer for children; and technology companies who are absolutely uncaring of that and caring of their profits – that’s where the dividing line is.”On a personal level, can Russell imagine reaching a point where he’ll think his work is done? “I’ve always wanted to just get on with my very ordinary life and remember Molly fondly. But sadly, I don’t see that happening anytime soon, because this is a global problem.” He has tried to keep his life and career as ordinary and unchanged as it was, “so there was something familiar in that second part of my life after Molly’s death.” Russell’s work and his grief are inevitably intertwined. There’s not a day he doesn’t think about her, he says. “Some days, that can invigorate you and it can be tremendously powerful and comforting. And other days it can absolutely stop you in your steps and you can barely bring yourself to come out the door. As time goes on, the harder days are fewer.”Molly vs The Machines will be in cinemas Nationwide on 1 March and will be coming to Channel 4Explore more on these topicsOnline abuseThe big interviewGrok AIXElon MuskFacebookInstagramPinterestinterviewsShareReuse this content"

US businesses reported similar gains, but created more jobs than they cut.It suggests UK workers are being hit particularly hard by the rise of AI, as higher costs and taxes also weigh on the job market.Unemployment is at afour-year high, as rises in the minimum wage and employer national insurance contributions squeeze hiring.More than a quarterof UK workers are now worried their jobs could disappear completelyin the next five years due to AI, a survey by the international recruitment company Randstad found.Younger workers, particularly thosein gen Z, were most concerned about the impact of AI and their ability to adapt, while baby boomers – born in the postwar years between 1946 and 1964 and nearing the end of their careers – showed greater self-assurance.The businesses surveyed by Morgan Stanley said they were most likely to cut early-career jobs, requiring two to five years of experience in the UK.Earlier this month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warned that AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.In his annual Mansion House speech, Khan said London is “at the sharpest edge of change” because of its reliance on white-collar workers in the finance and creative industries, and professional services such as law, accounting, consulting and marketing.Khan argued that “we have a moral, social and economic duty to act” to ensure that new jobs are created to replace those that will disappear, with entry-level and junior jobs the first to go.Last week Jamie Dimon, the boss of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have tostep in to help workerswhose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)EconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Grok AI generated about3m sexualised images in less than two weeks, including 23,000 that appeared to depict children, according to researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate.The commission said its investigation would “assess whether the company properly assessed and mitigated risks” stemming from Grok’s functionalities in the EU, including risks on the sharing of illegal content such as manipulated sexually explicit images and “content that may amount to” child sexual abuse material.The investigation has been launched under the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), a relatively new piece of legislation that is intended to protect internet users from a wide range of harms.Speaking to reporters, an official said the commission had not been convinced by mitigating measures put in place by X to remedy the issue.After the initial outcry over the manipulated images, the company restricted access to the tool to paid subscribers, but changed tack under pressure from European regulators. It announced earlier this month that it had introduced measures to prevent Grok from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothes.A commission official said the measures did not take away broader concerns about Grok. The investigation is looking at the systemic risks of the generation of illegal content, including content depicting violence against women and child sexual abuse material. X did not have “effective mitigating measures … to reduce the risk on their platform”, they said.Announcing the investigation, Henna Virkkunen, the commission’s top official for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said: “Non-consensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation. With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens – including those of women and children – as collateral damage of its service.”As well as the investigation into explicit images, the commission is extending an inquiry launched in December 2023 into X’s so-called recommender systems in view of the company’s announcement to move to a Grok-based model for filtering information and content to users.The move comes after the UK media watchdog Ofcomannounced its own investigationearlier this month into “vile” and illegal content on X.The commission has been widely criticised for being too slow in enforcing the DSA, especially in relation to X.“The investigation comes too late, but can still send a clear signal that platforms have to comply with European law,” the German Green MEP Alexandra Geese said. “This case is clear-cut. The damage to millions of women and many children is irreparable. We hope that the commission will use this learning to act quicker in the future.”EU officials have rejected such criticism, pointing to 15 ongoing inquiries under the DSA, which has applied to companies since February 2024.Regina Doherty, a centre-right Irish vice-president of the European parliament, said she welcomed the formal investigation. “When credible reports emerge of AI systems being used in ways that harm women and children, it is essential that EU law is examined and enforced without delay,” Doherty said.In response to the investigation, X provided a link to a statement it published on 14 January: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.”Thecommissionfined X €120mlast month for breaking EU law. The platform had deceived users, obstructed independent researchers and evaded accountability,” it said.The EU regulator said X gave “deceptive” blue tick badges to accounts without verification, potentially exposing users to scams and deception by malicious actors. X also broke EU legal requirements on transparency over advertising by hindering researchers from investigating fake ads and hybrid threat campaigns.Musk replied “bullshit” to a commission post announcing the fine and later called for the EU to be abolished.The company was given three months to pay the fine. An EU official said they were confident the penalty would be paid.Explore more on these topicsGrok AIElon MuskXAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingInternetEuropean CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

The bill is one of at least three statewide moratoriums on datacenters introduced in state legislatures in the last week asMarylandandOklahomalawmakers are also considering similar measures.But it isGeorgiathat is quickly becoming ground zero in the fight against untrammelled growth of datacenters – which are notorious for using huge amounts of energy and water – as they power the emerging industry of artificial intelligence.The Georgia bill seeks to halt all such projects until March of next year “to allow state, county and municipal-level officials time to set necessary policies for regulating datacenters … which permanently alter the landscape of our state”, said bill sponsor state Democratic legislator Ruwa Romman.It comes at a time when Georgia’s public service commission – the agency that oversees utility company Georgia Power –just last monthapproved a plan to provide 10 additional gigawatts of energy in the coming years. It was the largest amount of electricity sought for a multi-year plan in the commission’s history, was driven by datacenters and will mostly be supplied by fossil fuels.The 10-gigawatt plan – enough to power about 8.3m homes – in turn comes as the Atlanta metro arealed the nationin datacenter construction in 2024.This accelerated growth has already led at least 10 Georgia municipalities to pass their own moratoriums on datacenter construction, with Atlanta suburb Roswell becoming the most recentearlier this month.Municipalities in at least 14 states have done the same, according toTech Policy Press.Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent democratic socialist senator, proposed a national moratoriumlast month.“What we’re seeing is, as communities are learning more about this aggressive industry’s presence … [they] want to have time to thoroughly investigate all potential harms,” said Seth Gladstone, spokesperson forFood and Water Watch.The rampant development of datacenters to power AI raises several concerns for residents and activists alike. One is their impact on the cost of electricity. “In the public’s mind, datacenters and utility bills are inextricably linked,” said Charles Hua, founder and executive director ofPowerLines,an organization that works on lowering utility bills and involving communities in decisions about energy.Hua noted that the relationship between the two varies, depending on each state’s market and regulatory system. In Georgia, he said, the Georgia Power utility company makes profit off new capital investments – so it has incentive to keep building new power plants. This approach has led Georgia’s rates to go up by a third in the last several years alone. Meanwhile, he said, the power company doesn’t have incentive to make the electrical grid more efficient – which “could actually lower prices”, Hua said.But datacenter concerns in Georgia also include water use and lost tax revenue. Republicans in the state legislature have introduced bills this year toprotect consumersfrom increases in their utility bills and toend tax breaksfor the centers. A Democrat has proposed that datacenters make public how muchenergy and waterthey use each year.Romman is also running for governor. If elected, she would become the first Palestinian American elected to statewide office in Georgia and break the near quarter-century hold Republicans have on the office.Her bill,HB 1012, has a Republican co-sponsor in state representative Jordan Ridley, who said he signed onto the measure because he wanted to give local governments time to develop zoning regulations on datacenters, since “it seems like they’re being built across the state”.“Every local government has zoning codes and … they need public input. That takes time,” Ridley said. At the same time, Ridley added, “datacenters … provide tax revenue and high-paying jobs. I’m not against datacenters.”Romman’s bill is not just a policy proposal; it’s also a political one. In a statement, she wrote that the moratorium “would provide time for Georgians to vote on the majority of the Public Service Commission seats who make final decisions on energy-related projects”.Georgia is one of 10 states that elect their utility regulators. Voters in the state elected progressive Democrats Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard to the five-member commission in November, leading the agency to lose its all-Republican makeup for the first time in nearly two decades. Another seat is up for a vote this November.The calculus: if the commission becomes majority-Democratic, it will no longer give a rubber stamp to electricity demands from Georgia Power driven by tech companies seeking to build datacenters.Hubbard, now in his new position, recently wrotean editorialasserting that Georgia voters “see data centers receiving tax breaks as their power bills go up. They see local communities struggle with competition for water supplies and high voltage transmission lines that reduce property values. And they see how the PSC approved every request placed before it by the monopoly electric utility.“This is why opposition to data centers is growing in Georgia; because Georgians oppose being treated as collateral damage by the unregulated growth of data centers that will push their power bills even higher.”There’s another political implication to Romman’s bill. Paul Glaze, spokesperson forGeorgia Conservation Voters, said if the bill crosses from the House to the Senate, “it may be a preview of the potential general election” later this year.“The question is, in communities where datacenters are coming, who are voters going to trust to have their back?” Glaze said. “Anyone serious about statewide office should have a clear position on this.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)GeorgiaComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

However, 58% of secondary school pupils reported phones being used without permission in some lessons, rising to 65% among key stage four pupils.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told the BBC school leaders “need support from government, not the threat of heavy-handed inspection”.The move comes as ministers consult on introducing an Australian-style social media ban for under-16s in the UK. Options include raising the digital age of consent and restricting potentially addictive app design features such as “streaks” and “infinite scrolling”.Ministers will visit Australia, where a bancame into force in December. The government will seek views from parents and young people and will respond in the summer, according to DSIT.Last week, the House of Lords backed a Conservative-led amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill that proposed such a ban, despite it not being supported by the government.While ministers’ plans to bring forward legislation mean the amendment is unlikely to survive in the Commons, its passage in the upper chamber has increased pressure on the prime minister to act more quickly and decisively. Keir Starmer is understood to want to wait for evidence from Australia’s ban.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsMobile phonesConsumer affairsPrimary schoolsSecondary schoolsTeachingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.Synthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.The company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.The startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.Synthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such asOpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.Synthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.The $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.Synthesia was founded in 2017 by the two Danish nationals, as well as the computer scientists Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito.Last year, the London mayor said Synthesia was doing “incredibly well” as he opened its new offices. However, ina speech this monthKhan said AI would “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” if used recklessly, as intelligent, autonomous systems proved cheap replacements for humans.Tjerrild said he believed AI would enable businesses to hire more staff. “We’re an AI-first company, we have 600 employees and we hired 40% more people last year,” he said. “As a business owner myself, if my employees become more productive that means I can invest and hire more people.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Technology startupsTechnology sectorComputingVenture capitalnewsShareReuse this content"

So I’m creating a home for it: MothershipMon 26 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTShareWhether you’re reading about the impending AI bubble bursting or about the video game industry’s mass layoffs and cancelled projects, 2026 does not feel like a hopeful time for gaming. What’s more, games journalists – as well as all other kinds of journalists – have been losing their jobs at alarming rates, making it difficult to adequately cover these crises. Donald Trump’s White House, meanwhile, is usingvideo game memesas ICE recruitment tools, and game studios arebacking away fromdiversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the wider world’s slide to the right.The manosphereis back, and we’ve lostmainstream feminist websites such as Teen Vogue; bigots everywhere are celebrating what they see as the death of “woke”. Put it all together and we have a dismal stew of doom for someone like me, a queer woman and a feminist who’s been a games journalist and critic since 2007.Everything I just listed off in that paragraph speaks to an urgent need for something different. This is why I’m launching a gender and identity-focused gaming publication called Mothership. It’s independent and worker-owned; it will rely on subscribers’ support to exist. Mothership will focus on reporting on the good and bad of modern-day game-making – alongside investigations, reviews, criticism, and historical deep dives into games and developers who paved the way to now. It will be a website for people who read the news with dread, including gaming news, and worry thatGamergaters got what they always wanted. And it will be a place for readers who wish there was something like a Teen Vogue, but for games (and without a corporate owner to kneecap it).After all, the last two decades have seen a lot of actual, valuable change, and modern games are evidence of that. We exist, now, in a gaming world with more female characters, more non-binary characters, more queer characters, and more characters who don’t fall into rigidly defined gender stereotypes. TheGDC State of the Game Industry survey for 2025found that 66% of surveyed game developers were male, compared with75% in 2020, and 94% in 2009.More people than ever can now see themselves reflected in game characters, and more diverse development teams are creating them. But change has not come easy – and we’ve seen a lot of backlash to this progress. Few websites still in existence are able to cover this backlash while also keeping their reporters safe and motivated to continue.I have dreamed of founding a website like this for a long time; it’s not as if readers haven’t wanted it before now. The problem I saw with the idea was not that people wouldn’t want it, but rather that I didn’t see a good way to pay for it. Journalism has been facing a monetisation crisis since the advent of the internet. It’s hard to convince readers to pay for something they are used to getting for free.But I know the readers are there. In the mid-2010s, I worked for a small “geek girl” feminist website called the Mary Sue, and it was a unique pleasure to write very specific articles for a very specific audience. The Mary Sue relied on advertising income, which meant that all of us had to write up to six articles every weekday; there wasn’t time to spend on investigative reporting, for example, or long-form critical essays. I’m still proud of what we achieved, despite the intensity of those working conditions, not to mention the amount of harassment we faced just for existing. But I always dreamed of working for a place that had the same editorial remit without the harsh working conditions and quotas.Later, I left the Mary Sue and went on to work for Kotaku and then Polygon, both huge games websites where I was writing for broader audiences, rather than the hyper-specific one we catered to at the Mary Sue. As I watched many smaller games websites crumble over the course of the 2010s and 20s, I figured this was the only type of games website that was going to survive. The idea of working for a small, feminist games website – my dream – increasingly looked like an impossible speck of starlight in a far-off galaxy.View image in fullscreenThe logo for Mothership, a newly launched feminist games website.Photograph: Mothership Media LLCBut then, in the summer of 2025, my then-employer Polygon underwent amass layoff and acquisition. We went from a staff of 42 people to just eight. After a particularly disheartening video call with our website’s new owners, I realised I was going to have to quit. Every piece of the dream felt well and truly dead. I had not got into journalism to be taken advantage of by people who saw me and my colleagues as so easily replaceable as to be barely human.Another one of my colleagues at Polygon – Zoe Hannah, games editor – quit as well, for similar reasons. She hit me up with an idea she had for a feminist games website. “You should do it,” I told her. And then I sat there for a moment and thought about it. No,weshould do it! This was what I had wanted to do, before the industry had transformed me into someone so gnarled and jaded that I no longer believed it was even possible.Six months on, after many DMs with former colleagues from Polygon, the Mary Sue and Kotaku, plus other notable writers who’ve covered gender and identity in games – Zoe and I are launching Mothership together, today. We have had the benefit of advice and inspiration from many other independent, worker-owned outlets that have come before us, such asDefector,the Flytrap, andAftermath. Already, we’ve surpassed 1,200 paid subscribers. (Iknewthe readers were there.) And we don’t need millions of them. Mothership is a publication for a very specific audience: the people whodon’tfit the mould of the masculine, hardcore gamer image that marketing and pop culture have been dishing out since the 90s. We want to serve this audience well.I believe our website is a necessity in our current political climate. It should have existed before, when I and millions of other girls who grew up playing games were made to feel out of place by media and advertising that was laser-focused on teenage boys. But it’s not too late for me to make sure it exists now.Explore more on these topicsGamesDigital mediaGame cultureWomenFeminismGendercommentShareReuse this content"

The US must be rescued from Trump’s authoritarianismMon 26 Jan 2026 14.02 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 18.26 ESTShareFollowing the fatalshootingearlier this month of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, his colleagues received reassurance that they continued to enjoy “federal immunity” for their actions. “Anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony,” the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller,had previously stated. “No city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator or domestic insurrectionist can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties.”Words have consequences. Ms Good, a US citizen and mother of three children, had in fact been attempting to drive away from a protest in Minneapolis, where ICE’s deportation snatch squads have terrorised migrants and those who have attempted to defend their rights. On Saturday, in the same city, the same quasi-paramilitary force was responsible for a second shocking death. Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, wasshotmultiple times in the back after being wrestled to the ground and pepper-sprayed.Mobile phone footage demonstrates that Mr Pretti, like Ms Good, represented no threat. Contrary to scurrilousclaimsby senior members of the Trump administration, he was holding a phone, not a gun, before he was overpowered. His killing, which occurred after he attempted to assist a fellow protester who was being manhandled, amounted to a summary street execution by security forces. As anger erupted across Minneapolis, federal officers then reportedlypreventedstate investigators from accessing the scene of the shooting.As Trumpism seeks to impose a new authoritarian reality on the United States, Mr Pretti’s brutal death feels like a moment of reckoning. Pledges to shut down the US’s southern border, and to deport undocumented migrants, undoubtedly played a part in winning Donald Trump a second term. But the US president’s determination to wage urban warfare with a force that resembles a secret police – and his indifference to the law as he does so – is generating a widespread backlash that includes at least some of his own supporters. In a recent New York Timespoll, almost two-thirds of respondents said they disapproved of ICE tactics.Amid the growing public outrage, and with treacherous midterm elections due in November, some senior Republicans have begun to sense which way the wind is blowing. Some are nowdemandinga proper investigation into Mr Pretti’s killing, and the future funding of ICE has been brought into question. Mr Trump, having initially described Mr Pretti as a “gunman”, has sincestatedthat his administration was “reviewing everything” regarding his death.It would, of course, be foolish to place any faith in these words. Shortly before Mr Pretti was killed, it was widelyreportedthat an FBI agent had resigned after being blocked from investigating the shooting of Ms Good on 7 January. But Republican unease and burgeoning nationwide protests suggest that Saturday’s tragedy could yet function as a cross-party wake-up call if Congress can summon up the moral courage to act.With impunity, masked agents have acted with lethal and lawless violence inMinneapolis. With the connivance of the White House, their actions have been defended with assertions that most of the country has been able to see are false. In such a dark moment for democracy in the US, a different, decent America must now find ways and means to reassert itself.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But nation states in the Americas have spent more time with open borders than closedMon 26 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 12.02 ESTShareLate last year, Donald Trump’s White House published a newNational Security Strategy(NSS) outlining its vision for the world. At the time, the plan raised alarm fordismissing European alliances(now largely confirmed after Trumpthreatened Nato alliesoverGreenland), previewinginterventions in Latin America(also largely confirmed by recent military action inVenezuela), and aligning closely with the priorities of theKremlin.The document alsodemonizes immigrants. In one widely cited passage, it even claims that “unchecked migration” has gotten so out of control that Europe is facing imminent “civilizational erasure”. On these grounds, the plan makes ending “The Era of Mass Migration” a top priority for the US.It is one of the great marvels of our time that, in a world where governmentsspend more on border securitythan ever before, buildmore miles of border fencingthan ever before, deploy moremilitary-grade technologyto stop migration than ever before, spend more ondetention and deportationthan ever before, and knowingly causethousands of preventable deathsevery year by cutting off safe routes to migrate, people in power can look at the disastrous consequences of this system and unironically proclaim: “You know what our problem is? Open borders!”This is essentially what the NSS is saying, though, to be fair, it did not originate this marvel of modern absurdity. During the Biden administration, for example, afterarrests at the borderhit record highs,deportations spiked, and recordnumbers of asylum seekerspiled into overcrowded shelters and hotels (de facto detention centers since they werenot allowed to legally workor otherwise participate freely into society), a Republican senator from my home state of Texas whined that all of this amounted to a “radical experiment in open borders”. Not to be outdone, hisDemocratic opponentat the time made similar claims.The global rule of law is not collapsing – Trump is the lone problem and he can be defeated | Simon TisdallRead moreThe NSS still distinguishes itself, however, by applying this inverted way of thinking far beyond the Biden years, even to the point of making sweeping generalizations about the history of nations. As a historian of border policy, I find this part of the NSS particularly noteworthy.You can find thepassage in questionat the bottom of page 11, where the NSS blames “unchecked” migration for a host of social problems including: straining domestic resources, distorting labor markets, increasing crime, weakening social cohesion, and undermining national security. Rather than attempt to explain how immigration causes these problems, however, the argument looks for evidence in a curious reinterpretation of the past. To quote: “Throughout history, sovereign nations prohibited uncontrolled migration and granted citizenship only rarely to foreigners, who also had to meet demanding criteria. The West’s experience over the past decades vindicates this enduring wisdom.”To be clear, this version of history is nonsensical.My own researchexamines how nation states in the Americas have actually spent more time with open borders than with closed. In Latin America, many countries passed affirmative declarations protecting the right to immigrate, often going as far as to enshrine these rights in constitutions. In Central America, for example, the constitution of 1824 declared the entire region a “Sacred Asylum for all.” Far from viewing unimpeded migration as a threat to the national project, Central American policymakers proudly used open borders as a way to demonstrate the sovereignty of the newly formed government.In the US, open borders were more of a default policy born out of the absence of legal restrictions, but this was still the case for nearly the first 150 years the country’s existence.Immigrants were by default presumed admissible, and the federal government did not implement immigration restrictions at all until until the late 19th century when it singled out Chinese immigrants for exclusion, though borders remained open otherwise, and even many Chinese were able to evade these laws by naturalizing in other countries first, such as Mexico.It was not until the 1920s that federal lawmakers experimented with a fully closed-border system (defined as a system in which any immigrant is presumed inadmissible until they demonstrate that they fit into one of the restricted, previously defined categories that would make one admissible and have that admissibility officially recognized by the state). This was a massive expansion of federal powers, and under this clunky new system, some decades saw heavier enforcement than others – especially for racialized groups such asMexicansandHaitians– even as late as the 1980s, closed borders were flexible enough that alarge-scale amnesty programcould pass with relatively little controversy.The true historical deviation of “past decades”, therefore, has NOT been open borders. In fact, the real experiment has been making them militantly closed: a trend thataccelerated in 1990sunder the Clinton administration and intensified even moreafter 9/11.In sum, I actually agree with the NSS that our immigration system has been disastrous in the last few decades. I also agree that, in trying to envision a better future, it’s not a bad idea to take some inspiration from how early nations managed borders.Of course, that would mean embracing the “enduring wisdom” of open borders.It also worth noting that, according to a large body of corroborating evidence, the problems attributed to open borders by the NSS are actually caused by closed borders. Overwhelming evidence shows thatimmigrants do not costthe government in resources any more than citizens cost. What is costly, however, is arbitrarily rounding them up, detaining them, and deporting them. Opening borders would actually alleviate resource strains.Closed borders also distort labor markets. With closed borders, workers lack the freedom to move around looking for the best job, yet multinational corporations are free to shop around for the “cheapest” trapped labor pool.As I have written before, this is a massive grift, hurting workers on all sides of the border. Opening borders would alleviate these distortions.Still more, closed borders create optimal conditions for organized crime. Even though immigration itself does not increase crime – studies in the US, for example, have consistently shown that, on average,immigrants commit fewer crimesthan the native-born population – the fact that vulnerable people around the world need to move for their livelihoods, yet are not allowed to do so legally, hasincentivized cartelsto capitalize on the situation. Opening borders would reduce organized crime.There is also a case to be made that closed borders – or perhaps more specifically, the rhetoric calling for closed borders – actually weakens social cohesion. Studies show that people who havepersonal relationshipsor other forms ofpositive contactwith immigrantsare less likely to hold negative views toward unauthorized immigration. On the other hand, for people who lack these types of interactions, media images tend to matter more. And in the US, we are bombarded with a steadystream of defamatory newscalling immigration a crisis, even from politically “neutral” outlets. Accordingly, it’s not a huge stretch to hypothesize that replacing divisive rhetoric with informed discussions on the benefits of open borders might actually strengthen social cohesion.In this Trump era, we need satire more than ever. Just don’t expect it to save democracy | Alexander HurstRead moreFinally, we are at this very moment watching closed borders undermine national security by subjecting otherwise peaceful communities to the biggest security threat of all: the state itself. When closed-border zeal causes swarms ofheavily armedagents tostorm into communities,separate families, detain people indangerously deplorable conditions, and deploy increasingly unrestrainedviolence against people who object, no one is safer.Given this evidence, it is all the more vexing that people in power can so easily attribute the failures of our immigration system to the specter of “open borders”. The sheer audacity of blaming something that doesn’t exist is already pretty mind-boggling. But the whole thing is even more absurd considering that closed borders are causing these problems. I have been doing my best to explain this in academic terms for quite some time, though lately I find myself turning tosurrealist fictionto try to express how absurd this really is. The logic of our immigration system is backwards! How are policymakers getting away with this?It is worth noting, however, that as of late they seem to be getting away with it a lot less. Even before the killing of Renee Good set offprotests in Minneapolis,several major citiessaw mass protests in favor of immigrant protections, and countlesssmaller townsacross the country had likewise mobilized. Ultimately, these actions tell me that we are ready to have a serious conversation about the root of the problem: our failing experiment with closed borders.Daniel Mendiola is a professor of Latin American history and migration studies at Vassar CollegeExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionTrump administrationMigrationDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

After he is dragged away from the woman he was trying to help, a gaggle of ICE officers surround Pretti and force him to the ground, beating and restraining him there as he struggles to free himself.At least10 shotsappear to be fired within the span of five seconds. Pretti is splayed motionless on the asphalt. “What the fuck, they killed him,” a bystander’s voice can be heard screaming in one of several videos of the incident. “Did they fucking kill that guy?” Like his fellow Minneapolis resident Renee Good, who was also killed by ICE this month, Alex Pretti was 37.Trump administration and border patrol officials immediately sought to cast Pretti, like Good, as a villain. After the US senator from Minnesota Amy Klobuchar posted on X about Pretti’s killing, saying: “Donald Trump and all your lieutenants who ordered this ICE surge: watch the horrific video of the killing today,” Stephen Miller, the senior White House official,replied saying: “A domestic terrorist tried to assassinate federal law enforcement and this is your response?” Miller provided zero evidence for the terrorism label or for the assassination attempt claims.Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, also described Pretti, a nurse, as a “domestic terrorist” without providing evidence. Meanwhile the border patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who wears an olive-green greatcoat thatGerman media outletsliken to a “Nazi uniform”, said it “looks like” Pretti “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement”. He also did not present any evidence for his claims.The administration also claimed that Pretti, who was licensed to carry a legal firearm, was attacking the ICE officers. This claim is contradicted by the video evidence, which shows Pretti filming ICE – a constitutionally protected activity – and seeking to assist fellow observers who were being hurt by the agents, with one hand holding his phone and another shielding his face from pepper spray.Ella Baron on the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis – cartoonRead moreWe can believe what both video evidence and ICE’s own past behavior suggest: that Pretti was observing the actions of federal agents who are engaged in a military occupation of his home city; that he was looking to make the agents’ work of ethnically cleansing his neighbors more onerous, but that he was not looking to engage in violence; that he was peacefully exercising his right to observe Trump’s agents and to voice his disagreement with what they were doing. And that he was killed for it. The videos of Pretti’s shooting are disturbing. When dissidents face summary executions by armed, masked thugs in a totalitarian regime, they are usually read accusations in a mock trial before they face the firing squad. Pretti didn’t even get that.Pretti was just one of the thousands of Minneapolis residents who have been called to resist the occupation of their city by ICE. Every day, as immigrant families in the Twin Cities hide in their homes, those with citizenship brave the streets to bring them groceries and medicine. Patrols of local parents supervise school and daycare drop off, so that children and parents won’t be snatched away by agents; others follow ICE vehicles in their cars, and look to record as many arrests as possible on video, so that the families of the disappeared can be contacted. Many ordinary people in Minneapolis now wear whistles around their necks as they attempt to go about their daily lives, so that when the gangs of men appear, they can alert those around them with the shrill sounds. “They’re here!” these Minnesotans can be heard calling out in the videos that now emerge daily from a city under siege. “Stay inside!”What these people are doing is protecting their neighbors, seeking to help those more vulnerable with gestures that are ordinary, effortful and kind. These gestures have also become dangerous. With the slaughter of Good, and now of Pretti, it has become clear that ICE does not want to be watched. They seem to be targeting ordinary Minnesotans – especially the helpers, the observers and the growing masses who are standing up to oppose them. The result is killings of citizens in broad daylight.In both the Good and Pretti killings, ICE officers reacted to a calm observer with indignant violence. Videos show ICE officers escalating situations and pulling their guns with needless eagerness. In both the Good and Pretti killings, the response of the administration has seemed to suggest that opposing the violent occupation and mass ethnic cleansing operation that ICE is being deployed to conduct is worthy of a death sentence.It is of course well known by now that ICE agents do not want to be seen. They cover their faces; they drive unmarked cars; they have been told by their own leadership not to wear insignia stating that they work for any of the deportation agencies when they are off the clock. The gangs of masked, armed men committing anonymous violence in the streets of Minneapolis of course evoke past instances of racial terror in America – like the masked men of the Ku Klux Klan, who also did their best to eradicate racial undesirables from American communities.Any path back to political stability in the United States must involve a reckoning with what ICE is doingPerhaps ICE’s homicidal rage at the Americans who film them represents this same refusal to countenance being seen, being witnessed, being documented doing what they are doing to innocent people. In that sense, perhaps their actions towards observers like Good and Pretti exhibit a sense of shame. Some, like Tom Nolan, a former Boston police commander and criminology professor who once advised the DHS on civil rights issues, are calling Pretti’s death at ICE’s hands astone cold murder. You could also call it the elimination of a witness.ICE agents know, as we all do, that one day the Trump regime will come to an end. And they know, as more and more of even once reticent Americans are now coming to understand, that there can be no quiet moving on from the Trump era, no calm, forward-looking determination to absolve the Trump regime and its agents of their actions.Any path back to political stability in the United States must involve a reckoning with what ICE is doing – on the streets, in its camps, and to people like Pretti and Good. Any restoration of something like a republic in America will require, as a precondition, investigations, prosecutions and tribunals to assess and punish those responsible for these actions.The ICE agents who shot Good and Pretti know that the whole world can see them; they know that their countrymen, enraged and called to heroism and witness, will not look away. If they are trying to eliminate witnesses, they cannot eliminate us all. There will be an accounting one day, and though Pretti and Good will not live to see it, many of us will – many of the ICE agents now terrorizing America will, too. As thepoet wrote, “After such knowledge, what forgiveness?” These killers, deep down, must know that they will not be forgiven.It is small comfort to those who loved him that in his last act of witnessing, Pretti has now called thousands more to witness the horrors of their time – no matter the consequences that such a reckoning threatens. After his death, a video of Pretti was released by those who knew him as the nurse at work, at the VA hospital. It is customary there for staff to read out loud a tribute to veterans when one dies in their care.In the video, Pretti can be seen reading this final salute to an elderly veteran who died in his unit. “Today, we remember that freedom is not free,” Pretti reads. “We have to work at it, nurture it, protect it and even sacrifice for it.” Pretti sacrificed, too. We must all be at least as brave as he was.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

There are already a few videos on social media, depicting multiple angles of the grotesque scene. This killing,like the one before, has felt inevitable – because of the actions of the federal government, and in spite of the diligence and peaceful pushback by you and your neighbors.For more than a decade, watching soccer has been a staple of your Saturday routine, as it is for millions of others. Given that, it was hard not to think abouta prize awardedby the sport’s most powerful organization just eight weeks prior, to the president overseeing and encouraging all of this. You know, the medal meant to reward “exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace.” Plenty of peoplehave been jokingabout this “honor” online since the day it was announced. You were among them in December. Today, you find it hard to laugh.You get a push notification half an hour later: a member of your Premier League fantasy team scored. You forgot to update your lineups, what with everything going on around you. The goalscorer was left on your bench. Once, this would have registered as a palpable, if minor, annoyance. Today, it barely registers as anything at all. You quickly close the notification and tune in to the local news.The next kickoff approaches, in which your favorite team is about to play the defending champions. It’s a big one. Twenty minutes into the game, you mute it and load a stream of another press conference held by Jacob Frey, the mayor ofMinneapolis, and Brian O’Hara, the city’s police chief. It’s all too similar to the media briefing they delivered just 17 days earlier, after Renee Good was also brutally killed by ICE. Once again, they plead for the only action that will truly defuse what has become an impossibly tense new normal. They beg for ICE to leave us alone.‘Alex Pretti was murdered’: NBA’s Haliburton among sports stars to condemn Minnesota killingRead moreThe press conference wraps, and you look up to find that your boys are 2-0 up. The stadium is delirious. You might have been too, under different circumstances. Today, you haven’t heard a decibel of the crowd noise or a syllable of Peter Drury’s poetic reactions. You can’t bring yourself to go back and watch the replay to fill those gaps. Those goals are now forever associated with the sobering details of a senseless death. After 90 minutes, your team has pulled off the biggest upset of the weekendon the final kick of the game. Another day’s dose of euphoria doesn’t even register.There’s another game at 4.30pm – this one a little closer to home. The US women’s national team has built a proud reputation; an international powerhouse thatadvocates for progress and against violence. You wonder if they’ll find a way to acknowledge what’s happening in Minnesota, a state they’ve visited with increasing frequency since the opening of Allianz Field in Saint Paul.There are no black armbands of quiet support from the team. There’s no statement, or moment of silence, or acknowledgement before the national anthem. Eventhe gun lobby took time to criticizehow Trump’s camp justified the killing by turning the victim’s second amendment rights against him. So when thefourth goal goes in, and its scorer hustles toward the camera to try creatinga viral celebration for social media, you decide you can catch up on the final 35 minutes later. You decide this even though it’s the last meaningful soccer of the day, about a month before the domestic season kicks off in earnest.You and your partner’s favorite bar and its dart boards will go unvisited this evening. Keeping up with your shows has been pushed off the priority list entirely. These days, time together often means grabbing a coffee, or a water bottle at later hours, and slowly driving around in areas that have requested neighborhood patrol as community observers.You’re in group chats on platforms you had previously used to talk with sources. Nobody shares their real name, nor should they. You’re in constant contact with people who rename themselves after produce, minerals, and neighborhood landmarks. These are the people you trust most and are desperate to help protect.It haunts you that the first two victims – may they please be the only two – in your community were both 37 years old at the time of their senseless deaths. In less than a month, you’ll turn 32. You’re left to ruminate on realities that you hadn’t really dwelled on much until your own government began its occupation. Before, you thought of these ages primarily as those when soccer players might retire – or start thinking about it.It’s difficult to discuss this with your friends who have either moved away fromMinnesotaor who have never lived here at all.You watch the evening news, and the anchors deliver a statement from Michael and Susan Pretti, the parents of the man – now known to be VA nurse Alex Pretti – whose life ended far too soon and far too needlessly. It pushes back against false statements about him and the events leading to his death, disseminated by some of the most powerful people in the country. “Please get the truth out about our son,” the statement says in closing. “He was a good man.”Your professional instincts kick in, and you notice the Prettis’ statement hasn’t yet reached social media, and rush to transcribe and post it. It feels productive, helping them spread their message. Within an hour, it’s the most read and most shared post you’ve had on the platform – bigger than anything related to soccer, which is most of what you talk about on there.You get back into snow pants and boots and tear open another pack of hand warmers. You stand with your neighbors in subzero conditions after sunset, holding candles, acknowledging the morning’s horrors but stressing the value of this community, of fighting technologically enabled isolation. Your ability to gather in public parks reminds you that you can resist this isolation. It’s shared strength when needed most.A few years ago, sitting in freezing conditions like theserendered you unable to do your jobof covering a World Cup qualifier. Today, there’s no place you’d rather be than this city park.You anticipate the next day will be similar, even if nobody is killed. The past few weeks have introduced group chats and patrol drives and dutiful observation into your new daily routine. You stare at every car that drives past your window with longer gazes and greater scrutiny. Your camera roll, long teeming with pet photos, is now dominated by videos soundtracked by plastic whistles.On Sunday, you wake up to news that Trump’s attorney general hasissued a list of demandsif ICE’s grip on your state is to be loosened. Immediately below the letter on your social feed, the USWNT hasposted another angleof the fourth goal’s viral celebration. One of these feels far more important than the other.Explore more on these topicsFootballMinnesota ICE shootingUS sportsMinnesotaMinneapoliscommentShareReuse this content"

Mark Carney’sspeech last weekat Davos was the first time a western head of state has said outright what has been hanging over political proceedings for some time. The rules-based order is “fading”, in the middle of a “rupture” and there’s no going back. But outside Davos, the G7 and Nato, that is old news – many believed the rules-based order had expired long ago, depending on what moment you take as your watershed.There were several components to the order, which of course was a layered, complex thing. The first is structural, that is, the agreement between powerful and prosperous countries that there would be certain mechanisms and protocols to maintain political stability, contain the outbreak of wars and promote their mutual economic interests. All the bodies that direct international traffic – the EU,Nato, the UN, the WTO, the IMF – make up that top layer of organisation.The second was more abstract, the norms that those countries adhered to in action and rhetoric. They would not launch aggressive protectionist economic policies against each other, definitely not havedesigns on each other’s territoryand not pass opinion on each other’s domestic affairs.The third was the ideological glue that held it all together, one that advanced the impression that these were not simply transactional arrangements in everyone’s interest, but something rooted in liberal ideals: the promotion of universal human rights, rights to self-determination and the sanctity of individual freedoms.In many ways, the final component was the most important, what Carney called a “pleasant fiction”. This pretence that the whole thing wasn’t fundamentally about American hegemony. The US and its allies committed violations of international law frequently, or endorsed them, or let them pass – but broadly put in the effort to make those actions seem coherent. They had to sometimes violate the order so they could save it. They did so not because they could, but because they must, as the custodians of moral standards and global security.The “war on terror” was the first challenge to that argument. If there was any faith that powerful countries would not indulge their imperial rights to invade other countries, rendition people illegally and imprison them for years without due process, it ended then. The victims of the “war on terror” did not have the privilege of being able to partake of the pleasant fiction, as their lands became theatres for foreign troops. Their countries succumbed to years of war and fracture with disastrous results, proliferation of sectarian violence in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a handing back to the Taliban when the spasm of post-9/11 temper subsided. But the architects of the “war on terror” could still offer the consolation to themselves and their public that it was all in the service of combating the great threat of Islamic terrorism, and that its calamitous consequences were unfortunately due to “unknown unknowns”.That consolation became near impossible in Gaza, where another part of the order died and the necrosis spread. Every feature of the genocide throttled the pretence that the order was rooted in any ideals – or rather that those ideals applied to anyone but those at the top of the hierarchy. The scale of killing, the violation of every rule in the book, from the wholesale murder of non-combatants to depriving them of food and medicine, obliterated the fiction.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers in Rafah, southern Gaza, in July 2024.Photograph: Ohad Zwigenberg/APBut it wasn’t just that. It was that Israel was both armed and given diplomatic cover to pursue its campaign, rendering its allies not just bystanders but partners in crime. This was not a genocide enacted in an African country by a party remote from Washington or Brussels, allowing for hand-wringing and condemnation from afar. It was ajoint venturethat continued only because Israel is a close ally, making it clear that the rules were applied selectively.But Gaza was also destructive and catalysing in other ways, because it introduced an internal tension between the parts of the order that had spoiled and those that still worked. In maintaining support for Israel, some European countries and the US went to war with their own institutions,refusing to respectthe rulings of the international criminal court when it came to the indictment of Benjamin Netanyahu and, in the case of the US,imposing sanctionson the court. Gaza exposed that these institutions are only allowed to function as a sort of international club in which insiders were immune.And then, the most recent death, in which the constituent parts of that order became the targets of the American hegemon, rather than its handmaidens. This encompasses Trump’s designs on Greenland, his contempt for European allies and Nato, and his tariff wars against them. They are now reckoning with how to coexist on new terms, hastily and violently rewritten by a US that has decided covert supremacy is for the birds.Carney’s intervention is welcome, though exasperating to many who felt he was stating the obvious. He only felt compelled to make it once the rot reached his own door, and it was made worse by his admission that the grounds of the order were always false and unjust, but that the “bargain” had hitherto always worked.The global rule of law is not collapsing – Trump is the lone problem and he can be defeated | Simon TisdallRead moreBut, in fairness, his was a realisation that was, if anything, more challenging to Canada and other US allies than it was to those nations who always knew they were dispensable, and who were never closely enmeshed with the US. For those fully integrated within the American security, economic and ideological complex, the US’s new hostility towards them is a game-changing breach of fraternal compact, rather than business as usual.As the custodians of the rules-based order contemplate its death and what may replace it, what they will realise is that much of it still has a pulse. This won’t just be a matter of pivoting away from the US on foreign policy, but unpicking an entire system, much of it practical – globalised capital, trade agreements, dollarisation of international commerce. But much of the system is also one of coding, values, norms and persistent contempt for those outside the club. It was notable that, as Carney detailed the hypocrisies of the old way, there was no acknowledgment of the people who have always suffered them.The solutions proposed so far – more middle-power coordination to create groupings that act as a counterweight to the US, higher investment in defence spending, lowering taxes and trade hurdles to make up for the US’s isolationism – are policies that continue the security and economic supremacy of the old order. Those looking to spring free of it are still imprisoned by the very structures they created and continue to believe in. The question for them now isn’t what can they can realistically build out of the ruins of the old order – that would suggest a clean break. The real question is how much of that order remains within them.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionDonald TrumpNatoUnited NationsMark CarneycommentShareReuse this content"

At least for the moment, everything else is a distractionSun 25 Jan 2026 22.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 13.21 ESTShareWhen we talk about our inability to pay attention, to concentrate, we often mean and blame our phones. It’s easy, it’s meant to be easy. One flick of our index finger transports us from disaster to disaster, from crisis to crisis, from maddening lie to maddening lie. Each new unauthorized attack and threatened invasion grabs the headlines, until something else takes its place, and meanwhile the government’s attempts to terrorize and silence the people of our country continue.So let me break it down. There is one story: our country is on the brink of an authoritarian takeover. In Minneapolis an innocent poet and an ER nurse at a VA hospital were both killed in cold blood by federal agents. It is happening now. Toddlers are being sent to detention centers; videos of their gyms for kids recall the youth choruses that the Nazis so proudly showed off at the Terezín concentration camp. Intimidation and violence are being weaponized against the citizens of Minneapolis, some of whom are afraid to leave their houses for fear of being beaten, arrested and shackled, regardless of whether they are US citizens or asylum seekers or people from another country peacefully living and working here for decades.That is the news we should be paying attention to. At least for the moment, everything else is a distraction. I’m glad to have been informed about the heavy snow outside my window today and the local weather-travel advisory, but frankly, it’s snowed here before – so why is it leading the news?Donald Trump’s inability totell Greenland from Icelandduring his speech at Davos is embarrassing, awful, sort of funny – but it’s hardly the first time he’s made a mortifying mistake. I too want the Epstein files released, I want to know who is guilty, I want justice and respect for the survivors. But unless those revelations bring down the perpetrators, it’s not – for the moment – the story.The story is what’s happening in Minneapolis. And even that requires focus. Already thekilling of Alex Prettihas partly diverted our attention from thekilling of Renee Good.The story – masked agents, arrests, violence, kidnappings, deportations without due process – is happening all over the country, but in smaller increments, without as much pushback, and so far without the death of two innocent, middle-class, white bystanders. The story is about how decent and unselfish Renee Good and Alex Pretti were and about the falsehoods being told about them.The story is not letting ourselves be distracted from the real and present threat to our democracy. That threat is the story which our print, electronic and social media should be bannering at the top of every feed and every front page, every day. To consistently run that below the weather report is, quite frankly, to betray the struggles of the people of Minneapolis.The story is what we do now to support our fellow Americans in the midwest and to keep the violence and repression from spreading even further into our own streets and backyards. The story is avoiding the future that Stephen Miller and his minions are planning for us.The story is how we do it: not long after the 2017 inauguration of Donald Trump, I wrote, in these pages, about our need to stage a national strike. I know now that I underestimated the difficulties – the amount of organization required, the need to strategize, the necessity to support and provide for people who will lose their livelihoods if they walk off the job. But many people are already scared to go to work or send their kids to school.Such a shutdown would be an enormous undertaking, to say the least. But it’s been done. Gandhi and Martin Luther King achieved at least some of their goals without resorting to violence. The people of Minneapolis have stopped business as usual in the city. That energy can – and needs - to spread. Not to be alarmist, but unless we stay focused, it may soon be too late.This morning I went off – I apologize! – on a college classmate who sent an email link to a video of birds that others might want to watch as “relief from the weather and the news”. I wasn’t saying we should stop enjoying the birds. I’m thrilled that so many robins elected to stick around this winter. I even like watching the crows and turkey vultures pick the roadkill clean.But I don’t really want “a relief” from the loss of Renee Good and Alex Pretti or from the resistance beginning in Minneapolis. To crudely paraphrase Ecclesiastes, there is a time for everything. And this may not be the time to distract ourselves with the latest scandal or diplomatic blunder or with amusing images of the creatures who don’t much care if the humans beneath the snow-covered rooftops are living under a cruel and authoritarian regime.Francine Prose is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and SciencesThis article was amended on 26 January 2026 to correct a misspelling of Alex Pretti’s surname and an instance of Renee Good having the wrong surname.Explore more on these topicsUS newsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

As with thedefection of Robert Jenrickearlier this month, the continued “self-purge” of the “out-Reform Reform” brigade can only help the electoral fortunes of the Conservative party. As I said in a previous article, “wreckers like Braverman are why the public don’t like us”.For those of us who have long pointed out the utter failure of their strategy, it’s schadenfreude to see them leave a ship they themselves so effectively torpedoed. Reform UK is welcome to them. I suspect Nigel Farage will rue the day they came on board. ManyConservativeswill hope they have the same record of failure at their new party as they did at their last.Their hectoring, divisive and aggressive style was the ultimate turn-off for millions of centre-ground voters who had previously backed the Conservatives. Add to this their incompetence in government, as well as their lack of political strategy, and the Conservative party haemorrhaged support under their watch.Because their sense of political entitlement exists at stratospheric levels, there is no “you break it, you fix it” mantra for these people. Instead, they’ll leave their political mess of a Conservative party for someone else to clear up.They now argue, from Reform, that “Britain is broken”, as if they were not the ones involved in breaking it. Their rhetorical style is that of Momentum and Corbyn: it describes the problems rather then solving them. It’s negative politics. Yet what really matters to voters are positive solutions.More broadly, shedding this toxic, vote-destroying band of political losers may just give the leader,Kemi Badenoch, the glimmer of a chance to get the party back on track – and at a time when it feels the leadership has been perhaps surer-footed than over the past several disastrous years.It’s a small window of opportunity, but the defections can give Badenoch greater freedom to take a step in the right direction. The Conservative party can only win by returning to the mainstream of British politics, focused on aspiration, access to opportunity, stronger social mobility and a vision of equality of opportunity for all.The new centre-right group that I am supporting,Prosper UK, launched earlier today, could be a vehicle for Badenoch to steer the party in the right direction. It’s a long way back, but let’s finally all agree: we’ve reached the end of the political cul-de-sac that Braverman, Jenrick and co so catastrophically led the party down.The battle for a rejuvenated Conservative party truly begins today. It could offer millions of disenfranchised centre-right voters the choice they so badly deserve.Justine Greeningwas the Conservative MP for Putney from 2005 to 2019Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Putin is weaponising the savage eastern European winterMon 26 Jan 2026 11.44 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 11.49 ESTShareIn the winter of 1993, during thesiege of Sarajevo, people burned books and furniture to keep warm. Water froze in pipes. Electricity vanished for the duration of the war. Children slept in coats and hats, their breath visible in dark rooms. Cold itself became a weapon of war.I remember, when I was reporting from the Bosnian capital, seeingdoctors operating by candlelight or wearing camping headlamps. I remember old people chopping wood in the park in the centre of the city until there were no trees left, then dragging it home on sledges. I remember the ground being too frozen to bury the many dead on the football pitch, which later became a cemetery. I remember a terrible, frozen day when I went to an old people’s home near a frontline and counted dead body after dead body, all frozen in their sleep.Three decades later, I am watchinganother winter war– this time in Ukraine. It is a human-made catastrophe. Russia is now systematically targeting the country’s energy infrastructure.Since last mid-autumn, attacks on power and heating systems across eastern, central and southern Ukraine – includingKyiv, Odesa andKharkiv– have forceddaily electricity outages. Until December, power cuts followed a grim rhythm: four hours on, four hours off, all day and night. Twelve hours of light and warmth, 12 hours of darkness and cold.According to Ukraine’s minister of economy, Oleksii Sobolev, thetotal damage to its energy infrastructurefrom these attacks over the past three months will cost an estimated $1bn to address. But no statistic can capture what it means to live in a city where winter has beendeliberately turned into a tool of terror.Ending the war in Ukraine has more support than ever. So why is peace still not in sight? | Gwendolyn SasseRead moreOn 9 January 2026, a massive strike on Kyiv’s energy grid left6,000 residential buildings– about half of the city’s housing supply – without heating. On20 January, another attackcut power from more than 5,600 buildings, many of them the same ones. On 24 January, the same neighbourhoods were hit again: 6,000 buildings lost heating, with 3,200 buildings still without as night fell.This is happening as temperatures in Kyiv fall to between –15C (5F) and –18C, dropping to –20C at night. During a Zoom call I had last week with the human rights lawyer andNobel peace prize winner Oleksandra Matviichuk, she sat wrapped in a parka and scarves, refusing to complain. “It’s not your fault,” she said when I apologised, embarrassed that my colleagues at The Reckoning Project are suffering so valiantly.Another Reckoning Project colleague, Maksimas Milta, lives in Podil, one of Kyiv’s oldest neighbourhoods. In one week in January, he was without electricity for 98 hours out of 168. The following week, 99 hours without power. Yet he went to work every day, refusing to complain. This is not a temporary disruption. It is a siege by other means.One day, people will recall these terrible stories. On 21 January, Oleksii Brekht, the former acting CEO of Ukraine’s electricity transmission operator,was killedwhile working at a damaged substation. In the city of Dnipro, divers from the emergency services areentering the freezing Dnipro River, working for hours in sub-zero temperatures to repair heating pipelines. This is heroism, but it is also desperation: people are freezing to death. They have to do something.Ukrainians havebegun calling this reality “kholodomor”– death by cold – an echo ofHolodomor, the human-made famine Stalin used to crush Ukraine in the 1930s. Then, hunger was the weapon. Now, it is winter.Inside apartments, people heat bricks on gas stoves and use them as makeshift radiators. Families pitch hiking tents in their living rooms, sheltering inside them in thermal clothes and sleeping bags. Schools in Kyiv have extended holidays until February; elsewhere, children are back online because classrooms are too cold.View image in fullscreenPeople in Kyiv warm their hands over a barbecue at a blackout party during an electricity outage on 24 January 2026.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersOne of the cruellest stories from the winter cold is that of military veterans with bionic prosthetics. Without electricity, they cannot recharge their limbs.And yet, amid this suffering engineered byVladimir Putin, something extraordinary persists. People keep going, refusing to be broken by Moscow.Someday, people will tell these stories, too: how supermarkets now allow stray dogs and cats inside to keep warm; how young people, refusing to lose their youth, organise generator-powered raves in courtyards, dancing in the dark as an act of defiance. This defiance is Ukraine’s trademark – an act of fierce rebellion against Russia.I remember this all from my Sarajevo days. The refusal to be broken. The refusal to lose humour, despite nearly four years of siege. The bars that were heated with open gas pipes that flamed dangerously as you sat down and ordered a black market whisky. The laughter at an underground party in a bomb shelter. The strength it took to burn your PhD thesis that took six years to write, to heat a room so that your family could survive.Let’s be honest. The purpose of Putin’s attacks is not only physical destruction. It is psychological warfare. The Kremlin hopes civilians will break – but what they really want is for them to turn on their own government.During the Bosnian war, the international community failed to stop the siege and 100,000 people died who might have been alive today. We said “never again”, and then we looked away.In Ukraine, winter is a weapon as deadly as the drones that buzz through the frozen night skies, seeking prey. And the world must finally call it what it is: a war crime.Janine di Giovanni is a war correspondent and the executive director of The Reckoning Project, a war crimes unit in Ukraine, Sudan and GazaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is as if some enemy within guides it unerringly along the wrong strategic path. Declaring war on Andy Burnham anoints him as a northern martyr and hero, and casts Keir Starmer as a coward. Many opposed Burnhamthrowing down the gauntletfor all the problems it would have caused if he won. If he had run, and won, Starmer would have a choice: squeeze him python-tight within the fold, or confront any leadership manoeuvring head on. Instead, before he could show any strength, he funked it, using evasive proceduralism to block his rival from the byelection in Gorton and Denton.What timing for this decision! Starmer, along with his chancellor, business secretary and other chief allies are due to depart for China on Tuesday: his absence from PMQs, from the weekly parliamentaryLabourparty meeting and from TV studios is a blunder.Why this provocation when obstacles aplenty were already in Burnham’s way, with no easy route to No 10? Even those who are not particularly his supporters see how boldly he was ready to hazard his political career on an uncertain byelection at a time of wild political volatility. He could have lost to Reform or to the Greens, or been hindered by a pro-Gaza independent, and that would have finished him politically. But he had a good chance of winning: now, if that seat gifts Nigel Farage hisninth MP, excoriating blame will fall on Starmer.The byelection to replace Burnham as Manchester mayor would indeed have been mortally dangerous: a Reform win would have been a disaster, not just for Labour but for the future of the country. Anger at that needless loss might well have terminated any Burnham leadership bid. But, even if returned as a victor to the Commons, he would have been cold-shouldered by a fair number of unwelcoming Labour MPs: they note that, ever since he said government should not be“in hock to the bond markets”, the markets twitch whenever he steps towards power. It happened again last week when he threw his hat into the ring.A leadership contest with Wes Streeting and maybe others would be hard fought, no shoo-in. But, fearless or reckless, Burnham was willing to risk everything with that familiar challenger’s blend of personal ambition and resolve to rescue his party from its deepest slough of despond. It took guts.Starmer has dealt himself a blow. “Frit” was how Margaret Thatcher described it, when, in 1983, she accused Denis Healey of being afraid of an election. Blame falls on Starmer’s henchman Morgan McSweeney, but it was the man himself who ducked letting his challenger reach even first base, being on the national executive committee (NEC) panel that voted eight-to-one to hold Burnham down.Rows may lead to this NEC blunder being reversed in one more U-turn, aspolling showsthat 66% of Labour members thought that Burnham should be allowed to stand. Either way, his status is burnished, members preferring him to Starmer for Labour leader by 48% to 26%. Only he among senior Labour figures scores apositive public rating, gaining from the northern air of Manchester, uncontaminated by the detested Westminster miasma. But as suggested by astute psephologists such asMark Pack, surveying all polls, that’s scant prediction of how much lift any new leader would give Labour. After all, they will follow the five PMs in a row who have each been the most hated ever, in this time of anti-politician ferment.But whatever the unknowable result, keeping calm and carrying on over the precipice looks like the worst option. Labour has had that lemming instinct in the past, but no longer. This is not about one party’s survival but mortal combat with the Farage forces of darkness. The left-liberal bloc of parties is duty-bound to see off the hard-right bloc, the Tories now sucked into the frighteningly race-driven orbit of the Trumpian Reform UK. Starmer himself said on Monday, ashe did in his conference speech, thatthis is the fight. But it’s now clear to all that he’s not the one to lead that fight.The new leader has to be acceptable enough to appeal to tactical voters across the whole liberal-green-left spectrum. The new leader has to be bold enough to go for immediate electoral reform, to ensure every party only gets the seats earned by its vote, or Farage could do as Labour did in 2024, and win by a mile, despite the great majority voting against him.Let selecting a new leader be done with the least bloodshed, but it needs to be done before May: why wait for brutal results if there’s a chance of stopping a haemorrhage of Labour councils and terrible losses inScotlandandWales? Choose whoever is fittest to draw in the most support for the stop-Farage fight.The Scottish secretary, Douglas Alexander, one of the wisest put up to defend the NEC decision, was right when he told the Today programme on Radio 4 that the last thing the country wants now is an internal Labour melodrama, when the cost of living, state of the economy and public services should take up ministers’ every waking moment. But Labour’s failure to persuade on those essentials is exactly what has brought us to this crisis. If Gorton and Denton (Labour majority in 2024: 13,413) falls, that signals that there is no time to lose. That Labour’s NEC could even dare contemplate using the excuse of possibly losing Greater Manchester’s mayoralty to Reform shows the hierarchy accepting too complacently the depths of the party’s failure.Labour may fall out, unable to agree on the policies or person of a new leader, preferring to stagger on while vainly scanning the horizon for something to turn up. But I would hope the great majority of Labour MPs, members, voters and potential voters want to put up the strongest contender, setting aside factionalisms of small difference in the face of a grave national threat.Here is the Starmer tragedy, a good and clever man not made for politics or leadership. His lack of arrogance and his earnest endeavour is what his admirers like, but lack of political instinct and firmness of direction is a fatal flaw. Turning the party round after Corbyn was a triumph. His convictions are deep-dyed Labour: children’s opportunities, green investment, workers’ rights. But No 10’s over-cautious wariness of the right stifled the telling of that story. Look, I slid into the past tense because that is where he is almost certainly headed. His legacy will be a far longer list of good things done than anyone heard tell, because it was never well told. How he goes and who succeeds is the next story.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerReform UKLocal electionscommentShareReuse this content"

I was lost, full of yearning and big dreams.I didn’t realise the ways in which my time at school had been containing my anxiety. I was too busy, along with all the other girls, being excited about the future. School and its expectations were there to be railed against, and teachers and rules are to be left far behind. Bring on the future! I would leave home and move to the city to study! I would perform in plays! How thrilling! And wonderful!But … it wasn’t those things. I was exhausted. I had given the HSC everything and didn’t have the resources for university.On these in-between days I’m ‘growing down’, sinking into the present moment and savouring small delights | Nadine LevyRead moreNor did I feel ready, once I got there, to make new friends. My old ones felt like family; you can’t just snap your fingers and create new relationships. I was doing the wrong course, at the wrong institution, attempting to live in the wrong places and – just to add insult to injury – falling in love with the wrong people. I had a child’s understanding that dreams do come true, just how you imagine they will – exactly that way. You can control the path ahead with the strength of your own desire.I had chosen my university because of its proximity to Sydney’s National Institute for Dramatic Art. That was where I wanted to be. I didn’t want to live in my head; I wanted the physical experience of immersion in character. I remember standing on the far side of the campus, arms heavy with law books, longingly watching the acting students practise fencing, leaping and jousting in Shakespearean costume. But I did not get into NIDA – as hard as I tried – and after a year I dropped out of university to make it as an actor on my own. I was 18 and out of my depth.I eventually did study acting at the Victorian College of the Arts, and my years there held many wonderful discoveries about text and character. But when I graduated, I found myself, once again, unemployed. In between auditions I worked in kitchens, bars, hotels … I served drinks, scraped plates, made sandwiches. I sold potatoes at festivals dolloped with sour cream, corn and bolognese.I was a fairy, too. Every weekend with coat-hanger wings strapped to my back, I would entertain kids at birthday parties. At one point I signed up for unemployment benefits. This was in the days before the internet, and employment opportunities were occasionally sent by mail. A letter arrived from the Department of Social Security and, without enthusiasm (nobody wanted to hear from the Department of Social Security), I opened it. There was the little yellow card with its handwritten job description: writer. I stopped in my tracks. Writer? Did the DSS know something I did not? Might I be a writer?I had always kept a journal, always loved to read and to make up stories. As a child I’d loved poetry. I’d written plays to perform for friends and family. Had in fact toyed with the idea of writing a show for myself to act in. A film. I read the card again.Writer.The DSS knew me better than I knew myself! Then I looked again. Notwriterbutwaiter.In hindsight, I can say that every effort was a building block. Those hard days counted. The thwarted dreams. The failed auditions. The struggle. The stage fright and the failure. The fairy dust in my clothes, the smeared face paint and bedraggled fairy wings. Those drives back from the city at 4am after mopping floors at the club. All of it counted.Maybe days like that are counting for you, too. Maybe parts in yourself are carrying you towards your brightest most wonderful dream. Even when days feel long. Even when there are clouds in your sky. Something more powerful might quietly be at work.I would begin to study writing a few years after the invitation sent to me by the DSS. I thought, if I can’t find work as an actor, then maybe I’ll write myself some work. A deeper, more authentic part of me was finally taking the lead. I wasn’t as rigid, in that instant that I decided to study writing, about what the future should look like.It turned out that, when I first read the letter from the Department of Social Security, I had been right all along.Sofie Laguna is a writer based in MelbourneExplore more on these topicsAustralian educationOpinionMental healthHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

It seems absurd – but a cold truth lies beneathJason OkundayeIt comes to something when ‘Henrys’ in London worry about money, but that’s the reality of today’s wages and the cost of city livingMon 26 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 13.21 ESTShareWhen I was younger, I was always hearing about “yuppies” (young, urban professionals), a prosperous class of upwardly mobile, status-chasing people working in major cities. It was already a vintage term by the time I was conscious of it, it having been forged in the 1980s, when these people were viewed as the major beneficiaries ofMargaret Thatcher’s “big bang”. Now it’s disappeared altogether. Instead, these days you hear about the white-collar “Henrys” (high-earning, not rich yet) – a cohort near-identical in demographic, profession and status-obsession, but who are now apparently the overlooked, and the hard-done-by, of our current political settlement.One of the big contentions for Henrys, as you may have learned recently, is the claim that a £100,000 salary no longer pays; in fact, it is at this point that they face a financial double whammy. High earners lose £1 from their personal allowance for every £2they earnover £100,000, meaning that more of their salary will be taxed at a higher rate. It is also at this salary point that Henrys in Englandlose accessto 30 hours of free childcare for children aged between nine months and four years old, and £2,000 per yearfor under-12s. Add to this that these Henrys who started university after 2006 are more likely to be paying off their entire student loan for longer, and there areclear incentivesagainsthigher earningsafter a certain point.The consequence is that these people, feeling that the harder work is not worth the additional burden, apparently now shun promotions, work fewer hours or “salary sacrifice” into their pension pots (a practice that will becurtailedin 2029 due to changes made in the last budget).Tiny violin stuff, surely. Who wants to cry for these people? First off, this “debate” around whether £100,000 pays enough is clearly specific to London and the south-east of England. It would be ludicrous to most people living in, say, Bolton or Liverpool, where such a salary would afford you your pick of house and a more plush lifestyle, to think it represents a kind of struggle. And sure, even those of us in London will find it obnoxious that a £100,000 salary, only enjoyed by the top 4% of earners, is being trotted out as a symbol of economic injustice – especially since the median annual earnings for full-time workers in the UK is£39,039, with rates ofin-work povertyincreasing.Putting aside the fantasies of what I, a single gay man who has a love affair with designer shoes, would do with such a salary, I do think that underneath this ridiculous-seeming complaint there is an interesting truth about what it now means to build a good life in England’s capital, and how living standards have downgraded for almost all of us.To be absolutely clear, I am not a Henry. But I am interested in what the frustration at what most would consider a high salary actually says about life inLondon. While I personally believe that childcare hours, along with other provisions for children, should be universal and not means-tested, these are not a lifetime expense. Where you would feel the constraints of this salary, dependants or not, are in housing, if you are living in London or the south-east of England. The capital-dwelling Henry will have, at some point, endured the cowboy rental market, giving away much of their earnings in rent. Then, when in a position to consider buying a property, they will face an average house price of £553,000.When Henry finally saves up the deposit to escape the rental market, they will find that their options for home ownership are significantly downgraded compared with what they might have bought on a comparable or lesser salary 30 years ago, considering that income has not kept pace withrising house prices. Henry may have to settle for a leasehold flat, where they face escalating and unpredictableground rentand service charge increases.Once, the young urban professional had the assumption of a smooth transition to parenthood and family life. Now they are delaying the milestones that their parents will have embraced more readily. And this is the rub: perceptions of wealth matter. If one generation can compare their lot with another’s and find themselves worse off, they will feel hard done by.London-dwelling Henry may, rightly, not be the first or even second object of our sympathies. They will still have a nice life, and perhaps need to adjust their expectations. Maybe they will have to move out of London to a more affordable area. But there is a balance between what is simply an adjustment of lifestyle if you want to buy a house or have children (fewer meals out, Zara boots rather than Bottega), and what is cold reality: that the lifestyle and material circumstances older generations accessed on a good wage are now out of orbit for those even on an excellent one.So this looks and feels like a very limited grievance, but it’s indicative of an economy that is working for fewer and fewer of us. That has consequences for the aspirations of the young.Why go to university? Why move to the big city to make yourself in your field? Why work hard if the reward is increasingly diminished? And a bigger question – what will happen politically, and who will be the casualties, when this cohort of Henrys have their revenge?Jason Okundaye is an assistant opinion editor at the GuardianExplore more on these topicsTaxOpinionInequalityLondonTax and spendingStudent financeHouse pricescommentShareReuse this content"

Timid EU elites should take lessons from The LeopardJoseph de WeckLike the fearful Sicilian aristocracy in the 1958 epic novel, Europe clings to the status quo. But managed decline is not the only optionMon 26 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 12.53 ESTShareJust past the quarter-mark of the century,Europeappears to be at a turning point. For decades its share of global GDP has been shrinking and its geopolitical influence eroding. At a certain point, relative decline can turn into absolute decline. That moment may be approaching.The US, Russia and China are openly engaged in a “scramble for Europe”. Moscow seeks to reassert hegemony in the east. Beijing wants Europe’s industry; Washington demands obedience – and Greenland. Germans have grown anxious about the future. A disoriented France can’t fix its budget. Desperate for growth, Brussels dismantles climate legislation it passed only a few years ago while bending over backwards to appease Donald Trump. Little remains of European dignity – a sense ofdéclassementis beginning to take hold.Perhaps this is why the recent Netflix adaptation of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s 1958 masterpiece Il Gattopardo,The Leopard,is resonating with audiences across the continent. Lampedusa’s epic novel chronicles the decline of a Sicilian aristocratic family in the 19th century – and, more enduringly, the mindset of elites who sense their world is ending yet are willing to compromise and who will do almost anything to extend their power a little longer.Europe’s political class, suspended between pain and complacency, has come to resemble that aristocracy and is resigned to a strategy of managed decline. Yet “as long as there is death, there is hope,” Lampedusa writes, and Europe is not necessarily lost – if its leaders draw the right lessons from The Leopard.To read The Leopard isa feast; to watch Luchino Visconti’s 1963 adaptationa must; to linger with the refreshingly slow-paced Netflix seriestime well spent. For the pressed reader, here is the brief: set during Italian unification, The Leopard follows the Prince of Salina, an ageing Sicilian aristocrat living comfortably off his vast estates. Around him, however, the world is changing. Villagers aspire to become more than labourers on the prince’s land. Aristocratic power gives way to a stabby bourgeoisie.Clear-eyed, the prince very much understands that his way of life is dying. His wealth and privileges ebb away. “Everything needs to change for everything to remain the same,” the prince’s nephew Tancredi famously declares, urging his uncle to align himself with the new economic and political order. But if remaining on top requires renouncing one’s values and traditions, is that really winning?The proud prince is drawn to the dignity of resistance yet cannot escape the logic of pragmatic surrender in the hope of delaying his family’s decline. Reading The Leopard today, it is hard not to see Europe in the melancholic Prince of Salina.Like the prince, many Europeans have led relatively prosperous lives. And like aristocrats of a bygone age, most Europeans are convinced of the superiority of their model – a democratic order, a tamed capitalism, a refined culture – while ignoring the fact that this wealth also rests on the exploitation of others.Europeans also sense that history is moving against them. At home, politics has become a contest of nostalgias. The rising populist right dreams of an imagined nationalist past, while Europe’s political mainstream behaves like the Prince of Salina himself – trying to prolong the present through tactical adaptation: more debt here, welfare cuts there, deregulation and, above all, yielding to King Trump, who trolls EU leaders on social media and openly insults themas “weak”.Sure, this politics of muddling through has its virtues. Managed decline beats hubris followed by collapse. But there is an alternative to both denial and accommodation.The crucial question behind Tancredi’s aphorism is this: if you adapt so that “everything can remain the same”, what exactly are you trying to preserve?The prince has no convincing answer. He seeks to uphold an order that benefits only himself. Europeans, by contrast, have plenty of allies – if they choose to defend principles such as democracy, the rule of law, a state apparatus we don’t need to live in fear of and the principle of territorial sovereignty. As we saw last week, standing up to Trump on the tariffs he threatened over Greenland paid off. United, Europe is anything but weak.And Europe can retain this sense of purpose if it can focus on the ambition to build an economy that both is successful and allows people to lead meaningful lives. Trying to advance an order that emphasises human needs over the interests of capital is not decadent. Unlike the prince’s world, Europe’s way of life is not doomed – not least because Europeans don’t want to see the continent becoming what Sicily is to Italy in The Leopard: a periphery governed by others.Europeans are still showing signs of resistance: 76% of European citizens rejected last summer’s humiliating trade deal with Trump,pollsshow, and 81% want the EU to build acommon defence and security policy. At 74%,approval of the EUhas never been higher. And as Russia’s war enters its fifth year, European public opinion has remainedcommittedto Ukraine.Yes, Europe will have to change profoundly if it wants to protect what truly matters. Preserving Europe’s ability to choose its own future requires a stronger, more democratic EU. In Davos, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyencalled forletting go of “nostalgia” in the name of building a newly independent Europe.Each humiliation at the hands of Trump, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin makes Europeans more receptive to this case.The real question is thus whether our leaders are ready to drive change rather than merely passively endure it. Or whether, like the prince, they step back from the fight, hoping only to find comfort until their demise. After all, this is the most aristocratic and irresponsible saying of all: après moi, le déluge.Joseph de Weck is a fellow with the Foreign Policy Research InstituteExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionEuropean UnionThe LeopardcommentShareReuse this content"

I got Baudelaire into the lyrics somewhere, too’Interviews by Lee CampbellMon 26 Jan 2026 10.11 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 17.34 ESTShareAlison Goldfrapp, co-member, writer, producerThis song was an ode to glam rock. My older sister was really into Marc Bolan and her passion for him and his sound really rubbed off on me. I love the vocal effects and drum sounds on those old records.I couldn’t think of a lyric for the chorus, though, and I thought to myself: “What do I need?” We’d just been to France, hence the “Ooh la la”, but we wondered if it was sufficient. It felt good, though, so we stayed with it and kept layering the voice and then added these vocoder voices. We liked the synthetic robo feel alongside the natural voice.Simon Cowell made me freeze with frightThe lyrics were personal, about a relationship and how I was feeling. I like to use visual metaphors. The breakdown section, about breaking a heel on a shoe, came from this old 1950s film I’d seen on TV. An image of a woman, walking along the road in a tight pencil skirt, limping because the heel had broken. That stuck with me. I had a book of Baudelaire poems hanging around, so I got him into the lyrics somewhere, too.Portishead’s Adrian Utley, a friend of ours, came in to play guitar, which was quite a departure for us because for ages we wanted to stay clear of guitars. He’s so instinctive the way he plays, incredibly lean with the notes. He got the right tone immediately.For the video, I thought it would be fun to have an imaginary glam rock band. Dawn Shadforth was director, the late Cathy Edwards the stylist. We had some good budgets back then, there was plenty of time to do it all carefully with detail, no rushing.The song gets used in many places. Some requests are pretty funny – often sex scenes. We’re not too precious but we have said no many times, too. I remember performing the song on US TV, being in this freezing cold studio waiting to go on air, and Simon Cowell was standing about six feet away with his arms crossed, doing that thing he does on The X Factor, a rather disapproving expression. He was wearing this pink fluffy jumper, which I became fixated on. “Wow!” he said. “It’s all just kicking off for you in America, isn’t it?” I was already so nervous and him being there and saying that made me freeze with fright.Will Gregory, co-member, writer, producerI was listening to Ooh La La again recently for the first time in ages and was surprised at how little is actually in there. The whole thing hinges on the claps – it’s just claps, bass line, vocal, and a few little stabs from synths and guitars.We used to have this thing of renting spaces – usually slightly chintzy holiday homes – over winter when you could get a six-month let. The more lo-fi, the better. It felt more satisfying than being in a flashy studio. And not being in London was important. A lot of great music comes from that isolation.View image in fullscreen‘We used to have this thing of renting slightly chintzy holiday homes’ … Goldfrapp in the studio.Photograph: Joe DilworthThe song was an outlier because every time we tried to change the chords, we thought: “Why don’t we just stay as we are?” So it’s literally a one-note piece. We were delighted that we’d somehow sidestepped all those complications that usually come with songwriting. I made this mistake one day when I was playing the riff – I’d left a microphone on, so when I played it back, I got the sound of the bassline but also the clatter of the keys. I couldn’t get rid of it because it was all on one track, so it’s in there.I’m old enough to remember the 60s and thinking in the 70s: “Oh no, it’s all over, it’s all gone wrong.” I absolutely hated it after the Stones and the Beatles, but Alison was very good at educating me. I remember her playing me Joan Jett. I needed talking round, but I got it.I didn’t appear in the video. That was probably a mutual choice. Alison has always had this great visual side. I would have looked like Ron Mael, the synth player from Sparks. He used to do nothing – and I always thought I could relate to that.We got Mark “Spike” Stent interested, this amazing mixer who’s had millions of hits. We ended up camping in his studio while he was mixing and we were still writing. I felt like such an amateur – I couldn’t even get a bass track together without splitting it into a mosaic of different parts. But it was exciting, a real whirlwind.The track still seems relevant, partly because of the synths and the simplicity. It doesn’t bed itself into an era particularly, because it’s got this mixture of things boiled down to something without putting a foot too far into any identifiable genre.Supernature byGoldfrapp20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition is out nowExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeGoldfrappElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Melania was directed by Brett Ratner, and has a reported $40m production budget. And, obviously, you’re probably not going to watch it.Of course you’re not. Coming days after thekilling of Alex Prettiby a US Border Patrol agent, an authorised vanity project about the current wife of a globally unpopular political leader – and directed by a manaccused of sexual assault by multiple women(he was never charged, and denies the allegations), and whose production and release carried the smell of institutionalised media timidity – seems like just about the least appealing prospect ever. But, hey, any excuse for a party, right?View image in fullscreenThe popcorn machine.Photograph: @trump.family_usa/InstagramOn Saturday, a special screening of Melania was organised in the White House, in a makeshift cinema that had to be erected due to the ongoing construction ofthe White House ballroom. It was attended by what the Hollywood Reporter describes as “70 assorted VIPs”, including Amazon’s Andy Jassy, Apple’s Tim Cook, Queen Rania of Jordan and Mike Tyson. Amazon has thrown a $35m marketing budget at Melania, some of which could be seen at Saturday’s screening. If the images from the event are any indication, there should be quite a lot of it left over.Guests reportedly left the screening heaving with Melania merch, which included framed Melania screening tickets, black and white cookies bearing the name Melania, a limited-edition version of Melania’s book, Melania, and commemorative black and white Melania popcorn boxes. Additionally, judging by photos of the event, snacks included black and white M&Ms, black and white chocolate-covered pretzels, black and white macarons and a central display of white cake pops. In other words, it’s exactly what you would find at a baby shower thrown for someone who happens to suffer from debilitating achromatopsia.View image in fullscreenAssorted cookies.Photograph: @trump.family_usa/InstagramAnother cute fact about the screening is that, as they arrived, guests were treated to a full military band playing Melania’s Waltz, the central musical theme of the documentary, as written by the film’s composer, Tony Neiman. Obviously, the vast majority of us don’t know what Melania’s Waltz sounds like, but Neiman’s IMDb page lists his work as including eight episodes of Top Chef and 2020’s Russian 3D superhero space opera Cosmoball (‘An enormous spaceship hovers over Earth – this is a stadium, which hosts sports events that resemble soccer but at mind-boggling speeds. The name of the game is cosmoball’) so it’s probably pretty banging.More will follow. On Thursday, the day before the film’s release, Melania will get its official premiere at the recently renamed The Donald J Trump and theJohn F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.Details remain under wraps, but it will be interesting to see how much further a big event like this will be able to push the monochrome look established by the White House screening. Will there be a black carpet? Will the popcorn be black? Will someone be able to dig out and dyeMelania’s terrifying red Christmas treesfrom 2018, so the whole place resembles a nightmarish 1920s German expressionist forest? We wait with bated breath.The trailer for the film.In truth, if you’re able to squint hard enough to detach yourself from the horrors of everything, there’s something sort of sweet about this rollout. Clearly, Melania wishes that her documentary was a Sex and the City-style cultural phenomenon, a stylish and chic luxury brand that all the girlies can enjoy together. Obviously that’s quite hard to accomplish when you’ve convinced a quisling media corporation to finance a $40m ego massage during a tipping point of global insecurity instigated largely by your husband, but you can’t blame a woman for trying.Again, in reality, you’ll probably end up skipping Melania to watch something less depressing, likeDie My Loveor a documentary about asbestos inhalation. That said, the lucky attenders of the White House screening should keep hold of the merchandise they received on Saturday. Sure, a framed and numbered cinema ticket may not have all that much value at the moment. But 50 years from now, any number of upsetting niche collectors will be willing to pay top dollar for it on the dark web. Just be sure to keep it in a safe, to stop it getting destroyed during the upcoming civil war riots.Explore more on these topicsMelania TrumpFilm blogDocumentary filmsDocumentaryShareReuse this content"

Due to the attentions of an overzealous Czech customs guard and the vagaries of the British weather, a happy conclusion had been in doubt to the very end.But last Thursday a small suitcase filled with 681 drawings, love letters, poems and manuscripts created by the Jewish artist and poet Peter Kien in the Theresienstadt ghetto in German-occupiedCzechoslovakiabetween 1941 and 1944 finally made a blustery landing at Heathrow.From there, the treasures were transported to their new home: the WienerHolocaustLibrary in central London, where Judy King, 66, was anxiously waiting for them. She was keeping a promise she had made to her mother, Helga Wolfenstein, beside her deathbed in 2003.Wolfenstein had been Kien’s lover in the ghetto. He had handed her the small caramel-brown suitcase on the evening before he was transported to the Auschwitz death camp, where he was murdered at the age of 25 along with his parents, Leonard and Olga, and his estranged wife, Ilse Stránská.View image in fullscreenOne of the hundreds of artworks Peter Kien entrusted to Helga Wolfenstein in 1944.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianWolfenstein’s mother, Hermine, was matron of the infectious diseases ward in the ghetto, and it was here where they hid the suitcase from the occupying forces, on the correct assumption the Nazis would balk at the risks of entering such a place.When what was left of Theresienstadt was liberated in 1945, Wolfenstein left Prague for Libya, where her brother-in-law was working for the British as a doctor, before she moved on to England.She had known that the communists now in charge of Czechoslovakia would not let her take the suitcase out of Prague, so she had left it with her aunt, Julia Fleischerova. She could not have foreseen the deception of a man called Karl Finger.“Her aunt was elderly and had a handyman who discovered the contents of the suitcase being artworks in the 1970s,” King said. “He was a communist informant and he notified the authorities that the old woman had something of value.”Officials came to see the aunt and gave her a choice: hand over the suitcase and everything in it or face losing the pension on which her survival depended.“She was heartbroken,” King said. “She wrote very tragic letters to my mother about having to give her suitcase away. And so the communists took it.”View image in fullscreenA crate containing Kien’s suitcase arrives at the Weiner Holocaust Library in London last week.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianWhen the Velvet Revolution ended communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989, the works and the suitcase were taken in by the country’s Terezín Memorial, a museum commemorating those who died in the ghetto.The staff asked Wolfenstein for her permission to display the art, capturing the people and scenes in the ghetto, for a one-off exhibition and she agreed. But when she asked for their subsequent return, the museum steadfastly refused.“The Nazis were meticulous record keepers, but the communists were terrible record keepers,” King said. “So the communists didn’t even write down the name of my mother’s aunt or the address or anything from where they had taken the suitcase.“The museum was like, well, you know, ‘show us provenance’. ‘Why don’t you have a receipt from camp that shows that the suitcase had been legally authorised and given to you?’ And of course, no one had such a thing.”Wolfenstein was passionate about the return of what was known as suitcase #681, King added. “My mother spoke seven languages and she wrote in English, Czech and German to museums and institutions across the world trying to get support in recovering her suitcase.“People were sympathetic but they weren’t willing to fund anything or to put their name to it. She worked for 33 years to try to recover this suitcase and its contents, and at her deathbed I made her a promise. I said: ‘I will finish your work.’”King said her mother, who died aged 81, was almost obsessed by her mission. “Part of the difficulty was that she would begin letters to the Terezín people with ‘You thieves’ instead of ‘Dear Sir or Madam’. I said: ‘Oh, I can see how they will want to help now.’”View image in fullscreenKien’s work records scenes of everyday life from the Theresienstadt ghetto during the 1940s.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianIn 2017, King visited the Terezín Memorial with her cousin, Peter. “We talked with them and they said, you know, ‘we couldn’t work with your mother but we can work with you’,” she recalled. Yet it took nearly another decade to bring the suitcase and its contents to the UK.“They needed a lot of advice from the National Gallery in Prague about how to do everything,” King said. “Part of the difficulty was that the artworks were considered to be national treasures, and so there was enormous national reluctance to part with them.”The museum was under pressure, however, as the German writer Jürgen Serke championed a campaign for it to give up the works, while King – who was born in the US and lives in Florida – encouraged American officials to support her.There were wrinkles to iron out. “They said: ‘Oh, if only you had something that had your mother’s signature that said she bequeaths it to you.’ And I said: ‘Well, funny you should say that, I have exactly that document.’“As a Holocaust survivor, my mother was extremely paranoid, and she wrote a document saying that the suitcases and the artworks were her possession, that I was her only heir and that she willed them to me. She dated it. She had notarised the signature and the date. So [the museum] was satisfied.View image in fullscreenJudy King.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian“But it was still touch and go. At the last minute, the customs department said: ‘Oh, a handwritten document is no good. It must be a court-appointed document.’“Just this week, we thought all of these efforts had come to naught, but our friend, who has been coordinating all the efforts with the shippers in London and in Prague, somehow managed to pull strings. Customs relented and the artworks left Prague. But then they had trouble landing in London – you had a great deal of wind.”King concluded that her mother – an anglophile who worked for the Post Office in London and became a British citizen before she settled in America – would have been thrilled to know that the artworks had been donated to the Wiener Holocaust Library.Howard Falksohn, the London institution’s senior archivist, said it was “most grateful for this wonderful donation” ahead of International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Tuesday.The documents join nearly 100 other Kien works held in the library’s archive that were smuggled out by King’s cousin Peter during the communist era.Explore more on these topicsUK newsHolocaustSecond world warJudaismCzech RepublicCzechoslovakiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

André Is an Idiot, the result, mixes in stop-motion puppetry to create an astonishing record of an extraordinary lifeTim JonzeMon 26 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareWhen André Ricciardi turned 50, his best friend Lee made an unusual proposition: how about they go and get a colonoscopy together? The pair had reached the qualifying age for men in the US to access the health check, and Lee had visions of them farting merrily on adjacent toilets while the medication flushed out their bowels, then chatting on hospital beds as tiny cameras travelled through their anal passages. André was always up for ridiculous stuff, but on this occasion he surprised Lee: he said no.“I was 100% shocked,” says Lee today. “I actually got jealous because I assumed he must have organised to go with somebody else!” But André had not made other colonoscopy plans. He just thought it was a crazy idea and for once, he was being sensible. That turned out to be the stupidest thing he’d ever done. Eighteen months later, perturbed by blood in his stools, André did go for a colonoscopy. It turned out he had stage 4 cancer.André bought a pair of Kim Kardashian’s old leather trousers at an auction in the hope of cloning her DNA“I hadn’t spoken to André in probably five years,” says Tony Benna, director of a moving – and hilarious – new documentary called André Is an Idiot. “Then I get this email from him and Lee saying, ‘We’ve got a great idea for a film. Can we meet on Zoom?’” Benna was excited. He had worked with André, a maverick advertising creative from San Francisco, on numerous projects. “We’d go shoot with Ozzy Osbourne, or meet Eminem, or hang out with the guitar technician for the Rolling Stones. And somehow you’d tie that back to, like, Dove soap or something.”The next day, on screen, André told him: “I have cancer and I’ll probably be dead in three years. Want to make a film about it?”View image in fullscreenHis hair grew back even wilder ... Ricciardi in André Is an Idiot.Photograph: A24It was a lot to process, says Benna. He didn’t particularly want to make a maudlin film about cancer, but hehadalways wanted to make one about André. “He’s one of the most insane people I’ve ever met. He had so many wild stories. I wanted to get to the bottom of them.”And so, Benna soon discovered, André really did once buy a pair of Kim Kardashian’s old leather trousers at auction in the hope of cloning her DNA. He really did have to pull splinters out of his penis after a masturbation experiment gone wrong in his grandparents’ bathroom. He really did read Helter Skelter, a book about the Manson murders, to his daughter while she was recovering from surgery in hospital.Then there was the wedding story. In the 1990s – during what friends call André’s “bathrobe era” since he spent an entire year wearing one – he was out drinking when he overheard the server asking a friend to marry her so she could get a green card. The friend declined, so André piped up: “I’ll do it!”André had a girlfriend at the time (“She didn’t take it very well”) and Janice the bartender was seeing someone too, so the marriage was to be strictly platonic. Yet somehow, this fake couple ended up wangling their way on to Newlyweds, the US gameshow in which couples compete to show how well they know their new partner. André devised an ingenious plan: when asked multiple choice questions separately, they would each select the answer that, going by its first letter, came latest in the alphabet.“I don’t know how legal it was,” laughs Janice today. Probably not very – but it worked. The pair won a holiday to the Caribbean where, somewhat inconveniently, they fell in love.View image in fullscreen‘He had so much more to do’ … André Is an Idiot.Photograph: A24Although André, with his wild hair and explosion of ideas, is the star of the film, Janice is the understated hero, always there crossing her fingers for positive test results, keeping the house running and nursing André as he gets sicker. Her presence adds emotional depth to what might otherwise be a series of wacky adventures, of which there are many. At one point, André considers making a hard copy of his genome so he can return as a clone. He visits a teacher of “death yells” – basically, a rehearsal for the last sound you will ever make on Earth. And he pitches a TV show called Who Wants to Kill Me? in which contestants compete for the chance to finish André off in imaginative ways (fed to lions? Cooked by a chef with a thing for human flesh?).“He was so serious about that idea, we actually went to Hollywood to pitch it,” says Benna. “We got turned down, so then he went out on Hollywood Boulevard, asking people if they would watch this show, so we could go back and say, ‘Look, all these people want to see it!’” He wouldn’t really have let someone turn him into soup, though, would he? Benna laughs. “You never knew. It was a little scary at times – because you weren’t sure if he was actually going to get a head transplant.”Part of Benna’s job was to just roll with André. “If he wanted to go to a Radon mine and breathe radioactive air, we went. If he wanted to do a crystal healing session, we did it. If he wanted to do nine grams of mushrooms, we were OK with that.”It’s riotous fun. Benna uses stop-motion animation to recreate some scenes. In one, clumps of André’s fallen chemo hair are brought to life. When André’s dad, an intensely private man, refuses to appear on camera, they hire a lookalike. This turns out to be the legendary weed smoker Tommy Chong.View image in fullscreen‘One of the most insane people I’ve ever met’ ... a moment of defiance in the film.Photograph: A24The pace is frenetic, but there’s a point to it. “We’re all going to go through this at some point,” says Benna. “And there are different ways to approach it. You don’t have to be scared. You don’t have to be angry. You can approach it with humour, with friends, with art. I think that message has resonated.”At the start, André declares: “You only have time in life to get good at one or two things – and I choseadvertising. What the fuck is wrong with me? What a waste of a life!” But he gets a chance to find meaning in his work, creating a campaign encouraging men to get their colon checked (it revolves around everyday items that look like sphincters).André is forced to confront difficult parts of his past. The love he has for his two girls is undeniable, but he is not always affectionate. He never hugs them. “He won’t talk about pain and fear,” one of them says, “which is hard for my mum.”But it’s Andre’s conversations with his therapist, Peter, that take the film to another level. Peter loves André’s jokes but realises they’re often a defence mechanism to avoid confronting difficult emotions. “You are more than just your irreverent humour,” he tells André.“Without Peter, I’m not sure the film would have had much direction,” says Benna. “Peter helped André grieve his own situation, but also let his family grieve. André learned to be vulnerable and humble. That allowed him to appreciate the life he lived and the love that was all around him.”“I was surprised at how willing he was to talk,” says Janice. “The film was a wonderful way for him to think about his path and what was valuable in his life.”André copes with chemo incredibly well. “I prepared myself by getting the worst hangovers for 30 years,” he says in the doc. But eventually it stops working. His belly swells, his hair grows back crazier than ever and he develops long eyelashes. He starts to resemble a wild mystic sat atop a mountain. And the changes are not just physical: spiritually, his transformation is even greater, providing the film with a powerful climax and sense of closure.“He had so much more to do,” says Janice, who lost her soulmate in December 2023. “So many more stories, so much creativity. And he would have made a great cranky old man.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re all going to go through this. You don’t have to be scared’ … another stop-motion image from André Is an Idiot.Photograph: A24When Janice heard the film had won the audience award at last year’s Sundance festival, she pulled her car over and cried. Nobody had expected the film to even get a showing there. Benna hadn’t even RSVPd. “There was a standing ovation and it felt surreal, like I was floating,” he says. “People came up to me and said they wished they’d seen it when they’d been diagnosed, because they would have felt less afraid, less angry, less isolated.”Then there are all those who got colonoscopies because of the film. “I’ve had at least three dozen people say the film saved their life, because they got checked and caught something early.”Lee asked Andre, shortly before he died, how he’d sum up the previous three years. “André said, ‘The best years of my life.’” Janice, who was in the room at the time making a sandwich, shouted out: “Mine too!” Lee realised it was the same for him.Despite the heartbreaking outcome, they’d spent three precious years making countless memories with their crazy friend. “It brought us all together in a really intense, emotional way,” says Lee. “I honestly think this was part of André’s master plan all along.”André Is an Idiot is in UK cinemas from 6 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmCancerHealthDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He recalls their charged harmonies in the little shed at the bottom of his gardenSam AmidonMon 26 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 06.48 ESTShareI was brought into The History of Sound as the music adviser, my main job being singing coach for the cast, especiallyPaul Mescal and Josh O’Connor.My parents were folk educators. I grew up in New England, singing and playing all kinds of different folk including Appalachian fiddle tunes, as well as songs from the British Isles. My parents’ favourites were legendary Yorkshire singing family the Watersons. I now live in London and it was amazing how close History of Sound’s musical world matched my own.Ben Shattuck– who wrote the original short stories and the screenplay – made a playlist of all these different types of musicso everybody could get a sense of the film’s world.It made me remember hitchhiking through Ireland with my best friend, singing Talking Heads songsIt’s set around the first world war, so I pointed the actors at recordings of the era, such asAlmeda Riddle, an amazing ballad-singer from the Ozarks who had this idea of “getting behind the song”. Paul is from Ireland and had an immediate connection to folk music. Josh was familiar with traditional music and had done some singing in musical theatre and choirs – but within just three weeks, they had to look as if they’d been singing their entire lives. Their vocals in the film are sung live on camera, in the moment. When I saw the finished film, I understood how crucial this was to the organic development of the scenes.They would both come to the little shed-studio at the bottom of my garden: we’d have an hour or so together each time and I’d sing and show different approaches. Actors make amazing students. They have little time so their attitude is: “I need to get this now.” I have a distinct memory of Josh standing just inches from my face, studying every element of how my voice was producing sound, and Paul breaking out into a huge grin and grabbing Josh and I on the shoulders when we nailed a three-part harmony.View image in fullscreen‘Their enthusiasm was real’ … Amidon.Photograph: Steve GullickThe thing about singing is that the voice is much more intensely connected to your emotions than other instruments are. When teaching guitar, you can point people’s fingers to the right place,but with the voice it’s all internal. So for me, teaching singing is about helping people get comfortable, finding the natural sound in their voice, and not being scared of it.We made some pre-recordings in a studio in New York as a reference for singing on set and as a way to heighten the focus for the actors. They really engagedas musicians: Josh working on his piano parts, Paul coming up with harmonies. Paul really connected with the lonesome feel of the songSilver Dagger. And the enthusiasm for the music was real: I heard they were singing the songs down the street on their way back from the studio, just like Lionel and David do walking through the woods in the film. It made me remember hitchhiking through Ireland with my best friend, singing Talking Heads songs.I was not on set, but during filming, some of the cast and crew came to one of my gigs. My mom met everyone backstage and immediately started singing the Watersons’ song Country Life to Paul, who joined right in.Oliver Coates, who composed the score, was aware of my dad Peter Amidon’s choral arrangements, and actually used his arrangement of All is Well in the Oxford scene where Paul’s character Lionel is conducting the choir. Dad died in October and was able to see the film not long before. Hs role in the film was especially meaningful to me.‘You have to get behind the song’: singer Sam Amidon on fronting Bon Iver, schooling Paul Mescal and the new folk revivalRead moreWhen I saw the finished film, it was moving and magical to see how comfortable the actors were when singing: it didn’t feel academic or that they had just learned a style. There’s an incredible scene where Lionel’s father has just died. Lionel’s at a bonfire, there are musicians there playing, and he goes into a kind of reverie. It really captures something about a folk festival at night, but of course it’s mixed with his profound grief and the catharsis of that moment.I hope the film inspires people to explore this music. Folk is the poetic record of people who would make up songs to sing to themselves as they worked or travelled. It’s our only record of the internal emotional landscape of working people of those eras, as very few would have publishedbooks. The deeper theme of the film is the longing around love and a pain which never goes away. This is what a lot of these ballads have preserved – and the songs are still speaking to us 100 years later.The History of Sound is in cinemas nowThis article was amended on 26 January 2026.

Come Over to My House, co-written with musician Eliza Hull and illustrated by Daniel Gray-Barnett, is a rhyming picture book that explores the home lives of children and parents who are d/Deaf or disabled. I am so proud to have been a part of creating this book, and so thrilled to see it on this list among so many extraordinary titles.Some of the books on this list were created by dear friends and peers. Others are books I read to my children when they were young. It’s wonderful to see so many Australian picture books have stood the test of time, passed down from one generation to the next. Many of these picture books hold such a strong place in our hearts because they represent a cherished time in our childhoods: memories of being cuddled on someone’s lap, or sitting cross-legged on a mat listening to a beloved adult fill the room with funny voices.Unlike most books, picture books are primarily created to read aloud. Along with being a lovely way to connect with a child, reading aloud is a vital first step to developing literacy. It expands vocabulary, enhances brain development and develops what is called “phonological awareness” – helping children become familiar with rhythms and patterns in language. Research shows that regularly reading aloud to your child from a young age gives them a clear advantage when they start school.Australia’s best children’s picture book poll - vote nowRead moreSadly, many adults stop reading picture books to children when they have developed the skills to read for themselves. Sometimes that is because the child believes they have outgrown them, declaring “picture books are for babies”. Nothing could be further from the truth. Often children’s authors will use more complex vocabulary and sophisticated storytelling in a picture book than they would in an early chapter book, which usually aims to introduce a familiar but limited vocabulary, as well as simple storylines, for a child to decode on their own.And the text is just half of the story; illustrators don’t just draw what is written in the words but add another layer of meaning, often carrying the book’s emotional weight. In the Guardian’s list of the best 50 books, children can imagine what it might feel like to be a wombat, a fox, a possum or a bunyip. They can learn how to be proud of their differences, or discover how similar they are to someone who might appear different to them. There are books that act as mirrors, and others as windows. Reading develops empathy and I am heartened to see how diverse this selection is, and how many of these books portray the lives of such a wide range of children.As my co-author, Eliza Hull, says: “Growing up with a disability, I remember not seeing myself in any of the picture books I was read, and I wish the books that exist today had been around then, because I would have felt far less alone.” Or our illustrator Daniel Gray-Barnett, who discovered from working on this book that he has autism-spectrum disorder: “Knowing this about myself has explained so much to me about how my brain works and why I am the way I am. This book has changed my life. I’m so glad it came to me when it did.”You never know: a book on this wonderful list could change your child’s life. Or even your own.Sally Rippin is an award-winning children’s author and the outgoing Australian children’s laureate for 2024-25.

But beneath panicked viewers’ sweaty palms, there was a queasy truth about the future of televisionStuart HeritageMon 26 Jan 2026 07.19 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 12.53 ESTShareWell, have your balls descended back out of your body yet? Netflix’s Skyscraper Live has been and gone, and it may well qualify as the single most stressful viewing experience on record. Alex Honnold’s unassisted ascent of the 508 metre Taipei 101 was an absolutely extraordinary achievement. Whether or not it represents the future of television, though, is a completely different matter.Honnold’s work is already well-known. As the star ofFree Solo– a feature documentary once again so nerve-racking that the only way to comfortably enjoy it was under the influence of industrial sphincter relaxants – he has long been the poster boy of people climbing up stuff without ropes.But the difference between Free Solo and Skyscraper Live is vast. The former was a meticulously structured account of his attempt to climb El Capitan unaided, edited to wring out the maximum level of drama possible. The latter was just footage of him climbing up a building for an hour and a half. Obviously, the risk factor for the viewer was amplified enormously, because – unlike Free Solo, which could have been retroactively reedited in the event of an accident – Skyscraper Live had nowhere to hide.View image in fullscreenNerve-racking … Alex Honnold in Skyscraper Live.Photograph: Chong Kok-yew/NetflixHowever, an hour and a half is a long time to watch anything. And in the case of Skyscraper Live, you were essentially watching a guy repeat the same set of movements hundreds of times in a row. You invariably kept finding yourself zoning out a little, maybe checking your phone or going to make a cup of tea, because the human mind simply wasn’t designed to sustain a state of panic for that long. In effect, the act of watching Skyscraper Live was like taking a long-haul flight in turbulent weather, with long periods of boredom spiked with moments of sheer panic.At least Honnold and his team can be congratulated for picking an incredibly dramatic skyscraper to climb. Taipei 101 seems like it was custom-made for this sort of thing, consisting of three clear stages that aggressively ramp up in terms of difficulty. There were heights. There were overhangs. Towards the end, at the first part of the structure’s spire, there was a moment when Honnold had to climb outwards at a 45-degree angle, up a portion of building that didn’t appear to have much for him to hold on to. I just watched it back – having seen it once and knowing how it ends – and my palms instantly became sweaty. Even watching him stand up straight at the summit gave me the same sort of fizzy-tummy panic you get when you see that your toddler has got into the knife drawer.Which is to say that it was exceptional, but also: should we really be making entertainment predicated on the possibility that someone might die? Because as much as you can admire Honnold’s athleticism and pluck, you watched Skyscraper Live for the jeopardy of it. Even if you pushed it all the way down to the pit of your stomach, a tiny part of you knew that you were tuning in to the possibility that he might slip and fall to his death.There are plenty of events where this is implied – I maintain that most of the people who watch Formula One do so for the crashes – but there was something gaudily explicit about this. The closest example I can think of is when Red Bull paid Felix Baumgartner to jump from a height of 24 miles in 2012. There was the same giddy excitement leading up to the broadcast of the jump. And then, when he entered an uncontrolled, life-threatening spin after 90 seconds, there was the same sense of grim self-examination. You realised that you were simply a rubbernecker, tuning in to the macabre possibility that something would go wrong.I suspect that isn’t how Netflix wants to market itself – Home of People Plummeting Off Buildings (and Stranger Things) – which means that Skyscraper Live should remain a one-off.If it decides to capitalise on the success of this by commissioning more live events that could result in the death of a human being – Free Diving Live, or Rooftop Parkour Live, or even Eating a Steak Sandwich Without Chewing It Properly Live – it runs the risk of turning the future of television into a Victorian freak show. It’s better than that. And, besides, my sphincter couldn’t take it.Skyscraper Live is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionNetflixExtreme sportsTaiwanAsia PacificRock climbingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In this time of doom and gloom, we need to talk about thatJames MurphyWhy do we focus on the bad news stories about cuts and crises in classical music ? Musicians are doing incredible things to engage, support and sustain us; we should tell those stories tooMon 26 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 07.18 ESTShareWhen did you last read a good news story about classical music?Think of the stories that have made the headlines in recent years: fundingcuts to national opera companies, closurethreats to university musicdepartments,councils axing local provision,classroom music-makingin decline.Successes reported only tend to be reprieves or salvages in the face of such crises, fought for by a sector running out of fuel to keep defending itself. Each new bombshell raises stress and antagonism among music-makers on social media, intensifying the gloom.I know these are dark days generally, with bad news in every walk of life, but think of the music. If you’re a fan, you surely rely on its vitality, how it speaks to your emotions and uplifts or consoles you at times of need. Even if classical music is not your cup of tea, it’s unlikely you find it harmful or condemnable. How then has the narrative around it veered from the spirit of the thing itself?Recall the pioneering deeds of broadcasterSir Humphrey Burton, who died last month. When television first cast its spell, vanguards such as Burton seized the medium to make the case for music. In shows including Monitor, Omnibus, Aquarius, Arena and BBC Young Musician, Humphrey and colleagues put classical music on mainstream TV channels and on everyone’s radar.View image in fullscreenThe Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment’s Breaking Bach with choreography by Kim Brandstrup. The 2025 show is an RPS awards 2026 nominee.Photograph: © Edinburgh International Festival / Tommy Ga-Ken WanToday, the internet and streaming offer access to more music than ever before. But it offers more ofeverything. In that vast sprawl, musical advocates can less readily capture the public’s attention than Burton did when there were just three or four TV channels for UK viewers to watch. We’re also challenged with how to compress the expansive wonders of symphonies and operas into digital formats designed to hold the attention for 30 seconds.Classical musicis simply no longer on everyone’s radar. This diminished presence takes its toll and funders and opinion formers read less visibility as less relevance. Then the cuts, closures and negative headlines come our way.We need to reset the story. We need to measure up to the energy and imagination of the music and those who create it. We need to make a more compelling case for why classical music matters, accounting the difference it makes to so many lives.We sensitive souls disposed to the arts can be quite bashful articulating such matters. Let me try to crystallise what classical music has done for me: it has given me my calling, my voice, my confidence and my tribe. The dedication and integrity that composers and performers invest in their craft has compelled me to live by such virtues myself. Watching musicians onstage, I regularly witness the best of humanity, striving together to give the best of themselves for the benefit of others. Performing sublime music that’s sometimes centuries old, classical musicians reassure us that good things endure. They remind us that, if we can find meaning and resonance in what a composer had to say generations ago, we can surely find commonality and connection with each other in today’s world.In today’s unsettled times, what a precious force. On which note, I can’t think of any classical music organisation in the UK today that isn’t actively discovering how focused, informed engagement in its community can have a positive impact on multiple aspects of healthcare.Classical music surely deserves brighter exposure than it currently gets.One way we are trying to do this is via theRoyal Philharmonic Societyawards, whoseshortlist we announce today. Each year, our judging panels are overwhelmed by all the incredible things musicians are doing to engage, to entertain, to support and to sustain us all. Take this year’s nominees. They include luminaries such as conductor John Wilson. With his Sinfonia of London, Wilson pursues an Olympian level of musical excellence that’s gripping audiences in bestselling albums and sell-out concerts around the UK. Also nominated is the star soprano Louise Alder who dazzled at the BBC Last Night of the Proms, and composer Mark-Anthony Turnage, whose Festen at Covent Garden was a powerful reminder that the UK produces some of the greatest and most compelling opera in the world.View image in fullscreenCompelling … Natalya Romaniw (Helena), Stéphane Degout (Michael) and Julian Hubbard (Lars) in the RPS nominated Festen by Mark-Anthony Turnage at the Royal Opera House.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe RPS awards don’t just celebrate star talent. Among the nominees are unsung heroes, with great tales to tell. Take the Welsh community of Gresford who created an opera to commemorate the village’s mining disaster of 1934. In this, music brought people together, giving multiple generations a voice and a refreshed sense of the values that unite them.Take the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, who last year not only recorded its highest-ever ticket sales, but delivered interactive music-making projects for over 70,000 people, including its Big Music Weekend – collaborating with jazz and soul artists, and local chefs and breweries – in Glasgow’s deprived ward of Anderston.Take Sean Chandler, principal cornet of the amateur Shepherd Brass Band in York. Sean establishedI Can Play Brass Roots– an initiative that’s helping hearing d/Deaf children in York to feel heard and valued by teaching them brass instruments and playing as a band.These aren’t isolated ventures. They are representative of what all UK classical music-makers do. So many good deeds, so many good news stories. At a time of global woe, we should cherish and embrace this extraordinary infantry.View image in fullscreenGresffordd: I’r Goleuni ‘Nawr - a community opera based on the Gresford mining disaster, a 2026 RPS awards nominee.Photograph: Stephen CainHere we can take heart that a growing audience recognises classical music’s worth. In a Royal Philharmonic Orchestra survey in 2023, 84% of adults said they would like to experience a live orchestral concert. Last year, BBC Radio 3 reported an audience of 2.15m listeners in a single quarter – its largest since the pandemic – and the BBC Proms last year enjoyed a record-breaking digital audience, with more than 10m TV viewers and six million streams. Audiences are integral to classical music and it’s vital we find every way to ensure they are recognised. While many awards shows are just for the glitterati, we particularly welcome the music-loving public to attend the RPS awards – they are part of the story we have to tell.Humphrey Burton himself was a driving force in launching the RPS awards. Tributes to him last month talked of how he led a golden age for classical music storytelling. This is true, but he did more than that: he gave us the blueprint, showed us the zeal, and passed us the torch, to keep classical music in the hearts and minds of the nation, where it positively belongs.James Murphy is the chief executive of the Royal Philharmonic Society.The Royal Philharmonic Society awards are at Queen Elizabeth Hall , London, on 12 March.

In May, he released a song called Heil Hitler, which sampled a speech by Hitler and praised the Nazi leader. The song was banned in Germany owing to laws against hate speech and extremism, but went viral online. Last week, rightwing influencers including Andrew Tate and Nick Fuentes were filmed making Nazi salutes to the song as it played in a Miami Beach nightclub. West also engaged in Holocaust-denial.“One of the difficult aspects of having bipolar type-1 are the disconnected moments – many of which I still cannot recall – that led to poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body-experience,” he wrote. “I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability, treatment, and meaningful change. It does not excuse what I did though.”West traced his condition back to the car accident in 2002. He had his jaw wired shut in the aftermath, which inspired his debut single, that year’s Through the Wire. “At the time, the focus was on the visible damage – the fracture, the swelling and the immediate physical trauma,” he wrote. “The deeper injury, the one inside my skull, went unnoticed.”He said that his brain injury wasn’t properly diagnosed until 2023. “That medical oversight caused serious damage to my mental health and led to my bipolar type-1 diagnosis”, which he received in 2016.West wrote that in early 2025, he experienced a four-month manic episode “psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life”, which caused him to experience suicidal ideation. He wrote that after hitting rock bottom in recent months, his wife, the Australian architect and performance artist Bianca Censori, whom he married in 2022, encouraged him to get help.West wrote candidly about his mental health experiences, and highlighted the mortality rate – “on par with severe heart disease, type 1 diabetes, HIV and cancer” – associated with his condition. “Bipolar disorder comes with its own defense system. Denial. When you’re manic, you don’t think you’re sick. You think everyone else is overreacting. You feel like you’re seeing the world more clearly than ever, when in reality you’re losing your grip entirely.“The scariest thing about this disorder is how persuasive it is when it tells you: You don’t need help. It makes you blind, but convinced you have insight. You feel powerful, certain, unstoppable.”He confessed to treating his loved ones – presumably among them his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, and particularly their eldest daughter, North West – “the worst”, writing that they “endured fear, confusion, humiliation, and the exhaustion of trying to have someone who was, at times, unrecognizable”.West also apologised to the Black community. In recent years, he made comments suggesting that slavery was “a choice”,wore a T-shirt bearing the slogan “white lives matter”and appropriated the Confederate flag. “The Black community is, unquestionably, the foundation of who I am. I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us.”He said that he had found solace in Reddit forums reading of other people’s experiences with manic and depressive episodes. “I read their stories and realized that I was not alone. It’s not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day and being told by the so-called best doctors in the world that I am not bipolar, but merely experiencing ‘symptoms of autism’.”West wrote that medication, therapy, exercise and “clean living” had helped him find clarity, and encouraged him to channel his efforts into making “positive, meaningful art”.West’s current slated album is known as Bully. Its release has been delayed several times, and at one stage was scheduled for 30 January.“I’m not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness,” West concluded. “I write today simply to ask for your patience and understanding as I find my way home.”Ye’s letter in fullTo Those I’ve Hurt:Twenty-five years ago, I was in a car accident that broke my jaw and caused injury to the right frontal lobe of my brain. At the time, the focus was on the visible damage – the fracture, the swelling, and the immediate physical trauma. The deeper injury, the one inside my skull, went unnoticed.Comprehensive scans were not done, neurological exams were limited, and the possibility of a frontal-lobe injury was never raised. It wasn’t properly diagnosed until 2023. That medical oversight caused serious damage to my mental health and led to my bipolar type-1 diagnosis.Bipolar disorder comes with its own defense system. Denial. When you’re manic, you don’t think you’re sick. You think everyone else is overreacting. You feel like you’re seeing the world more clearly than ever, when in reality you’re losing your grip entirely.Once people label you as “crazy,” you feel as if you cannot contribute anything meaningful to the world. It’s easy for people to joke and laugh it off when in fact this is a very serious debilitating disease you can die from. According to the World Health Organization and Cambridge University, people with bipolar disorder have a life expectancy that is shortened by 10 to 15 years on average, and a 2x-3x higher all-cause mortality rate than the general population. This is on par with severe heart disease, type 1 diabetes, HIV, and cancer – all lethal and fatal if left untreated.The scariest thing about this disorder is how persuasive it is when it tells you: You don’t need help. It makes you blind, but convinced you have insight. You feel powerful, certain, unstoppable.I lost touch with reality. Things got worse the longer I ignored the problem. I said and did things I deeply regret. Some of the people I love the most, I treated the worst. You endured fear, confusion, humiliation, and the exhaustion of trying to have someone who was, at times, unrecognizable. Looking back, I became detached from my true self.In that fractured state, I gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika, and even sold T-shirts bearing it. One of the difficult aspects of having bipolar type-1 are the disconnected moments - many of which I still cannot recall - that led to poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body-experience. I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability, treatment, and meaningful change. It does not excuse what I did though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I love Jewish people.To the black community - which held me down through all of the highs and lows and the darkest of times. The black community is, unquestionably, the foundation of who I am. I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us.In early 2025, I fell into a four-month long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life. As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn’t want to be here any more.Having bipolar disorder is notable state of constant mental illness. When you go into a manic episode, you are ill at that point. When you are not in an episode, you are completely “normal”. And that’s when the wreckage from the illness hits the hardest. Hitting rock bottom a few months ago, my wife encouraged me to finally get help.I have found comfort in Reddit forums of all places. Different people speak of being in manic or depressive episodes of a similar nature. I read their stories and realized that I was not alone. It’s not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day and being told by the so-called best doctors in the world that I am not bipolar, but merely experiencing “symptoms of autism”.My words as a leader in my community have global impact and influence. In my mania, I lost complete sight of that.As I find my new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise and clean living, I have newfound, much-needed clarity. I am pouring my energy into positive, meaningful art: music, clothing, design and other new ideas to help the world.I’m not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness.

Of course it’s daunting to be following in the footsteps of Prue Leith and Mary Berry before her, great dames both, but I’m also bubbling with excitement.The Great British Bake Offis more than a television programme, it’s a national treasure – and it’s a huge honour to be entrusted with it.”Leith says: “I’m thrilled that Nigella is to experience brilliant Bake Off. She’s sassy, fun and she knows her onions – and her croissants, cake and crumble.”The TV chef has taken a break from British screens in recent years. Her last series, Nigella’s Cook, Eat, Repeat aired on BBC One in 2020, and she has appeared more on Australian television in the years since. She was a judge on the Australian culinary competition My Kitchen Rules in 2022 and 2023, having previously been a guest judge on the country’s version of MasterChef.‘The only woman for the job!’ Nigella Lawson must be the new Bake Off judgeRead moreLawson has worked on Channel 4 before, with her first cooking series Nigella Bites appearing on the station. She was also previously a judge on a culinary show for the broadcaster whenshe appeared on The Taste, in which contestants prepared a single spoon of food for her, Anthony Bourdain and French chef Ludo Lefebvre.She joins The Great British Bake Off at a point when its ratings are far below their peak. On Channel 4 the show has never reached the viewing figures it achieved on BBC One, where it averaged 10 million viewers, butwas nonetheless been a ratings success forthe broadcaster. In recent years, however, numbers have slipped, declining every year since 2020 – bar the 2025 series, which rose by about 600,000 from 2024 to a total of 7.26 million for the first episode of season 16.Channel 4’s Ian Katz said: “We’re incredibly excited about the marriage of two great British icons: Bake Off and Nigella … this summer’s series will be as mouthwatering a prospect as her chocolate Guinness cake.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe Great British Bake OffNigella LawsonFood TVnewsShareReuse this content"

The organisers asked for a 10-minute “respectful” event at sunset on Park City’s Main Streetto memorialise Renee Good, who was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent on 7 January, and Alex Pretti, who was killed on Saturday by an agent of the Department of Homeland Security.Footage of the protest posted by Deadlineshowed participants holding up their lit phones and chanting “love melts ICE” as a small group of law enforcement officials looked on.Deadline reported that Lord of the Rings actor Elijah Wood was among the protesters, and told the publication: “The folks who have been unlawfully gunned down in Minnesota – it’s awful. Here we are at this film festival that is about bringing people together; it’s about telling stories from all over the world. We’re not divided here; we’re coming together.”Notable among figures making statementshas been actor Natalie Portman, who wore “ICE out” and “Be Good” pins while conducting media duties at the festival. Portman also told Deadline: “What’s going on in this country right now is absolutely horrific. What the federal government, Trump’s government, Kristi Noem, ICE – what they’re doing is really the worst of the worst of humanity.”Actor and director Olivia Wilde also commented on the shootings on Saturday,telling Variety: “I’m appalled and sickened. We can’t go another day just sort of accepting this as our new norm. It’s outrageous. People are being murdered … And so if we can do anything out here to support the movement to cast ICE out, to delegitimise this unbelievably criminal organisation, then that’s what we should be doing.”Explore more on these topicsFilmSundance 2026Sundance film festivalNatalie PortmanOlivia WildeICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)FestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

As NERD, they released five albums.Lawyers for Hugo allege that Williams, in his own right a producer for artists including Kendrick Lamar, Ed Sheeran and the Weeknd, has withheld royalties and shares from touring income and merchandising, and that he refused to share documents that would clarify Hugo’s earnings despite repeat demands for financial disclosure. Hugo’s lawyers say the demands were ignored or met only with “limited” and “incomplete” documentation in “a breach of the operating agreement”.They estimate that the earnings due to Hugo from No One Ever Really Dies could exceed “$750k-$1m”.They claim Williams perpetuated a “systematic denial” of Hugo’s rights, alleging that he engaged in “self-dealing, concealed material information and … diverted revenues owed to plaintiff. Such wilful, fraudulent and malicious conduct warrants the imposition of punitive damages.”A representative for Williamstold Billboard magazinethat a standard accounting review was under way. “The lawsuit filed is premature as there may not even be a dispute between the parties.“If the accounting review determines that money is owed, the appropriate party will pay it. Pharrell has consistently acted in good faith. He has great respect for Chad and looks forward to resolving this in a way that honours their shared history.”It is the second lawsuit that Hugo has filed against Williams. In 2024, he accused him of “fraudulently” attempting to control the Neptunes name. The matter is still the subject of a federal trademark tribunal.At the time, representatives for Pharrell told Billboard that he was “surprised” by the filing. “We have reached out on multiple occasions to share in the ownership and administration of the trademark and will continue to make that offer,” they said. “The goal here was to make sure a third party doesn’t get a hold of the trademark and to guarantee Chad and Pharrell share in ownership and administration.” Hugo’s lawyers disputed their claims.Kelis has previously claimed that she was “blatantly lied to and tricked” by the Neptunes over the royalties for her 1999 debut album, Kaleidoscope. “Their argument is: ‘Well, you signed it,’”she told the Guardian in 2000. “I’m like: ‘Yeah, I signed what I was told, and I was too young and too stupid to double-check it.’” Representatives for Williams and Hugo did not respond to her widely publicised comments.In 2022, Beyoncé removed an interpolation of the Kelis song Milkshake from her Renaissance album track Energy after Kelis called it an act of “thievery”. She clarified that she took no issue with Beyoncé: “It’s beyond this song at this point.”Explore more on these topicsPharrell WilliamsThe NeptunesPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Their publishing house was named after two heroes of black resistance, Paul Bogle and Toussaint L’Ouverture.Photograph: Nell FreemanBlack British cultureObituaryEric Huntley obituaryActivist and co-founder of Bogle-L’Ouverture, one of the most important black publishing houses in BritainYvonne SinghMon 26 Jan 2026 11.55 ESTLast modified on Mon 26 Jan 2026 11.58 ESTShareEric Huntley, who has died aged 96, was the co-founder with his wife,Jessica, of the radical publishing house Bogle L’Ouverture, set up in London in 1968 to showcase black writing talent. Initially run on a printing press in their west London living room, the venture soon outgrew those makeshift premises, and in 1975 became the Bogle L’Ouverture bookshop, which established itself as a community hub and informal advice centre as well as a place to buy books from outside the mainstream.Among the authors championed by Bogle L’Ouverture were Linton Kwesi Johnson, Valerie Bloom, Lemn Sissay,Beryl GilroyandDonald Hinds, while the Huntleys also became involved in creating theInternational Book Fair of Radical and Third World Books, which ran from 1982 to 1995, uniting and amplifying the thoughts of black intellectuals, creatives and activists across continents.Aside from his work in publishing, Huntley was for many years involved in racial justice campaigns in the UK. He was a key figure in the Caribbean Education and Community Workers Association and theBlack Parents Movement; the first formed in response to the racist labelling of large numbers of black children as “educationally subnormal” and the second campaigning against “sus” laws that allowed police to stop, search, and arrest individuals on suspicion of intent to commit a crime – a facility that was deployed disproportionately against young black people in the 1970s and 80s.He was also closely involved in the Black People’s Day of Action in 1981, which followed the dire police response to what was widely suspected to be a racist arson attack,the New Cross firein south-east London in January 1981, when 13 young black people lost their lives (one survivor later killed himself, bringing the death toll to 14).Born in Georgetown in British Guiana (now Guyana), Eric was one of the 12 children of Frank, a prison warder, and Selina, a housewife. A bright, attentive pupil, he attended Smith Memorial primary school in Georgetown, but was unable to go to high school because of family hardship. When his father was posted to Berbice, Eric worked for the local post office as a messenger, and also trained briefly as a Methodist preacher. But he soon gave up the cloth, much to the consternation of his devout father, and moved back to Georgetown, where he continued as a postal worker.In 1948 he met Jessica Carroll, a trainee typist, and they married in 1950, moving to nearby Buxton, where Eric was a postman.With tensions brewing between labour unions and the British authorities, the Huntleys linked up with the Marxist politicians Cheddi andJanetJagan and their colleague Forbes Burnham to help form the People’s Progressive party in 1950, campaigning for independence.The party’s victory at the ballot box in 1953 ended up with the British governmentdeclaring a state of emergency and suspending the colony’s constitution, claiming that a revolution was afoot. In 1954 Huntley was arrested for breaking a curfew, and spent a year in Georgetown prison, where his father was working at the time. He later reflected on the “mental torture” the situation inflicted on both of them.Following his release in 1955, he was spurred by the unstable political climate to seek a better and safer life in Britain in 1957. This was a difficult decision to make; he had to leave behind Jessica and their two young sons, Karl and Chauncey. When he arrived in cold, foggy Southampton, the shortcomings of the wedding suit he had travelled in were soon apparent. He managed to secure work at the Mount Pleasant sorting office in London, and studied at night school while saving for the passage for Jessica and the boys. They joined him in 1962, and in London the couple went on to have a third child, Accabre.Struggling to get housing in the capital, at one point the family lodged at the home of some Trinidadian friends,Johnand Irma La Rose. The La Rose household was a place alight with political discussions about the decolonisation movement. Huntley described it as a “university”, and while there he encountered the young Guyanese political activist Walter Rodney, who was pursuing postgraduate studies at Soas University of London.Eric’s advocacy of community causes went on well into his 10th decade, when he observed that ‘the struggle never ends’Rodney made a deep impression on the Huntleys, and in 1968 they decided to set up Bogle L’Ouverture (named after two heroes of black resistance,Paul BogleandToussaint L’Ouverture) to distribute Rodney’s speeches in the UK. At the time La Rose’s New Beacon Books (formed in 1966) andAllison & Busby(1967) were the only other black-owned publishers in London.Self-financed and run out of the Huntleys’ home in Ealing, the press published its first title, Rodney’s The Groundings With My Brothers, in 1969. Later they released Kwesi Johnson’s Dread Beat and Blood (1975), several books by Andrew Salkey, Gilroy’s Black Teacher (1976), and poetry collections by Bloom, Sissay,Sam Greenlee, Lucinda Roy, Imruh Bakari andJohn Lyons. The Bogle L’Ouverture bookshop opened in 1975, renamed the Walter Rodney bookshop following Rodney’s assassination in 1980.Between 1977 and 1979, when support for the National Front was at its height, the shop was the target of numerous racist attacks. When windows were broken in the 11th such incident, Huntley, along with fellow black bookshop owners, picketed the Home Office, forcing the police to provide adequate security for their businesses and take the crimes seriously. Bogle L’Ouverture survived until 1991, with Huntley blaming its decline on rising rents and cuts to grants.The business was never designed to turn a profit and, while Jessica focused full-time on running it, Eric worked as a part-time insurance salesman. After the shop closed they moved operations back to their house, where they continued to publish intermittently.Eric’s advocacy of community causes went on well into his 10th decade, when he observed that “the struggle never ends: there is always something to fight for”. Papers relating to the Huntleys’ activism and publishing are now held atThe Friends of the Huntley Archivesat the London Metropolitan Archives.Karl died in 2011, and Jessica in 2013, after which Eric created a community garden in Ealing in her honour. He is survived by Chauncey and Accabre, nine grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and a great-great grandchild.Eric Lindbergh Huntley, publisher and political activist, born 25 September 1929; died 21 January 2026Explore more on these topicsBlack British cultureNewspapers & magazinesPoetryobituariesShareReuse this content"

The celebrity version, won by Alan Carr,peaked at a 28-day figure of 15.2 million.In the age of YouTube and TikTok and as younger audiences increasingly turn away from live linear television, insiderssee those kind of figures as remarkable.Finnemore is best known as a radio and television writer. As well as creating, writing and appearing in Radio 4’s Cabin Pressure, he has written extensively for Mitchell and Webb. He also sets cryptic crosswords and was only the third person in nearly a centuryto solve the literary puzzle Cain’s Jawbone.Hastie’s CV includesHamlet at the Nationaland themusical Operation Mincemeat, currently in the West End and on Broadway.This article was amended on 26 January 2026. The Radio 4 sitcom written by John Finnemore is Cabin Pressure, not “Cabin Fever” as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

More soon please!Hannah J DaviesMon 26 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTShareAfter decades as a BBC journalist and – latterly – one of the corporation’s best-known news presenters, you may well associateClive Myriewith more serious endeavours. Indeed, it was a little jarring to see him – just a few hours before presenting the latest Trump-flavoured bulletin last Tuesday – reclining on the One Show sofa to promote his latest travelogue, declaring himself “a warrior god”. As unlikely as this recent-ish pivot might seem (he previously presented Clive Myrie’s Italian Road Trip in 2023, and the Bafta-winning Clive Myrie’s Caribbean Adventure in 2024), I’m here for it. As a chronicler of cultures, Myrie is faultlessly fun and eager, and his African Adventure is no exception. This series of 10 half-hour episodes set in South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and Morocco is infused with joy and hope, while also not entirely adopting a fingers-in-ears approach to some of the bigger issues affecting the continent – be it environmental concerns or health inequalities.We kick off in SouthAfrica, a place Myrie knows well from his time posted there as a foreign correspondent for the BBC. He catches up with a former colleague, Milton Nkosi, and the pair reflect on the stories we tend to hear about the country. The news, says Nkosi, “is not wrong, but it can be one-sided”. Their episode in Soweto is a beautiful thing: a corrective to some of those more difficult stories about the country and its largest township, which also acknowledges its complex history. Myrie was, he says, inspired to get into journalism in the first place by the stories he saw on the news back home in Bolton about apartheid. Now, all these decades later, he finds himself having lunch with Nkosi and Ndileka Mandela, Nelson’s eldest granddaughter. They reflect on Mandela Sr’s humanity, and Myrie seems genuinely touched to find out that – by chance – they’re even eating the great man’s favourite food (braised oxtail, if you were wondering).View image in fullscreenYou absolutely cannot fault his enthusiasm … Clive Myrie’s African Adventure.Photograph: BBC/Alleycats TVSouth Africa is full of fun: “Banksy who?” says Myrie, as he grabs a spray can and helps artist Senzo Nhlapo with some street art. Mucking in is the theme of the whole series, in fact, whether he’s cooking a huge pot of bunny chow, a South African dish with Indian roots (“I feel like I’m rowing a boat in the Oxford and Cambridge boat race,” he says, the stirring proving a challenge) or helping out at a craft centre in Durban supporting women with HIV/Aids (“maybe in about six months,” he says, looking down at the minuscule part of a beaded pin he has managed to complete, “I would have a South African flag”). Whether it’s trapeze lessons or jazz drumming or dancing to the country’s thriving amapiano dance music, you absolutely cannot fault his enthusiasm.As mentioned, the series doesn’t shy away from some of the more difficult issues affecting Africa. The strongest part of the series are the episodes filmed in Ghana, where Myrie covers much ground – contemporary and historical. As the child of Jamaican parents who came to Britain during the Windrush era, Myrie knew he had West African descent due to transatlantic slavery. Here, he visits the vast fortresses where enslaved people were held: “I’ve spent my whole life reporting on the inhumanity of human beings to fellow human beings,” he says, “but this is personal.” He is also welcomed by the Fante people in a naming ceremony that is a pure delight to watch, and he is thrilled with his new sobriquet: Papa Kojo Abaka. As for the contemporary, the deeply troubling issue of textile waste (much of it from the west) leads Myrie to visit the Or Foundation in Accra, masters of recycled fashion who make him a fetching outfit from sportswear that would otherwise have ended up polluting the country’s beaches. He meets people with ingenious ideas for solving the continent’s biggest problems, including a startup whose AI-powered chatbot aims to give Nigerians health advice on the go, amid a worrying shortage of doctors (staggeringly, we are told, around a third of all maternal deaths across the world occur in the country).The Morocco episodes feel most like a traditional travelogue, but they’re still a lot of fun – even if Goat Milking with Clive Myrie does have a touch of the Partridge about it, as an idea. Really, though, this is a wonderful series which shows that the much-maligned celebrity travel show can be educational, informative and really moving (and, crucially, that destinations other than Italy are available). And with so much more of Africa to see, here’s hoping they give him a few weeks off from the news again soon.Clive Myrie’s African Adventure aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewClive MyrieAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

It stars Vic and Bob and a stellar backup cast – Reece Shearsmith, Tim Healey, Mark Benton, Matt Lucas and Morwenna Banks. It starts off innocuously enough with Carl Palmer (Bob) returning to Catterick to visit his brother Chris (Vic) but quickly descends into anarchy. The extremely loose plot centres around the criminal antics of mummy’s boy Tony (Shearsmith) but there are more tangents than a geometry conference. From ripped up posters of George Clooney and haunting dance routines to Chris Rea and Foreigner, Catterick should be top of your TV destinations.Tom Whelan, South ShieldsMonkey DustI first caught a glimpse of the sharp, dreamlike animation Monkey Dust back on BBC Three in the mid-2000s. I was mesmerised by its dark slice of post-millennium British life. Every week, each episode played somewhat the same, but with a tragic, twisted or nightmarish spin befalling the sad bunch of urban dwellers. Why did Clive perform depraved acts with German businessmen, his father in-law, or a dog and some peanut butter? How did Divorced Dad survive his dire ending every week?

This beautiful Italianate village was everything the 60s did best in design, colours and music. Patrick McGoohan, No 6, had been abducted and was kept prisoner in this gilded cage for obscure reasons, all to do with the secret services apparently. Rebelling against the system was useless, and as for escaping, forget about it, because a huge white balloon would pursue and eliminate you by smothering you on the beach. It was scary, baffling and the dissociation between the psychedelic décor and the sinister purpose of its masters made the show eternally spellbinding. The Prisoner remains a cult series for exactly that reason.Catherine Laz, 63, LondonWestworldView image in fullscreenMore of an art installation than a drama … Thandiwe Newton in Westworld.Photograph: 2020 Home Box Office, Inc.

The protagonist has his identity erased and he is constantly pursued because of a photograph he has taken, which contains elements of an unknown conspiracy. The show revels in reversals, betrayals and devastating reveals and no one is who they purport to be. Meanwhile the photographic negative at the heart of the struggle fluctuates between red herring and impossible touchstone. The whole affair concludes, much like The Prisoner, with an answer that invites even more questions and leaves both the protagonist and the viewer further unmoored from certainty.Howard Kistler, 60, Richmond, VirginiaDarkView image in fullscreenThe most confusing and brilliant TV show to ever exist … Dark.Photograph: NetflixIf you’ve seen Dark, you already agree.

It was alleged that she created an online identity as a man and used this character, Kye Fortune, to lure another woman into a sexual relationship, which was consummated repeatedly with the assistance of a blindfold and a prosthetic penis. The woman believed she was having sex with Kye until one day her ring caught on his hat and she felt long hair. Tearing off her blindfold, she realised her male lover was actually her female friend. As these lurid, almost fairytale details seeped out, the case went viral. “Sex attacker who posed as man found guilty” was one of the milder headlines.The trial caught Izabella Scott’s attention because it was a real-life example of a plot device she recognised from literature. The bed trick can be found in folk stories and operas, in Chaucer and Shakespeare. Often told for comic effect, it concerns sex by trickery and deception, under cover of darkness. “The plot suggests,” Scott writes, “that, in bed, anyone might be mistaken for anyone else.”It dropped out of literary fashion with the invention of artificial light, but here it was again, unfolding in a 21st-century court of law.According to Newland, there was no bed trick. She claimed the two women, both in their early 20s, were closeted lesbians. She’d invented the online alter-ego of Kye Fortune in her teens, as a way of expressing her inadmissible sexuality. She claimed that her friend, who was granted anonymity and is designated Miss X, was aware at all times that Newland and Fortune were the same person. After all, they had the same birthday, same job, same pet dog and were studying the same course at university. It was a shared fiction, a way of managing the clandestine fact of the two women’s sexuality. The fight that led to Miss X going to the police was caused not by the discovery that Kye was Newland, but because Newland wanted to come out of the closet and tell her parents she was gay.Miss X disputed all of this. She said she was lured into a romance at university by a handsome young man on Facebook, who repeatedly postponed a physical encounter by claiming a series of outlandish injuries and health emergencies. He had cancer, had been in a car crash, was in a coma: all classic features of a catfishing episode. But most catfishing is enacted entirely online, without the high risk of exposure that accompanies a real-world date. In this unusual case, Kye’s supposed illness was used to create a framework of deception in which a full-blown relationship could be carried out.Kye claimed he was so badly injured that he was embarrassed to be seen. At his request, Miss X wore a blindfold at all their dates, from brief encounters in hotels to long lazy weekends of cooking and watching movies at home – something the defence lawyer found particularly implausible. Kye also claimed he wore a woolly hat to protect his damaged skull, and a body suit to secure the wires in his failing heart. Miss X believed all this, apparently never recognising her friend’s voice, her body, her smell.A trial, especially one for rape or sexual assault, is in Scott’s words a “storytelling contest”, in which one person must be lying and the other telling the truth. It is exposing, often cruel, and gladiatorial in style. In 2015, Newland lost. She was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault. After an appeal, she was found guilty again at retrial in 2017. She served six years in prison and was placed on the sex offenders’ register.Scott is less interested in whether this was the correct verdict than she is in investigating the larger meanings of this strange, sad trial, which exposed the private lives of both participants to ridicule. Though the bed trick appears in literature as a joke, it turns out to have a significant presence in the history of rape. Rape is notoriously difficult to prosecute. According to a 2021 government survey, only 1.6% of rape reports result in someone being charged, while fewer than one in five rapes are even reported.UK rape law is based upon the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which means Victorian attitudes to women’s sexuality and value still shape present-day law. Because the Victorians had a powerful belief in women’s physical inability to undergo unwanted sex, the crime of sexual fraud – rape by deception, by husband impersonators or immoral doctors – became a credible route to prosecution.Although the 2003 Sexual Offences Act was a reframing of sexual offences according to the principle of consent, it absorbed much of the old law, including the crime of sexual fraud, now known as Section 76. This rarely used clause obviates the need to prove the defendant knew consent was lacking, meaning a prosecution is far easier to obtain. It was on this that Newland was convicted in her first trial.Scott is a supremely good guide to this complex terrain, thoughtful, nuanced and agile. She holds unusual objects up for clear scrutiny. Female husbands, Victorian quacks, statues sentenced to death, prosthetic limbs, witches with stolen penises fattened up on oats. A lesbian herself, her deepest interest lies in how the court’s binary vision – of truth and lies, deception and innocence – collides with more complicated narratives around queerness and gender, as well as the necessary secrecy of the closet.It turns out the case was not such an outlier after all. Newland was the fifth in a sequence of recent convictions for what has become known as “gender fraud”. “All suspects were accused of falsely presenting as men; some identified as trans, others as lesbians.” These convictions were not achieved by way of Section 76, but by case law known as the McNally principle, which states that “deception as to gender can vitiate consent”. Lies about wealth or status, or having a vasectomy, don’t have this special power to obviate the role of consent as a defence in rape and sexual assault, meaning even a willing yes can become a retrospective no. The McNally principle is how Newland was convicted at retrial.Newland never described herself as trans and it wasn’t brought in as a defence by her lawyers, though by the time of her retrial she’d been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. But as Scott pores over the trial transcripts, she finds repeated scenes of Newland explaining her existence as Kye in ways that are allied to trans narratives – not as a falsehood or deception but as a way of being real and authentic, of expressing something true. (When I first heard about the trial I was struck that Newland wore her swimsuit under her clothes, a not-uncommon practice for gender dysphoric people.)Whatever the facts of Newland’s own case, the McNally principle has clear implications for trans people, particularly in light of the2025 supreme court ruling on biological sex. To put this focus on gender into context, the so-calledspy cops, undercover police officers who carried out long-term relationships with more than 50 women as a way of deliberately shoring up their false identities, have still not been prosecuted. Rape by state, their victims called it.Olivia Laing’s most recent novel is The Silver Book. The Bed Trick by Izabella Scott is published by Atlantic.

To the horror of the packed amphitheater, the man stabbed the Indian-born British-American author – once the subject of an infamous fatwa from the leader of Iran in the 1980s – 15 times in the face, neck and torso, before members of the audience rushed the stage and disarmed him. Rushdie survived, narrowly; the stabbing left him on a ventilator, severed tendons in his left hand, and cost him his right eye.A full recreation of that attack from Rushdie’s perspective — 27 seconds of struggle, the mysterious man’s face, several sickening punches of blade — opens a new documentary on Rushdie’s recovery and resilience, which drew a standing ovation at the Sundance film festival. Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman Rushdie, directed by Alex Gibney and based on Rushdie’smemoir of the same name, is unsparing on the devastating results of the stabbing: in never-before-seen footage recorded by the author’s wife,Rachel Eliza Griffiths, Rushdie appears gruesomely disfigured — his skin discolored, his entire abdomen bisected by stitches, his swollen neck held together by stitches, his eye indescribably mangled. His first coherent thought after regaining consciousness, he recalls in the film, was simply: “We need to document this.”The Flower Bearers by Rachel Eliza Griffiths review – a powerful portrait of loss and violenceRead moreThe motivation to record an unvarnished account of Rushdie’s recovery, nurse-administered cleanings and all, was partly a coping mechanism. “When we were in the trauma ward, it wasn’t like ‘let’s make a film,’” Griffiths, a poet and author, said at the film’s sold-out premiere in Park City, Utah. “It was ‘what’s going to happen to us? How did this happen to us? And here we are, in this moment.’”But it was also a larger act of defiance against political violence. Though the documentary features Rushdie as both subject and narrator, “it’s not about me,” the 78-year-old writer told an enthusiastic Sundance crowd, several of whom were in tears. “I think it’s about a larger thing, of which this is an example. Violence is that thing. Violence unleashed by the unscrupulous, using the ignorant, to attack culture.”“For the authoritarian, culture is the enemy,” he added. “The uncultured and ignorant and tyrannical don’t like it. And they take steps against it, which we see every day.”Gibney, whose prior films have explored such tricky subjects as Scientology, Elizabeth Holmes and the Trump administration’s Covid reponse, uses the attack as a launchpad into the future — Rushdie and Griffiths’s intimacy as its own miraculous resistance — and into the past, retracing the novelist’s early life in secular Muslim family in India, and later in London, where his writing was met with resistance from those who deemed as antithetical to Islam.View image in fullscreenPro-Iranian Hezbollah fundamentalists burn an effigy of Salman Rushdie in 1989.Photograph: Nabil Ismail/AFP/Getty ImagesThe 1988 publication of his novel The Satanic Verses, the title of which referred to a group of Quranic verses related to three Meccan goddesses, sparked backlash from many Muslims who deemed it blasphemy;Ayatollah Khomeini’s fatwa calling for Rushdie’s death, as well as death for anyone who published him, took it viral. The film includes numerous clips of protesters burning Rushdie’s effigy in London, New York, Bombay and beyond, with images that eerily foreshadow Rushdie’s injuries over three decades later; numerous news clips, too, of people around the world — men and women, young and old — stating clearly for news anchors that they would kill Rushdie themselves, if given the opportunity.Rushdie, who spent nearly a decade in hiding under the protection of UK police, said he was reluctant to revisit that era of his life, even as it belatedly inspired a 24-year-old man from New Jersey, who was not even alive for the fatwa, to stab him 30 years later. But he soon realized “if you don’t understand what happened then, you don’t understand what’s happening now”.Gibney, too, connected the widespread protests against Rushdie’s book to “our present moment” during a post-screening Q&A that obliquely referenced thecurrent unrestinMinneapolis, Minnesota, whereICEagentsshot and killed a 37-year-old US citizenthe day prior. The death threats that drove Rushdie into hiding, Gibney said, echo today in “how violence unleashed by an irresponsible political leader could spread out of control”.Sundance 2026: the 10 films not to miss at this year’s festivalRead moreGibney also saw parallels in Rushdie’s recovery from the 2022 attack, during which, as Griffiths’s footage reveals, he never lost his “righteousness and principles” — or his sense of humor. (Of his assailant’s jailhouse interview with the New York Post, in which he said he was surprised Rushdie survived, the author had this to say: “Thank you! That demonstrates intent.”) Against “the growing momentum of authoritarian rule”, Gibney said, “it’s important that we continue to embrace our humanity, to love each other, and to continue to achieve that kind of intimacy that’s so important to us as human beings, even as we face this larger political challenge”.The documentary returns, in its final minutes, to the attack that began it — this time from the third-party perspective, as the conference cameras captured the bloody attack in its entirety. The grisly footage shows nearly every stab of the knife, as well as the many strangers who tackled the man and saved Rushdie’s life. That day, he experienced, “almost simultaneously, the worst side of human nature — violence, led by ignorance, induced by the irresponsible — and on the other hand, the best side of human nature, because the first people who saved my life were the audience”, he told the Sundance crowd.“Here are the people rushing to defend me against an ideologically driven man with a knife,” he added. “And yet they all agreed to do that, to risk themselves in order to save me. We are that, too.”Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman Rushdie is screening at theSundance film festivaland will be released at a later dateExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026Salman RushdieDocumentary filmsFestivalsSundance film festivalAlex GibneyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Each regards themselves as a guardian, and the other as a thief. The reader is not asked to take sides, but instead to observe how the world makes thieves of guardians, and vice versa.A Guardian and a Thief takes place over what is meant to be the last week of Ma living in Kolkata. She, her father and her two-year-old daughter are about to join Ma’s husband in the United States, as the recipients of prized “climate visas”. Floods and extreme heat have turned Kolkata into a city of persistent food shortages. Black marketeers hoard eggs, fruit and vegetables, while fish, previously the cornerstone of Bengali cooking, has vanished altogether. The terrifying word famine is disinterred. This is one of the many ways in which climate change has sent Kolkata forward into the past. While Majumdar’s acclaimed debut,A Burning, laid out the appalling consequences of a young woman’s Facebook post, in A Guardian and a Thief the city appears to be almost entirely smartphone-free.For years, Ma, who sincerely believes herself to be an honest and altruistic person, has got away with stealing food from the homeless shelter that she manages. She has, after all, an old father and an infant daughter to take care of – if she is a thief, it is only because she is a guardian. But then, just as she is about to leave Kolkata behind, a new shelter resident who has observed her theft breaks into her house. Boomba takes not only the stolen food, but her purse, which contains her family’s passports and the climate visas that will open the gates of America.Majumdar writes what Martin Amis dubbed “vow-of-poverty prose”, although in her case it might more accurately be called vow-of-efficiency. This means the eradication of semicolons, run-on-sentences, wordplay and digression; a faultlessly clear third-person voice that dispenses with free indirect style; and a truly minimal degree of social and historical context. All these things are sacrificed for narrative focus.By abjuring so many of the novel’s traditional tools, Majumdar raises the question of why this is a novel and not a play or a filmThere are costs to taking efficiency to this ascetic extent. A Guardian and a Thief has the pace of a thriller, but it derives its drama from the ratcheting up of moral stakes, rather than suspense. By abjuring so many of the novel’s traditional tools, Majumdar can make her choice of form seem arbitrary, raising the question of why this is a novel at all, and not a play or film. Although concerned with moral ambiguity, it seeks at all times to be narratively unambiguous, and to signpost and repeat its ideas for the inattentive reader, just as TV writers are now encouraged to do.But plenty is gained, too. By offering as little cultural and historical exposition as possible, Majumdar evades the narrative clunkiness that inevitably attends attempts to explainIndiato the west. This frees her up not only to tell a story of universal moral interest, but also to deliver a perceptive account of specifically Indian anxieties. She brilliantly renders the helplessness that even privileged Indians feel in the face of western consular officials; the extent to which Indians divided by class simply cannot understand each other; and, above all, how the Indian rich use the claims of family as a justification for riding roughshod over everyone else.If the novel works best as (Indian) moral critique, it is less successful as climate fiction. By structuring the plot around the accidental theft of the family’s passports, Majumdar, at two crucial moments, is compelled to stretch plausibility too far. In both cases, for narrative reasons a character displays a degree of unworldliness that is inconsistent with everything else we know about them, and with what we might reasonably expect of someone in their position.First, Boomba – a young man who has worked for years in the big city – is ignorant of the very existence of passports. When he finds them, he fans himself with one “to see if it served a cooling purpose”. Later, Ma goes to a forger in an attempt to substitute fake passports for the ones that Boomba has stolen. This could, perhaps, be explained by desperation. Boomba’s moment of unworldliness, however, cannot be satisfactorily accounted for.At a pinch, a reader might accept or at any rate pass over these moments. What is harder to accept is the idea that the US, in a world in which large parts of Earth are uninhabitable, might hand out “climate visas” at all. The book pits “some Americans” who are outraged by climate immigration against “other Americans” who welcome it; the implication is that climate visas will be handed out by some presidents and not others. A Guardian and a Thief dramatises, to superb effect, the Indian elite’s great fear: a world in which they are forced to share. The west’s fear of uncontrolled climate immigration, by contrast, is not only not dramatised but trivialised as the concerns of “some”. Those “other Americans” will find here a novel to engage their sympathies, but not trouble their sleep.A Guardian and a Thief by Megha Majumdar is published by Scribner (£16.99).

It’s a movie whose entertaining initial premise and shrewd satire are finally damaged by Raimi’s need to juice everything up with spurious “horror” flourishes for the fanbase, on-brand gore eruptions that aren’t really scary and undermine the film’s believability, turning everything into silliness. The poster and promotional materials promise a “horror” film, but that isn’t really what this is. But what is it? Well, it’s a desert island parable that owes something to JM Barrie’s The Admirable Crichton and to … how to say it? … other dramas. No spoilers, but Raimi appearing to borrow from a recent Cannes Palme d’Or winner was not, as they say, on my bingo card.Rachel McAdams plays nerdy Linda Liddle, a single woman living alone with a caged bird. She’s devoted to her job. She is an extremely smart researcher in a corporation, but is passed over for promotion by the charmless misogynists running the firm: useless, untalented males in Patrick Bateman suits who depend on her work. Chief among these odious sexists is new CEO Bradley Preston, played by Dylan O’Brien, a vacuous smoothie and nepo princeling whose late father, the company founder, valued Linda enough to promise her a VP position – a promise on which the hateful Bradley now smugly reneges.He and his ghastly bros mock and humiliate her, especially her ambition to be on a top-rated “survivor” TV show. They find her audition footage online – which shows how skilful she is at bushcraft, making fires and shelters, etc – and giggle over it. But they can’t avoid bringing Linda with them for a business conference in Thailand on the firm’s private jet, and when this crashes on a remote island in a storm, with the only survivors being gutsy, capable Linda and spoiled alpha-idiot Bradley … well, guess who the boss is now?It’s a time-honoured and perfectly enjoyable setup, and the first act, when the new reality dawns on clueless Bradley, is watchable. But the plot twists are derivative and the action then becomes dependent on weird stabs of grisliness that are not convincing or consistent with the characterisation. By the end, it’s exasperating – but McAdams delivers a solid performance.Send Help is out on 29 January in Australia, 30 January in the US, and 5 February in the UKExplore more on these topicsFilmSam RaimiHorror filmsRachel McAdamsComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The premise is not the problem: a sexy young woman lures six eligible young men to her family’s country pile for a weekend of romance, only to reveal to the men that they are now trapped in a reality-TV-meets-Saw farce in which they will struggle to survive. On paper, The Bachelorette-meets-femme-Jigsaw sounds potentially fun.The biggest problem is that the film never achieves the necessary suspension of disbelief; horror films have to feel at least somewhat real or deliberately ludicrous while you’re watching them; but this just feels like student theatre. You can pick out interesting individual moments that could have been something, but you’re never inside the action, willing the characters to escape (or die).It doesn’t help that right out of the gate it feels like the film can’t quite make up its mind how to begin. Is this a woodsy folk horror with a guy fleeing through the rain at night, or a torture porn deal with a guy shackled to a bed, or a twisted family in an elegant mansion chiller where bad shit is about to happen? It’s all three, but not in a way that feels bracing; the effect is more like channel hopping.Perhaps if things were staged with more conviction it could work, but there’s a sense of flimsiness to much of it – sometimes quite literally, since the modest plastic cable ties and wispy gags used to restrain the unlucky young men give the impression of being highly escapable.Lure is on digital platforms from 2 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

While this is egregious for an actor of her calibre, the bigger snub is that she wasn’t even nominated for her best performance yet. Enchanted’s Giselle introduced Adams to a mainstream audience and was possibly considered too frivolous for Academy tastes, but her pitch-perfect take on a real-life Disney princess is a masterclass in full-bore commitment, and the gravitational force around, which this winningly charming Disney film revolves.‘Cinematic comfort food’: why Heat is my feelgood movieRead moreI was instantly won over by Enchanted on its 2007 release, but having since revisited it many times (including with my own kids), I’m convinced it’s close to a platonic ideal of family-friendly feelgood viewing, and there’s been nothing in this vein that’s come close to matching it since (including, sadly, 2022 Disney+ sequel Disenchanted). It’s also so much better than the Disney’s many official live-action remakes.Much of its success is down to Adams’ performance, utterly without guile, as the fairytale princess who becomes a fish out of water in ’00s New York – “a place where there are no happily ever afters” – but the tone is just right from the off. Its throwback to the leatherbound-storybook framing device segues into a 2D-animated prologue introducing Giselle, who’s an amalgamation of Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty’s Aurora. Optimistic, friendly with woodland creatures, prone to spontaneously breaking into song and eagerly awaiting her true love’s kiss, Giselle is due to marry Prince Edward (James Marsden) before she’s shoved down a well that turns out to be a portal to Times Square.There’s something cosy in the predictable framework the story follows, as Giselle gets to know divorce lawyer and single father Robert (Patrick Dempsey). Through culture-clash osmosis, she loses some of her naivety, but not without encouraging those around her to occasionally treat life a little more like a Disney movie, with casual declarations of love, an unwaveringly sunny outlook and frequent bursts of song. The upbeat centrepiece Central Park number That’s How You Know never fails to move me to tears. Adams’ delivery of an impromptu ode to wearing your heart on your sleeve is so wholly idealistic, something about the pure joy of it gets me every time.It might not always have been this way. According to director Kevin Lima, the original spec script shopped by writer Bill Kelly and producer Sunil Perkash was a little too cynical. “I came in and said: ‘Hey, why don’t we make it a love letter to Disney?’” There’s certainly a great deal of warmth for Disney movies past: Enchanted is littered with in-jokes, references and cameos (including the voice artists behind Ariel, Belle and Pocahontas) that provide an extra dopamine hit for the target audience. But it gets its affectionate ribbing of the tropes spot-on, finding the humour without disparaging; the tidying-up sing along Happy Working Song parodies with genuine wit and a catchy tune. That’s why it’s aged so much better than the low-hanging-fruit snark of the Shrek movies.Enchanted earns bonus feelgood points for neatly tying up the loose ends for all of its characters. Robert’s partner Nancy (future Elsa, Idina Menzel), who gets slightly short shrift for the most part, has a happily ever after send-off, and even the divorcing couple played by Tonya Pinkins and Isiah Whitlock Jr gets a beautiful little subplot in the scantest of screen time.Every supporting role is well cast, from Susan Sarandon’s vampish sorceress to Timothy Spall’s minion. Marsden – who could’ve coasted on his cheekbones alone – is an absolute hoot as the pampered prince blissfully unaware of how at odds he is with his surroundings. He bags the funniest lines, telling Robert and his daughters: “Thank you for taking care of my bride, peasants.” But his straightforwardly romantic pronouncements (Nancy is taken aback when he introduces Giselle as “the love of my life, my heart’s true desire” without a hint of irony) also chime nicely with the film’s underlying sincerity, which is what makes it such a balm for the real world’s harshness.Compared with the recent box-office trend of carbon-copy live-action remakes of beloved animated classics, which even at their best feel like hollow exercises, Enchanted pushes the nostalgia buttons and provides everything you could want from a Disney character in a real-world context, but it does it with wit, invention and a palpable affection for its source material. Talking about revisiting the film in preparation for Disenchanted, Adams recently said: “It was nice to have distance from it and to be able to see it for the absolute joy that it was.” That’s how you know you’ve made a generational comfort movie.Enchanted is available on Disney+ in the US, to rent digitally in the UK and on Disney+ in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAmy AdamsMy feelgood movieComedy filmsComedySusan SarandonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead here he is, muscled and strong, wound round a Chinese pole, suspending himself in the air, abs glistening.Ali is also thriving as an artist. His last show, The Chosen Haram, garnered five-star reviews, and he has just officially launched his own circus/theatre company. This new work, Tell Me, follows a woman with an HIV diagnosis, which is something still stigmatised and misunderstood, especially outside the LGBTQ+ community. It is a subject that’s personal to Ali but he doesn’t put himself at the centre. Instead Phoebe Knight is the protagonist, joined by Ali and Jonah Russell, and along with a clever set made from cube-shaped frames that double as poles and trapezes to climb and swing from, they portray a coherent story and evoke some stinging emotions.To contrast with the present day, we are sucked back to the synth-soundtracked 1980s, to the febrility of fear and shame as Aids became public enemy number one, and people with a diagnosis were heartbreakingly shunned by friends and family. This show was originally made as an outdoor performance (premiered at Norfolk and Norwich festival last year) but a black box theatre allows for a darker atmosphere, actually and figuratively.View image in fullscreenTower of strength … Sadiq Ali in Tell Me.Photograph: Alberto Santos BellidoFriendship, revelry, nightlife and sex are played out in movement across the floor and vertically up the poles, until the characters end up facing their demons – rather literally – with Ali dressed in horns and knee-high PVC heelless platforms. The first half of the show feels smart and sharp in terms of theatrical choices; the use of music, sound, set, text and dance, to deftly delineate what’s happening. Once we descend into murkier territory with the devilish minotaur creature, it plateaus for a while.Tell Me is not ultimately a story of triumph or transcendence, it’s one of love, support and acceptance, with some poignant intimate moments. It’s also a well put together piece of theatre, and there is no doubt much more from Ali to come.AtPavilion Theatre, Worthing, on 6 February, andEdinburgh Studio theatre, 9-10 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDanceAids and HIVreviewsShareReuse this content"

The presence of a Phil Collins banger on the soundtrack and a reference to Jean-Claude Van Damme are tells. One assumes the target audience are males of all ages with a bloodlust for highly choreographed casual violence and stunts interspersed with quips. As such, it gets the job done, plus it throws in the bells and whistles you’d expect, such as fireballs erupting in the background as characters flee the scene, scads of civilians getting killed along the way while evoking not a drop of regret from the protagonists, and estranged siblings getting in touch with their feelings about their errant, recently deceased father, and learning lessons about love along the way.Yes, you read that last bit right, because The Wrecking Crew offers a mildly enlightened, post-therapy 2020s spin on the genre – going so far as to give one of the main characters a child-psychologist wife (Roimata Fox) who is ready to diagnose emotional dysfunction when the script requires. Otherwise, the action is dominated by Dave Bautista andJason Momoa, playing excessively muscled, abundantly inked, initially estranged half-brothers James and Jonny, who spend the film trying to work out who killed their father Walter (Brian Keaulana) in a hit-and-run incident. James is the one with the child psychologist wife; he trains Marines and is a disciplined, solid citizen only slightly simmering with rage. Jonny, an Oklahoma-based cop, is more flamboyantly booze-sozzled, roistering and irresponsible – a classic younger brother according to all those TikTok videos about sibling birth order.Walter’s death reunites them in their home state of Hawaii, which gets showcased in an especially flattering way with plenty of pretty location photography and drone shots. At the same time, the script (by Jonathan Tropper, who wrote and show-ran the recent TV seriesYour Friends and Neighbours), which is slyly more interesting than it needed to be, acknowledges that there’s plenty of corruption in paradise, with various gangster groups and corrupt figures keen to exploit the islands’ beauty for their own interests.The most obviously nefarious character is a rich businessman named Robichaux, whose French name obviously hints at effete monstrosity; he is played by arthouse studmuffinClaes Bang(The Square), projecting cruelty just by affecting a British accent and wearing a topknot. The final big-boss banter between him and Momoa is a gas, as is the chemistry between Momoa and Bautista, two lovable lugs who clearly like each other. The whole package is an easily digested guilty pleasure.The Wrecking Crew is on Prime from 28 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmJason MomoaAction and adventure filmsThrillersHawaiireviewsShareReuse this content"

They opened with Schumann’s Three Fantasiestücke, Op 73, which is more often the province of clarinettists or cellists, but the full lyrical flood of Schumann’s Romanticism proved to suit the horn even better. It also showed immediately the infinite musical sensibilities of this duo, equally attuned each to the other and matched in virtuosity.Simon Holt’s The Bell was written for them in 2022, its arresting opening – slightly spiky and precisely articulated – giving way to striking exchanges between the instruments with the glistening bell-like sounds at the top of the keyboard offering the perfect foil to the horn’s mellifluous phrases, its final clarion statement an almost defiant gesture.Oliver Leith’s Eeyore, another work originally premiered by Goldscheider and Uttley, did indeed carry the element of humour that his title suggests. Gloomily soulful and lugubrious, any mocking was only affectionate, with the donkey-braying brilliantly realised and the musical argument cogently sustained over the course of the work’s four sections.Scriabin’s Romance for Horn and Piano is a very early work, full of passion and a tantalising if all too brief pointer to the Russian’s future path, while Esa-Pekka Salonen’s Horn Music 1 had all the conviction of a composer for whom, as a hornist himself, the instrument has always been a potent inspiration. This was a dynamic interpretation, with the extended cadenza-like horn solo bringing an added flourish.At the heart of the performance was – like the Schumann – another appropriation, Mahler’s Urlicht. It was a nicely sly reference to the fact that this song, later the fourth movement of his Second Symphony, began life as the last of Mahler’s song-series Des Knaben Wunderhorn (The Boy’s Magic Horn). Goldscheider has more than a touch of magic about his playing and this Urlicht – “Primordial Light” is the translation that seems best to invoke the light the anonymous poet craves – unfolded with such expressive line and lambent glow as to be deeply moving.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

So I’m creating a home for it: MothershipMon 26 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTShareWhether you’re reading about the impending AI bubble bursting or about the video game industry’s mass layoffs and cancelled projects, 2026 does not feel like a hopeful time for gaming. What’s more, games journalists – as well as all other kinds of journalists – have been losing their jobs at alarming rates, making it difficult to adequately cover these crises. Donald Trump’s White House, meanwhile, is usingvideo game memesas ICE recruitment tools, and game studios arebacking away fromdiversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the wider world’s slide to the right.The manosphereis back, and we’ve lostmainstream feminist websites such as Teen Vogue; bigots everywhere are celebrating what they see as the death of “woke”. Put it all together and we have a dismal stew of doom for someone like me, a queer woman and a feminist who’s been a games journalist and critic since 2007.Everything I just listed off in that paragraph speaks to an urgent need for something different. This is why I’m launching a gender and identity-focused gaming publication called Mothership. It’s independent and worker-owned; it will rely on subscribers’ support to exist. Mothership will focus on reporting on the good and bad of modern-day game-making – alongside investigations, reviews, criticism, and historical deep dives into games and developers who paved the way to now. It will be a website for people who read the news with dread, including gaming news, and worry thatGamergaters got what they always wanted. And it will be a place for readers who wish there was something like a Teen Vogue, but for games (and without a corporate owner to kneecap it).After all, the last two decades have seen a lot of actual, valuable change, and modern games are evidence of that. We exist, now, in a gaming world with more female characters, more non-binary characters, more queer characters, and more characters who don’t fall into rigidly defined gender stereotypes. TheGDC State of the Game Industry survey for 2025found that 66% of surveyed game developers were male, compared with75% in 2020, and 94% in 2009.More people than ever can now see themselves reflected in game characters, and more diverse development teams are creating them. But change has not come easy – and we’ve seen a lot of backlash to this progress. Few websites still in existence are able to cover this backlash while also keeping their reporters safe and motivated to continue.I have dreamed of founding a website like this for a long time; it’s not as if readers haven’t wanted it before now. The problem I saw with the idea was not that people wouldn’t want it, but rather that I didn’t see a good way to pay for it. Journalism has been facing a monetisation crisis since the advent of the internet. It’s hard to convince readers to pay for something they are used to getting for free.But I know the readers are there. In the mid-2010s, I worked for a small “geek girl” feminist website called the Mary Sue, and it was a unique pleasure to write very specific articles for a very specific audience. The Mary Sue relied on advertising income, which meant that all of us had to write up to six articles every weekday; there wasn’t time to spend on investigative reporting, for example, or long-form critical essays. I’m still proud of what we achieved, despite the intensity of those working conditions, not to mention the amount of harassment we faced just for existing. But I always dreamed of working for a place that had the same editorial remit without the harsh working conditions and quotas.Later, I left the Mary Sue and went on to work for Kotaku and then Polygon, both huge games websites where I was writing for broader audiences, rather than the hyper-specific one we catered to at the Mary Sue. As I watched many smaller games websites crumble over the course of the 2010s and 20s, I figured this was the only type of games website that was going to survive. The idea of working for a small, feminist games website – my dream – increasingly looked like an impossible speck of starlight in a far-off galaxy.View image in fullscreenThe logo for Mothership, a newly launched feminist games website.Photograph: Mothership Media LLCBut then, in the summer of 2025, my then-employer Polygon underwent amass layoff and acquisition. We went from a staff of 42 people to just eight. After a particularly disheartening video call with our website’s new owners, I realised I was going to have to quit. Every piece of the dream felt well and truly dead. I had not got into journalism to be taken advantage of by people who saw me and my colleagues as so easily replaceable as to be barely human.Another one of my colleagues at Polygon – Zoe Hannah, games editor – quit as well, for similar reasons. She hit me up with an idea she had for a feminist games website. “You should do it,” I told her. And then I sat there for a moment and thought about it. No,weshould do it! This was what I had wanted to do, before the industry had transformed me into someone so gnarled and jaded that I no longer believed it was even possible.Six months on, after many DMs with former colleagues from Polygon, the Mary Sue and Kotaku, plus other notable writers who’ve covered gender and identity in games – Zoe and I are launching Mothership together, today. We have had the benefit of advice and inspiration from many other independent, worker-owned outlets that have come before us, such asDefector,the Flytrap, andAftermath. Already, we’ve surpassed 1,200 paid subscribers. (Iknewthe readers were there.) And we don’t need millions of them. Mothership is a publication for a very specific audience: the people whodon’tfit the mould of the masculine, hardcore gamer image that marketing and pop culture have been dishing out since the 90s. We want to serve this audience well.I believe our website is a necessity in our current political climate. It should have existed before, when I and millions of other girls who grew up playing games were made to feel out of place by media and advertising that was laser-focused on teenage boys. But it’s not too late for me to make sure it exists now.Explore more on these topicsGamesDigital mediaGame cultureWomenFeminismGendercommentShareReuse this content"

I didn’t know what I wasn’t getting that everyone else was and I just didn’t understand it. I came from a very academic family and it was hard for people who were very academic to understand me.”Arnison was given his first camera when he was nine years old as a gift from his parents, a year before finding out he was severely dyslexic. After leaving school at 15 he was inspired by the work of newspaper photojournalists such as the Guardian’s Denis Thorpe to pursue a career in pictures, beginning by working in Fleet Street darkrooms and eventually starting a darkroom of his own in Leeds, which has become a hub for a thriving community of northern photographers.View image in fullscreenArnison has has travelled all over the north photographing waterfalls, including in Yorkshire, Teesside and Cumbria.Photograph: John Arnison“I think taking pictures has kept me going, and I think the waterfalls in particular have saved me,” said Arnison, who also lives with anxiety andADHD. “I find it so healing outside. I don’t always get people, I find them difficult to understand, but nature and photography are honest and straightforward. I find walking through a busy city quite worrying, but going out into the countryside at night alone, I love it. It’s just me and the owls.”In the past decade and a half, Arnison has taken more than 150 photos, venturing alone, save for a couple of occasions that necessitated bringing a friend with a walkie-talkie to help with the more complex subjects. He has travelled all over the north photographing waterfalls, including in Yorkshire, Teesside and Cumbria, and has hopes to capture some in Scotland in the next few years.View image in fullscreenArnison enjoys taking photographs out in the countryside at night alone. ‘I love it. It’s just me and the owls.’Photograph: John Arnison“It’s so cathartic at every stage, researching the waterfalls, driving to them, spending hours getting this right. It just allows me to focus on what’s outside my head,” Arnison says. “When you’re out in the pitch black you can’t think of anything else, good or bad. You very much have to be in the moment.”So precious to Arnison is his work that he keeps all of the negatives in a fireproof case in his home, saying that “if anything happened to those, I couldn’t recreate them. I could photograph them again, but it wouldn’t be the same, they’re so precious to me.”View image in fullscreenArnison would like to release a book of his waterfall photos.Photograph: John ArnisonArnison has no plans to retire, claiming that at 63 he feels the same as he did at 20, but admits that “there’s going to be a time when I can’t keep trampling over moors and up mounds and things in the dark by myself.” He hopes to publish his work as a book, possibly accompanied by poetry from northern writers.“I’d love to release a book of my photos to be honest,” said Arnison. “If I could see my work in print … if anyone could look at it and take something helpful from it, then I’d feel really proud. It’s always been about the process of taking them for me, but if anyone could relate to them, then that would be amazing as well.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographyAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The idea for my novel came in a rush: as I walked over the Thames on the Golden Jubilee Bridge in central London, the scene at the heart of it leapt out of the deep blue dusk and clung on to me until I committed to writing it into existence.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A few months later, it became depressingly clear that the half-hour snatches of writing at the end of my working day just weren’t going to get me over the finish line.And so I entered the world of the writing retreat. More than simply a place to write, the best are spaces that can rejuvenate even the most frazzled and blocked writers.The first retreat I went on was self-guided: three very solitary nights ina converted chapelin Llanfrynach village, near Abergavenny, in the foothills of Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons). Dylan Thomas was definitely on to something with his love of walking, and Wales meets a writer’s need to walk and write. I developed a routine of morning writing followed by a stroll along the damp banks of the River Usk through clouds of marsh hair moss, allowing the plot tangles to unknot themselves in the cold Welsh air. I was amazed by how much I got done in a long weekend cut off from distractions, but it was an eerie idyll and I missed having people to bounce ideas off.View image in fullscreenA moment of reflection by Loch Lomond at an Acorn Writing RetreatRewarding myself for reaching the hallowed 50,000-word mark and clutching a patchy story and the beginnings of a credible three-act structure, my next stop was theUrban Writers’ Retreat. I had already taken an online writing course with its founder, Charlie Haynes, and liked the supportive way she worked. So I knew I would be in safe hands for my three-night stay in the expansive Georgian farmhouse near Newton Abbot, Devon, where she hosts her retreats.The setup was what I needed: unfettered time away from life’s admin during which I could immerse myself in the story. While my room had faded country house charm and a desk, I preferred the window seat of the drawing room, where I could look out at the gardens and farm animals as I wrote.There were six guests and we met for meals and to talk about all things writing in the cosy kitchen. Relinquishing the mental load of meal prep in return for herb-crusted salmon, fig and mozzarella salad and homemade cake was one of the greatest pleasures, all the more enjoyable given that Charlie, who prepared much of the food herself, is a notable cook. Even had I not written a word, I would have left feeling restored.My novel had become the Google Docs equivalent of a cupboard door that was opened occasionally then crammed shut before the overwhelm cascaded outMonths later, my novel had slipped down my priority list, becoming the Google Docs equivalent of a cupboard door that was opened occasionally then crammed shut before the messy overwhelm cascaded out.Informed by her PhD experience, Dr Rebecca Maxwell Stuart set upAcorn Writing Retreatsto help writers tackle their unwieldy manuscripts. “Coming on an Acorn retreat allows writers time and opportunity to have conceptual clarity on their projects, but also leave feeling good about themselves,” she says.Amid an expansive Loch Lomond landscape, the Oak Tree Inn in Balmaha was a paradisal setting for a four-day retreat for a diverse group (fiction, academic, nonfiction) of eight writers. This was one of the most structured retreats. We started with some goal setting and sharing our objectives, and there were four writing sessions across the day, including short activities, which were brilliant for jump-starting ideas and energising my writing.View image in fullscreenA bijou cabin at Starcroft Farm near Battle in East Sussex.Photograph: Tom MilnerWe wrote quietly, seated around a horseshoe table. Writing together is strongly encouraged for the duration of the retreat, to foster support and momentum and hold your writing gently to account. Nurture is important to Rebecca’s ethos, and there is optional meditation in the evenings and time to celebrate the small wins of the day.Watching sunlight and shadows race along the lochside hills on our afternoon walks, it was hard not to feel hope in my project and believe my years-long work-in-progress might reach completion.Sometimes it’s the right people at the right time that make a writing break memorable, as I found atRewrite, a retreat for women of colour. The founder, Christina Fonthes, is an author who runs writing and wellbeing programmes in the UK, Costa Rica, Portugal and Thailand, as well as online.Tucked into the writing nook of the cabin, it was impossible not to do my best workThe Brighton weekend retreat I chose was a refreshing opportunity to concentrate on technique. The structured writing sessions focused on helping us find our voice, then we workshopped what we had written and shared what we had developed in an open mic finale. Christina highlights the importance of connection between mind and body, and avoiding the burnout all too common for Black women. A meditative daily yoga practice brought that to life. Discussing the themes of beauty, Blackness and belonging that I explore in my novel in a safe space with other women of colour edged me closer to the final draft.With the end of the novel in sight, I needed solitude and space to write my way to the finish. A wood cabin atStarcroft Farm, overlooking the fringes of Powdermill Wood near Battle in East Sussex, was quietly perfect.Hannah Stuart-Leach, a historian and former travel journalist, and her husband Tom have created the most magical space where every aspect of a writer’s journey has been carefully planned out. Each bijou wood cabin has a desk area, bathroom, kitchenette and a bedroom with a stargazing skylight. There was a pagan air afoot in my cabin: a carefully curated collection of craft books, poetry and witchy tomes (including Hagitude by Sharon Blackie) filled the bookshelf. There was also a box of spells for down time, while the Green Man looked down from a print on the wall.View image in fullscreenThe writer at the Starcroft Farm cabin.Photograph: Tom MilnerThe nicest touch was arriving to find a gift-wrapped copy of Soldier Sailor by Claire Kilroy, specially chosen by the local independentRother Booksafter a brief pre-trip email questionnaire.I chose to work alone, but Starcroft Farm also arranges brilliant regular sessions with writing coaches, one-to-one or in small-group themed retreats. Tucked into the writing nook of the cabin, it was impossible not to do my best work.I finished my novel. The sense of achievement is enormous. And while there’s no substitute for keeping your bum in the seat and getting words on to the page, having a few days of literary luxury every so often with like-minded people certainly made it more fun.TheOld Chapelin Llanfrynach is £487 for three nights.Urban Writers’ Retreathas rooms from £415 for three nights.Acorn Writing Retreats’ all-inclusive rates are £525 for three days, £675 for four(theAcorn Access Fundoffers discounts for marginalised and low-income writers).RewriteinEast Sussexfrom £1,700 for five nights.Starcroft Farmcabins £320 for a two-night independent writing break and £750 for a four-night small-group retreat with coaching, massage and otherextras (the writer was given one night’s stay for this article)Fiona McAuslanhopes to have her debut novel published in 2027Explore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysLearning holidaysScotland holidaysEngland holidaysWales holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’re still making a regular appearance in our house, from shredded and stir-fried with chilli and spice, to roasted and dressed, as in this salad. And what a salad it is: with a caesar-esque dressing, it is crisp, salty and crunchy, and hits all the right notes. You can bulk it out, if you like, by topping it with a few soft, jammy boiled eggs cut into wedges or some shredded leftover chicken. However, it is pretty perfect as it is, as a light lunch or side.Roast sprout salad with anchovies and parmesanPrep10 minCook35 minServes2as a main500g brussels sprouts, trimmedOlive oil2 tbsp white-wine vinegar, or cider vinegarSea salt andblack pepper125g ciabatta(about ½ loaf)1 small garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped4 anchovy fillets1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped25g parmesan2 little gems, trimmed½ bunch fresh chives, finely choppedHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. Halve the sprouts, put them in a large roasting tray and drizzle with two tablespoons of olive oil and a tablespoon of the vinegar, then season generously. Really massage everything into the sprouts, then pop them in the oven for 15 minutes.Tear the ciabatta into small, bite-size pieces and toss these through the roast sprouts. Drizzle with a little more olive oil, then return to the oven for 10-15 minutes, until everything is crisp, slightly charred around the edges and tender. Remove and cool slightly.Meanwhile, make the dressing. In a mortar, pound the garlic with a pinch of sea salt until creamy, then add the anchovies and keep pounding until they have broken down. Muddle in the chopped shallot, two tablespoons of olive oil and the remaining tablespoon of vinegar, then season with black pepper. Finely grate in half of the parmesan and stir with the pestle, adding a little more olive oil to loosen if need be – you want a thick, creamy dressing.Cut the little gems into thin wedges. Stir the dressing through the sprouts, using your hands to make sure everything is coated, then add the little gem wedges and most of the chopped chives, and toss again. Scatter over the remaining chives, shave the remaining parmesan over the top with a vegetable peeler, and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodSaladVegetablesMain courseSide dishesCheeseFishrecipesShareReuse this content"

First up, some eastern Mediterranean chicken meatballs, flecked with feta and black olives for a sharp, savoury punch. Then a Persian-style saffron chicken and rice; the rice cooks with the chicken, absorbing all the flavours of the sunshine-yellow saffron and crisping up at the edges. Finally, a Korean-inspired chicken and potato traybake in which gochujang and soy create a deeply savoury sauce that elevates a simple midweek meal.Feta-licious chicken meatballs (pictured top)I’m a big fan of chicken meatballs: they are juicy, light and really easy to make. These ones are flavoured with feta, olives and Turkish pepper flakes, and they’re cooked in a rich tomato sauce. Serve them with salad, pasta or a jacket potato, and they’re epic the next day for a simple lunch al desko.Prep15 minCook15 minServes4For the meatballs600g chicken breasts, or minced chicken150g feta50g black pitted olives4 spring onions, trimmed and roughly chopped2garlic cloves,peeled2 tbsp tomato puree2 tsp Turkish pepper flakes1 tsp dried oreganoSalt and pepperFor the sauce680g tomato passata2 tsp Turkish pepper flakes2 tsp dried oregano1 tsp garlic powder50g feta1 small handful finely chopped parsley leavesHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. To make the meatballs, put the chicken breasts (or mince) in a food processor and add all the remaining meatball ingredients and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Blitz smooth, then roll into 16 meatballs.Swirl a few tablespoons of the passata around the base of a 24cm x 32cm roasting tin. Mix the remaining passata with the Turkish pepper flakes, dried oregano, garlic powder and a big pinch of salt and pepper.Arrange the meatballs in the roasting tin, then pour the sauce over the top to cover. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through – cut one in half to test: it should be pale in colour and firm-textured all the way through. If it’s not quite there, return the tin to the oven for a few minutes more, until the meatballs are cooked.Crumble the remaining 50g feta over the top, scatter on the parsley and serve immediately.Seoulful Korean garlic chickenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Poole/Penguin Random HouseThis is a take ondakdoritang, a Korean chicken and potato stew, reimagined as a quick and easy traybake. It’s packed with flavour, thanks to a lip-smacking sauce made from gochujang, vinegar and soy sauce.Chickenthighs and onions roast together with potatoes that soak up every drop of that rich, deeply savoury sauce.Prep10 minCook1 hr 10 minServes44 tbsp gochujang paste2 tbsp dark soy sauce3 tbsp rice wine1 tbsp sesame oil1 tsp caster sugar4-5cm piecefresh ginger, peeled and grated1kg skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs250ml hot chicken stock2 onions, peeled and roughly chopped8garlic cloves, peeled650gbaby potatoes, halved, larger ones cut into thirds4 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced2 tsp toasted sesame seedsHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Whisk the gochujang, soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, sugar and ginger in a jug.Put the chicken in a large bowl, spoon over three tablespoons of the gochujang sauce and toss to coat. Pour the stock into the jug with the remaining sauce and whisk.Put the onions, garlic, potatoes and chicken in a 30cm x 40cm roasting tin, then pour over the sauce/stock mix. Cover the tin with foil, then roast for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, turn down the heat to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then return the tin to the oven for 30-40 minutes, until the chicken is lovely and crisp and the tops of the potatoes are golden. Scatter on the spring onions and sesame seeds, and serve at once.Persian-style saffron chicken riceView image in fullscreenPerfumed with saffron and cardamom, and with crisp chicken and fluffy rice, this is one of the most exquisite traybakes around. I was inspired by a stunning Persian dish,zereshk polo ba morgh, or saffron-roast chicken with rice and barberries. The OG is all cooked separately, with the chicken in one pot, crisp rice (ortahdig) in another, and barberries candied in sugar syrup in another. Mine, however, has more of a laid-back, throw-it-all-in-the-oven vibe. I love piling on the garnishes for colour and texture – more is more in my opinion – but feel free to scale back if I’ve gone a little overboard.Prep10 minCook55 minServes41 pinchsaffron4garlic cloves, peeled and crushed3 tbsp tomato puree2 tbsp olive oilJuice of 1 orange2 tsp ground coriander½ tsp turmeric¼ tsp ground cinnamonSalt and pepper500ml hot chicken stock1kg skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs250g basmati rice3 cardamom pods, bashed open1 handful of barberries or pomegranate seeds10g pistachios, roughly chopped1 handful coriander leaves300g Greek yoghurt– I use 10% fatHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the saffron in a large bowl, add two tablespoons of just-boiled water, then stir and leave to infuse for a few minutes.Add the garlic, tomato puree, olive oil, orange juice, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon and a very generous pinch each of salt and pepper to the the saffron bowl, then mix to a paste.Whisk half the saffron paste into the stock. Put the chicken thighs in the remaining paste in the bowl and toss to coat.Tip the rice into a 30cm x 40cm roasting tin and pour the stock on top. Add the cardamom pods, then arrange the chicken on top. Cover the tray with foil, bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 20-25 minutes, until the chicken is golden and cooked through and the rice nicely crisp on top.Garnish with the barberries or pomegranate seeds, pistachios and coriander leaves, and serve immediately with yoghurt.These recipes are edited extracts from The Greatest Traybake Cookbook Ever: Weeknight-Friendly Traybakes with Weekend-Worthy Flavours, by John Gregory-Smith, published by Penguin Michael Joseph on 29 January at £25.
