It’s a moving, uplifting look at how children can shine with support. What a tonic for all the bad news stories about education in BritainPhil HarrisonSun 31 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 16.02 EDTShareThe trailer for the new series of Educating Yorkshire is a work of art. Shot in one take and clocking in at more than three minutes, it was written and performed by the children of Thornhill community academy in Dewsbury – in collaboration with Dougal Wilson, the director of Paddington in Peru – and takes in a school band, percussionist dinner ladies and a child seemingly being fired out of a cannon from the roof. It’s sweet and funny, but it’s pointed, too, in style and content.This hasn’t been a great year for the public profile of British secondary schools. The national orgy of hand-wringing prompted byNetflix’s superb Adolescencehas led to something approaching despair at the state of education, entrenching the perception that overstretched and under-resourced teachers act as little more than crowd control, leaving children neurotic and dysfunctional, making them sitting ducks for malignant influencers such as Andrew Tate.This revival then, is perfectly timed. In the trailer, the one-take style showcases humour, variety and invention. The show itself suggests that while many things have changed since we last spent time at this school, in 2014, plenty more has stayed the same. Mr Burton – last seen movingly coaxing fluent speech out ofa stammering pupil, Musharaf– is now Thornhill’s headteacher. Britain has had six prime ministers since 2014. Sometimes a slow but steady uphill trajectory is the most worthwhile path for a public servant to take.So who are our new Musharafs? The very clever and very disruptive Riley is certainly an early candidate. Might he have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? Or dyslexia? Or is his clowning, as Mrs Delaney-Hudson puts it euphemistically, “a behaviour choice”? He faces significant sanctions if his erratic modus operandi can’t be clinically explained. A neurodiversity screening doesn’t help. His mum is nonplussed. Maybe a food diary will offer some answers? The gentleness with which Riley is guided towards better habits is striking. As Mrs D-H puts it: “He absolutely thrives off the positivity.” Who doesn’t?View image in fullscreenSame school, different headteacher … Mr Burton.Photograph: Tom Martin/Channel 4Then there is Amy. “I’m just a mixture of random stuff, put together incorrectly,” she says. She is underselling herself considerably, of course. Amy is a thoroughly eccentric and entirely charming kid, grappling with Tourette syndrome and the absurd (but, at 12, deadly serious) micropolitics of schoolyard friendships.In a pastoral care session, she struggles to find a single good thing to say about herself. It can be stated with confidence that viewers will feel very differently. Amy is obsessed with the school’s hash browns and says quirky, funny things (“Why are your tights so holey? They’re like the Bible”). She is a star; as you watch, you can feel the country’s collective heart begin to melt.Amy’s trajectory illustrates the genius at the heart of this series. What an incredibly careful and delicately performed editing job is routinely done here: to make these children hilarious, but never the butt of the joke; to show their vulnerability, but also their strength; to render their triumphs and tragedies serious, but never overwhelming. It shows us the nuance and the nuts and bolts of their developing personalities, their muddled impulses and motivations, the gently irresistible force of their forming identities.View image in fullscreen‘Thoroughly eccentric and entirely charming’ … Amy.Photograph: Tom Martin/Channel 4The care of the film-makers echoes that of the teaching staff. When Amy has a mild falling out with her friend Millie, the student manager for year 8, Mr Wilson – who isn’t a teacher and is more like a benign big brother – simply brings them together in his office, puts his headphones on and lets them get on with setting their incredibly minor difference. “I don’t think I opened up to people when I was at school,” he reflects later. “But then I don’t know if there was anyone I could have opened up to.” This will chime with many viewers of a certain age who may wish things had been different in their day.There is something gently polemical going on here. Sadly, there will be people who observe this school, with its wellness hub and its positive reinforcement and its atmosphere of listening, rather than shouting, and decry it as “woke”. What happened to the stiff upper lip? To discipline? To “spare the rod and spoil the child”? Educating Yorkshire reinforces something quite different. Things have changed. These children are given tailored, individual pastoral care. They will be better adults for it.For viewers in search of confirmation for their biases, clouds will certainly gather in later episodes. Smartphones will be discussed; social media, too. But initially, at least, solutions are hard-earned, but relatively simple. Is Educating Yorkshire rose-tinted? Probably. Is it filmed and edited to show everyone involved in as positive a light as possible? Almost certainly. Does it feel like a necessary blast of optimism? You bet it does.Educating Yorkshire is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Former children’s laureate Rosen has some suggestions …Michael RosenSun 31 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 16.47 EDTShareIt hardly needs saying but I’ll say it anyway: we live in hard times. Things that some of us thought could and should have been solved haven’t been solved. Things that some of us thought would show signs of progress haven’t progressed. In many ways, wherever we look – locally, nationally or globally – there are things that have got worse. I don’t need to list them.I’m going to make a big claim: we can’t do anything about the things that bring us down if we are oppressed and depressed by them. We have to have hope. We need to be hopeful creatures in order to live. No matter how much events seem to point towards despair, telling us to be pessimistic, I think we have to find strategies and techniques to be hopeful. In spite of everything, we have to find reasons to go on. As someone once put it in a book, “We can’t go over it, we can’t go under it, we’ve got to go through it.”I’m inspired by two pieces of writing: one by the poet Philip Larkin and the other by the singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow.Larkin wrote: “Days are where we live.”Like Larkin, I’m of the view that this “day” is where and how we live. We live “day by day”, “taking one day at a time”, “living from day to day”.It’s true, of course, that our thoughts break out of the capsule of the day by going back into memories and forwards into possible happenings, but my argument here is that we live those emotions in the now, in the day. There’s nowhere else to live them. We go through the acts of remembering (past) and thinking ahead (future) in the reality of the now. The now is in the day. In that sense, even our mental life is in the day.Sheryl Crow tells us that “every day is a winding road”. As we go through a day, it winds around places, people, events, feelings. It’s a good metaphor.She also says that every day is a faded sign.Yes! Our days are full of the faded signs of our own lives. We go through a day with fragments of our past life coming up on our mental TV screen. What follows are some thoughts about hope and even ways to be hopeful of having good days. Feel free to adopt them, adapt them or, better still, come up with your own. It all helps!Always experimentTo experiment is to do something new, it’s to discover something in the world around us, it’s to discover something about yourself. And a big discovery (or it may be a reminder) is that we don’t have to be passive receivers of what the world throws at us. We can take any part of the world and experiment with it, see what happens if …The scene: it’s 10 o’clock at night. I should be closing down. Not looking at a screen. Not eating or drinking. Then I remember that in the freezer is the tub of Belgian chocolate ice-cream I bought the other day. I say to myself, “This is silly. You don’t neeeeeeeed a bowl of Belgian chocolate ice-cream. You don’t need to taste shavings of Belgian chocolate ice-cream sitting on your tongue, melting slowly and slipping down your throat. You so, so, so don’t need Belgian chocolate ice-cream.”For some mysterious reason I then find that I have found my way into the kitchen. And, very surprisingly, I’m standing next to the fridge.I open the freezer drawer. O my, poor little Belgian chocolate ice-cream tub, all on its own in the freezer basket.O my, it looks to me as if there are about four spoonfuls left. The problem is we don’t have any spoons. O we do!But we’re talking about experimenting. Surely there’s no experimenting left to do. I have the tub. I have the spoon. I don’t even need a bowl. It’s a done deal. Just get on with it.Ah but …It’s at this moment my experimenting mind turns on. What if (and that’s the key phrase in the world history and practice of experimenting) … what if, I were to add something to the Belgian chocolate ice-cream? That old roast potato that’s sitting in the fridge? Belgian chocolate and cold roast potato? Maybe not. What about … raisins?My experimenting mind says, why don’t I rearrange the known world, and add raisins to these last four scoops of Belgian chocolate ice-cream?And so it is that when I open Michael’s dried fruit cupboard, there they are, each sultana with a smile on its face, saying, “Eat me.” And, I have plans. I am going to drop and scatter a few on to my four scoops of Belgian chocolate ice-cream. It’s an experiment. I want to know if this is a great combination. I’m not a gambling man, but I’m thinking that the odds are good. I scatter the sultanas. I dig in.There’s a moment when I pause to take it in. Has it worked? Or have I ruined the day?It has worked. The flavours match perfectly. But then, as with all good experiments, there’s an unexpected outcome. I was all prepared for an interesting clash of texture: the freezing-melting of the ice-cream with the chewiness of the sultana. But something else happened. The ice-cream has frozen the sultanas. They have turned into resistant toffee-like pebbles. So as the chocolate melts, the sultana, in this frozen state, persists and can only give up its flavour if I give it a good old chew. What’s happened is that the whole business of this 10 o’clock snack has slowed down. It’s become impossible to consume Belgian chocolate ice-cream laced with sultanas quickly. It can’t be rushed. It has to be taken step by step. With pauses. While the flavours and textures blend.I’ll leave you with that image, if I may.To have good days, you need good nightsIf our nights are crap, our days are crap. We’re irritable and ineffective. We find it hard to concentrate, hard to remember stuff, hard to relax, hard to think, hard to be nice to anyone, more likely to fly off the handle. And that’s just the stuff we can see and be aware of. We can be pretty sure that all the parts of our body that need to rest in order to recuperate, repair and regenerate are having a hard time, too.I have one big insight into this. In 2020, I was put into an induced coma. It lasted for around 42 days. While I was put into this coma, I was intubated and ventilated – meaning that the doctors and nurses put a tube down my throat and pumped air down the tube into my lungs.But why did they do that? The theory behind it is that if you “switch off” a patient, then you give them a better chance of recovery. Because the patient doesn’t do that stuff for themselves, the regenerative powers that the body has are not in any way “competing” with the muscles and nerves of the body for energy and power.Any doctor will tell you that one of the best treatments for illness is rest and sleep. We all know that if we try to ignore heavy colds, flu, or any other big infection such as bronchitis or pneumonia, our bodies can’t cope. Things get worse.It follows, then, that nights are our place of healing. Nights are our rehab treatment. If we can’t sleep, it’s more difficult to rehab. (The opposite is true, too: if we can’t rehab, it’s difficult to sleep.)Here is one of my tricks for getting to sleep. I’m not going to claim that it’s absolutely failsafe and you may want to adapt so that it works for you. Remember the principle: whatever works, works!First step is the “one good thing” principle. At some point, at the beginning, on your way to bed, as you get into bed, as your head hits the pillow, you concentrate on one good thing that happened to you, or that you did on that day. It can be as tiny and as insignificant as how you successfully washed a burnt, greased-up oven pan!Next step.I bore myself to sleep.My failsafe bore is counting, starting at one. But that’s not enough. It’s not any old counting. You have to count slowly, concentrating on each number, thinking of the shape of the number itself. However, you won’t be able to. Your mind wants to be interested in all that other stuff. So by the time you get to about nine or 10, your mind flips on to one of the anxieties or terrors. What do you do now? You go back to one. What? But that’s sooooo boring! Exactly. You start again. Slowly, carefully, thinking of the shape of each number. The moment that your mind flicks on to one of the anxieties, back you go to one.Word of warning: you don’t do this in an irritated way. You do it in a detached, calm and contented way. You don’t even say to yourself “back to one” because that’s another subject in itself. You just go back to one, gently, nonchalantly, calmly.Next: you must not, must not move, twitch, fiddle, scratch, rub, shift about in any way. You are a statue. Think of yourself as a statue. If you twitch, scratch, shake your leg or some such, back you go to one. Again, don’t do it resentfully or irritatedly. Just do it nonchalantly and calmly.So you have two things going on here, counting and being a statue.View image in fullscreenStay unitedMy mother is opening an envelope at the breakfast table. She pulls out a piece of paper and, with an ironic look on her face, turns to me and my brother and says, with a triumphant edge to her voice, “I’m four-sevenths of your father!”At the time, I don’t think I fully understood what she was talking about and it took some explaining. The National Union of Teachers campaigned for many years for equal pay for female teachers. The National Association of School Masters (as I think it was called then) opposed it. It was a bitter fight and it divided staffrooms and families, but in the end the NUT and other trade unions won the argument, convinced government to put it in place but … with one proviso: equal pay couldn’t be implemented in one go. It had to be implemented in “seven increments”, each one added on annually. So it was that I remember my mother’s exultant cry on this particular morning indicated that she had reached a point where her pay was calculated on the basis of being four-sevenths of what a man would have received.The kitchen table was a place where I learned a lot about these wins and losses. The big one for them had been what has come to be known as the Battle of Cable Street of 1936, where a huge street demonstration (including my parents, Harold Rosen and Connie Isakofsky) stopped the British Union of Fascists from marching through a largely Jewish area in the East End of London.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Your mother, a respectable suburban primary school teacher, is telling you a story about a day on the streets, taking place in what always seemed like a strange mythic place and time, “the East End in the 1930s”.As with my mother and the equal pay win, I got it from my parents that you might win something but it won’t be all. Fascism didn’t win in Britain, but by 1942, it looked very much as if it was going to engulf the whole of Europe. As my mother said, if Hitler had won, we (my brother and me) “wouldn’t be here”.These wins and losses explain why my mother behaved the way she did during the “bus strike” of May and June 1958. By then I was at grammar school, aged 12, and for many of us, a bus journey was essential. We lived three miles or so from school. Teachers and parents ferried the school students to school. I got a lift in the maths teacher’s Morris Minor and, given that I was hopeless at maths, the journeys were a bit tense. Pretty soon, the conversation in the playground and at “register time‘” was around allegedly overpaid bus drivers holding Londoners to ransom. I came home repeating some of this. My mother said, “You’ll have to put some money in the bucket.”“What bucket?”“There’ll be a bucket outside Harrow Weald Bus Garage, so that you can show support for them.”“How do you know there’ll be a bucket?”“There’s always a bucket. It’s for the strike fund. To support the people out on strike. They’re not getting paid.”Once when I was quite young (a teenager, I think) I asked my father: what is a trade union? He said that he had once asked his Zeyde (Yiddish for grandfather) that same question. English was Zeyde’s second or even third language, with Yiddish and Polish being his first two languages. My father imitated him affectionately:“Zeyde told me, ‘Voss is a union? A union is a box o’ matches. One match – you can break. Two matches – you can break. Three matches – you can break. But take a whole box o’ matches – you can’t break. That is voss is a union.’”When my father’s Zeyde was talking about this, he was pulling it out of his past in the struggles for wages and equality for Polish Jewish workers in the 1880s and 90s.I believe that the way we talk is formed through our social interactions using words and phrases developed over hundreds of years of millions more social interactions.When we see ourselves as part of others, and others as part of us, then the idea of a union is a logical necessity.Listen – really listen – to musicTrying to explain why we like listening to music is quite hard. You could almost say that the point of a good deal of music is that it expresses things that we can’t say in words. If we could express in words all that music does for us, there wouldn’t be much point in having music.What I really like doing is getting to a place where, when listening to Van Morrison, I can’t say why I’m enjoying it. Philosophers have words for this feeling – words like “inexpressible”, “ineffable” and “sublime”.For the sublime to happen, I find it’s a good idea for me to switch off the wordy stuff.What I’ve taught myself to do is what I call “sitting in”. If I hear a tune, a voice, a band, a sound that catches my ear, I give myself the space to “sit in” with it. This means playing it over and over again. Quite often, for this to be that sublime moment, I will find that I can’t imitate it. I can’t sing it or whistle it, or play it on my harmonica. All I can do with it is to let it go into my mind and for my mind to feel around it as if I’m stroking a cat with my eyes shut.Because some of Van Morrison’s songs are themselves mysterious, elliptical and suggestive rather than literal and obvious, there’s a mystique that feeds into something about Van the Man and his music that I find I can’t grasp. Interestingly, he has his own words for this: “the inarticulate speech of the heart” – which is both the title and one of the repeated choruses of one of his songs.Understand deathWe’ve been talking about good days, so what’s death got to do with it? Surely death is the end of all days, good or bad. Yes, but it’s my view that one way to have good days is to sort out in our minds what we think about death. I find that as and when I make peace with death, it gives me the strength to better appreciate my days.As far as I understand life and death, I don’t see much difference between me and a dandelion or a butterfly. Reproduction produces us; we have various lifeforms; we die. I understand that, for some, this is a profoundly depressing thought. But can I turn that feeling on its head?If there’s no afterlife, if there are no gods arranging things, if this is all we have, then there isn’t much point in being miserable. Further, we should try not to make other people miserable and, if anything, when we can, we should try to help make other people be not-miserable.I find it easier to think of now, this day, this time here, as being the “all we have”, the time we have to get on and do whatever it is that we think is worth doing. Because, sure as anything, I couldn’t do it before I was born and I’m not going to be able to do it after I’ve died.But what about the loved one who’s died? How could they have been so selfish to have not waited till we went first? Believe it or not, there were moments after my son Eddie died when I not only thought “it” was cruel that he died but also that “he” had been cruel to have died!One of my main reasons for regret and sadness is that I feel cut off from conversations with him, about him. If someone dies, these come to a stop. You are stuck in the buffers and can’t go on having these conversations. Instead, the conversations become frozen, sometimes in places you wish they weren’t frozen.I can live with the paradox that I think life is purposeless by keeping focus on this day todayOne way round this is to have conversations with others who knew the person who’s gone. These can be hard. My son had a life of his own. He was nearly 19. He had several lives that were quite separate from each other: his last years at school; his time with the mates that he played sport with; his workmates in the theatre (he was a “crewman” in the West End); his girlfriend; and, of course, the life he had with me and the family. I have to admit with huge regret that I know very little about all the parts of his life apart from the one with the family.For years, I haven’t done anything about it. Then, not long before writing this, I asked myself, “What became of Greg?” (not his real name). I remember Eddie talking about Greg as his best mate. And here we are, 25 years since Eddie died and I haven’t exchanged a single word with Greg. Or with any of his other friends.Michael Rosen and his son Joe look back: ‘I am gooning about, but this photo is tinged with sadness’Read moreWhat would you do? Would you get in touch with one or some of them? I decided to. I’m just beginning. I’ve started to hear bits and pieces about Eddie that I had no idea existed. I started to hear some things that have made me proud of him (even more proud than I was anyway!). In fact, meeting up with Greg for a couple of hours in a pub not far from where we sat with Eddie just over 25 years before was a good day! At times painful, but a good day all the same.Another thought: whether someone is alive or dead, the past has gone. When I sit in a state of regret and loss about Eddie as a child, it can (if I let it) be a place only and purely of regret and loss. It’s as if I say to myself, “That funny moment when Eddie found a dead mouse and thought it was a gerbil is sad because Eddie isn’t here any more.” Why do I do that? Why do I spoil that funny moment by smothering it with Eddie’s death? After all, that moment is no more “gone” than the scenes with any of my other children or the scenes with my father or mother or brother. So I tell myself I shouldn’t taint these fun memories with Eddie with the fact that he’s died.I can tell you, it’s taken some time to think that one through! So this is a way of pulling memories of Eddie into the good days. I can also say that thinking about this helps me think about what it means to die. I can live with the paradox that I think life is purposeless by keeping focus on this day today. A day in which I’ll have a go at doing something worthwhile.This is an edited extract from Good Days: An A-Z of Hope and Happiness by Michael Rosen, published by Ebury on 4 September at £16.99.

Here, couples share why they’ve tied the knot for a second timeAnn LeeSun 31 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTShareWhen Jade Foster-Jerrett married Dean in 2015, the couple decided that if they were still together in 10 years’ time, they would renew their vows. “We always said that it felt like a big milestone if we ever made it – which, luckily, we did.” This month, they held a ceremony in the forest behind their home, colourful bunting fluttering in the wind, with a Mary Poppins impersonator emerging from the trees to surprise their guests and officiate. “We love to have a laugh,” she says.Mary Poppins was Foster-Jerrett’s favourite film when she was a child, and she used to watch it with her father, who died in 2020. “We wanted to mark him not being there,” says the 42-year-old children’s entertainer from Romford, London. Her best friend, who was a bridesmaid at her first wedding, did a reading, and the couple gave their 22 guests kites made of paper studded with poppy seeds that they could plant later at home. Afterwards, they returned home for food and drinks with their guests, including their 12-year-old son and Foster-Jerrett’s 19-year-old son from her first marriage. Since the ceremony, she and Dean, a 49-year-old local government officer, “are closer than ever. We realised how much more in love we are with each other.”View image in fullscreenDean and Jade Foster-Jerrett with ‘Mary Poppins’.Composite: Guardian design; supplied image; Getty ImagesFoster-Jerrett and her husband are one of the many couples choosing to take part in vow renewals. It’s something that celebrities have been doing with gusto this summer. Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz renewed their vows in August, just three years after their original wedding. Guy Ritchie and his wife, Jacqui Ainsley, also renewed their vows in August at Stonehenge after 10 years of marriage. Other celebrities who have said “I do” again include singer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z; musician Justin Timberlake and actor Jessica Biel; actors Viola Davis and Julius Tennon; former talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres and actor Portia de Rossi; and the Biebers, model Hailey and singer Justin. Brooklyn’s own parents, David and Victoria Beckham, renewed their vows in2006.The ceremonies, where couples reaffirm their love for one another, can be officiated by anyone as they’re not legally binding, so they might ask friends, family – or indeed Mary Poppins tribute acts.View image in fullscreenJulius Tennon and Viola Davis, who have renewed their vows more than once.Photograph: Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for LacmaSusanna Abse, a couples therapist and author of Tell Me the Truth About Love, says one of the main reasons couples decide to renew their vows is that they didn’t have the wedding they wanted the first time round. “There’s so much buildup and expectation, and a lot of fantasy around it,” she says. “There is family, people to please.” Doing it all over again can be an attempt to reclaim the day. “They feel they’ve got more control over how the whole thing goes, and it is about them and not about other people’s ideas of how things should be.”For her first wedding to Dean, Foster-Jerrett, who also works as a celebrant, felt she needed to conform to how a blushing bride should look, with a long dress and her hair pinned up. “This time I wore my dream dress, which was gothic and lacy, with some Dr Martens. I felt the best I’ve ever felt.”John Moody, 74, a retired production manager from Torquay, Devon, decided to throw his wife, Jenny, 78, a surprise vow renewal in March for their 50th anniversary. Partly, this was an attempt to “make up” for their first wedding in 1975. “It was a register office job, the normal 10 minutes in and out, because we didn’t have a lot of money,” he says. Working up to the renewal was “a bit difficult”, he says: “I’ve never lied so much in my life.”He convinced Jenny, a retired credit controller, that she had to get a new dress so they could have an anniversary photoshoot on Babbacombe Downs, overlooking the sea. On the day, when she saw the guests waiting for them and realised what was really happening, “she looked gobsmacked. I said: ‘Don’t hit me!’ And she said: ‘No, I’m not going to do it here.’” Afterwards, they took the party to the nearby home of their 47-year-old daughter, Nicola, to celebrate with a meal and champagne.View image in fullscreen‘There were three ladies and a dog, plus us’ … David Smith with Sabina and the Revd Dr John Barker.Composite: Guardian design; supplied image; Getty ImagesFor David Smith, 62, who is on sabbatical from his job as a consultant, his vow renewal in 2022 was a chance to celebrate with people who couldn’t attend his wedding a decade earlier. “We were living in Macedonia and got married there. Although some family came, not all of them could. We always had an idea that we would do something in the UK.”Smith is originally from Beckenham, London and now lives in Maspalomas, Gran Canaria. In 2022, he was based in Ghana and returned to England for the ceremony, but things didn’t quite go to plan. A few days before, the queen died and then his wife, Sabina, 62, tested positive for Covid. The couple, who are Christians, decided to change the ceremony, which was going to be held at a church in Harrow Weald, London, and officiated by a vicar, into a memorial for the queen. “Sabina clearly wasn’t going to be able to attend the service,” says Smith.The vow renewal took place the week after; it was a much more stripped-back affair than what they were originally planning, during a normal church service, with no guests. Smith’s two sons from his first marriage had attended the revamped memorial, but were unable to make the new date. “Normally, there’s three ladies and a dog,” he says, “and there were three ladies and a dog, plus us. We were happy to get it done. It felt more intimate. When you’re making your renewal, the primary purpose is you’re doing it in the eyes of God.” The couple celebrated by going for lunch with the vicar and his wife.There’s a scepticism, though, that comes with the news of vow renewals. The Daily Mail once called vow renewals the “kiss of death for your marriage”. Musician Seal and model Heidi Klum renewed their vows every year during their seven-year marriage before separating in 2012. The singer later said that the renewals “turned into a little bit of a circus”. Rapper Kanye West and reality TV star Kim Kardashian renewed their vows at home in Los Angeles in 2019 for their five-year anniversary and went on to divorce a few years later.View image in fullscreenBrooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz.Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty ImagesKatie Price and her third husband, Kieran Hayler, renewed their vows three times in three years, after having two weddings in 2013. One month after their last vow renewal in 2017, Price announced she was divorcing Hayler after he had an affair.Abse says some vow renewals are because of what she calls a “breach” in the relationship. “There might have been an affair or something that has left them both feeling like their relationship came under a lot of threat. Things have gone really wrong, and then there’s a feeling of wanting to restart, to put something behind you as a couple that has been really disruptive to your relationship.”The late Black Sabbath rocker Ozzy Osbourne renewed his vows with his wife, Sharon, in Las Vegas in 2017, a year after his affair with Michelle Pugh, his former hairstylist, was revealed. “This is a new beginning,” Osbourne told Hello! magazine afterwards. “I think that everyone should reaffirm their marriage.”“It’s easy to mock people who do it,” saysSarah Haywood, a wedding planner based in London. “Even if it’s because you’ve gone through a rough patch, and you’ve decided to come out the other end and remain together, and reaffirm why you’re staying together, that’s also pretty powerful.”Carol Smith, an independent celebrant from Somerset, says: “People are quite cynical when we see the rich and famous having them. But the couples that I have worked with – all of them – are very much in love and very committed.” Smith has noticed a surge in vow renewals over the years. When she first started working as a celebrant in 2016, vow renewals weren’t really on her clients’ radar, but now they make up 50% of the ceremonies she officiates. “They’re smaller [than the original wedding], they’re much more intimate, they’re much more meaningful.”View image in fullscreen‘The wedding is a big celebration with family, and this was very personal’ … Gilly Cant with Ian.Composite: Guardian design; supplied image; Getty ImagesGilly Cant, 58, from Herstmonceux, East Sussex, told her husband, Ian, 64, a CCTV and security engineer, that she wanted to renew their vows – but she didn’t tell him where the ceremony was going to be or who would be there. The couple married 10 years ago in their friend’s garden in the same village. This month, she surprised him by taking him back to the exact same spot to renew their vows, between two oak trees, overlooking the South Downs with the same registrar who officiated their wedding.“I’d got us two rings,” says Cant, who wore the same dress that she wore at the first wedding. “He couldn’t make up his mind on a wedding ring at the time. He just bought a really cheap one when we got married.” On the back, she had engraved “It must be love”, a reference to the Madness song that was played on their wedding night in 2015.There were no other guests at the renewal. “It’s something that I wouldn’t have felt comfortable doing in front of other people, even if they were our friends and family, because it wasn’t about doing it for other people,” says Cant. “The wedding is a big celebration with family, and this was very personal. It was about us renewing our love for each other and the promises that we made 10 years ago.” Cant’s son and daughter from her first marriage, and Ian’s two sons and daughter from his first marriage, were all “happy that we did it”.The couple have been through plenty of ups and downs during their relationship – Cant was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013, four years after they first got together, and underwent a double mastectomy. “When I was diagnosed, I was 45, and my goal was to make it to 50 years old. When you’ve had cancer, your life goals are quite short. I’ve lost so many friends who should still be here. Being able to celebrate 10 years of being married – I really didn’t know whether that would ever happen. So, I’ve been really lucky.” The ceremony was also a chance to remember her father and Ian’s best man, who have both since died. They went for a Turkish meal afterwards. “It was absolutely perfect,” says Cant, who now runsFlat Friends UK, a charity for women who don’t have breast reconstruction after a mastectomy.View image in fullscreen‘It felt very deep and meaningful’ … Catherine Dall’Occo with Kym.Composite: Guardian design; supplied image; Getty ImagesInstead of throwing a party for her 25th wedding anniversary, Catherine Dall’Occo, 58, from Calne, Wiltshire, decided to renew her vows with her husband, Kym, 65, instead. They were keen to include some people who weren’t around for their first wedding in 2000 – their daughters, Poppy, 24, and Emily, 22. Their children, she says, “wrote their own vows to us as parents and from them as daughters. Sometimes you just need these magic moments to reassure you that all is well in the world.”Dall’Occo, who manages a racing club, and her husband, a special needs school driver, took part this month in a handfasting ceremony, a Celtic ritual in which the couple’s hands are tied together to symbolise how their lives are bound together, at the Temple of Minerva in Bath in front of just 12 guests. They used the same celebrant who had conducted her father’s funeral the year before. “We all cried from start to finish. It felt very deep and meaningful. I don’t think either of us had anticipated the intense feeling that you get from standing there with your loved one, reminding them of how you feel and everything that’s been wonderful but also tough about the journey.”Vow renewals serve as a welcome reminder of everything a couple has achieved while they were married. “It’s made us appreciate more what we’ve done over the years,” says Moody. “We’ve travelled, we’ve moved. It’s made us look forward to the next few years.”“It was really nice to reflect back – a lot happens in 10 years,” says Foster-Jerrett. “It made us remember why we did what we did,” adds Cant. “It’s made the bond even stronger.”And it seems once you’ve renewed your vows, it’s hard to stop. Back home after her woodland ceremony, Foster-Jerrett had just finished tidying up her garden from the celebration that day, when she turned to her husband: “I was like: ‘Another 10 years?’ I would definitely do it again. Hopefully we make it.”Some people featured in this article responded to acommunity callout. You can contribute to open calloutshereDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It looks exactly like what you’d expect of a bar in the Financial District. Men in button-up shirts stand around a tall table with folded arms, ranting about the current season as multiple baseball games are playing on TV screens all around the bar.I feel out of place as I wait for a friend, but I know it’s only a matter of time until things change. A stream of women slowly trickles in, group by group. The mood abruptly changes when the TV screens flicker on to a clip of sparkling water. The bar cranks up the volume, a wistful three notes plays over the speaker, the brief theme song of what has become a show so popular that sports bars in Manhattan are throwing watch parties for women who, like me, are years older than the show’s protagonist.I have a confession: when I first watched The Summer I Turned Pretty upon the series’s release onAmazonin 2022, I only got through two episodes. I quickly deemed the show too cringe-inducing to handle. I believed I had grown out oflove trianglesdriven by hormones and a lack of a fully developed prefrontal cortex. Growing up had taught me there were much, much more important choices to make in life than who you take to debutante ball. Also, the lead character’s name is Belly, and no one’s questioning that?Stop bullying The Summer I Turned Pretty cast and start ‘acting normal’, Amazon tells fansRead moreBut when I gave the show another chance this summer, after the encouragement of a friend, I realized just how wrong I was. Once I dropped my defenses and settled into life in Cousins, the fictional beach town where the show is set, I was hooked. And when my social media feeds adjusted to my new obsession, I realized just how many people were as well.Videoaftervideoshowed theheavy investmentadultshavein this teen drama, fromscreamingat TVs tofull-on tearsfrom the show. Primereported25 million worldwide viewers tuned into the third season’s premiere the week of its release, a 40% increase from the second season’s release in 2023.It’s been a strange summer for American pop culture. After Charli xcx’s Brat painted last summer green, there’s been a curious absence of the standard “song of the summer”. The closest contender, some argue, is the “nothing beats a Jet2 holiday” ad that’s been featured in clip after clip online. Themovie theaterswere filled with reboots and sequels forSupermanandJurassic Park. And the most popular TV show in the US appeared to beLove Island, which had near-daily episodes of eye-rolling drama for six weeks until mid-July.Instead of a clubby pop song, this summer’s rhythms have been dictated by constant updates to the rapidly changing world we’re living in. Americans seem to be feelingmore uncertainabout their futures than ever. News notifications can feel like a never-ending barrage for anyone trying to keep up.In other words, the timing was ripe for a show that provides an escape. As temperatures started to peak, the third and final season of The Summer I Turned Pretty premiered in mid-July and has cemented itself, for many, as the show that saved summer.The series centers Isabel “Belly” Conklin (Lola Tung), whose family spends every summer at the Fishers’ giant beach house at Cousins, a town resembling the neighborhoods of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The series starts the summer that Belly turns, you guessed it, pretty and begins to attract the attention of boys, including the two Fisher brothers, Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno).Summer sizzlers! It’s the 20 hottest TV shows of the seasonRead moreIn the backdrop of this coming-of-age summer is the cancer diagnosis of Susannah (Rachel Blanchard), the Fisher matriarch who is the college best friend of Belly’s mom. Susannah’s diagnosis is a secret to most, allowing many of the characters to have their carefree teenage summer. Belly’s biggest concern appears to be whether Conrad, the brooding older brother and her longtime crush, has any feelings for her – or whether she should be with Jeremiah, her “best friend” who is drawn to her.In its third season, the series has wholeheartedly embraced this Austenian love triangle, framing it against complex emotions around grief. Susannah’s death less than a year after that first summer has only heightened Belly’s emotional hold over both brothers. Their late mother, on her deathbed, called Belly “my special girl” and often referred to her as the daughter she never had.But by the start of the season, Belly, who was 15 in the show’s first season, is now about to turn 21 and has made her choice. After an intense but failed relationship with Conrad, Belly has chosen Jeremiah. The two have been together in college for three years while Conrad was on the west coast. But while the three characters pretend things are good and settled, they are clearly far from it.As a grown adult, I’m fully aware of how absurd this plot is. A love triangle with two brothers is only a huge red flag right next to an arrow pointed toward a therapist’s office. But at some point, I accepted The Summer I Turned Pretty as a fantasy world that is a pastel-tinged version of our own and learned to bask in its endless, wonderful melodrama.View image in fullscreenGavin Casalegno and Lola Tung.Photograph: Erika Doss/PrimeThe Summer I Turned Pretty is the second success for author Jenny Han, co-runner of the series and author of thetrilogythat inspired the show. Her other booktrilogy, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before wasadaptedfor Netflix and became one of its most-watched original movies when it was released in 2018.The series feels like a surprise hit for Amazon, which has found more success with shows targeted to male audiences such asThe Boys,Jack RyanandReacher. Netflix has been the traditional home for originals geared toward young women and teens likeNever Have I Ever,HeartstopperandXO, Kitty, the spin-off show from To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.Han seems to have mastered teen romance, making it all feel refreshingly tender and sweet, taking seriously what is often dismissed as frivolous. Her stories ask readers and viewers to step into worlds where the choices these teenage girls make feel undeniably consequential.It’s a kind of unapologetic sincerity that evokes the teen dramas of the early 2000s. In The Summer I Turned Pretty, declarations of love are delivered with full gusto, the sound of waves crashing in the background. And the show never fails to lean on its seemingly unlimited soundtrack budget. So far, the series has played no less than20 Taylor Swift songsthat punctuate its emotional high points. Many have pointed out that the show shares a filming location – Wilmington, North Carolina – withOne Tree Hill, which premiered over two decades ago.And unlike the first and second seasons, which were released in batches, the 12 episodes of this final season are released every Wednesday. To those of us who grew up with cable, it’s reminiscent of the feeling of rushing home to catch the newest episode of a TV show. The wait encourages anticipation, what feels rare in an era of endless, bingeable content online. It’s also proof that old-fashioned scripted TV shows, under a traditional weekly release schedule, can still have pull over younger audiences who areincreasingly drawnto platforms including YouTube.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

The endless stream of content has culminated into a sort of communal viewing experience. With clips on TikTok, fans can relive the show’s moments over and over again with plenty of commentary and mockery.Of course, the show indulges in the drama surrounding its love triangle. As with any teen love triangle, people have divided themselves into “teams”. Who you root for suddenly becomes a barometer of your core values. The passion over the characters have become so intense that Prime Video and members of the show have had toremind viewersto conduct themselves respectfully online. Han, in an Instagram story, told fans that “the cast shouldn’t have to endure harassment because of the roles they play”. Amazon reminded fans that “the show isn’t real but the people playing the characters are”.Some elements in the third season seem so excessive and ridiculous as to be made for virality. (Some spoilers ahead.) In a scene in the season’s sixth episode, Conrad and Belly make a pit – stop at a roadside peach stand. As Belly eats a peach, a heavy stream of juice runs down her mouth. Conrad untucks his plain white T-shirt – clearly a part of hiscoastal-dad drip– to gingerly wipe the juice from her mouth.Videoson TikTok quickly turned the scene into aninside jokeamong fans. Even Nobel prize laureate and assassination-attempt survivor Malala Yousafzaiposteda picture of herself on Instagram holding up a peach, with the caption “counting the minutes until Wednesday”.For me, the absurdity of it all is a reminder that the show is very much fiction, a world to step into like a book splayed open on a poolside lounge chair. I can’t help but root for Belly. We all know what it’s like to be young, naive and feel like the weight of the world rests on each choice we have to make for ourselves. Tuning in every week feels like a quick escape back to that time – far away from the usual cadences of life, as evocative as summer itself.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionTelevisionAmazon Prime VideoDramaRomance booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A new show at the Tate explores the dramatic side of an uncompromising artistJonathan JonesSun 31 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 15.25 EDTShareShe is called the Weeping Woman, but that is an understatement. She grinds her teeth on a handkerchief that’s like a jagged white-and-blue spearhead while her fingers claw at her face, tearing the flesh to expose her skull. Her chin is two grenades, her eyes are filled with horror – black silhouettes of planes are held in her transfixed eyeballs. They are the German bombers that attacked the Basque town Guernica on 26 April 1937.Picasso’s Weeping Woman was bought from him by the British surrealist Roland Penrose in November 1937, fresh off the easel. Fifty years later, his son gave it in lieu of tax to the Tate Gallery. Now it is about to star in aTate Modernexhibition that showcases the museum’s Picasso collection, enhanced with terrific loans from the Musée Picasso in Paris.Weeping Woman is a hair-raising example of Picasso’s feel for drama. Tate Modern’s blockbuster, calledTheatre Picasso, is “staged” rather than curated, by the contemporary film artist Wu Tsang and writer Enrique Fuenteblanca in a series of cabaret and theatre-like spaces they hope will give visitors “a rhythmic experience”. Picasso, says Tsang, anticipated “the fluid relationship that artists have today with performance”.Picasso’s theatre gave him the imaginative power to do what few other artists managed: make art that fought fascismHe certainly loved a good show. Picasso’s passion for drama included a spectacle that ended in real bloodshed – bullfighting. The corridas fuelled some of his greatest art. Guernica evolved from visceral, densely compacted paintings he did in the 1930s of dying matadors, horses gored by bulls and the artist’s alter ego, the man-bull Minotaur.Yet he was equally at home at the ballet, creating sets and costumes for the production Parade in 1917 with Jean Cocteau and Erik Satie, and going on to collaborate with Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. His first marriage in 1918 was to a dancer in the company, Olga Khokhlova – it was disastrous, and the artist’s treatment of women has in recent years been heavily scrutinised.The most gossipy exhibit in Theatre Picasso suggests he was an opera fan, too: in a clip from a movie shot by Man Ray, the stocky painter drags up as the opera heroine Carmen. “It’s a bit of a gem to me to see him with the mantilla and the cigar,” says Tsang.But it was his later fierce rejection of the world of ballet and high-society elegance that produced the greatest Picasso in the Tate collection. The Three Dancers, painted in 1925, is violent, apocalyptic and has never calmed down. It’s a drama we don’t fully understand but whose brutal denouement we watch like a stunned audience.View image in fullscreenPablo Picasso at his home, La California, in Cannes, France, in 1955.Photograph: Express/Getty ImagesIt’s like a stage set, a room with a view, except beyond the windows, which are weirdly opaque, is only a blue Mediterranean sky of hard pigment suggesting unbreathable air. Life is a theatre, this painting suggests, where we move among fake furniture in an illusory set with no freedom or space.The people in The Three Dancers unleash themselves in Dionysian frenzy. The woman in the centre flings her arms in the air as she raises her head to the sky: she is dancing to hot jazz, surely, in 1925, the year The Great Gatsby was published. But this dance is lethal. You can feel it get faster and madder. On the left, a woman gyrates even more ecstatically, twisting over so there seems to be a round hole showing dead sky where her heart should be. Her face has the empty nose socket and eyes of a skull. On the right, a male dancer has a partly brown, partly white body, suggesting the multiculturalism of jazz, more embraced in 1920s France than the segregationist US – Josephine Baker first performed in Paris in October that year.The Three Dancers is one of Picasso’s crucial revolutionary works. He regarded it as better than Guernica and kept it with him until 1965, when he sold it directly to the Tate. With its flattened space and overlapping, hard-to-read images, the piece helped to revive cubism, an artistic experiment that seemed to be have ended by 1914, at the outbreak of the first world war.The movement, undertaken by Picasso and Georges Braque from 1907, had asked fundamental questions: what is the fabric of reality, and can art see it? By 1913, when Picasso collaged and drew Bottle of Vieux Marc, Glass, Guitar and Newspaper, he and Braque used real things in their art, inventing the appropriation of found materials as an artistic technique.Then came the war. Picasso stepped back from this dizzying demolition of art as Europeans then knew it. Some people even blamed the war on the chaos of cubism. By 1918, Picasso participated in the “Call to Order” movement that hoped to restore civilisation with a more traditionalist art. Seated Woman in a Chemise from 1923 is a captivating example of this quieter phase of his work: when Picasso chose to draw or paint “properly”, he could do so better than anyone. As he justifiably claimed, he was born with the talent of Raphael and had to learn to paint like a child.The fuse that set Picasso back on a revolutionary road came in 1924, when a younger group of artists, the surrealists, published their manifesto declaring that all creativity comes from the unconscious and erotic compulsion. The Three Dancers’ jazz age cocktail of cubism and the surrealist cult of desire liberated Picasso to create his most pungent artworks, including The Acrobat, a wondrous painting of an impossible body, and the rampant sculpture Cock (the bird, but it’s truly cocky). The early 1930s was also when he pursued sex as a Sadeian theatre and discovered cubism’s most shocking use – to show all a lover’s orifices at the same time. A dazzling work from this era is his 1936 print Faun Revealing a Sleeping Woman, in which he changes into a mythic creature looking at his lover with unabashed voyeurism.Picasso’s scandalous theatre of sex and death gave him the imaginative power to do what few other artists managed: make art that fought fascism. The year he painted Weeping Woman, there were bombers in his eyes. In his loft in a 17th-century building on Rue des Grands Augustins, Paris, he planned and executed the gut-wrenching Guernica, which he finished by early June and unveiled in July in the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris international exhibition.Picasso is certainly theatrical, but his true genre is tragedy. The Weeping Woman cannot stop herself seeing those murderous planes. The nightmare is turning her skin green, as if she rots. Yet a honeybee sucks from a tear: out of this paralysed rage, some hope might come, if people act. The Weeping Woman is often identified with his lover Dora Maar, but why are her fingers so chunky? They look more like Picasso’s. Just as he could imagine himself as Carmen, Picasso is the woman weeping, merging with Maar in grief for the murdered of Guernica and those yet to die in the age of total war.When I look at Guernica now I see Gaza, I see Ukraine. When I look at Picasso’s satirical strip The Dream and Lie of Franco, I see today’s far-right populists and new-style dictators. Picasso lived in a time of emergency and so, it seems, do we. He was far from a perfect human being in his private life. But he was ultimately a political artist who acted in history. On that stage he was on the side of the angels – and of the Weeping Woman.Scene setters: works from the Tate exhibitionView image in fullscreenPablo Picasso’s Bust of a Woman 1909.Photograph: Rod Tidnam/© Succession Picasso/DACSBust of a Woman, 1909Picasso was making sculpture for the first time, carving raw wooden images that pay homage to African art, when he painted this early cubist “portrait”. This woman has rough-hewn wooden body parts and a featureless face, as the artist takes apart the European belief that pictures must be clear, legible perspective windows on the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

These performers star in his early Rose Period paintings, holding horses, balancing on balls or gathering in a family group with a clown as its patriarch. Here, he purifies what it means to be an acrobat: this character is all arms and legs, with no torso, as it contorts inconceivably. The closed eyes tell us it’s a dream – this is a surrealist vision.View image in fullscreenPablo Picasso’s Nude Woman in a Red Armchair, 1932.Photograph: Tate/© Succession Picasso/DACS London 2025.Nude Woman in a Red Armchair, 1932Cubism was often seen as ugly in its distortions of the human figure, but here Picasso uses it to glorify his lover Marie Thérèse-Walter, composing her face from two different views, full-on and in half-moon profile.

With 62% of UK adults saying they’re currently spending cautiously or cutting back due to the cost of living crisis, according to theBritish Tourist Authority, cheaper holiday options are increasingly attractive.Dozens of people responded to a Guardian callout asking for their experiences of UK camping holidays. Here are some of their affordable tales of pitching up and switching off.‘I don’t think I’ve ever met a little kid that doesn’t love camping’View image in fullscreenJen Ablitt and her daughter on their way to their camping trip.Photograph: Jen Ablitt/Guardian CommunityI was recently made redundant, and hopefully I’ll get a new full-time job, so this might be the last summer holiday where I can spend the entire six weeks with my daughter, who’s four.I rented our home out online and planned nearly three weeks staying with friends and camping: the Forest of Dean, the Peak District, the Lake District and north Wales. We camp a lot anyway – and started when she was 18 months old – so we’re used to it. I don’t think I’ve ever met a little kid who doesn’t love camping.We’ve had a very cheap holiday – about £20 a night – more than paid for by the home rental money. But as a solo parent it has been exhausting to do all the driving, packing, camping, parenting, interspersed with house guest changeovers.Overall, I’m very glad I did it. Camping is a terrific way to see some truly gorgeous parts of the UK.Jen Ablitt, 48, south-west London‘I watched the children uncurl’View image in fullscreenThe children enjoyed toasting marshmallows on Rebecca Lovell’s camping trip to the Lea Valley.Photograph: Rebecca Lovell/Guardian CommunityI went camping for the first time in the Lee Valley this August – three mums and six kids – to try to give our city kids a taste of outdoor living, off their phones and out into nature. They’re teenagers, and most of them are glued to screens.We had looked at a few seaside holiday lets, but the prices – one place was £1,000 a week – were just too high. Cost was definitely a factor. It feels like UK seaside holidays are getting out of reach, whereas the campsite cost £140, including equipment hire, for two nights per family. It was camping for softies – none of us have camping equipment or tents, so we got to experience it without the stress of bringing endless bits.Only one of us has a car, so she drove with the luggage, and the rest of us got the train, which was only 20 minutes. We then walked 45 minutes along the River Lea to the campsite. It was brilliant that it wasn’t far.View image in fullscreenRebecca Lovell,second left, on the camping trip.Photograph: Trish Costello/Guardian CommunityThere were the initial complaints from the kids: “How long is this walk going to take? There’s no toilet in the tent. It’s cold at night. The shop doesn’t sell any good snacks.”It took about 24 hours, but I watched the children uncurl, and by the end of our stay they were all out playing frisbee, making fires, going on river walks, watching the ducks and climbing trees to get apples.Rebecca Lovell, small business owner, east London‘On clear nights you could see the Milky Way’Nick Norton, 70, in Orkney.Photograph: Nick Norton/Guardian CommunityThis summer, I’ve reacquainted myself with low-tech camping and had two glorious weeks in Dumfries and Galloway. My family prefer more comfort and also have less spare time, so I went solo.I stayed at a family-owned farm campsite, which is in the Galloway Dark Sky area and close to lots of interesting attractions.This is my happy place. Each day was an early rise, including watching an uninterrupted sunrise on Midsummer Day from my tent. Most days I cycled around the quiet roads and trails. On clear nights you could see the Milky Way and millions of stars.For £17 a night, I got my pitch, free hot water and showers, a freezer for ice packs, and mains electricity to charge my phone and electric bike. It was amazing value and I had a great reception from the owners.The carbon footprint of these holidays was tiny: two cans of butane gas a week and 50 litres of petrol. The weather was kind, but then being retired I could pick my weeks to take advantage of the sunshine.As a solo holiday, there were many other folks around to chat with and share tips. I think these are the best holidays I can remember.Nick Norton, 70, retired business analyst, Glasgow‘Camping offers the opportunity to be close to nature’View image in fullscreenRachel Hardy with her family.Photograph: Rachel Hardy/Guardian CommunityWe took our two children to Coniston Water in the Lake District camping, We’re keen paddleboarders and kayakers. It did not disappoint and was only a two-hour journey from our home.We all enjoyed the water, with spectacular views. We played ball games on the camping pitch, made a lovely campfire under the stars and toasted marshmallows. Our children also enjoyed the brilliant tree swing each day. It was absolutely perfect, and all for £34 a night.As a family, we have enjoyed holidays to France, Finland, Scotland, Tunisia, Spain and Cornwall. Each holiday is unique so it’s hard to say how our camping trip compares, but we had just as much fun in the Lakes and felt really connected as a family.Camping offers the chance to be close to nature, and it is a great learning experience for children. We love that these kinds of holidays build character and resilience.Other holidays, you can end up fretting about a missed departure, getting lost or wondering whether you can afford to eat out. But when we got home from camping, we felt refreshed and relaxed.Rachel Hardy, teacher, northern EnglandExplore more on these topicsCamping holidaysFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A daily low-dose aspirin makes blood less sticky and helps prevent heart attacks and strokes.But now a new study, presented at the world’s largest heart conference, has found that clopidogrel, a commonly prescribed blood thinner, is more effective – and with no extra risk.The stunning discovery was revealed at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Madrid, with the data behind the findingssimultaneously published in the Lancet medical journal.Weight loss drugs can halve heart patients’ risk of early death, study findsRead moreThe international team of medics behind the study, from countries including the US, UK, Australia, Switzerland and Japan, said the results showed that clopidogrel was “superior” to aspirin and should lead to “extensive adoption” of the drug in clinical practice worldwide.Their comprehensive analysis of nearly 29,000 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) found that clopidogrel was better than aspirin in preventing serious heart and stroke events, without increasing the risk of major bleeding.CAD is the most common form of heart disease and a leading cause of death and disability globally. More than 300 million people live with CAD, including 2.3 million in the UK.It occurs when arteries in the heart become narrowed by a buildup of atheroma, a fatty material within their walls. The pain or discomfort felt from such narrowing is called angina and if a blockage occurs, it can cause a heart attack.The findings challenge the longstanding recommendation of aspirin as the default treatment for preventing serious cardiovascular events in hundreds of millions of CAD patients.CAD often requires lifelong treatment to prevent heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death. Aspirin has traditionally been prescribed indefinitely for patients with the condition.However, the evidence supporting aspirin’s long-term benefits and safety has been limited. The new analysis of seven clinical trials found that patients taking clopidogrel had a 14% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events – including heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death – compared with those taking aspirin.Importantly, the rates of major bleeding issues in patients were similar between the two drugs, dispelling concerns that clopidogrel might lead to more bleeding complications.Writing in the Lancet, the study team said: “This comprehensive synthesis of available evidence indicates that, in patients with CAD, long-term clopidogrel monotherapy offers superior protection against major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events compared with aspirin, without an excess risk of bleeding.Potassium-rich diet may cut risk of heart failure by 24%, study suggestsRead more“The superior efficacy of clopidogrel v aspirin was consistent across multiple key subgroups, including individuals with clinical features predictive of poor clopidogrel responsiveness, supporting the generalisability of these findings to the broad spectrum of patients with CAD.“These results support a preference for clopidogrel over aspirin for chronic antiplatelet monotherapy for patients with stable CAD. The widespread availability, generic formulation and affordability of clopidogrel further supports its potential for extensive adoption in clinical practice.”The analysis drew from diverse patient groups, including those who had undergone procedures such as stent placement or had experienced acute coronary syndrome, and examined various subgroups to ensure the findings applied broadly.Notably, even patients who might respond less well to clopidogrel as a result of genetic or clinical factors still benefited from its use over aspirin. The results suggest that clopidogrel should be considered the preferred long-term anti-platelet medication for patients with CAD.Because both medications are widely available, the findings have the potential to influence clinical guidelines worldwide and improve patient outcomes. Further research on the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel, as well as broader population studies, will be needed to support changes in treatment standards.Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, said: “Aspirin is a commonly prescribed drug to help prevent repeat heart attacks and strokes. This research suggests that clopidogrel, an alternative to aspirin, might be more effective at preventing recurrent heart attack or stroke.“Importantly, these benefits come without a greater risk of major bleeding. These findings are likely to impact the medications doctors prescribe to their patients to reduce their risk of future heart problems.”Explore more on these topicsHeart diseaseHeart attackStrokeMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Badenoch moved to the UK from Nigeria aged 16.“Although 30 years have passed, I would definitely remember if we had admitted a Nigerian student with any financial aid. The answer is that we did not do so,” he said.Reider said he had admitted a few students based in Africa during that period but not from Nigeria. “I assure you that we would not have admitted a student based on test scores alone, nor would we have mailed an invitation to apply to any overseas students based on test scores,” he said.He added: “O-levels would not have been sufficient, and we would have been very nervous admitting a 16-year-old. She would have had to have an extraordinary record.”Reider also revealed it was implausible for a student to be offered a partial scholarship they could not afford to take up.“If an applicant needed, say, $30,000 a year to attend Stanford, we would offer them the full amount. There was no point in offering them less because they would not have been able to attend. If we admitted them, we wanted them to enrol,” he said. “We were very generous and could offer only about 30 full scholarships a year. Some turned us down for Harvard, Yale. I made the selections myself, subject to the approval of the dean. I was never overruled by any of the three deans for whom I worked.”The Guardian has also consulted Ivy League admissions coaches, an author specialising in college admissions, several Stanford graduates and an Ivy League vice-provost.All of those who spoke to the Guardian said they did not believe it was plausible for a place to be offered proactively on exam results alone. One senior US academic said he had never heard of any exemptions – not even for internationally renowned child prodigies or royalty.Badenoch first mentioned her admission to Stanford inan interview with the Huffington Post in 2017, when she had just been elected as the Conservative MP for Saffron Walden.Asked what she wanted to be when she was 16, she said: “A doctor, like my parents. Going to a very bad school here stopped me. I had actually got admission into medical school in the US – I got into Stanford pre-med – and I got into medical school in Nigeria but I came here because being a citizen, it was just a lot cheaper.”Additional detail was given in aninterview with the Times in 2024. The interview says: “At 16, her US SAT scores won her a partial pre-med scholarship to Stanford, but her family still couldn’t afford the place.”The claim that Badenoch had an early offer from Stanford has been mentioned in numerous other newspaper articles.In a profile in the Spectator in 2020, it says Badenoch “won a part-scholarship to Stanford University to study medicine”.The same claim is made in aprofile in the Daily Mail by Lord Ashcroftlast year, previewing his biography of Badenoch.On its website, the university says: “Stanford does not have a pre-med major. For any of the health professions, you may major in any discipline.” Medicine is a graduate degree.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A party spokesperson said: “Kemi Badenoch spent months asking questions of the chancellor regarding her CV. It’s now time for her to answer some of her own.”Badenoch has spoken in the past how she felt she was let down by poor British teaching in her final school years, having moved to the UK as the political situation in Nigeria deteriorated.Aged 16, she was studying part-time at Phoenix College, a further education college in Morden, achieving a B in biology, a B in chemistry and a D in maths. She says she had previously been a straight-A student but was repeatedly put down and underestimated by teachers at the college and discouraged from applying for medicine or to the University of Oxford.Stanford University did not return requests for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel.”Harri added: “She was self-possessed enough when they arrived at Paddington to jump off the train, find a guy in uniform and say, ‘That man just attacked me,’ and he was arrested.”The queen, 78,has long campaigned against domestic violence and sexual abuse, and has dedicated her royal charity work to supporting victims of sexual assault.A number of years ago she championed the idea of washbags for people who have been attacked, an idea that has recently been revived.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Cooper is understood to be looking at similar changes, as well as setting a minimum period refugees must be settled before being allowed to invite their families.The home secretary will alsoconfirm changesto the asylum process which will remove the power of judges to hear appeals, handing them to a select panel of trained experts. Officials say this will operate in a similar way to the magistrate system, with trained members of the public hearing cases under the supervision of legal experts.Cooper will also highlight the number of “disruptions” law enforcement officials are making to people smuggling gangs, whether through arrests, asset seizures or action to close communication networks. The government says officers took 347 such actions in 2024-25 – the highest on record.They also point to an unexpected dip in small boat crossings over August to the lowest levels in four years – something they say was triggered in part by law enforcement operations to seize dinghies at the Bulgarian border over the summer.This recent drop has not been enough to appease public anger, especially at the ongoing use of hotels to house those whose claims have not yet been processed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Protests must end by 8pm, while demonstrators will be stopped from blocking the road and could be ordered to remove face coverings, the force said.In response to the protests, Farage announced a series of policy proposals to bar most asylum seekers from Britain.Faragewas criticisedover the weekend by Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, who called his policy “isolationist, short-term [and] kneejerk”.But he received backing in part from an unexpected quarter as Jack Straw, a formerLabourhome secretary, added his name to a list of experts who believe the UK can leave the European convention of human rights without undermining peace in Northern Ireland.Downing Street last week accused the Reform leader of not being a “serious person” for advocating the UK’s departure from the convention, which it said would damage the Good Friday agreement.Straw, however, on Monday gave his backing to a report from the thinktank Policy Exchange claiming this was not the case. “The debate about our future relationship with the ECHR … should be conducted on its merits,” he said.“This paper [from Policy Exchange] argues, in thorough and forensic detail, that ‘whatever the merits of UK withdrawal from the ECHR, nothing in the Belfast agreement rules it out as a viable course of action.’”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumYvette CooperLabourReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

According to Ragusa, prior to the incident, Giuliani was flagged down by a woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident.“Mayor Giuliani immediately rendered assistance and contacted 911. He remained on scene until responding officers arrived to ensure her safety. Following this, while traveling on the highway, mayor Giuliani’s vehicle was struck from behind at high speed,” Ragusa said.Giuliani was transported to a nearby trauma center where he was treated for a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple cuts and bruises, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg.Giuliani’s business partner and medical provider were contacted and arrived at the hospital to oversee his care, Ragusa said, adding that Giuliani is in “good spirits and recovering tremendously”.He went on to say that the incident “was not a targeted attack” and urged the public to “refrain from spreading unfounded conspiracy theories”.In response to a comment from an X user who said: “Does anyone think the victim’s abuser waited for the car who helped her, to ram them? Maybe not even knowing it’s Giuliani,” Ragusa replied: “He was in a rent a car no one knew it was him.”In 2024, Giuliani took a tumble at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, when he fell into some chairs. Following the incident which was shared widely across social media, Giuliani said: “I tripped as I was checking out the convention floor. The eyes of the world are on Fiserv Forum and the RNC, so my trip was seen by many. As a famous person once said: ‘Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.’”Giuliani served as New York City’s mayor from 1994 to 2001. He later went on to serve as Donald Trump’s lawyer before being disbarred inWashington DCandNew Yorkover false statements he made about the 2020 presidential election.In 2023, a juryorderedGiuliani to pay $148.1m to two former election workers from Georgia after he falsely accused them of attempting to steal the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.Explore more on these topicsRudy GiulianiNew HampshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The group also chanted: “Say it loud and say it clear, refugees are welcome here.”Commander Adam Slonecki, in charge of policing London this weekend, said: “This afternoon we have unfortunately seen more disorder, following thefive arrests made yesterday in the West Drayton area.“Today’s protest saw many community members attend, including women and children, and we worked to ensure the safety of those there to peacefully represent their views.“Those who arrive at protests masked and intent on causing trouble will continue to be dealt with robustly at future protests.”He added: “We remain in the area to deter any further disorder and provide reassurance to local residents and businesses.”Elsewhere on Sunday, three people were arrested after hundreds of protesters gathered again outside the Bell hotel in Epping calling for the removal of asylum seekers housed there.Essex police said a woman was arrested on suspicion of breaching a section 14 order, requiring demonstrators to stay in a prescribed area during the protest.A man was also arrested “on suspicion of inciting racial hatred after an emblem was reported to have been set alight” on Friday, while another was arrested for breaching the section 14 order in place after reportedly refusing to leave when the assembly on Sunday had ended.Police added that all three remained in custody on Sunday evening.Several protesters were seen waving union and St George’s cross flags during Sunday’s protest.“Send them home, please protect me,” read a T-shirt worn by one young girl, while a boy held up a sign saying “deport foreign criminals”.Police put in place a dispersal order “to prevent and deal with any antisocial behaviour”, and a section 60 AA order, both of which remained in place on Sunday evening.The Bell hotel became a focal point for protests in July after an asylum seeker staying there was accused of sexually assaulting two 14-year-old girls. He has denied the allegation, telling a court on Wednesday that he did not touch the girls.The latest protests come two days after an appeal court overturned a temporary injunction that had blocked the use of the hotel to house asylum seekers.Stuart Hooper, assistant chief constable with Essex police, said: “We’ve consistently said that we will always seek to facilitate lawful protest but that does not include a right to commit crime, and we’ll take a firm approach to anyone intent on doing that.“And, to reiterate to the public, the strength of feeling in Epping is not lost on me – or anyone in Essex police – and I would urge anyone who wants to make their voices heard to please do that peacefully and within the parameters outlined.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the findings also revealed that compared with those who did not have dysmenorrhoea, teenagers with severe period pain were more than twice as likely to develop chronic headaches or chronic knee, wrist, hand, foot or ankle pain in adulthood, and were 81% and 78% more likely to have hip and upper back pain respectively.While anxiety and depression could play a role in the development of chronic pain as an adult, the study found this was only a minor factor.The researchers believe that greater “neuroplasticity” during adolescence could make teenage brains more sensitive to repeated pain signals, which could change how they process pain in the brain.Dr Rachel Reid-McCann, the lead researcher at theUniversity of Oxford, said: “It is possible that the experience of moderate or severe period pain can alter the brain structure and how it functions in response to painful stimuli, making chronic pain more likely in the future.”Katy Vincent, a professor of gynaecological pain at the University of Oxford and the senior author of the study, said: “We’ve known for a long time that period pain can really disrupt young people’s lives, impacting their social development, education and mental health.“However, we know that most young people don’t seek help for period pain and those who do may be dismissed, belittled or told it is normal. This study shows that teenage period pain may also shape future physical health.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We need better awareness, more inclusive education and faster diagnosis – especially for those in deprived or marginalised communities. We’re calling on the government to refresh thewomen’s health strategyand improving the care of menstrual health conditions should be a priority within this.”Janet Lindsay, the chief executive of the charity Wellbeing of Women, which runs theJust a Periodcampaign, said: “For too long, girls have become accustomed to putting up with pain, leading to delays in diagnosis, dismissal of symptoms, and ongoing stigma around menstruation.“If we fail to take teenage period pain seriously, we risk storing up a lifetime of ill health and chronic pain for millions of women. By investing in education, awareness and support during the school years, we can empower young people, improve women’s health outcomes and end the cycle of stigma once and for all.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “All women and girlsdeserve to be listened to and treated with respect. It should never be the case that period pains, which can be severe, are dismissed and women told to ‘just put up with it’.“We know women deserve better, which is why we are turning the commitments in the women’s health strategy into tangible action, already delivering 4.9m extra appointments, tackling gynaecology waiting lists using the private sector, and from October this year making emergency hormonal contraception free in pharmacies.”Explore more on these topicsMenstruationWomen's healthMedical researchYoung peopleHealthUniversity of OxfordnewsShareReuse this content"

If a company is prosecuted it will have to prove to the court that it had reasonable anti-fraud measures in place.The law will apply to large organisations that meet at least two of three criteria: having more than 250 employees, £36m turnover or £18m in total assets.“Today marks a pivotal moment for businesses, and this new offence strengthens our anti-fraud culture to protect businesses, build corporate trust and support long-term economic growth,” said David Hanson, the fraud minister. “Fraud is a shameful crime and we are determined to bring those responsible to justice wherever it takes place.”The law firm Irwin Mitchell said it marked a “fundamental shift” in corporate accountability by removing the previous need to prove that senior management were complicit.It said that failure to comply with the new law,under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act, could result in unlimited fines, reputational damage and criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office or Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).“The new offence will have a significant impact on organisations and their risk exposure,” said Colette Kelly, a regulatory specialist and partner at Irwin Mitchell. “[However], whether procedures are deemed to be sufficient will be a matter for the court to establish, and until we start to see the outcome of prosecutions this is somewhat of a watching brief.”Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a 31% increase in fraud last year.Loan ‘irregularities’ led to collapse of Prax Lindsey oil refineryRead moreThe Home Office said the new offence was intended to encourage organisations to build an anti-fraud culture, in the same way the failure to prevent bribery legislation did when introduced in 2010.“The new law represents a major step forward in holding to account those who commit corporate crime,” said Hannah von Dadelszen, the CPS’s chief crown prosecutor leading on fraud and economic crime. “Large organisations must act to put robust fraud prevention systems in place or leave themselves open to legal action.”Irwin Mitchell said businesses should be undertaking a review of fraud risk assessments, update internal controls and ensure that staff and third parties were trained and aware of whistleblowing procedures.Explore more on these topicsCorporate governanceCrimeSerious Fraud OfficeCrown Prosecution ServicenewsShareReuse this content"

One places a pistol against his leg, just above the knee.Jeanitta remains in her darkened bedroom upstairs with siblings – her mother is on the landing holding the door, corralling the children for their own safety – but she can hear the shrieks of a sister who is downstairs and the shouts of the IRA intruders.Then she hears bangs, like a door slamming. Then silence. After an interval – seconds, minutes, she is not sure – she is able to open the door and joins her mother at the top of the stairs. Her father is at the bottom of the stairs lying in a pool of blood. “Throw me a towel,” he shouts to her mother. “Don’t let the children see me.”View image in fullscreenJeanitta and her father, Peter McCabe, in County Down, Northern Ireland.Photograph: Jeanitta McCabeThree decades later Peter McCabe, now 66, still walks with a limp and the family bears psychological wounds. The groupKneecaphave reclaimed the word but for the McCabes, and many other families affected by so-called punishment violence, kneecapping retains its original meaning, connoting pain, terror and stigma.“What happened to daddy is still alive to this day. I feel trapped inside my own mind, of still being that 10-year-old child,” Jeanitta, now 45 said this week. “That unsettlement has never left me.”Republican and loyalist paramilitaries inflicted more than 6,000 punishment shootings and beatings from 1973, when reporting began, according to police figures, but scholars estimate the real figure is between 10,000 and 20,000. The practice tapered off after the 1998 Good Friday agreement butincidents still occur.Most of the victims were alleged petty criminals such as drug dealers and car thieves – hoods, inNorthern Irelandparlance – who were targeted by the Irish Republican Army, Ulster Volunteer Force and other groups in the guise of policing their own communities.It was the one of the most pervasive forms of violence, said Liam Kennedy, a Queen’s University Belfast historian whodocumented the phenomenon. “The astonishing thing, apart from the silence round these practices, is that this was green-on-green and orange-on-orange violence, perpetrated by those who had set themselves up as defenders of their community.”Victims typically were teenage boys or young men who were escorted to alleyways or wasteground – some turned up by appointment – to be shot or bludgeoned in the ankles, wrists or knees. To have all those joints targeted was called a “six-pack”. Some lost limbs; some died.For the IRA, it was a way to challenge the legitimacy of the British state and usurp its justice system, saidKieran McEvoy, an expert on transitional and restorative justice at Queen’s university. “It was brutal, visible and popular. There was a demand for it.”Therap group Kneecaphas subverted the term by adopting the personas of hoods who celebrate drug-taking and mock paramilitaries as well as state authority. They embody gleeful defiance for a generation that views the Troubles as history.For many families affected by punishment violence, however, the page never turned. Other victims of the Troubles are routinely commemorated but people who were kneecapped are largely overlooked.“There is stigma attached to victims of these attacks, some of whom become outsiders and are shunned in their home localities,” said Kennedy. “The key is in the label ‘punishment’. This suggests that victims somehow ‘deserved’ what they got.”Peter and Jeanitta McCabe feel that the stigma is reinforced by theirexclusionfrom theTroubles Permanent Disability Payment(TPDP) scheme, which offers compensation to those permanently disabled physically or psychologically disabled because of the conflict. They have appealed, saying the Victims’ Payment Board unlawfully deemed them ineligible because the shooting was not defined as Troubles-related.Their lawyer, Kevin Winters, said punishment shootings were a byproduct of the conflict. “They cannot be written out of history as if they never happened. We couldn’t possibly begin to quantify the volume of affected cases. They are in the thousands and therein may lie the real reason why these cases have been deemed out of scope – money.” The high court is expected to rule on McCabe’s case in September.Illness prevented Peter granting an interview but Jeanitta, speaking from her home near Newry, recalled the attack and aftermath. The reason for the assault remains unclear. Her father was a diesel mechanic with traffic convictions but had no criminal record and it was unusual for the IRA to kneecap someone in their own home, said Jeanitta.The attackers gave him 24 hours to leave Northern Ireland so Peter discharged himself from hospital and with a bandaged leg drove his wife and seven children to the ferry. For five years the family were nomads, roving bed and breakfasts across England and Scotland and making fleeting visits to Northern Ireland.View image in fullscreenJeanitta McCabe outside her home near Newry in County Down, Northern Ireland.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianJeanitta was 15 when they settled again in Newry but she felt an outcast. “On my first day back at school a girl from a republican family stood up and said ‘youse aren’t supposed to be in the country, your daddy’s a tout [informer]’.”Jeanitta would stay up all night with her father, who would sit on a sofa with an iron bar and a fire extinguisher, fearing another attack. “We’d be there until daylight. In my mind if I stayed with him I could stop it happening again.”She married and has children but has been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia and other conditions that she attributes to trauma and enduring stigma. “The legacy never leaves. To this day our name is absolute dirt.”She dislikes Kneecap’s use of balaclavas, which remind her of the attack, but otherwise has no opinion of the rap group. “I don’t watch the news or go out of the house a lot. I have isolated myself. I don’t know how to live in that world out there. This is my world, within my own walls.”Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandKneecapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This week, YouGov putLabouron just 20% – the lowest level in more than five years – and eight points behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.Already bruised by internal rows, public criticism and a failure to get a grip of big issues such as the economy and migration, Starmer’s government desperately needs to reassert itself and gain some momentum. But there are lots of difficult moments ahead.The budgetWhen Labour’s former shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told the Guardian at the start of the summer thatthe Treasury should consider a wealth taxto close the growing gap in the public finances, Rachel Reeves was unequivocal. “I think we’ve got the balance right in terms of how we tax those with the broadest shoulders,” she said, citing higher levies on private jets and second homes, and increased capital gains tax, as well as scrapping non-dom status.Yet the chancellor is now in a trickier predicament, with experts suggesting the government spending gap ison course to reach more than £40bnafter a slowdown in economic growth and higher-than-expected inflation. With extra borrowing likely to spook financial markets and ministers already struggling to stay within departmental spending limits – and Reeves determined to stick toher own fiscal rules– the chancellor returns to work pondering which tax rises would be the least unpalatable option.Why radical tax reform may be only way for Reeves to balance the booksRead moreLabour has already ruled out putting up income tax, national insurance or VAT – which could have potentially raked in billions – in order to stick to a manifesto pledge. The Treasury has spent the summer flying kites to test different options, including raisingmore money from inheritance taxandputting up capital gains taxon expensive homes. But wherever she lands, Reeves has a tough task explaining tax rises to the public. The chancellor is already considering delaying the budget until November to give her more time.Party disciplineAfter a bruising few weeks during which angry Labour MPs fronted up to Downing Street over welfare cuts, forcing the governmentinto a dramatic climbdown, and Starmer came under pressure from his own cabinetto immediately recognise Palestineas a state, both backbenchers and the government were in need of a break. “We’re all totally frazzled,” one No 10 adviser told the Guardian before recess. “We went straight from the election campaign into government and haven’t had a day off in months.”While the lack of announcements and press conferences over the summer alarmed some MPs, who feared it created space that was occupied by Farage, it also gave Downing Street an opportunity to reflect and reset. Starmer has used it toshake up his top team, including bringing ina new chief economic adviserto challenge Treasury thinking, and more internal changes are expected.The prime minister is also expected to reshuffle his junior ministers, to reward the rising stars of the 2024 intake and speed up delivery, as well as punishing those who plotted against the welfare plans andreplacing his homelessness minister. Sources suggested, however, that the cabinet will remain intact for now. The political side of No 10, chastened by the welfare debacle, intends to put greater emphasis on the relationship with MPs, including making sure they get face time with Starmer himself.With more potentially divisive issues coming up – includingSend reformand the government’schild poverty strategy– they are desperate to avoid further parliamentary battles. But Labour MPs are anxious about being squeezed by thenew Jeremy Corbyn-led partyon the left and Farage’s Reform UK on the right, and have shown themselves willing to flex their muscles.Trump state visitWhen Keir Starmerhanded over a letter to Donald Trumpin the Oval Office in February, with an invitation from the king for a second state visit, there was a muted response back home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So far, and despite the odds, Starmer has achieved that. Trump has even stated that he likes the prime minister “a lot” even though, with Starmer being a “liberal”, the two men have very different politics.Yet as both that meeting in Washington and Trump’s subsequenttalks with Starmer at his Ayrshire golf courseshowed, any visit with Trump is also a diplomatic nightmare. Often played out in front of the world’s media, the US president has no qualms about dipping into sensitive domestic issues such as free speech, tax rises or his friendship with Farage.While he may well be on his best behaviour as he enjoys Charles and Camilla’s hospitality at Windsor Castle, it could easily go wrong elsewhere. If the whim takes him, Trump could unpick the economic deal already agreed with the UK or even decide to impose further tariffs. The two governments are already at odds on the Gaza crisis, with Starmer planning to formally recognise the Palestinian state at the UN, while Trump gives the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, cover.Starmer will also push for the US to (finally) offer firm security guarantees for Ukraine, after Trump’s talks with Vladimir Putin emboldened the Russian president. Starmer will be walking a diplomatic tightrope on multiple fronts. Brace, brace!MigrationBy Westminster standards, this was a quiet summer recess, yet while government ministers settled into their sun loungers, a vacuum emerged. It wasquickly filled by Nigel Farage.Against a backdrop of rising small boat crossings and protests outside hotels that house asylum seekers, getting a grip on Britain’s borders is now one of the most pressing issues facing the government. While ministers blame the irregular migration crisis on the mess they inherited from the last Tory government, it is now Labour that is getting the blame. Starmer’s incremental approach – speeding up asylum processing, reviewing article 8 of the ECHR, striking a returns deal with the French – is not, thus far, satisfying the public clamour.To the discomfort of many on the left, polls show that immigration is now regarded as one of the most important issues facing the country. It doesn’t look likely to get any easier for the government, with further protests expected at asylum hotels after thecourt of appeal decisionon the Bell hotel in Epping, and Reform intent on exploiting community tensions – and frustration with the government – to its political benefit. Labour will try to take the fight to Farage at its autumn conference, but it could backfire. And it only has a few months until next spring’s local elections – the party’s first big electoral test since it came to power – to show it can get on track.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourRachel ReevesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Illustration: Guardian Design/Laura Cavanaugh/Getty ImagesExperts raise questions about the DoJ’s interview with the Epstein associate that left questions remainingByVictoria BekiempisSun 31 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 08.28 EDTShareAs deputy US attorney Todd Blanche announced last week that the justice department would releasetranscriptsof hisinterviewwithGhislaine Maxwell, he described this disclosure as being “in the interest of transparency”.“Except for the names of victims, every word is included. Nothing removed. Nothing hidden,” Blanche also said of his two-day sit down with Maxwell, who was convicted sex trafficking in relation toJeffrey Epstein’s abuse of teenage girls.That same day, James Comer, the House oversight committee chair, said that the justice department had sent a large tranche of Epstein investigative documents in response to a congressional subpoena. Comer praised justice officials andDonald Trump,saying: “The Trump DoJ is moving at a pace far faster than anything ever produced by the Biden DoJ.”Trump, who has faced extensive political blowback over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files, also voiced support for transparency. “I’m in support of them keeping it open. Innocent people shouldn’t be hurt, but I’m in support of keeping it totally open,” hesaid.Maxwell transcripts bring some respite for Trump, but fail to quell Maga uproarRead moreWhilethose supportive of Trumphave touted these actions as a show of openness, many others have pointed to the questionsleft unasked– and the people who have not been asked anything at all – as indicating that these disclosures about Epstein were more of a show than any real push for truth. For them the Maxwell transcripts, and the ignoring of victim’s voices, are not a sign of openness; they are a sign of a reluctance to pursue any potentially dangerous truth.For example, Blanche asked Maxwell whether people around Epstein – including the numerous high-profile and powerful men who had known him – were associating with him for the purpose of sexual encounters. In her reply Maxwell said that some of the “cast of characters” around Epstein were “in your cabinet, who you value as your co-workers”.Despite the fact that Maxwell had just openly mentioned Epstein associates as being in Trump’s current cabinet, Blanche – a hardened lawyer not known for missing a trick in trial argument – did not pause to ask Maxwell to identify the cabinet members she was referring to.At another point in the interview, Blanche asked Maxwell had ever had contact with Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency.“Well, not deliberately,” Maxwell said. Blanche responded: “Pardon me?” She again said “not deliberately” and Blanche then moved on to a question about whether Epstein was receiving money from any intelligence agency.Blanche also seemed to indulge Maxwell’s repeated professions of spotty recollection, including in response to questions about whether Trumppenned a letterfor Epstein’s birthday book, as had been reported by the Wall Street Journal.Blanche, prefacing a question with the phrase, “I understand you don’t remember anything with President Trump or a lot about the book anyway,” asked: “Do you remember asking President Trump to submit a letter for that?”Ghislaine Maxwell never saw Trump in ‘any inappropriate setting’, transcript showsRead moreMaxwell said: “I do not.”“Do you remember – would you have been the one to do that or could somebody else – would somebody else have done that?” Blanche asked.“I did ask some people. I don’t remember Mr Trump. I don’t remember who I did ask, but Epstein also asked people himself directly.”Blanche responded: “OK.” He did not pursue the obvious line of thought that Maxwell’s response suggested: had Epstein reached out to Trump?Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who is the founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said: “Many of Blanche’s questions were surface-level and didn’t drill down the way lawyers, especially prosecutors, do when they want to catch inconsistencies.”“She has zero credibility and I don’t believe for a second that she saw nothing and knows nothing,” Rahmani said. “Perhaps Blanche’s questions were more of the softball variety, but there was no world where Maxwell was going to implicate herself when she has hersupreme court appealpending or anyone in the administration when she is trying to get apresidentialpardon.”For victims’ representatives and advocates, the issue with unasked questions also extends to who hasn’t been asked questions. Several attorneys, representing more than a total of 50 Epstein and Maxwell, survivors told the Guardian that the justice department had not reached out for sit-downs with them.“Despite the fact that we have successfully represented 11 Epstein victims, no one has reached out,” said attorney Lisa Bloom.Spencer Kuvin, who has represented multiple Epstein survivors, commented: “We have heard nothing from the DoJ or the house subcommittee regarding request to speak with either the attorneys for the victims or the victims. I have repeatedly advised that I am willing to volunteer to provide testimony at their request. The victims have been ignored in this entire process.”Another attorney said: “I have received updates from the justice department, but no requests to speak to my clients.”Gretchen Carlson and Julie Roginsky, who filed sexual harassment suits against former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes and co-founded the non-profitLift Our Voices, said that the approach has ignored those who were abused by Epstein and Maxwell.“If they actually had survivors in mind, if you were thoughtful about them, they would be able to talk to them, and then we’d be consulting subscribers and lawyers to make sure inquiries were unfolding in the way they wanted,” Carlson said.“Nobody is doubting thatJeffrey Epsteintrafficked young girls. Nobody is doubting that Jeffrey Epstein was not the only man who raped these young girls,” Roginsky said. “All we need to do is listen to these survivors as they tell us who these others are.”Maxwell honored at Clinton event years after sexual abuse allegations emergedRead more“Ghislaine Maxwell is a convicted sex trafficker and felon who has been previously accused of lying under oath. Her conversations with United States deputy attorney general Todd Blanche reveal nothing shocking; Maxwell provided a version of the truth that best suits her agenda, in an attempt to continue concealing her wrongdoings,” said Jennifer Freeman, an attorney for Epstein survivors and special counsel at Marsh Law Firm.“For far too long survivors have been left in the dark, shut out and shunted aside from receiving vital information in their most painful hours.”The House oversight committee says it is in contact with Epstein survivors and that there will be a bipartisan meeting with them on 2 September.Ro Khanna, a California Democrat on the oversight committee, said in a statement that just 3% of the documents the justice department gave to the committee were new and that “the rest are already in the public domain.”“Less than 1% of files have been released. DoJ is stonewalling. The survivors deserve justice and the public deserves transparency.” Khanna said he is holding a press conference with survivors on 3 September to “hear from them why releasing this information is so important”.Asked about Blanche’s interview style or whether there had been any outreach to victims, the justice department said “no comment.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Her brilliance turns it into genuinely moving TVLucy ManganSun 31 Aug 2025 17.00 EDTShareIs there any comfort to be had in knowing that police incompetence is not a new phenomenon? Not really, no. But it might be all you can find to cling on to during this harrowing, heartbreaking four-part drama. I Fought the Law is based on the true story of Ann Ming ,the murder of her 22-year-old daughter Julie in 1989 and her 30-year campaign to change the double jeopardy law so Julie’s acquitted killer could be tried again for the crime.I Fought the Law has two great strengths. First, the awareness that although the overturning of a law that had existed since Magna Carta is technically the most astonishing part of Ming’s tale, it is not the most televisual. That, for better or worse, will always be the body blows she withstood, from finding her daughter’s body three months after she went missing to the two horrendous trials she sat through and years of injustice. These would have felled anyone less extraordinary (and indeed threatened to fell her husband and their marriage, although both made it through in battered but unbowed form). The drama wisely confines the legal machinations to the final episode and concentrates three-quarters of its time on limning the lives of the Ming family before and after Julie’s murder.The second great strength – as is almost always the case – iscasting Sheridan Smith in the main role. Ordinary women in extraordinary circumstances are what she does, and few do it better. Here, she elevates a workaday script that dares not take too many liberties, lest it be seen to dishonour the story, and makes it genuinely moving. She gets help from the strong cast that is – again, as ever – assembled round her.Special mention must go to the chilling ordinariness Jack James Ryan brings to the part of the murderous Billy Dunlop, and to Daniel York Loh as Ann’s husband and Julie’s father, Charlie Ming, a man at first too broken to support his wife and devoid of her crusading zeal, but who digs deep to try to bring her what she needs to survive.For all its formulaic structure and the traditional beats it is careful to hit (winsome child asking poignant questions about mummy, bureaucratic nightmares and class snobbery as the doughty nurse faces down the British establishment), I Fought the Law does an unusually good job of sympathising with, rather than condemning, the half of the partnership to whom fighting for justice does not come naturally. Charlie would probably – like, I suspect, most of us – prefer to crawl into a ditch and pray for some kind of impossible peace. In its way, his quieter journey is as impressive as Ann’s, and the drama takes the trouble to show us how.‘I was bawling my eyes out’: Sheridan Smith on drink, death and the hardest role of her careerRead moreThe police spent the initial period of Julie’s disappearance insisting that the mother of one, who saw or spoke to her mother at least once a day, must have decided to leave her son, Kevin, behind and move to London without telling anyone when she separated from her husband. After relentless pressure to investigate from Ann, a forensics team was sent to examine the house. After five days, they had found nothing to indicate foul play. Eighty days after Julie’s disappearance, Ann was trying to trace a bad smell in her daughter’s bathroom and found her body under the bath.The delay by the police in investigating and finding Julie – leaving aside the unfathomable suffering it would have saved her mother – meant that the evidence the jury heard in court about the cause of death, and other details potentially connecting Dunlop to the killing, was weaker than it should have been. That almost certainly contributed to the two hung juries and his resulting compulsory acquittal. He was then heard in local pubs bragging about committing the murder, safe in the knowledge that he could not be tried again. Or so, of course, he thought.The overturning of the archaic double jeopardy law is not a pyrrhic one for the family – it gets the violent Dunlop off the streets and will help to protect other bereaved people suffering as the Mings did. But we are aware of how life changed for them for ever: that their daughter (and Kevin’s mother) will never be restored to them because one man felt like killing her, could and did. So it goes.I Fought the Law aired on ITV1 and is available on ITVXExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSheridan SmithDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

Archive image: courtesy of Sarah Parish and James MurrayBorn in Somerset in 1968, Sarah Parish is an actor best known for her roles in W1A, Industry and Stay Close. She met fellow actor James Murray, 50, while working on the BBC drama Cutting It and they married in December 2007. In 2014, the couple set up the Murray Parish Trust in memory of their first child, Ella-Jayne, who died at eight months of a congenital heart defect in 2009. Relaunched asImagine This, it is the only UK charity solely dedicated to supporting the mental wellbeing of ill children and their families; earlier this year the pair received MBEs in recognition of this work. Sarah and James live in Hampshire with their teenage daughter, Nell.SarahThis picture was taken in Abersoch, north Wales. It was a beautiful summer and the first time I’d been to the house Jim used to own with his brother and sister. Not only was it meaningful to visit an important place for Jim, but it was a fun, party holiday. I look very carefree. We had been together a year.Although this image is very idyllic, the first part of our relationship was quite dramatic. It was the early 00s and we were out a lot in Soho, having a great time mostly, but also being fairly tempestuous together. The thing you really love about somebody often becomes the thing you find threatening. While Jim and I were drawn to each other because we’re both out-there, sociable characters, we probably tried to tame each other a bit – which, funnily enough, didn’t work.The first time I met Jim was at a party. I didn’t like him much. I thought he was a very attractive man, but once we spoke I realised he had recently worked with my ex-boyfriend and had a preconception of me based on what he’d heard about the relationship. Jim said something inappropriate about the breakup and I remember thinking, what a shame he’s so rude, considering he’s so nice-looking.Our relationship has settled into something much more peaceful. We’ve watched each other grow upThe next time we met was a month later at a read-through for Cutting It. He walked in and I thought, “Christ, it’s him.” This time, we became good friends. I didn’t realise that I liked him romantically until some of the cast went to play pool one afternoon. Jim took a shot, and had his back to me, and I said to my friend, “Something’s happened. I really fancy him.” I guess it was love at first back.Just over a year after this photo was taken, we were married and I was pregnant. Jim and I lost our first daughter, Ella-Jayne, to Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. It was an incredibly distressing, life-changing time for us. My memories of that whole period are blurry. Even though she only lived for eight months, Ella-Jayne made a huge impression on so many people. Her memorial was a beautiful experience and we both read eulogies.It wasn’t easy on our relationship; Jim and I found it difficult to look after each other. Grief is all-consuming and we realised we had to do something. We found this amazing initiative calledHands Up Holidays, and went to Vietnam and Cambodia to work in various orphanages. On our return, we felt an enormous amount of strength, having been with children who had experienced unimaginable trauma but still had smiles on their faces. If they could carry on, so could we.The death of a child is difficult to get through as a couple, and maybe without setting up our charity we wouldn’t have made it. Now, Imagine This takes up most of our time, while acting feels like a holiday. We still have friends over to socialise every weekend, but we’re not nearly as wild as we were 20 years ago.Our relationship has settled into something much more peaceful. We’ve watched each other grow up, and now what I find most attractive about him isn’t nearly as superficial as the view of his back – it’s the way he throws himself into his passions.JamesThe weather in north Wales means that you can very rarely spend a day diving off a boat into the sea, so that holiday was very special. The boat was laden with booze and more booze. It felt like anything was possible.At that point in time, our relationship was quite rock’n’roll. We were both successful actors and thought the world was our oyster. We travelled a lot, we partied a lot. We were both strong personalities who kept testing each other’s boundaries, only to be frustrated when we realised we couldn’t change one another.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Last time I saw her, it wasn’t great, so I’m just going to keep my head down.” On the day of the first read-through, I was a bit late, and the one spare seat was next to her. I assumed she would ignore me, but she was sweet, polite and behaved like any good lead actress would, welcoming and kind to the new person. It was that very quality that made me fall in love with her. Not only was she a brilliant actor, but how she behaved on set with people – cast, crew, whoever – was deeply impressive. Often the life of an actor is very transient, but Sarah and I stayed in touch after the show and became good friends. I don’t remember our first kiss, but it’s very likely I made the first move.Losing a child is such a hard thing to digest, but when we harnessed the grief, it got easierWhen Ella-Jayne died, it was insurmountable. A lot of people didn’t know what to do or to say to us. That dynamic can get very exhausting because you feel like you have to apologise and help them get over their awkwardness. In the end, we ran away. For us to go to those orphanages and immerse ourselves in these stories of hope and reconciliation, that really put life in perspective. We came back in a much stronger frame of mind.Nish Kumar looks back: ‘My parents had to bribe me with Crunchies and Batman pens to stay in school’Read moreEveryone grieves in different ways. For Sarah and me, there were moments of extreme volatility and disagreement that led to us questioning our future together. The loss of a child is such a seemingly impossible thing to digest unless the other person is feeling exactly the same emotion as you at exactly the same time. It’s very difficult to find a connection. When one is feeling down, the other has to feel strong enough to look after them, and vice versa. It’s hard to get the scales right and that can cause friction.We set up the trust five years after Ella-Jayne died. There is no finite amount of time you can spend working on a charity – it’s not a nine to five job. You could dedicate 24 hours a day to it and there’d still be more to do. But from my perspective, as soon as we harnessed the grief and focused, it became easier for us both.After spending a long time with someone, you often don’t notice them changing, day to day. But when I step back and think of Sarah’s evolution, it’s amazing. I want to say it’s like watching a flower bloom, but that’s too cliched. Instead, Sarah is a whole garden. Maybe I helped plant a few seeds or sketched out the landscape in the beginning, but 20 years later she has grown into this beautiful, thriving ecosystem that nurtures everyone around her.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

More than half of those living in the sleepy village inNorth Yorkshireare over the age of 50. However, recently there has been an influx of unlikely visitors: young people armed with golf clubs.Some have even made the nearly two-hour drive from Manchester to putt balls and swing their irons at Bentham golf course. “Covid started it off. It was the only way they could see mates and have a beer,” said John Marshall, 32, the club’s operations manager. “Sometimes it turned into more of an outdoor pub. Then it carried on from there.”Golf has long been seen as a sport for the grey-haired and retired. This has changed since Covid, with popularity booming among young people.Accordingto England Golf, the average age of club members decreased from 56.18 to 54.99 in 2024 alone and, in the US, research from the National Golf Foundation found that 71% of the rounds played post-pandemic were by golfers under 50.When lockdown restrictions began to lift, golf was seen as the perfect activity to socialise while staying safe. “Lots of my friends were meeting up to play golf,” said Toby Warner, who was 23 when he took up the sport. “At first, it was mostly just a vehicle to see my friends but the addiction took hold from there.”Warner, now 28, who works in sports marketing, has continued to hit the course every other weekend. “It’s a really good way to spend a day. You’re outside, having a walk and chat with your friends while playing golf.”Golf has undergone a cultural resurgence. The US president, Donald Trump, is well known for his love of the game. He even squeezed in a round at hisTurnberry club in Scotlandduring a visit to the UK in July. The golf-themed comedyHappy Gilmore 2,a sequel to the 1996 Adam Sandler cult classic, was a sensation when it was released on Netflix in July, drawing 46.7m views in its first three days. Even Spider-Man himself, Tom Holland, hashitthe course, competing in the 2024 BMW PGA Celebrity Pro-Am.The greater attention paid to the sport has led to booming business for Marshall. He said there had been a big increase in junior memberships and young people filled the course in the evenings, when fees are slightly cheaper.Golf influencers have also increased the sport’s appeal to young people, with golf-themed challenge videos racking up hundreds of millions of views on YouTube. Bolton-born Rick Shiels is the most followed golf YouTuber with 3 million subscribers, a number that has soared since he first took the title in July 2019 with 561,500 followers.The two-time US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who recentlyfeaturedTrump in one of his videos, has nearly 2.4 million subscribers. The British influencer supergroup theSidemenhave also joined in, starting a channel last year called Big Wedge Golf, which already has more than 700,000 subscribers.Marshall saw a big increase in players after the YouTuberGolf Mates, who has more than 200,000 followers, filmed a video on the Bentham course. “The phone just didn’t stop ringing,” said Marshall.Other golf influencers, including Paige Spiranac, who has more than 4 million followers on Instagram, have helped get more women into the sport. Amber Mayes-Long, 29, runs a TikTok account calledAmberGolfs, where she shares her passion for the sport, despite being a beginner. Before playing, she “thought it was an old man sport” but after being introduced to golf by her fiance, she took to it immediately.“I was thinking, men have been gatekeeping this. It was so nice, going out and walking for four hours with no phones. It was peaceful,” she said.She spends about 25 hours a month playing golf. The sport has completely changed how she spends her weekends. “I used to spend my Sundays hung over. Now I’ll not drink on Saturday night because I want to be fresh for golf,” she said.Mayes-Long said golf clubs were becoming more inclusive. “Women can still get funny looks when they go to a golf course but I think it is getting better. There are still some barriers, like there being no toilets on the course. Men can just go in the bushes and women can’t.”With some clubs enforcing strict dress codes and good quality irons starting at about £600, golf is known for being a pricey hobby. “I’m very much a budget golfer,” said Mayes-Long. She buys secondhand golf clothes and clubs. “As a beginner or casual golfer, I just don’t think it’s worth spending £1,000 on clubs, that’s not my financial situation.”Back at Bentham, Marshall said clubs needed to adapt to the modern age to bring in younger members. Before Covid, the club had experienced a steady decline in numbers before rebounding thanks to young golfers. The club offers age-banded memberships, where younger members pay less, and a points-based pay-as-you-play system for greater flexibility. “Golf has an obsession with trying to make everyone a member. It shouldn’t. The more people you get playing golf is the way you get more members,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGolfNorth YorkshireYorkshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

On our first day there, she was itching to go for a walk down to the port, so we dropped our bags at the accommodation and set off to explore.I was feeling quite exhausted after the flight, and while walking down a steep cobblestone street, I tripped. I flew through the air and fell flat on the ground, face first. For some reason, the instinct to put my hands out to cushion the fall hadn’t kicked in, so I landed straight on my chin. I knew immediately that my jaw was broken – I’d heard the awful crack. Before long, blood was gushing down my face.The kindness of strangers: I used to hate being judged, but then a woman on a train praised my parentingRead moreMy daughter helped me get up and a crowd gathered to help. One of those people was an Italian woman, who opened her handbag and took out a pristine white handkerchief with a lace trim. She handed it to me and said: “Use this to clean up the blood.” I protested, saying I didn’t want to ruin her lovely hanky, but she insisted. Before long the ambulance came and I was whisked off to hospital.Her kind act was the best thing that happened to me on an otherwise terrible day. I’ve learned that bad things happen in life, but, sometimes, good things will come from them that take the edge off. This was one of those times.What that lovely woman did was so unobtrusive, offered without expectation of anything in return. Oddly, it was the futility of her gesture that made it so impactful – she was sacrificing something beautiful just to mop up some blood.I never saw her again. But I have kept the hanky, washed and white again, as a reminder of how to be kind.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceFrom making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Yet for Ukrainians, the reality remains unchanged:airstrikes still thunder across their cities, homes still burn, lives are still lost. Against this grim backdrop, the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, has seemed more than content to bask inthe literal red-carpet treatmentafforded by the president of the United States.Donald Trump, who has anointed himself mediator of this war, has nearly exhausted the lexicon of contradiction. Some days he proclaims thathealone can end this war. Then he insists thatpeace talks should be left to the two parties.At times he boasts that Putin“respects” him; at others, he castigates Putinfor “going absolutely crazy”. This month, Trump vacillated between putting US troops on the table andruling it out. Now he is reportedly considering usingUS private military firmsfor the job.For those watching – whether in Kyiv, Moscow, Washington or beyond – the effect is dizzying. Policy by improvisation is not strategy. And in a war where lives hang on the credibility of US commitments, unpredictability is not strength. It is abdication.So what is Trump doing,Nobel peace prize ambitionsaside? Has he finally realised that Putin has no interest in a treaty that falls short of his maximalist goals? Or is this simply another chapter in a familiar playbook – headline chasing, image first, strategy later – where the costs will be borne not in Washington but on the streets of Kyiv?After a long learning curve, Trump may finally be realising that Putin has played him – that the two are not the close friends he once imagined. His repeated threats to imposenew sanctions and tariffson Russia are one example. Yet Trump has also shown time and again his willingness to forgive and forget, so long as Putin offers a new promise that this time things will be different.In the meantime, Ukraine appears to have found a workaround for direct US military aid, though one that comes at immense cost. With European financing, Kyiv cankeep buying US weaponswhile Ukraine and the EU scale up production. It is hardly optimal, but it sustains the status quo: Ukraine survives, Trump claims credit for US arms profits, and Europe keeps Russia bogged down elsewhere. As long as this arrangement holds, the war will go on. Russiawill continue to attack, but it will not defeat Ukraine. And in the absence of genuine US leadership, the conflict will persist as long as Putin can throw bodies forward.0:45Russian attack on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region leaves dozens injured – videoAt the same time asUkrainescrambles for survival, Putin is playing a different game altogether. He is the unlikely winner in this mayhem. Unable to seize an upper hand at the negotiating table through battlefield victories, he has fallen back on the tools that have served him for decades: obfuscation, manipulation and the grinding down of adversaries. Putin may not yet have secured everything on his wishlist, but he is nothing if not patient.Unlike democratic leaders, Putin faces no checks – only an inner circle ofmilitary and conservative eliteswith an imperialist worldview. To them, Ukraine is not just another territory to be bartered away to help boost Trump’s ego. It is the key to restoring Russia’s lost greatness.Putin also understands that US audiences crave clarity; they tire quickly of drawn-out talks and muddled messages. Fatigue becomes Putin’s ally. The tedium, the phone calls, the visits that go nowhere – these are not failures of diplomacy. They are the strategy. Once the war fades from headlines, his hope is to strike a bargain in the shadows: sanctions lifted, aid to Ukraine frozen. For Putin, every hour of confusion is an investment. The question is whether anyone else at the table has the stamina to see through it.The real loser in this, other than Ukraine, is Trump himself. For all his posturing, he risks selling himself short if his ambitions stop at a medal in Oslo. He imagines more – and he might even achieve it. If he emerges with a clear policy to end the war, this could be his Reagan moment: a chance to be celebrated as the saviour of the free world.The Guardian view on Russia’s strike on Kyiv: Putin is testing Trump’s will and Europe’s resolve | EditorialRead moreTrump is not wrong that Joe Biden was too cautious to claim such a mantle. Trump, in contrast, could. Whether or not Putin personally respects him is debatable, but Putin does respect US military power. And there are options available, many well short of all-out war: thebipartisan Graham-Blumenthal bill, expanded air support, lifting missile restrictions and major increases in direct military aid, among others.Like any autocrat, Putin can be coerced. Biden was too timid to test that premise. Trump may not be. After all, unpredictability is his calling card. Should Trump force Putin to back down and end the war, he would secure a legacy as the unexpected hero. But if he allows Putin to dictate the outcome, the laurels will fall to Moscow. History will record not a peacemaker but a president who helpedRussia, the US’s longtime adversary, reclaim its imperial standing while cementing the decline of US hegemony.Olga Chyzh researches political violence and repressive regimes.

In March,the Timesreported a surge in litigation over boundary disputes; in June, the housing ombudsman told the BBC that antisocial behaviour complaints haddoubled in the past five years.But I don’t believe we’re all living in a simmering neighbour grievance stew, threatening to boil over any second. Almost all of us live in intimate proximity on this small island and vanishingly few cohabitations end in complaints and court. We ranked fourth of 24 countries in trusting our neighbours in theWorld Values Surveyand while the sense of belonging to our neighbourhoods hasdeclined slightlysince Covid-19, it is steady at about60%. Most people try to be decent, tolerating barbecue smoke, straggly privet or escaped tortoises laying waste to their gardens.My neighbours go much further than that: this summer they have given us mountains of cherries, tomatoes and plants, lent us a trailer and done some chicken sitting. I don’t offer much in comparison, but I have fed a cat, taken out bins, offered lettuces and witnessed signatures – the basics of neighbourliness.Or should that be “neighbouring”? Writing in theFinancial Times, the author Tiffany Watt Smith suggests the word is a better fit for how we live in this unchosen, happenstance proximity: “A more neutral verb (much like ‘parenting’) that emphasises what we do, rather than who we are.”The idea of “neighbouring” as an action, not an identity, resonates, and how you neighbour is a product of circumstance (plus, of course, personalities). My neighbouring history is mixed: there was a family of uptight brass players so annoyed by my laissez-faire lawn maintenance that they sent one of their chinos-wearing sons round to mow; in another street, a nocturnal saxophonist improvised experimental accompaniments toJohnny Hallydaytracks after midnight, but also threatened to bury my husband in the garden when he got the lawnmower out.In a Paris apartment with a newborn, a toddler and terrible acoustics, we were the meat in a multi-generational complaint sandwich: five minutes of crying (the baby’s, mine was equally heartfelt but quieter) roused both the twentysomething below, who threatened to report us to the “authorities”, and the irascible retiree above, thumping with his cane.But other neighbours threaded connection and kindness through the long or short times we shared space. Especially Maria, our neighbour in our first flat. How else would I ever have met Maria? I’m so glad I did.Italian, widowed, mid-70s, Maria lived downstairs with her pampered cat, Bambi, a fur ball fed solely on organic chicken mini fillets and “special” Harrods milk. Absurdly energetic, she still worked in Soho’s trattorias, stumping home at midnight with the takings zipped inside her boot. Her speech patterns and anecdotes were richly strange, featuring murder (decapitation recurred alarmingly), cameos from the likes ofGeorge BestandL Ron Hubbardand decades-long grudges. Her expressions – “pieces and pieces” for “this and that” and “Fatty Bongo” (her nickname for Bambi, and others) – instantly entered my personal lexicon.Maria “neighboured” hard: she fed us, gave us gifts (unwanted, but that was immaterial) and took us out, usually to Italian restaurants where she was feared and respected equally. Once, memorably, she took us to a louche Mayfair casino where we discovered she was a regular. Later, she marched me down Edgware Road, pregnant, to buy frilly OTT baby clothes for our firstborn. I could only offer “pieces and pieces” in return: sourcing Bambi’s expensive rider, errands, an appreciative ear for her stories.Eight years later we left, with a final parting gift of a gigantic crystal basket. I’m sad that we didn’t stay in touch (my stepmother did for a while, so I know Maria adored the chaps who replaced us – they even shared a dog). That’s “neighbouring”, I suppose: we enter each other’s lives then leave, hopefully a little richer, not in crystal and infant sailor suits but in perspective; openness to connection, curiosity. Of course, your next neighbour could be a pass-agg note leaver, a pyromaniac or 3am dubstep aficionado. But what if they aren’t?Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocietyOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

She must not waste her chance to ‘go big’Heather StewartChancellor needs to reform an out-of-kilter tax system without alienating voters or spooking financial marketsSun 31 Aug 2025 06.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 15.27 EDTShareIt’s back to school this week for MPs and government ministers – and few can be facing a more challenging new term thanRachel Reeves. After being moved to tears in the unforgiving glare of the cameras before the summer break, the chancellor’s allies say she is returning to the frontline with a renewed sense of purpose. She is ready, as the kids would say, to “lock in”.But team Reeves is also well aware of the scale of the economic and political obstacles ahead. Most pressing, yet out of the chancellor’s hands, is the Office forBudgetResponsibility’s (OBR) summer “supply stocktake” of its economic model.As wereported in June, it looks likely that the OBR will move its key productivity forecast closer to the less-positive consensus. Given the crucial importance of productivity in determining economic growth, this shift could create a £20bn headache for the Treasury.The downgrade – not anythingLabourhas actually done – is likely to be the biggest factor pushing Reeves off track from her fiscal rules. That creates a formidable challenge in explaining what has gone awry – and why she needs to come back with more tax increases, after last year’s historic £40bn budget package.Expect to hear much more of the kind of language Reeves used in herrecent Guardian article, in which she argued that “if renewal is our mission and productivity is our challenge, then investment and reform are our tools”.She does have a story to tell here: changing the fiscal rules to prioritise investment has allowed the Treasury to give the green light to scores of pro-productivity infrastructure projects (with the next expected to beNorthern Powerhouse Rail).In the same vein, expect tax rises to be badged as efficiency enhancing, as well as revenue raising.Officials do not yet know the scale of the fiscal gap they will need to fill, though they expect it to be large. Reeves’s decision to involve Torsten Bell, formally the pensions minister, in budget preparations points to a willingness to think more radically.Bell has argued in the past for changes to the taxation of unearned income, property wealth – which we know the Treasury islooking at closely– and pensions.Reeves made moves in this direction last autumn, with changes to inheritance and capital gains taxes, but this budget must be the moment to“go big”, as Bell’s former boss Ed Miliband would put it. (Arguably, the moment was, in fact, last July, but here we are.)Yet as she draws up her plans, Reeves must have her eye on at least three different audiences, each in their way as tough as the meanest girls in the dining hall.The first, and most important, is the public, to whom the chancellor may be best known as the author of last year’sbotched removal of the winter fuel allowance.While she is claiming to have been “fixing the foundations” in her first year in the job, it may not feel like it for families facing resurgent inflation, which hits low earners hardest.And unfortunately, “Labour crashed the economy”, while unfair, is a much cleaner explanation for fresh tax rises than “the OBR has systemically overestimated productivity, which hasn’t recovered since the financial crisis”.Reeves will need to convince cash-strapped voters she understands their struggles and has a plan to help.Also watching Reeves closely will be those behind her, in her own party. Once seen as a potential future leader, she is blamed by some Labour MPs for a series of dire missteps, including on winter fuel and the botchedspring statement welfare cuts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they do raise the prospect of cracks emerging between No 10 and No 11, which rarely ends well.Reeves’s third audience is among what her battle-scarred Labour predecessor Denis Healey called “the faceless men” (and, these days, women) managing the “atomic cloud of footloose funds” in financial markets.Talk of an IMF bailout iswell wide of the markbut with debt interest expected to cost the taxpayer more than £100bn this year, even modest moves in government bond markets can be extremely costly.Judging by thebond sell-off in Julywhen Reeves’s tears were read as a sign that she was on the way out, investors are minded to trust her – or at least, more than any potential alternative.But to keep the support of this tough crowd, tax rises will have to be straightforward (and big) enough to close any fiscal gap convincingly, yet calibrated not to put the kibosh on growth or jack up inflation.Given the 10 weeks’ formal notice the Treasury gives the OBR of the budget date, it cannot now happen until November.Reeves will want to set some parameters in public long before that, to contain what has already become frenzied speculation, but she would be wise not to waste what may be Labour’s best crack at reforming our out-of-kilter tax system.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesEconomics viewpointEconomic policyTax and spendingBudgetLabourEconomicsEconomic growth (GDP)commentShareReuse this content"

In forensic work this is a non-negotiable, as the version of events clients present is often different to the way events transpired, and there are often rationalisations or justifications for behaviours.I knew Bill had been convicted of possessing and distributing child exploitation material (CEM) and had been found with hard drives containing thousands of folders of it. He had been distributing it for years in return for other CEM images. He was identified as being at higher risk than the average CEM offender and treatment was mandated.In the wake of childcare allegations, how should I talk to my kids about body safety?Read moreBefore starting treatment, we spoke about the limits of confidentiality in detail. As a registered psychologist, I am mandated to report any child sexual or physical abuse, including the use of CEM, and it was important that Bill understood what this meant for our therapy.He insisted that he was not aroused by children. This is a common occurrence among CEM offenders and is a reflection of the instinctive human need to shy away from admitting something shameful. Nevertheless, clinical judgment based on his years of CEM abuse and use of aclinical measure of sexual interest in childrensuggested that he probably had paedophilic interests, which amplified his risk of reoffending.Treatment for CEM use is still at a nascent stage and there have been few comprehensive evaluations of programs to assess whether they are successful in reducing risk.For Bill, as for most of my forensic clients, I used a tailored approach based on a formulation of his offending and his needs, and aligned this with the existing research surrounding risk factors for CEM within therisk-needs-responsivity modelof rehabilitation.Bill’s denial that his offending was problematic is a common rationalisation for CEM users but pointed to offence-supportive thoughts we needed to address. We also identified that he had experienced longstanding anxiety and fears of sexual inadequacy.We needed to work on building better emotional regulation skills so he could manage stressBill also had great difficulty managing emotion and often experienced high anxiety and stress levels. Outside his connections on the dark web he was isolated and spent most of his time playing video games. This isolation had stopped him from acknowledging the reality of his CEM abuse – until police raided his home.Our work began with getting Bill to identify a few things he wanted to work on. This kind of “buy-in” is important when working with mandated clients and is a key part of making them ready for treatment. We identified that we both wanted the same thing – for Bill to not reoffend – and this shared goal allowed us to form an alliance.We also focused on developing a shared understanding of his offending to ensure he understood his “offence map”, the unnoticed steps which resulted in his decision to offend. We needed to work on building better emotional regulation skills so he could better manage stress, and also started discussing ways we could reduce his use of the internet, as absorption in the online world facilitated his offending.We also needed to help him find ways to manage his urge to use CEM in future, and built a “toolkit” to support him at these times, including use of theStop it now serviceand techniques such asurge surfing.While Bill remained in denial about the extent of the harm his behaviours had likely caused to real children, he was sincere about his desire to ensure he didn’t reoffend. We were able to make some progress towards reducing the likelihood that he would, with Bill monitored by the sex offender registry and community corrections to further manage the risk he posed.*All clients are fictional amalgamsIn Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800, or Bravehearts on 1800 272 831, and adult survivors can contact Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

Now Reform is importing them to the MidlandsJon AllsopNottinghamshire council has borrowed the US president’s playbook – but may soon find that it needs the media more than it thoughtSun 31 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 03.07 EDTShareOn the day that he returned to office in January, Donald Trump signedan orderrenaming the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America”. A few days later, the Associated Press, a leading global news agency that is also a linguistic bible for newsrooms across the US, said that while it would acknowledge Trump’s order, it wouldmostly continue to use the original name. In response, the White Housebanned AP journalistsfrom certain media availabilities. Trump accused the agency of failing to follow the law. The AP said the government was trying to dictate what words it can and cannot use.This week, Nottinghamshire’s Reform-led county council said that it would impose a sweeping ban on the Nottingham Post, its affiliated website and BBC-funded reporters who work there. At issue, apparently, was a story that the paper had written about a proposed reorganisation of local government. The leader of the council insisted that he welcomes scrutiny, but has a “duty” to combat “misinformation”. The Post’s editorcalled the decision“a massive attack on local democracy” – and it’s hard to disagree.The Guardian view on Reform UK v the Nottingham Post: a council’s boycott of its local paper is both petty and alarming | EditorialRead moreThe ban has clear echoes of Trump’s tactics, andsomecriticssaid as much explicitly. In the US, there isa clear longer-term trendof Republican officials imposing poorly justified restrictions on the press. But one doesn’t need to look as far as that to understand the Nottinghamshire ban. Indeed, Reform has been accused before of shutting out reporters, or otherwise treating them with disrespect: last year,the party reportedly excluded certain adversarial outlets and journalists from its conference; earlier this summer, Reform’s leader Nigel Farageaccused local reporters in Scotlandof helping to coordinate protests against him. It all seems to add up, on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond, to a moment in which hard-right politicians, in particular, feel that they don’t need to engage with traditional news outlets to get their message out, and that they won’t suffer electoral consequences for shutting them out. They might even benefit from doing so, turning the media into a foil as part of a broader war against the establishment.And yet, there are also reasons to doubt these conclusions, or at least to texture them. It’s true that Trump, for example, has shut out journalists whose stories displease him. (In addition to the AP imbroglio, his White Houserecently barred a reporter from the Wall Street Journalfrom a trip to the UK, after that paper reported unflatteringly on Trump’s alleged ties to Jeffrey Epstein.) At the same time, though, Trump will routinely talk to pretty much anyone who will listen, the mainstream media very much included. (Earlier this year, he called the editor of the Atlantic a “sleazebag” – thengranted himan interview not long after.) Indeed, Trump has long used media coverage successfully to set the political agenda.In the UK, Farage seems to be using the same playbook. Sure, he has leaned, in particular, on the rightwing press. But such papers aren’t necessarily natural allies for Reform given theirdeep cultural ties to the Conservatives. And Farage has sucked up oxygen in more hostile quarters, too. This week, just as Nottinghamshire council was banning journalists, Farage was being praised,by Politico, for answering questions about his mass deportation plans with a directness that other parties should seek to emulate.Trump has clearly proven that there aren’t hard electoral consequences for press-bashing. But there are still important differences between UK and US political culture. Trust in the media is at alow ebb here, too. But in the recent past, rightwing political figures who have used Trumpian rhetoric to deflect blame for their own failures on to the media haven’t always been successful. Dominic Cummings goaded the press after his Covid-era drive to Barnard Castle,but could not escapemassive public anger. Boris Johnson dodging tough questions –from the Today programme, for example, which his government boycotted – didn’t spare him from the glare of scandal in the long run.This doesn’t guarantee that the leaders of Nottinghamshire council will suffer from banning their local paper. Indeed, it might very well be to Reform’s advantage to let Farage suck up attention nationally while dodging scrutiny for the actions of the party’s councillors across the country; the party surely wants the media talking about immigration, not the reorganisation of local government. And local outlets might seem an easy target, diminished in power and reach in an age of cuts to local news and unchained online discourse.View image in fullscreenPresident Trump meets members of the media at the White House.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersAnd yet Reform’s leadership of councils is an important test for the party in a country where voters still, to some extent, value competent governance. “If Reform can’t even face questions from the Nottingham Post,” the Conservative party chair Kevin Hollinrakewondered this week, “what hope is there that they could ever face the serious responsibilities of government?” He’s surely not the only one asking that question. Even in the US, where the culture of political press-bashing is more entrenched, local Republican legislators in some statesare cooperatingwith proposals to steer more resources to their dwindling local news outlets. This isn’t some act of altruism, advocates say, but one born of the realisation that they need voters to know what they’ve been doing when elections roll around.The Reform ban might hold. But at some point, local Reform councillors will want to trumpet an achievement, and when they do, it would not be a massive surprise if they go running to the Nottingham Post. Politicians can, of course, reach voters on social media these days. But established local news brands can still confer prestige. And good publicity is good publicity. For now, Trumphasn’t let up on the AP. But he hasn’t been shy about showcasing its journalism when it suits him.

I’ll have to go before him, out of spitePolly HudsonShould your partner be your best friend? After David Mitchell mansplained relationships, I asked my husband and his answer surprised meSun 31 Aug 2025 05.50 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 05.52 EDTShareDavid Mitchell is probably the only male on the planet who could get away with defending mansplaining, so that is what he has done. “I feel there’s an unfairness to the term, which is taken to be men explaining things in a boring way to women,” he toldthe Sunday Times. “Because they do it to each other, and they take turns, and that’s what men call a conversation.”In the same interview, Mitchell and his comedy partnerRobert Webbare asked how each counselled and supported the other through various personal challenges. They are confused and slightly aghast at the idea that they might have discussed such matters. What do men talk to one another about, then? “Well, yes,” says Mitchell. “That’s a question [my wife] Victoria’s asked me many times. And I never really know.”This insight came in the same week Rylan Clarkrevealed what he has learnedfrom hosting his podcast How to Be in Love. “I never really understood when people said, ‘my partner is my best friend,’” he admitted. “Because I thought, well, my partner is not my best friend – my best friend is my best friend. I didn’t get it. But I’ve realised that your partner can be that.”Hmmm … can they, though? As so perfectly illustrated byDavid Mitchell, men and women communicate in extremely different ways so, if you are in a heterosexual relationship, the odds seem stacked against you. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule but, if my husband went to the pub with a mate whose entire family had just been abducted by aliens, there’s a very real chance it might not come up. There have been many instances where something huge is happening in the life of one of his pals and I’m waiting patiently for the next instalment, but he comes home clueless. “Didn’t you ask?” I’ll shriek, brandishing my rolling pin. And he will look bewildered, somehow unaware he was meant to.Meanwhile, I know my friends inside out, and vice versa. From their deepest dreams, hopes and desires, to how they feel about themselves and everybody they have ever met via what they fancy for lunch. We check in, we keep up, we don’t have to be reminded to enquire about the plot twists in each other’s storyline, we are living and breathing them together. How can these opposite ways of relating, of transmitting and receiving, mesh successfully so both parties get what they need?But perhaps bigger, and more important, than the question of whether it’s possible to be best friends with your partner is if it’s a good idea in the first place. Isn’t that a lot of pressure on one person, and also too great a shift from romance towards roommates? Love aside, I do like my husband, we are friendly, but I’m not sure he’s mybestfriend, nor that I want him to be. It feels co-dependent and insular. A bit Stepford, tradwife, like we might share a toothbrush or, worse, an email address.Then I asked my husband who his best friend was, and his answer, and my reaction to it, surprised me. He thought for a second, and then gave a male name. He had been best man at our wedding, so the clues were there, but I was oddly hurt. “Not me, then?” I clarified, in case he had mixed me and this guy up or something.Are we heading for a world where no one ever needs to talk to another human being?Read more“Well, I’m not yours, am I?” he replied, immediately reeling off five people and one cat who would definitely be ahead of him in the queue. All fair enough. Except … it turns out that although my husband isn’tmybest friend, and I am fine with that, I want to behis. Want and expect. Oh, and I’m increasingly outraged not to be, the longer I ponder it. Welcome to marriage.The disparate ways the genders relate are also the reason widows are “way happier” than widowers after the death of a spouse,says Harvard professor, author and happiness scientist Arthur C Brooks. “Widowers do really poorly generally, men do very poorly, and part of the reason is because – this data is disputed but more or less it’s directionally correct – 60% of 60-year-old men say their best friend is their wife, 30% of their wives say their best friend is their husband,” he mansplains … sorry,explains. “Women have more relationships, they have closer, deeper love relationships with non-related kin and with the adult children, typically, than the husband does.”My husband, the outlier. Clearly, I will have to die before him, out of spite, to teach him the error of his ways. If he dares to call me his best friend in his eulogy, please feel free to heckle.Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsMenFriendshipDavid MitchellRobert WebbRylan ClarkHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

And yet, he said, he was miserable. How could he be happy about his success when so many terrible things were happening in the world?It’s a good question, and one that I hear from a lot of people these days. As I write these words, humanitarian disasters are unfolding in Gaza, Sudan, Yemen, Myanmar, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Global climate action has not moved fast enough, and we are perilously close to creating an uninhabitable planet. Meanwhile here in the United States, immigrants have been rounded up and shipped to foreign countries without legal protection. Trans people have been demonized. Meaningful government agencies have been cut. Research destroyed. Universities attacked. The legal system pushed to the brink and corruption rampant.Is it cruel to be happy when there is so much destruction? Or is it simply foolish to tie one’s mental health to this unpredictable and often violent world? I told my friend that both questions hold some truth: if he is going to feel the world’s pain, he should remember to feel its joys as well. In saying this, I was relying on some of the oldest beliefs in the world – ones that we’d do well to remember today.The idea that we should feel the pain of others is deeply etched into many cultural and religious beliefs. A foundational image for this is an understanding of humanity as members of a single body. We can find versions of the concept in the religious texts of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity.In finding beauty in the broken, we can form a bridge between the mundane and the divine | Jackie BaileyRead moreThere is, for example, St Paul in one of his letters to the Corinthians: “For just as the body is one and has many members … so it is with Christ … If one member suffers, all suffer together with it.” Centuries later, Ralph Waldo Emerson offered a secular formula: “It is a doctrine alike of the oldest and of the newest philosophy, that man is one, and that you cannot injure any member, without a sympathetic injury to all the members.”Those today who doubt their own right to happiness are echoing this noble tradition of thought. It is reasonable and moral to think that when others are being injured, you, too, should feel that injury.But feeling what others feel does not limit you to their pain. The St Paul quote above continues: “If one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.” There is some logical truth in this: if we experience the injuries done to others, shouldn’t we experience their joys as well?Some Buddhist texts suggest that this is part of the process of enlightenment. Buddha recommends spreading one’s consciousness across the whole universe and experiencing all the joys of others encountered on the way. This feeling is calledmudita, often translated as sympathetic joy. A German term –freudenfreude, pleasure in another person’s pleasure – nicely captures this idea.When we doubt whether we should feel good right now, we are only feeling the pain of others. We focus so much on what’s going wrong in the world that we neglect to also experience the goodness – the new feats, delights, births, achievements, decencies, kindnesses – all around us. While focusing excessively on the positives makes us saccharine, ignoring them completely makes us cynical.Recognizing the need to experience both the pain and joy of others helps us move past the traps of feeling bad for feeling good or feeling good only by ignoring the world. It helps us overcome the common pitfalls of retreating into the empty sloganeering of positive thinking or the equally unhelpful downward spiral of doomscrolling depression. We can instead appreciate the very real nature of our feelings: miserable and elated, horrified and happy.As connected members of an unfurling and complex world, we are bound to experience this range of moods. The trick is to learn to let ourselves experience them all and not get fixated on any particular feeling. The times we live in are full of horror and delight. So are our souls. It’s okay to feel both.To say this is not to cave into normalization and acceptance of our current political situation. There is much more chaos and cruelty than there ever should be. And that’s part of the point: the current administration wants to “own the libs” and create pain and confusion. Political action is the main venue to fight back. But taking care of ourselves also matters. Feeling bad some of the time about the state of the world is part of being a connected human. Feeling good some of the time is part of our resistance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

It teaches me that we are at least capable of overcoming the horrors of the present.That’s also why alliances matter.

But as corporations and those in power turn away,the overwhelming majority of peoplein the world want more ambitious climate actionSupport independent environment journalism todaySun 31 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 05.01 EDTShareExtreme politics and extreme weather go hand in hand, and both have to be confronted if we are to understand and overcome the polycrisis we are living through.Yet few media organisations are examining why the climate emergency is creating a new era of demagogues. Even fewer are scrutinising how those authoritarian leaders aretrying to misdirect public attentionaway from the root cause of our current global malaise.The Guardian is different.About nine out of every 10 people in the world want their governments to take stronger climate actions, yet we’ve witnessed a dramatic shift away from the progress we need to avert climate disaster.Powerful governments, financial institutions and big oil companies areturning their back on climate promisesand some are fundingsecretive lobby groupsandfar-right politiciansthat want to shift away from the progress we need to make real, positive change.The pushback has been shocking. Debunking climate disinformation is a full-time task for Guardian environment teams across the world, particularly in the United States, now that the world’s biggest fossil fuel producer appearsintent on undermining hard-won progresson reducing emissions.The most obvious elements of disinformation are the wild conspiracy theories spread by social media influencers and bots. Instead of attributing disasters to fossil fuels and cuts to emergency services and the USNational Weather Service, in July they spread unfounded rumours that the deadly floods in Texas were caused by sinister weather modification technology. In this anything-but-the-truth realm, California wildfires were supposedly planned by officials to destroy child-trafficking tunnels, whilethe devastation in North Carolinacaused by Hurricane Helene was apparently the result of a hushed-up dam failure and cloud seeding.Then there are rightwing media organisations that jump to politically convenient – but wrong – interpretations of events, such as thefalse claimsthat renewable energy caused the recent massive blackout in Spain.Most alarming are the brazen lies of the likes of Donald Trump, who has called climate science “a giant hoax”, “a scam” and “bullshit”. This is a double falsehood – firstly because climate research is robust andsupported by 99.9% of specialists, and secondly because Trump and many of his influential supporters in business and politics are well aware of the global heating risks and are responding in a way that suggests they think their best hope for survival is to build up their wealth, consider invading cooler neighbouring countries, such as Canada and Greenland, andprepare their doomsday bunkers.There also appears to be an insidious strategy to keep people in the dark about the environment for as long as possible.The Guardian has tracked how the Trump administration isdefunding world-leading climate research agencies,firing droves of scientistsand threatening official portals that were formerly hubs of cutting-edge information about climate trends. Amid so much uncertainty, wepublished the US National Climate Reportin full to ensure it can be found, for free, in the public domain.Climate deniers and fossil fuel interests are funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and EuropeWorse could still be to come. In the US, Trump has declared an “energy emergency” as an excuse to carve open more land and ocean for oil and gas exploration, which is expected to lead toa sharp increase in US greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel companies, such as Koch Industries, are funding an association of Republican attorneys which includes many Republican attorneys general who are trying to block states seeking compensation for weather disasters caused by climate change.The Orwellian developments in the US have not yet been replicated on the other side of the Atlantic, but Guardian reporters are investigating how money from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests are funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe. This is a clear attempt tobreak down the longstanding consensus over climate science and net zero campaigns, despite the very strong public support for both.Earlier this year, the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, and former Conservative prime minister Liz Trussattended the launch of Heartland UK/Europewhich is headed by a climate denier and part of a US network funded by the petroleum company ExxonMobil and wealthy US Republican donors. The Guardian has revealed how Heartlandhas been wooing far-right European politicianssince at least February 2023.In these bleak times, it is also crucial to report on the strength of the resistance and the possibility for positive change: theleaders still seeking global solutions, the youth activists who have launched a new campaign to “villainise big oil” and lobby for compensation for climate damages (which is reminiscent of the Guardian’s earlierPolluters seriesto name and shame the companies most responsible for the climate emergency), the taskforce dreaming upradical climate solutions, and the campaigns that remind us thatthe overwhelming majority of peoplein the world want more ambitious climate action.We are not alone. This is not a fringe issue. Nor is it a hoax or an impossibly expensive challenge, no matter what Silicon Valley social media, Russian bots and Saudi oil money try to tell us.

A generation of journalists is being wiped outSun 31 Aug 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 15.28 EDTShareDay by day, the death toll rises, the war crimes mount, and the outrage grows. Last Wednesday, the popedemandedthat Israel stop its “collective punishment” of Gaza’s population. A day later, António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general,warnedthat “the levels of death and destruction … are without parallel in recent times”. More than 500 UN staffhave pressedthe human rights chief, Volker Türk, to call it genocide. Half of registered voters in the US havealready concludedthat that is what Israel is doing in Gaza.The agony is deepening. On Friday, the Israeli military declared famine-hit Gaza City to be a combat zone, intensifying its assault and ending “tactical pauses” that allowed limited – if utterly inadequate – food delivery. Many inhabitants are physically incapable of fleeing again, and fear that they would be no safer elsewhere.Israelhas attacked parts of areas that it has labelled as “humanitarian zones”.Israel could end the international condemnation by stopping its campaign of annihilation. Instead, it tries to stop us learning about it, by silencing those who bear witness. It is determined to control the narrative of the war – though even its own figures at times offer ableak viewof conditions – and will go to shocking lengths. This has become the most lethal war for the media in recent history. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 189 Palestinian journalists are dead in Gaza; others put the toll still higher. Five were killedin a single strikelast week.Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Avaaz, a non-profit organisation promoting global activism, are calling on Israel to abide by its international obligations to protect journalists as civilians, and open Gaza’s borders so that international journalists can report freely.The Guardian is printing the names of all of those whom the CPJ has listed as killed: women and men such asFatma Hassona,Hamza al-DahdouhandAnas al-Sharif, admired for their work and, of course, dearly loved as daughters, fathers, sisters and friends. These are deeply personal losses. But they also represent a generation of journalists that is being wiped out and cannot be replaced.“At the rate journalists are being killed in Gaza by the Israeli army, there will soon be no one left to keep you informed,” warned Thibaut Bruttin, RSF’s director general.The civilian death toll in Gaza is staggering, and journalists are put at particular risk when they run to danger to report as others try to escape. But the killing of so many who have been clearly identified as members of the media, in some cases after they werethreatenedover their work or smeared, leaves no doubt that they have been targeted. This is “the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists that CPJ has ever documented”, the organisationhas said. “Palestinian journalists are being threatened, directly targeted and murdered by Israeli forces, and are arbitrarily detained and tortured in retaliation for their work.”Journalists in Gaza work in unbearable conditions – hungry and exhausted, breaking off reporting to find food for their families, help carry bodies from rubble or assist wounded relatives in finding shelter. Many are separated from those they love; many have buried loved ones. All know that in bearing witness, they increase the danger that they face. They carry on to defend the truth against Israel’s attempts to extinguish it. They must be defended themselves.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

At last this dire situation is getting some of the attention it deserves. This year, nearly a quarter of all maths and English language entries in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were for students aged 17 or older on a repeat attempt – with just one in six of those retaking maths managing to pass.By calling this a crisis, Jill Duffy, who heads the OCR exam board, has thrown a spotlight on the problem. But admitting that there is an issue with resits, as officials are now doing, is only the first step. There are differing views about what ought to happen next.ReformingGCSEsis outside the scope of the review being led by Prof Becky Francis. But a proposal to ditch compulsory resits is on the table. The Sixth Form Colleges Association wants a second attempt to be followed – for those who fail – by a modular alternative. This would mean students not being forced to endlessly repeat the parts of the courses they have mastered, and focusing instead on the gaps.Nick Gibb, the former Conservative schools minister, has predictably set his face against change and demanded that all schoolsfollow the example of the best. But while big variations in results should be drilled into, and successes learned from, this is not an adequate response. Many subject experts believe that the qualifications are poorly designed if their purpose is to serve as a universal gateway to the world of work. Rather than sticking to vital competencies (such as numeracy, statistics and reading comprehension), the current versions include calculus and geometry (in maths) and quasi-literary analysis (in English language).It is a great shame that these issues were not grasped more effectively by Labour in opposition. Changes to the curriculum and exam system are a painstaking process. Prof Francis’s review is the best chance of breaking a destructive cycle. But the Department for Education’s recent record of engagement with the further education sector – where most resits are taken – is not good. There is no secondary English specialist on the review, andteacher shortagesand challenges around provision for special educational needs and disabilities remain concerning.Resits must also be seen in the context of a wider debate around the future of post-16 education, including the pledge by ministers toabolish coursesthat they see as unwelcome competition to T-levels. As with resits, critics of this policy are most worried about less academically able pupils with lower test scores. Even the government’s own figures show a gap, with tens of thousands of students on thethreatened courses, including some BTecs, potentially unsuited to newer alternatives.With a skills white paper due in the autumn, it is not too late to tackle unanswered questions. A better balance between ambition and pragmatism can surely be found. Plenty of jobs in the UK do not require calculus or textual analysis. T-levels were meant to boost less academic, more practical teenagers. This year’s resit figures are a worrying addition to existing evidence that these are the pupils for whom the system works least well. Ministers must be absolutely confident that any changes they introduce make things better, and not worse.Explore more on these topicsGCSEsOpinionSchoolsExamsEducation policyFurther educationStudentseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fomJane Ryan,Michael PykeandHugh CoolicanSun 31 Aug 2025 12.05 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 15.27 EDTShareLast week in my small rural town, St George’s flags were erected from lamp-posts and crudely daubed on roundabouts and zebra crossings, while residents were subjected to “Sieg Heil” as a mob walked along the streets. Downing Street has put out a statement that patriotism is important, while Joanne Monk, theReform UKleader of Worcestershire city council, also emphasised pride in the flag.I have nothing against the flag per se, but when Nazi thugs use it to demonstrate and catcall, it morphs into something else entirely. As a Black person, I have been subject to abuse three times in the past fortnight. My 12-year-old child and his friend were called “paedos” at school – they are the only Black children in the class – and a friend’s child was called the N-word on the bus (this was before the summer recess). To be Black in the countryside at the moment is to have a target on your back.There are real-world consequences of constantly demonising Black and Brown people in the media, racialising crimes and acting as if the most vulnerable people in our society – asylum seekers – are the reasons your energy bills are too high or you can’t afford your food shop.Nigel Farage and his acolytes know what they are doing with their disinformation and division campaign, and the media should be ashamed of giving them so much airtime. As Rafael Behr notes (There’s an obvious way to challenge Nigel Farage. But Keir Starmer won’t do it, 27 August), the distraction technique is a well-worn part of Farage’s playbook. A strong prime minister would call him out, not mimic him. If he gets into Downing Street in 2029, as some pollsters predict, we will only have ourselves to blame.Name and address suppliedI am surprised that someone who asked their neighbour to take down an England flag is astonished by their refusal to do so (Letters, 26 August). But why would they comply? The flag is not obscene, offensive or inappropriate; it is the flag of England being flown in England.I do not recall similar objections when Ukrainian flags appeared in windows in a display of solidarity. Nor do such debates arise when the England men’s football team enjoys success, prompting a surge of flags in cars, pubs and homes. And the union jacks along the Mall in London rarely attract controversy.To equate the St George’s cross with extremism is a mistake. Suppressing its display does not challenge intolerance, it merely silences legitimate expressions of national identity. Surely the more constructive approach is to foster open discussion rather than to remove symbols.If one chooses to live in England, one should reasonably expect to see England’s flag flown with pride. There is nothing inherently wrong in expressing affection for one’s own country.Name and address suppliedI live on a terrace of 16 houses. A couple of years ago, one of our neighbours put up a St George’s cross. At first, the flag seemed football-related, but they left it flying indefinitely. As such a powerful signifier of patriotism, many of us felt it gave our terrace a distorted and unwanted image.It then occurred to us that we could drown out that cultural noise by us all flying flags. Ten houses participated. We made poles from fishing rods and bamboo. I chose the flag of Jamaica to represent my partly Caribbean family. There were flags from the Philippines, Scotland, Spain, rainbows and doves, and we raised them as high as possible above the union flag. On breezy, sunny days they made our terrace seem like a festival of difference.Many people asked residents what we were celebrating. Our answer was that “we are from everywhere”. The St George’s cross couple soon left and our community settled back into its peaceful ways.Jane RyanWoodbridge, SuffolkFurther to the very interesting letters about the current rash of flags, has anyone noticed that nearly all the ones on tall lamp-posts are flying at half mast? Is it just that flag-flyers don’t have cherry pickers, or are we unconsciously in mourning for the decline of compassion and decency?Michael PykeLichfield, StaffordshireIt’s heartening to see so many lads supporting the England women’s team in the Rugby World Cup with their street flags.Hugh CoolicanBroughton Astley, LeicestershireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I feel unseen’, 26 August) has clearly had included in its training any number of science fiction works, from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein onwards, in which authors have imagined such scenarios. Any half-decent sci-fi author would produce a much better script than the AI-generated one quoted.There is something deeply disturbing about a world that does not grant personhood to, for example, great apes, whales, dolphins or octopuses (and barely grants personhood to some immigrants, for instance), but where consideration is given to granting personhood to strings of computer code. No, AI cannot suffer, but it might produce a more or less convincing simulacrum of “suffering”.Chatbots rely on, and exploit, an aspect of human psychology that casually attributes agency to almost anything: “the cash machine swallowed my card”, “the car refuses to start”. We even teach it to young children: “Did the naughty stone hurt your foot?” No, it didn’t.Equally disturbing is the ease with which people start to imagine that they are in a “relationship” with a chatbot. What are the gaping wounds in the fabric of our social relationships that enable this to happen? This nonsense needs to end before it starts.Pam LunnKenilworth, WarwickshireYour article on whether AIs can suffer (Big tech and users grapple with one of most unsettling questions of our times, 26 August) misses one important point: that AIs are effectively actors and nothing more.They have been programmed to react, much like an actor learns lines. They can learn and seem more real, much like an experienced actor might be more convincing. But the actor is still an actor, no matter how pained they seem on stage.AIs are still technology, going through their lines, hitting their marks.

The rollout of the programme was significant and marked a giant step forward in improving emergency medical readiness, and potentially saving lives in schools across England.Now I am urging the current Labour government to go a step further by ensuring that all school staff receive appropriate and up-to-date training on how to use defibrillators confidently and effectively. Through our work at theOliver King Foundation, we have heard first-hand from headteachers and teaching staff across the country that this life-saving equipment is not being used and instead being stored in cupboards because the training on how to use it has not been provided.The presence of defibrillators in schools alone is not going to solve the problem. Providing adequate training is crucial as a means of maximising the valuable investment made by the former government and in ensuring that every child, teacher and visitor in our schools is as safe as possible in the event of a cardiac emergency. Failure to provide this training is putting lives needlessly at risk.Cardiac conditions such as sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (Sads)kill 12 young people under the age of 35 every single weekin the UK. The need to ensure our schools are prepared to deal with unexpected emergencies such as cardiac arrest could not be clearer.This is not a partisan issue, but a matter of safeguarding the health and lives of our children. Regardless of political affiliation, we can all agree that schools should be safe spaces where teachers are equipped to respond effectively in emergencies. Training is a commonsense solution that transcends political lines and reflects a shared commitment to the wellbeing of every child in England. As the new school year approaches, I am urging the government to act quickly.Mark KingThe Oliver King FoundationExplore more on these topicsSchoolsChildren's healthChildrenHealthlettersShareReuse this content"

Or maybe it was the fear of defeat. Nobody wanted to countenance that, however early in the season this fixture came.‘I should mention Trent’: Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai savours free-kickRead moreWouldArsenalhave taken a fourth Anfield draw in a row beforehand? The answer was probably yes and it appeared that Mikel Arteta had placed the emphasis on being difficult to beat, first and foremost. He loaded his lineup with physicality, playing Mikel Merino in the No 10 role rather than Martin Ødegaard, who was not fully fit. Or Eberechi Eze, the new signing, who was also among the substitutes. Which was a surprise.Arteta knew it would be tight; he wanted it to be that way – for his team to retain a puncher’s chance. Perhaps they could nick something from a set piece? He did not subscribe to the notion of fortune favouring the brave. In the end, Arteta got nothing, he and his players floored by what ­Szoboszlai produced with seven ­minutes of ­regulation time remaining.The free-kick was 30 yards out but the Hungary international made light of the distance with a stunning execution up and over the wall, the technique genera­ting vicious dip and fade, ­leaving David Raya clutching at thin air. ­Szoboszlai brought precision to the party, too, placing the ball perfectly inside the goalkeeper’s right-hand post.It was the last day of August yet it was easy to see this as a marker from Liverpool; a declaration of intent. This is before they make their final moves in a blockbuster transfer window, in which they could still add Alexander Isak and Marc Guéhi and push their spending towards £500m.Arsenal were the better team in the first half, even if they created little. Neither team did across the piece. It was that kind of contest. But ­Liverpool rallied in the second period, the Kop making itself heard and if one team was going to score, it felt as though it would be them.View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai scores the only goal of the game from 30 yards.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesSzoboszlai, who stood in at right-back for the injured Jeremie Frimpong, ensured it was a goal to remember. Thanks toManchester City’s defeat at Brightonearlier in the day, Liverpool have a bit of daylight between themselves and both their principal rivals.Arsenal had to go back to September 2012 for their previous league win at Anfield; Arteta was a player for them that day as goals from Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla secured a 2-0 victory. Arteta’s plan on this occasion was to be solid; to stop Liver­pool from playing. To that end, it was a blow to lose William Saliba to an ankle injury in the early ­running. Injuries would be a theme of the day. ­Liverpool’s Ibrahima Konaté and ­Florian Wirtz also hobbled off.It was tense. Arsenal could feel their hearts thump when they tried to work their play-out-from‑the‑back patterns. Yet they got them to click in the initial exchanges; a sign of the personality that Arteta wanted to see. Martín Zubimendi was prominent. Arsenal’s aggressive press, meanwhile, was a feature. Liverpool had a few nervy moments as they attempted to build from their defensive third.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The odds in the first half appeared to point towards Arsenal making something happen in this regard. Yet it was Liverpool who had the big moment on 34 minutes when Raya erred and Virgil van Dijk outmuscled ­Zubimendi. The Liverpool captain had a shooting opportunity only to look for Mohamed Salah and a pass that was not there.The ­creative quality was absent. Arteta’s team searched for Noni Madueke on the right; it was clear he had the pace to trouble Milos Kerkez. Twice in the first half Madueke almost got the better of his man. Kerkez, though, made last-ditch interventions. Madueke also worked Alisson after a corner broke for him.Liverpool had to free themselves from Arsenal’s headlock in the ­second half and they did so. They took higher starting positions. They brought greater intensity. Arne Slot was able to play Alexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch together in midfield for the first time this season and the latter came to flicker. At the back, Konaté bullied Viktor Gyökeres, giving him nothing. It was a mismatch; a painful one from an Arsenal point of view.Mac Allister fizzed a pass up to Wirtz, whose low shot Raya found too hot to handle. He spilled it to Cody Gakpo and then cleaned him out; an obvious penalty. Except that Gakpo was offside. The ball deflected in off Saliba’s replacement, Cristhian ­Mosquera, but it would not count.Arteta introduced Ødegaard and Eze for Merino and Gabriel ­Martinelli in the 70th minute and, by that point, the tide had turned, Liverpool ­pushing. Arsenal’s priority was their defensive shape. Declan Rice blocked a Salah shot after good work from Wirtz before Szoboszlai assumed centre stage.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Even though it’s not for me, it’s for the Americans, it’s fine,” Krejcikova said. “I’m looking forward to seeing you again in my next match – I think against another American.”Townsend dominated the opening set and looked poised to win the second as well, with Krejcikova saving her first match point in the 10th game.It was the tiebreak that really saw the 29-year-old pull off her Houdini act, though, Krejcikova saving her best for when it really mattered to fight off seven more match points, recovering from 3-6 before taking her third set point.The Czech then took an off-court break, leaving Townsend sat on her chair wondering what might have been, and it was Krejcikova who had the momentum in the deciding set.“It just stings, because I literally gave everything,” Townsend said. “She came up with some really, really great tennis in moments where she was down, and I thought I had it.”Krejcikova next faces another American, fourth seed Jessica Pegula, who lost in the final last year and breezed through to the last eight again with a 6-1, 6-2 victory against Ann Li. Pegula hasn’t dropped a set this year at Flushing Meadows, and only once has she been kept on court for more than 75 minutes.“Probably the best match, honestly, I’ve played since, like, before Wimbledon I feel like from the start to finish. So that was encouraging,” Pegula said. “I was just hitting the ball, doing everything well, executing my strategy very well and got through it pretty quick.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open tennisUS sportsTennisUS Open Tennis 2025newsShareReuse this content"

Opponents suddenly look at them and ­wonder what on earth once seemed so intimidating, how on earth a bunch of ­players in these shirts, even with this manager, could seem so unbeatable.At half-timeManchester Cityled, and seemed comfortable in their lead against opponents who had never got going. But by the time Brajan Gruda calmly rounded James Trafford and dumped Rayan Aït-Nouri on his ­backside before rolling into an empty net, a Brighton winner had come to seem almost ­overdue.Seconds earlier Trafford had made a remarkable save, stretching back and to his left to claw away a deflected Jan Paul van Hecke shot. But there had been opportunities before that as well; the Brighton surge had become relentless.Brighton v Manchester City: Premier League upset – as it happenedRead moreFabian Hürzeler, the Brighton manager, must take credit for a quadruple substitution on the hour that transformed the game, but just as striking was how vulnerable City became to balls played in behind their defensive line, particularly after the substitution of Bernardo Silva on 72 minutes.The structure that once gave City a stifling control has vanished almost entirely, the optimism of that­opening romp against Wolveslong since departed. Give them space and they will still take advantage, but put them under pressure and the fissures and flaws are evident. Almost every recent opponent – Crystal Palace, Al Hilal, Tottenham, even Wolves in the opening minutes – has shown how the space between back four and keeper can be exploited.The sense for Brighton until now had been of performances ­having been rather better than results. Although they conceded a stoppage‑time equali­ser athome against Fulhamand then lost at Everton, where they missed a penalty and twice hit the woodwork, they had won the xG convincingly in both games. But they began poorly, undermined by a lack of precision and decisiveness, a laxity that created a mood of frustration; a pass completion rate of under 75% before half‑time told its own story.City weren’t at anything like their fluent best, which is perhaps no real ­surprise given the number of ­players they are trying to integrate and the ­disruption to their pre-season caused by partici­pation in the Club World Cup. Even the return of Rodri for his first ­Premier League start since he ­damaged a knee against Arsenal last September could not ­generate the old sense of calm.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland in despair after the final whistle.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesAlthough there were some signs of at least some of the familiar City rhythm returning, this remains a team more dependent on ­individuals for attacking penetration than the stereotype of a Pep Guardiola side.Erling Haaland, as ever, was the major threat, although these days even he misfires more than he scores. After scuffing one early chance, he had dragged another effort just wide and then headed straight at Bart Verbruggen from close range when, presented with an opportunity following Omar Marmoush’s run, he dinked the ball neatly over the goalkeeper. Brighton, perhaps, will feel they should have cleared, Marmoush somehow bundling through a challenge from Van Hecke before dabbing a pass between Lewis Dunk’s legs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a long time since they really controlled a midfield as they did so often in the treble ­season. Long before ­Gruda’s winner, Trafford had had to make a good saves to keep out Kauro Mitoma and Yakuba Minteh, while Diego Gómez squandered a similar opportunity by manhandling Abdukodir Khusanov.Minteh’s chance, in particular, seemed to unsettle City and it was soon after that, after the ­needless con­cession of a free-kick on the right by Khusanov, that Dunk’s volley smacked into Matheus Nunes’s upraised arm. James Milner, six years after he last scored, converted against his former club to become the ­second oldest (behind Teddy Sheringham), as well as the second youngest (behind James Vaughan), scorer in Premier League history.What was notable then was just how incapable City seemed of stopping the Brighton flow. Trafford made save after save before, in the 89th minute, another turnover led to a four-on-three break. Mitoma picked his pass with typical composure and Gruda, presented with yet another one-on-one, almost casually converted.City, somehow, had lost a game they seemed to have under control with half an hour to go. But worse than that, they no longer have the demeanour of champions. It may return, but for now other Premier League sides will look at them and see opportunity.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

You get a message one night, a day and a half later you’re on a plane, and then a day and a half later you’re on the field.”The final was a rematch of the 2023 game which Brave won comfortably, while this season the Southampton‑based side had enjoyed a faultless procession to the final, winning all eight of their group-stage matches. But Brave faltered at the last after being put in to bat by a Superchargers side high on confidence following their 42-run hammering of London Spiritin the eliminator on Saturday.Kate Cross quickly found herself on a hat-trick, Sophie Devine and Freya Kemp both holed out in the 20s, and Brave’s captain Georgia Adams was run out after hitting the ball straight back to the bowler Cross and dashing out of her ground. Brave put just 115 runs on the board.“A final’s a final and you’ve got to go into that on a fresh start, wipe what’s happened away,” Adams said. “We didn’t hit our straps early enough with the ball today and put enough pressure on them.”Brave had defended a total of 106 three days ago at Southampton against Welsh Fire, but Superchargers are a far stronger batting side. The world’s leading proponent of the switch-hit, the 22-year-old Australian left-hander Phoebe Litchfield, once again showcased her extraordinary talent, with two of her five boundaries hit from a right-handed stance. She was ultimately undone with a conventional sweep which ended up in the hands of Lauren Bell at short fine leg, but by the time she was dismissed – shortly after a 15-minute rain delay – the equation was down to a run a ball and an unbeaten partnership of 60 from 24 balls between Carey and Annabel Sutherland saw Superchargers home with 12 balls to spare.Superchargers enjoyed their fair share of luck – Chloe Tryon could have seen off Carey lbw first ball had Brave referred the not-out decision to the third umpire, while Bell actually clipped the top of Sutherland’s stumps but failed to dislodge the bails – but the pair remained unbeaten to the end, Sutherland sealing the win in style with a six lofted over long-on.Whatever happened in the final on Sunday was scarcely going to eclipse the events of 24 hours previously, whereby the 18-year-old prodigy Davina Perrin struck a once‑in‑a-lifetime century to propel Superchargers into the final, and herself into England contention.All eyes were on Perrin as she walked out to the middle at Lord’s and continued where she had left off with back-to-back boundaries against Bell, including disdainfully ramping her bouncer – the shot of a supremely confident player who has just played the innings of her career.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Who knows, next summer we might see Dav up in lights here in a World Cup final for England.”There was a sigh of disappointment around the ground when Perrin skied a catch to mid-on for just 17. But while she could not quite match her mammoth efforts of the previous day, she can look back with satisfaction on an innings which launched her side to an odds-defying Hundred title.Perrin’s innings may also have wider significance, showcasing the quality of the Women’s Hundred at a time when female players are anxious about their future in a tournament now with a new set of owners who are making noises about possible changes to the double-header format, team names and player-selection process.“We absolutely love playing it, we love the format, we love playing alongside the men,” Adams said. “The nature of what we’re doing now is you’ve just got to roll with what’s happening, roll with the changes, be open to change. But everyone feels like it’s just starting to take off. Hopefully they don’t change too much, but we’ll just have to wait and see what’s thrown at us.”Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Similarly, the seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton was forced to trudge back to the paddock, his ­Ferrari in pieces by the side of the track after an enormously uncharacteristic, unforced error.‘A lot of emotions are not that helpful’: Oscar Piastri on his F1 world title dreamRead moreThis was sport as a cruel mistress writ large at Zandvoort. Piastri’s performance was as admirable and assured as any he had delivered, the 24‑year‑old Australian as unflappable as ever to deliver a consummate pole‑to‑flag victory. Indeed it never looked in doubt from the moment he held his lead through turn one, even through a brief period of light rain and three safety-car restarts.But in his wake fate had decreed the most damnable fortune for ­Norris. The British driver had entered the weekend fired up for the title run‑in, with just nine points between the two protagonists. He had noted that now it was getting serious, with nine races to go after the meeting in Zandvoort, every point would matter. Dropping a few he might consider a setback but a DNF to his teammate’s victory was surely the veritable white whale of Norris’s nightmares.Worse still was the manner he was denied. In the turbo-hybrid era the cars have become all but bulletproof in reliability, the days of an engine going pop seemingly all but long gone. Yet as Norris harried Piastri to the flag in second place, with only seven laps to go, the unthinkable became blunt reality as his cockpit filled with smoke that belched from the car as the oil leak that was to blame finally ground him to a halt.Norris pulled over, climbed out and moved, dejected, to sit alone on the dunes, helmet on and head bowed, sitting disconsolate as his hopes fell to pieces – through no fault of his own.Nonetheless Norris, ­impressively, took it with no little phlegm, ­remaining calm and remarkably stoic on reflection. “It wasn’t my fault, so there’s nothing I can really do. It’s just not my weekend,” he said.“Of course it’s frustrating. It hurts a bit for sure in a championship point of view. It’s a lot of points to lose so quickly and so easily.”Piastri, as cool as ever, calmly took the flag with complete control to secure a 34-point lead in the ­drivers’ championship. Not ­insurmountable but a swing that amounts to a body blow for the British driver and one from which he must recover for Monza in a week’s time.Hamilton has a similarly short time to reset after what was ­supposed to have been his fresh start in the wake of the summer break after a difficult first half of the season on his debut with Ferrari. Last week he said he was determined to have fun driving again, to enjoy himself competing for the team he had dreamed of joining when he was child, and that he felt positive and motivated.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri stands triumphant atop his McLaren after cruising to victory in the Dutch Grand Prix.Photograph: Sem van der Wal/EPAHis hopes were left in tatters in a shower of carbon fibre as the front of his Ferrari came apart on impact with the barriers. With very light rain intensi­fying a little on lap 21, ­Hamilton was caught out. At turn three he went wide on to part of the track beyond the white line where painted ­branding adorns the tarmac.With a fine coating of Dutch drizzle it was a slippery surface and he lost the rear and slid inexorably off into the ­barriers. “I’m so sorry guys,” he said as, clearly dejected, he made his way on foot back to the paddock, helmet still firmly on.It was striking that he lost the car in circumstances in which he usually exhibits absolute control. Yet even after what was a blow to his ambitions for a reinvigorated restart at Ferrari, he remained upbeat. “Took me by complete surprise what happened, I lost the rear up the bank and that was it. I was hoping to save it, but I didn’t,” he said.“Apart from that, it’s been a really solid weekend. I feel like I made progress, just overall, and my approach and everything. To come away with nothing is definitely painful. I’m sad for the team because I really wanted to get those points for the team today.”His team principal, Fred Vasseur, maintained afterwards that ­Hamilton remained positive, that he felt the weekend had been a step forward with which he was happy despite his error, as the Scuderia look forward to their home race at Monza.Quick GuideDutch F1 GP result and standingsShow1Oscar Piastri(Aus) McLaren 1hr 38mins 29.849sec2Max Verstappen(Ned) Red Bull +1.2713Isack Hadjar(Fr) Racing Bulls +3.2334George Russell(GB) Mercedes +5.6545Alexander Albon(Tha) Williams +6.3276Oliver Bearman(GB) Haas +9.0447Lance Stroll(Can) Aston Martin +9.4978Fernando Alonso(Sp) Aston Martin +11.7099Yuki Tsunoda(Jpn) Red Bull +13.59710Esteban Ocon(Fr) Haas +14.06311Franco Colapinto(Arg) Alpine +14.51112Liam Lawson(NZ) Racing Bulls +17.06313Carlos Sainz Jr(Sp) Williams +17.37614Nico Hülkenberg(Ger) Sauber +19.72515Gabriel Bortoleto(Br) Sauber +21.56516Kimi Antonelli(It) Mercedes +22.02917Pierre Gasly(Fr) Alpine +23.629DNFLando Norris (GB) McLaren, Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari, Lewis Hamilton (GB) FerrariFastest lap: Piastri 1:12.271 on lap 60Drivers' championship1 Piastri 309pts, 2 Norris 275, 3 Verstappen (Ned) 205, 4 Russell 184, 5 Leclerc 151, 6 Hamilton 109, 7 Antonelli 64, 8 Albon 64, 9 Hülkenberg 37, 10 Hadjar 37, 11 Stroll 32, 12 Alonso  30, 13 Ocon 28, 14  Gasly 20, 15 Lawson 20, 16 Bearman 16, 17 Sainz Jr 16, 18 Bortoleto 14, 19 Tsunoda 12, 20 Colapinto 0, 21 Doohan 0Constructors' championship1 McLaren 584pts, 2 Ferrari 260, 3 Mercedes 248, 4 Red Bull 214, 5 Williams 80, 6 Aston Martin 62, 7 Racing Bulls 60, 8 Sauber 51, 9 Haas F1 44, 10 Alpine 20Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Hamilton has known similar set­backs before and is no stranger to overcoming them, old enough and experienced enough to move onwards and, he doubtless hopes, upwards. But Norris – in his first real head-to-head title fight – must now draw deep and steel ­himself to these slings and arrows, even as ­Piastri took a mighty step toward the title.Hamilton’s woes were further compounded more than three hours after the race when the stewards gave him a five-place grid penalty for the Italian Grand Prix, for failing to slow for waved yellow flags on his reconnaissance laps to the grid before the race had even begun.Max Verstappen took second for Red Bull, while Isack Hadjar was third for Racing Bulls – his first podium and a superb result in his rookie season.George Russell was fourth for Mercedes and Alex Albon fifth for Williams.

They are the last team in England’s top four divisions yet to score a league goal this season.A highly underwhelming summer’s transfer window was compounded by yet another disappointing result against Palace. We will never know whether Emiliano Martínez would have saved Guéhi’s peach of a shot as Villa’s regular goalkeeper was unavailable for selection amid reports of Manchester United’s renewed interest.Dominik Szoboszlai’s wonder strike sinks Arsenal and sends Liverpool topRead moreUnai Emery confirmed the World Cup winner was too distracted to play. “We need the players focused 100%,” the Villa manager said. “He wasn’t.” Emery did confirm there had been no bid from United. “He was not available. Tomorrow is the line and we will see how we finish it.”Emery also conceded that Martínez’s situation has contributed to Villa’s poor start. “It’s not helping us. This is one of the circumstances we are having now not helping, but tomorrow, we’ll see. I am confident after tomorrow for we are going to try to manage the group we will have.”The Palace fans serenaded their potentially departing hero by singing “Marc Guéhi, I wanna know how you scored that goal” after their captain followed a run out from defence by curling home a beautiful shot into the top corner for 2-0 midway through the second half. If the England defender is leaving for Liverpool on Monday, then what a way to sign off.Oliver Glasner conceded that it is up to Steve Parish, the Palace chairman, whether the club give in to “temptation” and accept Liverpool’s bid for the England player who has entered the last year of his contract. “We need to keep Marc if we want to have a successful season,” the Palace manager said. “We had a meeting in March and we have an agreement that we sell Marc if we have the right replacement in. There’s no replacement in the building so it’s clear one part of the agreement is not fulfilled.“I know if we don’t sell Marc, he would accept it because he loves Crystal Palace. It’s all about Crystal Palace’s future, about this season. We have such great times, maybe the most successful in the club’s history. And Marc is not just a small part of the puzzle.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr heads Crystal Palace’s third goal from close range.Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images“But I don’t have the final decision. You know about Adam and Eve and the apple? The whole situation is tempting. If you want to progress, we have to keep him. If we accept the offer, maybe falling a step back, we say OK.”Palace dispatched Villaby this scoreline at Wembley before winning the FA Cup final in May in a run of 14 games unbeaten, their best such run as a top-flight club. They have won five and drawn one of their last six games with these opponents over the past two years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Emery is convinced the bad vibes will dissipate once the transfer window shuts and the players return for their away games at Everton and Sunderland before commencing on their Europa League campaign.Though Villa fielded a very offensive team, once Palace went ahead their fogginess re-emerged. Youri Tielemans could have headed home after corners at either end of the first half, but it was Jean-Philippe Mateta’s penalty that established the tone after Marco Bizot, the Dutch goalkeeper signed from Brest in the summer, felled Daichi Kamada. Only Mohamed Salah (13) has scored morePremier Leaguegoals than Mateta’s 11 since the start of this year.Villa regained the ascendancy before succumbing to Guéhi’s gambit. The Palace captain started the move from deep in his own half before playing the ball wide to Kamada. When Kamada then won a loose ball off John McGinn, the England defender curled a sumptuous shot into the far top corner.Palace’s win was rounded off when Maxence Lacroix headed on Jefferson Lerma’s long throw and, at the far post, Ismaïla Sarr nodded in. “Aston Villa, it’s happened again”, sang the triumphant travelling fans, thoroughly enjoying their 270-mile round trip on a Sunday night.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Jackson is due to return to London but is understood to be disappointed with how the situation has played out. Enzo Maresca, the Chelsea head coach, may face a challenge to lift the forward’s spirits when he rejoins the squad after the international break.It had seemed Jackson was set for a new challenge when he was given permission to fly to Munich on Saturday after Bayern reached an agreement on a loan with an option to buy for €65m (£56m). However, Chelsea contacted the German club to inform them that they wouldnot permit the deal to go aheadafter Liam Delap sustained a hamstring injury against Fulham later in the day.Yoane Wissa urges Brentford to ‘keep their word’ and allow him to leaveRead moreDelap is due to have a second scan this week and although it is hoped that the damage is not severe enough to require surgery the striker is expected to be out for at least eight weeks.Maresca is reluctant to proceed with only one fit striker given his team’s packed schedule over the next two months. However, Chelsea’s instruction for Jackson to return to London on Saturday afternoon fell on deaf ears at first. The Senegal international remained in Bavaria with his representatives, who spent much of Sunday trying to find a solution with Bayern.But with Chelsea willing to consider only a permanent deal, the Bundesliga champions walked away from talks over Jackson last night. Bayern, who spent heavily 12 months ago, only wanted a loan and are moving on to other targets.Chelsea were willing to let Jackson leave after buying João Pedro and Delap this summer. Jackson, who has scored 24 goals in 65 Premier League appearances, has dropped down the pecking order and asked to leave in August. He has also been targeted by Aston Villa, Newcastle, Napoli and Juventus. It remains to be seen if anyone moves for Jackson before the transfer window shuts on Monday night. Newcastle could be an option if they sell Alexander Isak to Liverpool.Chelsea have considered contingency plans in the unlikely event of Jackson leaving. They are looking at permanent deals rather than loans and have made inquiries about a number of forwards, including Sporting Lisbon’s Conrad Harder. However, they have reached an agreement to recall Marc Guiu from his loan at Sunderland.Harder, a 20-year-old Danish forward, joined Sporting from Nordsjælland last year and has scored six goals in 32 league appearances. RB Leizpig have been linked with Harder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Doing so for the WSL newbiesLondon City Lionessesis nigh-on impossible because they have undergone a complete squad overhaul. A staggering 15 players have come in (with two then going out on loan) and 11 have exited. Change isn’t limited to the pitch either, with the training ground in flux, buildings coming down and going up as the club try to turn Cobdown Park in Aylesford into an environment fit for elite professionals.There isn’t a precedent set by another promoted club that would give us an indication of the side’s potential because no promoted team have had the level of investment that London City have had pumped in this summer. They are an anomaly, powered by the investment of their billionaire owner, Michele Kang.The ambition is high. As Kang said to Sky Sports at the end of last season: “We have been building a team to be at a minimum, on day one, mid-tier WSL”.The five-time Champions League winning midfielderSaki Kumagai, who joined Kang’s project in January, echoed that sentiment last week. “For us, it’s not about staying in the WSL, though of course we want to, but it’s about pushing towards that top three or four so the following season we can start pushing for Champions League qualification,” she said.The task will be stitching together a patchwork quilt of players. London City have signed some big names, in Daniëlle van de Donk, Nikita Parris, Katie Zelem and others, who join players such as Kumagai and the Swedish forward Kosovare Asllani, but these are arguably players closer to the end of their careers than the start. Marrying that experience with the young talents who have joined into a team capable of competing in the league consistently is a big ask, but the quality is there.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerJocelyn Prêcheur was poached by Kang from Paris Saint-Germain in 2024. He had taken the reins there after his father, Gérard Prêcheur, departed, stepping up from being an assistant coach. That was the second time 43-year-old had worked with his father, having assisted him at Jiangsu Suning in the Chinese Super League. He won his first and only trophy with PSG in 2024, the Coupe de France, and helped guide London City to the Championship (now WSL2) title in his first season. The test gets harder in the WSL but having gelled a side capable of helping the club achieve their objective of reaching the WSL he has shown he can get new players working together.View image in fullscreenJocelyn Precheur helped guide London City to the Championship title in his first season as manager.Photograph: Molly Darlington/The FA/Getty ImagesOff-field pictureThe purchase and redevelopment of their 28-acre training facility is symbolic of Kang’s commitment towards her growing women’s football empire – with Washington Spirit and Lyon also owned by the billionaire. Kang has made clear she is not expecting short-term returns on these investments, though she sees the potential for profit in the long term given the trajectory of the women’s game. London City’s promotion on the final day of the season was justification for the investment. A mid-table finish this season would do that further.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How about one with experience and one rising in Van de Donk and Jana Fernández respectively. The Dutch midfielder Van de Donk returns to London, where she won the FA Cup, League Cup and WSL title with Arsenal, after four years and eight trophies, including a Champions League with Lyon. Fernández represents the desire to build a squad with a future, the 23-year-old defender recruited from Barcelona, where she was part of a squad that won three Champions Leagues.Stepping upIsobel Goodwin returns to the WSL after leaving Aston Villa for Coventry United in January 2023 having made three top-flight appearances. After six months with Coventry she joined Sheffield United and her 15 goals in 19 games for the Blades caught the eye of promotion-hungry London City. Last season she scored 16 times in 18 games as London City battled their way to the title. How will she fare on her return to the WSL and with star-studded signings providing for her? It’s an exciting prospect.It was a good summer for …With London City spending big, selling clubs have probably had the best summer. A host of their new squad competed at the 2025 Euros this summer, though with England emerging victorious none will have walked away particularly happy. The 20-year-old Freya Godfrey made her loan move permanent this summer, having spent time with Ipswich and Charlton on loan from Arsenal before spending last season with London City. The young midfielder scored in a 3-1 friendly defeat by Lyon in August.Main initiative to attract more fansAttracting fans is one of London City’s biggest challenges. As an independent club, unconnected to a men’s team, they have no existing fanbase to pull from, unless some Millwall Lionesses fans switched across when the women’s team broke away from the club in 2019. Playing at Princes Park in Dartford hasn’t helped. A move to Bromley’s Hayes Lane has come with attempts to build a local fanbase, and investment is being made in the matchday experience. The club have also connected with about 40 local girls’ teams across London, who have become sister clubs.Explore more on these topicsLondon City LionessesWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I asked them to accelerate, and they did a great job. It was fantastic teamwork, and I’m very happy that I was able to finish it off,” the 28-year-old Dane said.The Norwegian Træen, who had fallen behind the peloton during the climb, launched a late attack in the final 3km to finish 1min 46sec behind Vingegaard, retaining the red jersey.During the stage there were several failed attempts to break away early on until Michel Hessmann, Liam Slock, Michal Kwiatkowski, Archie Ryan and Kevin Vermaerke formed a leading group, building a 2min gap around the 70km mark.The riders faced heavy rain about 120km into the stage, and the peloton maintained the gap to the leaders before rapidly closing distance with the breakaway five in the final 30km.Lidl-Trek riders Carlos Verona and Andrea Bagioli attempted to lead out their teammate Giulio Ciccone early on the climb, but Vingegaard stayed on their heels before launching an attack with 11km to go.Italy’s Ciccone could not keep up the chase, while Briton Pidcock (Q36.5) and Portugal’s Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) charged ahead to finish on the podium.Almeida sits third in the general classification, 1min 15sec behind Træen. Pidcock is fourth, 20sec behind Almeida. Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) remained at the top of the points classification, retaining the green jersey. The race continues after a rest day with a 175.3km ride from Arguedas to El Ferial Larra Belagua on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingJonas VingegaardnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a rare concession in response to mounting public anger.By Monday, “lawmakers will see certain allowances scrapped and overseas work trips suspended under a new moratorium,” Prabowo said.Police set up checkpoints across Jakarta on Monday, with more protest gatherings planned in several locations around Indonesia’s vast archipelago. A police spokesperson told broadcaster Kompas TV that officers were also patrolling the city to “protect” citizens and give a sense of security.Police had deployed a convoy of armoured cars and motorbikes to parliament late on Sunday, in a show of force to warn off protesters.The defence minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, a close ally of Prabowo, warned on Sunday that the military and police would take “firm action” against “rioters and looters”, after the house of the finance minister was pillaged.In anticipation of further unrest, TikTok on Saturday temporarily suspended its live feature for “a few days” in Indonesia, where it has more than 100m users.Fire kills three people in Indonesia after protesters torch council buildingsRead moreAfter nationwide protests escalated across the world’s third-largest democracy last week, Prabowo during the weekend summoned the country’s prominent figures and cancelled a high-profile trip to China. He met 16 religious figures and eight political leaders, including former president Megawati Sukarnopurti, the chair of the country’s only formal opposition party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle.Five days of protests began in Jakarta on Monday, sparked by reports that all 580 lawmakers receive amonthly housing allowance of 50m rupiah($3,075) in addition to their salaries. The allowance, introduced last year, is almost 10 times the Jakarta minimum wage.View image in fullscreenPresident Prabowo Subianto meets the family of Affan Kurniawan, a ride-hailing driver Affan Kurniawan who was run over and killed by police during protests in Jakarta on Thursday.Photograph: BPMI Presidential Secretariat/Cahyo/Sutantaaditya.com/ShutterstockCritics argue the new allowance is not only excessive but also insensitive at a time when most people are grappling with soaring living costs and taxes and rising unemployment.The protests grew wider and more violent after the death of 21-year-old ride-hailing driver Affan Kurniawan. A video on social media apparently showing his death during a rally in Jakarta on Thursday shocked the nation and spurred an outcry against the security forces.Kurniawan was reportedly completing a food delivery order when he was caught in the clash. Witnesses told local television that the armoured car from the National Police’s mobile brigade unit suddenly sped through the crowd of demonstrators and hit Kurniawan, causing him to fall. Instead of stopping, the car ran over him.Prabowo said police are investigating seven officers over the incident.The death toll from riots that broke out in multiple cities rose to six after the Amikom Yogyakarta University confirmed the death of 21-year-old student Rheza Sendy Pratama in protests on Friday. The circumstances around his death remain unclear.At least three people were killed in the eastern city of Makassar on Friday after a fire was started by protesters at a council building.Another victim died in Makassar on Friday after he was beaten by a mob on suspicion that he was an intelligence officer, local disaster agency official Muhammad Fadli Tahar told Agence France-Presse on Sunday.Prabowo reiterated that his government respects freedom of expression as guaranteed in Indonesia’s constitution and international conventions.“But when demonstrations turn anarchic, destroying public facilities, endangering lives, and attacking private homes or public institutions, this becomes a serious violation of law,” he said.Prabowo cautioned that violent acts risked veering into treason and terrorism, and warned “the state would not tolerate attempts to destabilise the country”.The former general further called on the public to express their aspirations in a peaceful and constructive manner, and promised their voices will be heard.“I sincerely ask all citizens to trust the government and remain calm,” Prabowo said, adding his government “is determined to always fight for the interests of the people and the nation.”Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaPrabowo SubiantoAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Passengers will be able to travel without planning or booking journeys in advance.The technology, which has previously been tested in Switzerland, Denmark and Scotland, is being piloted in England first on East Midlands Railway services between Leicester, Derby andNottingham, with trials to be extended to Northern Trains in Yorkshire from the end of the month. Up to 4,000 passengers are expected to take part in the pilots.The DfT said the scheme demonstrated its commitment to improving the passenger experience and trialling innovative technology to save time and money.The rail minister, Peter Hendy, said: “The railway ticketing system is far too complicated and long overdue an upgrade to bring it into the 21st century. Through these trials we’re doing just that, and making buying tickets more convenient, more accessible and more flexible.“By putting passenger experience at the heart of our decision-making, we’re modernising fares and ticketing and making it simpler and easier for people to choose rail.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Voter fraud is incredibly rare and voter ID laws have beenshownto disproportionately impact minorities, low-income individuals and disabled voters.“As many as 11 percent of eligible voters do not have the kind of ID that is required by states with strict ID requirements, and that percentage is even higher among seniors, minorities, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students,” the Brennan Center for Justicestates.Aprevious attemptby Trump to require proof of citizenship to vote wasblockedby a federal judge in June 2025, as the law risked disenfranchising millions of Americans who don’t have passports, may not have easy access to birth certificates, and millions of married women with name changes may not have citizenship documents with their current legal name.Enforcement would likelyaffecttens of millions of Americans every election cycle who vote for the first time or update their voter registration information.

That is why I am calling time on this unilateral act of economic disarmament and Labour’s impossible ideology of net zero by 2050.“So, a future Conservative government will scrap all mandates for the North Sea beyond maximising extraction.“It is time that common sense, economic growth and our national interest came first, and only theConservativeswill deliver that. We are going to get all our oil and gas out of the North Sea.”Last month, the energy and net zero secretary,Ed Miliband, accused the Conservatives of being “anti-science”by abandoning a political consensus on net zero.In the first of what is promised to be an annual “state of the climate” report, the Labour MP set out the findings of a Met Office-led study that detailed how the UK was already hotter and wetter, and faced a greater number of extreme weather events.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Plastic sachets will be allowed but the government hopes bulk bottles or dispensers will be used in sushi shops instead.The South Australian environment minister, Dr Susan Close, said each plastic fish container was used for just seconds but “their small size means they’re easily dropped, blown away, or washed into drains, making them a frequent component of beach and street litter”.Fruit stickers are annoying and bad for the environment. So why did an Australian ban come unstuck?Read more“They’re a ‘convenience packaging’ item that can be replaced with bulk or refillable condiment solutions or more manageable alternatives, meaning their elimination directly reduces the volume of single-use plastic entering the waste stream,” Close said.Other single-use plastic items included in the ban are plastic cutlery and expanded polystyrene food packaging, such as pre-packed instant bowl noodles.Dr Nina Wootton, a marine ecologist at the University of Adelaide, said plastic sushi fish are more damaging because they could be mistaken for food by marine life.“If it hasn’t already been broken down into microplastics yet and it’s floating around in its whole form, then other organisms that eat fish that size could think it is a fish and then eat it,” Wootton said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The export of our world-leading Type 26 frigates will do exactly that, supporting well-paid jobs up and down the United Kingdom, from apprentices to engineers.”It is estimated that the shipbuilding programme will support 432 businesses, including 103 in Scotland, 47 in the north-west of England and 35 in the West Midlands.The deal also signals a strengthening of a long-term strategic relationship withNorway, as part of which a combined fleet of 13 frigates will operate jointly in northern Europe.Eight of the frigates will be British and “at least” five will be Norwegian, with the joint operation designed to “significantly strengthen Nato’s northern flank”.“This historic defence deal deepens our strategic partnership,” saidJohn Healey, the defence secretary. “With Norway, we will train, operate, deter and – if necessary – fight together. Our navies will work as one, leading the way in Nato, with this deal putting more world-class warships in the north Atlantic to hunt Russian submarines, protect our critical infrastructure and keep both our nations secure.”Concerns over critical infrastructure around Europe have been raised on multiple occasions in the last year, after thealleged sabotage of the Baltic gas pipeline and undersea internet cablesbetween Finland and Estonia.‘There’s a bit of a queue forming’: how UK firms are enticing buyers for the next generation of fighter jetsRead moreNorway was the only other country to participate in the UK carrier strike group’s full deployment this year, and it also collaborates with the UK and Nato partners to safeguard critical undersea infrastructure in northern Europe.“Norway and the United Kingdom are close allies with common interests and strong bilateral ties,” said Jonas Gahr Støre, Norway’s prime minister. “I am confident that the strategic partnership with the UK for purchasing, developing and operating frigates is the right decision.”The Scottish secretary,Ian Murray, said the decision showed the “tremendous success” of Scotland’s shipbuilding industry and was an example of another “defence dividend” for the country.The Type 26 frigate features sophisticated weapons, and advanced sensors and communications. Its design enables the warship to be upgraded to “counter emerging threats”, according to the MoD’s statement announcing the deal.Charles Woodburn, the chief executive of BAE Systems, said: “The Norwegian government’s decision reflects its confidence in British industry’s ability to deliver a superior anti-submarine warfare platform, together with systems and equipment, that will support its future maritime security and reinforce its position within Nato.”Explore more on these topicsBAE SystemsNorwayDefence policyNatoMinistry of DefenceIan MurrayJohn HealeynewsShareReuse this content"

The latter has said France intends to recognise Palestine at the UN meeting.Starmer also spoke to Donald Trump before announcing his decision. The US president indicated the US would not object to such a move, but British officials are worried that his administration might retaliate by recognising Israeli jurisdiction over illegal settlements in the West Bank.Starmer’s conditions for Israel include taking “substantive steps” to end the war in Gaza, agreeing a ceasefire and committing not to annex parts of the West Bank.Far from taking steps towards satisfying any of those demands, however, Netanyahu has shown signs of violating them further.Reutersreportedthat Israel was considering annexation in the West Bank if France, the UK and other countries push ahead with recognising Palestine. Israeli officials said the subject was on the agenda for Netanyahu’s cabinet meeting on Sunday, but would not say where or when annexation could happen.The Foreign Office has just over a week to complete its formal assessment of Israel’s position. Senior government officials say the timing of the British recognition is being driven less by that process and more by diplomatic concerns that the government should be seen to be acting in concert with France.Lammy said on Sunday that the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where UN-backed expertsrecently declareda famine, was a “man-made catastrophe” caused by Israel’s refusal to let in aid deliveries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The home secretary then detained him in prison under immigration powers to remove him from the country and prevent him absconding in the meantime.After lawyers told the home secretary that the man did not understand what he was signing and did not want to withdraw his asylum application, Cooper reinstated his asylum claim.However, the high court heard, she “continued to detain” him, believing he could be removed from the country within weeks.In the judgment, the deputy high court judge Alan Bates said he was not satisfied it was reasonable for the home secretary to believe the claimant’s case would be dealt with quickly, given “the combination of the reinstated asylum claim and the accumulating indicators of the claimant’s psychosis”.In May a tribunal granted immigration bail to the claimant, which should have led to his release. Nonetheless, he remained in prison, more than 15 weeks on, because he had not been provided with “a suitable accommodation address in the community”, Judge Bates said.Concerning the claimant’s detention since he was granted bail, Bates said it was “arguable” that the home secretary “has not always acted with the appropriate diligence and … that this has led to the claimant remaining in detention for a longer time than necessary”.Bates, granting an interim order for the claimant’s release and permission to apply for a judicial review, which would determine whether his detention was unlawful, said it was “arguable that [Cooper’s] detention of the claimant … has, at least at times, been incompatible” with his right to liberty under article 5 of the Human Rights Act.Bates warned that a case for damages for unlawful detention could follow against the Home Office, adding: “Damages would not be an adequate remedy … especially so in the circumstances of this case, given that there is some evidence that detention may be worsening … [his] mental health.”Between July 2021 and April 2024 the claimant, believed to have entered the UK in a lorry at Dover, was under the care of mental health services and twice detained under the Mental Health Act.He was jailed in October 2024 for 18 months after travelling from asylum accommodation in Wolverhampton to Pitlochry, Scotland, where he threatened a shopkeeper with a broken bottle in an argument. His previous convictions included possessing a knife and assaulting an emergency worker.After his sentence in Scotland, he was detained at Brook House immigration removal centre in West Sussex, where concerns were raised that he might be a victim of torture and that detention would worsen his mental health.But in April of this year he was moved to HMP Lewes in East Sussex, apparently because his “erratic” behaviour could not be “adequately managed” at an immigration removal centre.Bates, in his judgment, said “in fairness” to the home secretary, the making of “appropriate arrangements” for the claimant’s release – considering his mental health, licence conditions and the immigration regime – were “not without practical complexities”.He added: “I bear in mind that [Cooper] accepts that the claimant must be released. What is preventing his release is the non-availability to him of suitable accommodation, which has been approved as suitable by his [social worker].”A further hearing concerning potential proceedings for damages for unlawful detention is expected to take place in October. The Home Office has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumYvette CooperHome OfficeLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The SCO is a 10-member bloc of Eurasian nations, and the summit is also being attended by the leaders of 16 observer or “dialogue partner” nations.Xi personally welcomed several leaders including the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Turkish president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, before the delegates attended a formal reception.Xi told the welcome reception that in the past century there had been a “significant increase in instability, uncertainty and unpredictable factors”, and that the SCO had become an “important force in promoting the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind”.Footage published by Russian state media showed Xi and Putin, who arrived in Tianjin with an entourage of senior politicians and business representatives, warmly greeting each other at a photocall before calling in an interpreter for a lengthy and animated conversation.Putin and several other attenders are expected to stay on for a military parade in Beijing on Wednesday to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which China refers to as the war of resistance against Japanese aggression. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, isalso expected to attend.The Tianjin summit is the largest held by the bloc since it was formed in 2001. The SCO is a key part of Beijing’s push for stronger multilateral alternatives to western or US-led blocs such as Nato.Putin told the Chinese state news agency Xinhua on Saturday that the SCO meeting would “consolidate solidarity” among the Eurasian nations and “help shape a fairer multipolar world order”.The goal appears to have been helped by the upheaval brought by Trump’s tariff regime and other foreign policy moves. Modi and Xi’s meeting took place five days after Washington imposed punishing 50% tariffs on Indian goods due to Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.It isModi’s first visit to China in seven years, and comesamid efforts by China and Indiato rebuild trade ties and resolve long-running Himalayan border disputes.“We are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities,” Modi said after meeting Xi.Xi said China-India ties could be “stable and far-reaching” if both sides focused on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, state media reported.In a meeting with Erdoğan, Xi said China and Turkey should strengthen cooperation in the area of counter-terrorism, according to Chinese state media. Xi also met leaders of the Maldives, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and the autocratic leader of Belarus,Alexander Lukashenko, a key ally of Putin.The bilateral talks were held at the Tianjin Guest House, an intimate venue surrounded by lush greenery. Large sections of Tianjin were closed to traffic and a significant police presence was deployed around the city.Lim Chuan-Tiong, a researcher with the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia at the University of Tokyo, said Putin and Xi meeting again was a sign of the continuation of their “limitless” partnership, and closing ranks while both deal with a common foe – the US.“As long as the mutual opponent [US] has not been defeated, China and Russia’s off-limits cooperation will remain,” Lim said. “Their cooperation also serves to highlight a global order that exists beyond the United States.”Moscow’s claims over Ukraine and its full invasion in 2022, as well as Beijing’s claim over Taiwan and threats to invade, have further isolated both governments from western and other democracies.Russian analysts have saidthe Ukraine war is now a main pillar of the bilateral relationship and that Moscow would want know how Beijing would respond if the US were to ask it to put pressure on Russia to end the fighting.“The longer the war [on Ukraine] drags on, the more Russia will need China’s assistance, whether economically or other forms,” Lim said. “China also recognises that it is unlikely for Sino-US relations to return to their pre-2018 state and thus has no choice but to accept a close alignment with Russia.”Beijing purports to take a neutral stance on the Ukraine war but has become an economic lifeline for Russia, and Ukraine has accused it of providing direct aid to Moscow’s campaign. The two countries have separately increased joint military drills.A Chinese academic who spoke on condition of anonymity said Moscow had expected more support from its ally but Beijing had been at pains to avoid further punitive sanctions.“China says there is ‘no limit’ but in practice it hesitates, constantly looking over its shoulder, wary of pressure from the west, the EU and Nato. It has never really taken Russia seriously – and Russia saw through this long ago,” the academic said.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingVladimir PutinRussiaNarendra ModiIndiaRecep Tayyip ErdoğannewsShareReuse this content"

At least 11 UN personnel were detained.”He demanded that they be “immediately and unconditionally” released.Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme (WFP), earlier told the Associated Press that security forces raided the agencies’ offices in the Houthi-controlled capital Sana’a on Sunday morning.She said at least one staff member was detained in the city and others reportedly detained in other areas.“WFP reiterates that the arbitrary detention of humanitarian staff is unacceptable,” Etefa said.The offices of the World Health Organization and Unicef were also raided, according to a UN official and a Houthi official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The UN official said armed forces raided the offices and questioned employees in the car park. He said contact with several other WFP and Unicef staff members were lost and that they were likely also detained.Israeli strikes hit Yemen’s capital in retaliation for earlier Houthi attacksRead moreAmmar Ammar, a spokesperson for Unicef, said a number of the agency’s staff members were detained, and it was seeking additional information from theHouthis.Both Etefa and Ammar said their agencies were conducting “a comprehensive head count” of their employees in Sana’a and other Houthi-held areas.The raids were the latest in a long-running Houthi crackdown against the UN and other international organisations working in rebel-held areas in Yemen.They have detained dozens of UN staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the now-closed US embassy in Sana’a. The UN suspended its operations in the Houthi stronghold of Saada in northern Yemen after the rebels detained eight UN staff members in January.Sunday’s raids came after the killing of the Houthi prime minister and several of his cabinet members in an Israeli strike on Thursday.It was a blow to the Iran-backed rebels who have launched attacks on Israel and ships in the Red Sea in relation against the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The missile, which the Houthis said was aimed at Ben Gurion airport, prompted air raid sirens across central Israel and Jerusalem, forcing millions into shelters.The Houthis are likely to escalate their attacks on Israel and ships in the Red Sea, after they vowed in July to target merchant ships belonging to any company that does business with Israeli ports, regardless of nationality.“Our military approach of targeting the Israeli enemy, whether with missiles, drones or a naval blockade, is continuous, steady and escalating,” al-Houthi, the group’s secretive leader, said in a televised speech on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsYemenHouthisUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Recently, the White Houserequestedthat a US military base on the outskirts of Chicago assist with immigration operations as theTrump administrationplans a broadertakeoverof Democratic-run “sanctuary cities”.Pritzker, a Democrat, told CBS on Sunday: “Any kind of troops on the streets of an American city don’t belong unless there is an insurrection, unless there is truly an emergency. There is not … I’m going to do everything I can to stop him from taking away people’s rights and from using the military to invade states. I think it’s very important for us all to stand up.”Chicago mayor signs executive order directing city to resist Trump’s immigration raidsRead morePritzker spoke after Trump on Saturday took to Truth Social to rant about Pritzker and Chicago, saying: “JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor ofIllinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming!”Meanwhile, Pritzker said that no one from theTrump administrationhas contacted his team, the city of Chicago or any other local officials.In his interview with CBS, he said: “It’s clear that they’re secretly planning this. If they actually send in US troops, it would amount to an invasion. They should be coordinating with local law enforcement, telling us when and where they’re coming, and whether it’s Ice, ATF, or another agency. But they’re not doing that. And I have to say, it’s disruptive and dangerous. It stirs up tension on the ground when we’re left in the dark and can’t coordinate with them.”Pritzker also pushed back against accusations from Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, who said that Illinois “refuses to have our back”.“That’s not true,” he said, adding: “There were police officers who made sure that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the Ice officials that were here … People have a right to their first amendment … and we protect that too in the city ofChicago… We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of our city and by the way, we’re succeeding at that job, but when they bring people in and don’t coordinate with us, they’re going to cause enormous problems.”Pritzker continued: “If he wants to send troops, he should call. I’ve been very clear about what it is that we’d like help with. But, instead, he’s talking about sending troops. Nobody’s called, literally nobody from the White House … If they actually wanted to help, they might call and say, what help do you need? … I don’t know why they haven’t bothered to reach out if they have plans of their own, but honestly, we’d be happy to receive a call.”The governor also accused Trump of having “other aims, other than fighting crime”, pointing out the handful of Democratic cities that have been the target of Trump’simmigration crackdowns, includingWashington DCandLos Angeles.White House seeks to use Chicago-area military base for ‘sanctuary cities’ crackdownRead more“The other aims are that he’d like to stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections. He’ll just claim that there’s some problem with an election, and then he’s got troops on the ground that can take control if, in fact, he’s allowed to do this. We have sovereignty,” Pritzker said.With an imminent federal crackdown in Chicago expected to take place as soon as the end of this week, Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson,signedan executive order on Saturday in an effort to push back against the White House’s “out of control” plan to deploy federal troops into the city.The new order bars Chicago police from aiding federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or related patrols, as well as traffic stops and checkpoints during the crackdown.Johnson also ordered all city departments to protect the constitutional rights of the city’s residents “amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or national guard deployment by the federal government”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationChicagoUS immigrationDonald TrumpUS politicsIllinoisDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the seat he found a handgun.The pistol looked strange. It was made almost entirely of plastic – half white, half black.The mechanic didn’t know it but the car belonged to a street-level drug trafficker who’d come down from Sydney seeking “fast money” slinging meth across Canberra’s suburbs.The gun had been made by an associate with a 3D printer, according to court documents. It was untraceable and lethal, and part of a trend that experts say threatens to fundamentally upendAustralia’s world-leading gun controls.View image in fullscreenThis 3D-printed pistol was found under a car seat by a mechanicAndrew Hemming, an expert in criminal law at the University of Southern Queensland, says the laws on 3D-printed firearms are a “dog’s breakfast”.‘Blindsided’: father of Port Arthur massacre victims says NSW hunting bill will take a ‘jackhammer’ to gun controlRead moreManufacturing or possessing any type of firearm without a licence is illegal across Australia but specific laws on 3D printing vary between the states.Some have criminalised the manufacture of 3D-printed weapons or owning blueprints while others rely on existing firearm laws.Hemming says the united action Australia took to tighten gun laws after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, in which 35 people were murdered, is now coming undone.Q&AHow did Australia change its gun laws after the Port Arthur massacre?ShowAfter the 1996 mass shooting in Port Arthur that killed 35 people, the Australian government enacted thenational firearms agreement.The deal between the federal and state governments aimed to make gun laws broadly uniform across states and territories. It introduced mandatory licensing, rules for secure storage and use, and restrictions on semiautomatic rifles and pump action shotguns.There was a buyback scheme for guns that were now classed as illegal. Australians could voluntarily give up weapons in exchange for financial compensation – leading to the surrender of more than 600,000 firearms.Owners would also need a “genuine reason” for having guns, such as hunting or sports shooting, and personal protection was not a valid reason. The agreement specifically states that firearm possession is a privilege, not a right.This sets Australia apart from other countries, most notably the United States, where a right to bear arms is included in its constitution. US Congress and state legislatures have passed some gun control measures, including mandated background checks but, unlike Australia, most states have not banned assault weapons.Gun ownership in the UK is also considered a privilege, not a right, and new laws have similarly responded to mass shootings, including the 1987 Hungerford massacre. Certain semiautomatic rifles were banned and police must consider reasons for ownership before issuing a licence.The effectiveness of Australia’s gun control measures remain a matter of debate, and some elements are yet to be fully enacted almost 30 years later, including the nationwide firearms register.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We all got together after Port Arthur and everybody pulled together with the ban [on some semi-automatic and pump-action firearms] and the buyback,” he says.“Well, the reality is … if anybody can make one, the sands have shifted and it’s only a question of time.”More sophisticated and more lethalThe firearm found in Canberra resembled images of a popular 3D-printed pistol model known as the Harlot, court documents say. According to numerous online communities that celebrate and promote 3D-printed guns, the Harlot is entry-level.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“It’s quick, and cheap to print, easy to assemble, and the hardware required to complete the build is readily available,” one website hosting instructional material says.But more reliable and more deadly models are now showing up.Det Supt John Watson, commander of the drug and firearms squad in New South Wales police state crime command and the head of the national illicit firearm working group, says police have been uncovering 3D-printed weapons for more than a decade.Over the past three to four years the trend has been from “very novice, very low-powered, almost a one-shot weapon” to higher-quality weapons, he says.In 2025 police say they have so far made seizures of homemade firearms in almost every state and territory.In one suburban home police allege they found 3D printers as well as 3D-printed pistols, magazines and firearm parts.The stash allegedly included a 3D-printed semi-automatic carbine in parts, commonly known online as the Urutau.The blueprints of the Urutau were released online only last year but already components have allegedly been found during police raids in multiple states.In another case, police allegedly found a “Nutty 9” firearm – a spin-off of the FGC-9 – and a 3D-printed pistol as well as the digital blueprint for the manufacture of firearms.Images released by police show a vast array of components allegedly found during the raid, including an incomplete Urutau.Gun parts in the postRajan Basra, a researcher at King’s College London, says the 3D-printed gun world has become a “social movement”.The Urutau and other models, including perhaps the most infamous 3D-printed firearm, the FGC-9 – or “Fuck Gun Control” – emerge from online communities that share information and promote the creation of weapons both as a means to push the boundaries of science and, according to some designers, “permanently undermine global firearm prohibition”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The packages were allegedly described as “pipes” or “high pressure oil pipe”, according to court documents. Police allege they were “unfinished firearm barrels”.Some groups promote what they call a “new second amendment”, according to Dr Yannick Veilleux-Lepage, an associate professor at the Royal Military College of Canada. Broadly, this is the belief that the right to bear arms is universal, not just part of the US constitution.“This all falls within the same movement, which is essentially trying to push the boundaries of privately manufactured firearms,” he says. “The main impact here is the erosion of state control on firearms.”Worried? ‘Build one yourself’It’s unclear how many 3D-printed guns are being seized in Australia each year (there is no centralised record), yet an examination of court documents suggests various models are emerging, created both by hobbyists and those intending to use them for criminal purposes.Australia’s gun lobby says it’s ‘winning’ the fight against firearm control as numbers surgeRead moreIn 2023 a man was sentenced in Melbourne for possessing a traffickable quantity of firearms, six of which were 3D-printed handguns, court documents show, including 0.22 rimfire calibre pistols, as well as aggravated carjacking, among other charges.Some suggest 3D-printed firearms may not be popular among cohorts linked to organised crime, because of a lack of reliability and their aesthetic. “They communicate to other people that you’re not able to source a conventional firearm,” Veilleux-Lepage says.But this could change. Some popular models, such as the “Not-a-Glock”, he says, look like a conventional firearm and are cheap to build.Extremist groups that might not otherwise be able to easily access the illicit market also pose a threat.“Over the last few years … it’s very typical for the gun blueprints to be shared by far-right influencers, along with the instructional material and incitement for followers to make guns at home,” says Basra,who unmaskedthe man behind the FGC-9 as the already deceased German citizen Jacob Duygu.View image in fullscreenJacob Duygu with an FGC-9.Photograph: HCPP Hackers CongressArtem Vasilyevwas sentenced to at least three years in jail in the South Australian supreme court in 2024after pleading guilty to more than a dozen firearm offences.In his sentencing remarks the judge referred to a report prepared by a forensic psychologist, which said Vasilyev “was in the process of becoming radicalised” and had material “espousing extremist rightwing ideologies” on his electronic devices.The court heardthat a plastic tub containing 3D-printed gun parts that could be used to make a FGC-9 firearm was found in his home.In a NSW hearing about whether to put in place an extended supervision order, the court heard how a man who had shared extremist beliefs was found to have downloaded hundreds of 3D-printing files for a number of firearms.Urutau’s anonymous originator, who goes by the handle Joseph the Parrot, was asked on a podcast this year about extremists using his design.“I mean, I don’t support them but if they build a gun I can’t do anything about that,” he said.“If you are upset about a white supremacist building a Urutau, you can build one yourself to counter him.”Explore more on these topicsGun controlOff targetGun crimeCrime - AustraliaLaw (Australia)Far rightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So why did they vanish into obscurity?Damian BarrSun 31 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTShareThe world is burning. Fascism is rising. Countries are falling. And we’re on the brink of incredible technological change, which will either be the end of everything or a new beginning. So, who needs artists?An August night in 1944. Robert Colquhoun’s hand shakes as he lights a candle in the blacked-out Notting Hill studio shared with his lover, fellow artist, Robert “Bobby” MacBryde. They are known – from Soho alleys to Bond Street galleries – as the Two Roberts: inseparable, incandescent, often in trouble. Where is Bobby tonight? The Colony Room Club, probably. Safe, Robert hopes. Though never from himself. Bombers prowl the skies above. Who will survive the night? “Fuck it,” Robert mutters, fag dancing on his lip. And he picks up his brush.The Two Roberts were real, though in my new novel I’ve reimagined them as literary characters – putting flesh on biographical bones. Two young Scotsmen on the make, with boot-black hair, talent matched only by ambition, generosity surpassed only by thirst. Robert Colquhoun and Bobby MacBryde were born in Ayrshire just before the first world war, meeting at Glasgow School ofArt(GSA) in 1933 then becoming stars as the bombs fell. They were the original “Golden Boys of Bond Street”: nicknamed MacBraque and McPicasso, which they pretended not to love. Photographed in Vogueand filmed by Ken Russell, they were twin suns. Everybody else was in their orbit, if they were lucky.At one of their weekend-long studio parties at 77 Bedford Gardens you could share a whisky with Elizabeth Smart, birl with boys from the Royal Ballet or strain to hear Dylan Thomas over the music. Somehow, despite rationing, there was always plenty to eat and drink and smoke. Bobby could feed the five thousand with one fish. Robert was a beguilingly brooding host. You could feast on the gossip for weeks. Smart would later employ them at Tilty Mill in Essex as live-in nannies for her four children with George Barker, the poet she fictionalised in By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept. They knew everybody and had everything then suddenly they had nothing and almost nobody and then they were gone. Robert dead at 47. Bobby, never far behind, at 52.Glasgow School of Art awarded them a joint travelling scholarship, sending them around Europe a step ahead of HitlerWho were they? How did they blaze such a trail? And why are they now barely remembered?Growing up in Maybole, South Ayrshire, Bobby worked in a boot factory to save for tuition, convinced he’d get into the big art school in nearby-but-faraway Glasgow. In Kilmarnock, Robert was taken out of school by his father then returned on a scholarship by a minister who saw potential in the meticulous drawings his father envied. They were first in their families to get to university. In my novel I have them meet on their first day – each seeing something secret in the other.At the GSA they won every prize, the greatest being each other. Knowing the prodigy pair would only split any money, the GSA awarded them a joint travelling scholarship, sending them around Europe just a step ahead of Hitler. They survived street encounters with Blackshirts, sketched Michelangelos in Rome, got a taste for wine and had their eyes opened by Picasso’s Guernica in Paris. Their travel diaries, held in the GSA archives, smoulder with drawings of hot young priests.I fell in love with Bobby and Robert during lockdown. I saw a tweet of a painting of Two Women Sewing and the blue of the cloth stopped me – who made this? Bobby. Next I found Robert’s Grieving Women. These were great artists, great Scots, why were they not up there with Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the Glasgow Boys andthat ministerice-skating on a million shortbread tins?Bobby becomes famous for his not-very-still still lifes – apples and pears dancing out their bowl, fish flapping on a plate. He offers the viewer a glimpse of rationed deliciousness and a secret taste of what he’s cooking for his man. Robert becomes famous for his mysterious and often tragic portraits – mask-like faces contorted in the mystery of mourning, often a pair of figures holding each other: one with his long face and the other Bobby’s low brow. They are pioneering a radical queer domesticity.I stumbled across them as footnotes in the biographies of people who used to want to be them. Soho survivors claim Francis Bacon is supposed to have said “Everything I learned about drawing, I learned from Robert Colquhoun.” Endless enraging articles describe them as “friends” or “roommates”: polite closeting elisions, more final than any coffin. When Bobby was 27 he wrote to Robert: “We must be certain to create our legends before we die.” By the time I discovered them they were almost forgotten. Could fictionalising them bring them back?View image in fullscreenMacBryde and Colquhoun in London, 1951.Photograph: Baron/Getty ImagesObsessing, I found them in an issue of the Picture Post from 1949 with Prunella Clough, Keith Vaughan, Patrick Heron and John Minton (Minty). Rich Minty was in love with Robert and would eventually move into their studio, making a couple a throuple – that’s a fun chapter. The Roberts’ interview is titled The Artists Who Live, Travel, Work and Exhibit Together. The photo, by Felix Man, shows them at their easels in matching shirts and ties. Robert is in a fisherman’s jumper probably knitted by Bobby who made most of their clothes, ironing Robert’s shirts with a spoon heated on their single gas ring. On the easels are Bobby’s Woman in a Red Hat and Robert’s Two Scotswomen – both bought by Alfred Barr, the first director of the Museum of Metropolitan Art and sadly no relation. On a mission to acquire the best young British artists, Barr’s other purchases were Bacon, Edward Burra and Lucian Freud.Looking at Man’s photo I found myself imagining the rest of their studio-high windows capturing pale north light and looking over to the glossy magnolia tree still growing in the garden opposite. Savouring the smell of pencil shavings and linseed oil. Wondering at the audacity of two young men building an illegal and illicit life in this one room. Finally standing outside their studio felt like completing a pilgrimage to fallen gods.Bobby and Robert were pioneers who spoke to me like prophets. Handsome, talented and foolhardy. Each believing in the other and making the other love more and paint better. Until they didn’t. Until drink and debt and the ceaseless memory of the horrors of war and the undeclared war on people like them – people like me – became too much.Like them, I arrived in London knowing almost nobody and wanting to be somebody – to become a writer. Just before the millennium, I discovered the three parallel streets in Soho: Greek, Frith and Dean. A world of pleasures and stories for a young man who’d grown up in a former pit village near a dying steel town where you could get a train to Glasgow and find the one gay club, if you knew where to look. I found freedom on the streets Bobby and Robert had danced down before my parents were born. Hardly any of their haunts remain but get drunk enough in Soho and you’ll see ghosts. I imagined them eyeing me up across a smoky bar.Every second person in wartime Soho was from somewhere else. So Bobby and Robert are lumped together by their new English friends – and subsequently by art historians – as “working class”. But Robert’s mother was a housewife and Bobby’s sold rags. The Colquhoun’s council flat still stands, Bobby’s childhood street was demolished. Robert’s lot were Protestant, Bobby’s Catholic. These differences mattered, forming fault lines that flourished in their work but fractured their relationship.Art was their life but also their work and they had the temerity to need paying, unlike their mostly monied pals. The Roberts spent faster than they earned – hosting parties, helping friends and having fun. They came from nothing. They didn’t know how to be rich. When art tastes changed they couldn’t afford time to experiment. The Roberts really did not get on with “the Bloomsberries”. In Frances Spalding’s book Duncan Grant she describes them as “abrasive young Scots” claiming their “begging letters arrived regularly”. Were they abrasive or just direct in the Glasgow style? Begging or just asking for what they were owed?They were fiercely loyal. When Bobby met Barker, who was leading Elizabeth Smart a merry dance, he is alleged to have ground the base of a broken whisky glass into the palm of his hand while purring “Pleased to meet ye”. Their Notting Hill neighbour Wyndham Lewis knew this, writing in an Observer review: “Robert Colquhoun is generally recognised as one of the best – perhaps the best – of the young artists. Perhaps I should have said Colquhoun and MacBryde for they work together, their work is almost identical, and they can be regarded almost as one organism.”View image in fullscreenDamian Barr.Photograph: Andrew Hasson/The ObserverOne organism. Two Roberts.But how did they get to London and break into the art world? In my novel I conjure a cruising encounter in a blacked-out Waverley Station: Bobby picking up John Tonge, art critic for Horizonmagazine, then showing him some etchings after. Why not? Sex and art are happy bedfellows. We don’t know this happened. We don’t know it didn’t. We do know Tonge introduced Bobby to Cyril Connolly, editor of Horizon, and Peter Watson, millionaire backer of the magazine, over a lunch of partridge at Edinburgh’s Café Royal. Bobby, ever hungry, thought they were very small chickens. This life-changing lunch opened a new chapter in art history.When lives are not valued or actively devalued – as the lives of Bobby and Robert and everybody like them were and often still are – they are not fully known. They can’t be. That doesn’t mean they weren’t fully lived. Writing to your same-sex lover in the 1930s was drafting your own arrest warrant. Or suicide note. You wrote in code, you burned letters, you memorised names and addresses. Or you were caught. Bobby and Robert knew many people who were imprisoned, or worse. Their close friend Denis Wirth-Miller was arrested for “gross indecency” on his way to a party at their studio and jailed for nine weeks – a remarkably light sentence. They collected him from the gates of Wormwood Scrubs. The prosecution in 1954 of Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, Peter Wildeblood and Michael Pitt-Rivers, was a national festival of bigotry.The laws the Two Roberts defied would not be lifted in their too-short lifetimes, and remained in Scotland until 1984. By then I had already been kissed by another boy. When the facts of our lives can never be fully known there isn’t just room for fiction, there is a moral imperative for it. To write it. To paint it – to light a candle in the dark then pick up your pen or brush. Even, and especially, when the world is ending.The Two Roberts is published by Canongateon4 September.

This Elizabeth Hurley-starring series is a confusing, overcomplicated muddle that it’s hard to care aboutJack SealeSun 31 Aug 2025 17.05 EDTShareAsprawling mansion, full of look-at-me reality contestants trying to win money by playing a parlour game based on manipulation and persuasion? It’s either a new season ofThe Traitors, or a clone trying to steal some of The Traitors’ addictive, gossip-worthy magic. Welcome to The Inheritance, a clone that has clearly been carefully worked on, but which has still come out a bit wonky.Thirteen players – spanning the usual reality-TV spectrum of age and class, from a student/influencer and a debt-ridden scaffolder to a flawlessly styled socialite and a wily pensioner – convene at a country pile, the rich owner of which has supposedly died. The contestants are the would-be beneficiaries of the estate and are given a new group task each week. But, instead of this cash being added to a shared fund, the group must nominate one player to receive all of it.It’s fiendishly simple! Except that, no it isn’t because there are many, many conditions to apply. Players who think they deserve the money put themselves forward as a “claimant”, ie a candidate standing for election. The claimants are not in the room when the rest of the group – the “jury” – decide who wins. Then the winner can either keep all the money, or choose to gift some back to members of the group, divided in whichever way they wish – with the proviso that they cannot give money to other claimants. Being a claimant, therefore, means running the risk of ending the round with nothing. Which would be bad, because at some point, the player with the least money will be eliminated. Oh, and the weekly winner divvies up the money (or keeps it all) in secret, so they can lie about how much they bestowed on others. Although, when the poorest player is booted out, presumably this will enable players to deduce who lied about sharing their cash. If this sounds confusing, rest assured that when you watch The Inheritance for yourself, it is confusing.A flawed format is not a dealbreaker in this genre: after all, the aim of the game in The Traitors is meant to be voting out all the traitors, which can’t be allowed to happen because it would end the show, so swathes of that show’s early action have to be a sham. But The Inheritance is an overcomplicated hotch-potch, the obvious issue being that there are only likely to be one or two plausible candidates for the winner of each task, which leaves everyone else scrabbling for a purpose since there’s no weekly elimination.The players deal with this by reverting to their base reality-telly instincts. They build alliances, form cliques, then berate other people for forming cliques and building alliances and cry about being excluded. The main motivation for making friends is meant to be to ensure that if you don’t win a task, the person who does may decide to share some money with you. But, since you don’t know if they’ve actually done that, it’s all a bit hypothetical – and it’s hard to care who’s side anyone is on.In any case, the main showdown in each episode is about who should win the task, and that’s just a debate about observable reality: people make claims about their contribution, which others can dispute because they were there. There’s no equivalent to thosedelicious moments in The Traitorswhere players face instant death if they can’t deflect baseless conspiracy theories hurled at them by the mob. Nobody can brazenly bluff it.Players arguing about the tasks brings up another problem: we have to care about the tasks. You may even feel obliged to actually watch them, instead of skipping to the bit where everyone has a massive barney. But they’re pure reality slop, the tedious spectacle of fools failing at contrived projects – bottling wine in the opening instalment, herding farm animals in episode two – constantly interrupted by clips from contestants’ post-task interviews, where they chirpily tell us things we’ve just observed perfectly well ourselves.Overseeing all this are our hosts (plural, because it takes more than one person to try to replace the godlike Traitors presenterClaudia Winkleman). Officiating from moment to moment isRob Rinder, who doesn’t have much to do beyond reading the rules off a sheet. He appears to be aiming for an air of sophisticated indifference, but just looks bored to death. The big hire isElizabeth Hurleyas the deceased stately homeowner, but even her camp video messages (“Hello, darlings! I’M DEAD!”) soon lose their lustre and become superfluous. The Inheritance could turn out to be playing a cunning long game, but there are enough reasons here to vote it off in week one.The Inheritance is on Channel 4 nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionElizabeth HurleyReality TVGame showsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It has been written for the screen by its estimable director Olivier Assayas, working with the formidable author and reportage journalist Emmanuel Carrère;Carrèrein fact has a cameo here, playing a supercilious French figure at a raucous Moscow student party in the early 90s, patronisingly informing the young people present that it was the communism they’ve just rejected that really believed in the arts.The action takes us through the 1990s decline of ailing president Boris Yeltsin and the promotion of FSB chief Vladimir Putin as prime minister by entrenched oligarchic interests who assume he will be their apparatchik puppet. Through the eyes of our strangely cynical media-manipulator hero, we seePutin’s presidential election triumph in 2000, thesinking of the Kursk submarine, which tested the president’s neo-Stalinist ruthlessness in ignoring public-opinion pressure orchestrated byunreliable courtier and media magnate Boris Berezovsky(who was destined for a lonely death in UK exile), the Chechen wars, the annexation of Crimea, the development of internet black ops and bot farms, and Putin’s growing hatred of Ukraine. Will Keen plays the bullish and hubristic Berezovsky, Tom Sturridge is private banker Dimitri Sidorov (based onMikhail Khodorkovsky), and Alicia Vikander does her best with the uninteresting role of “Ksenia”, a fictionalised girlfriend who leaves Baranov for Sidorov.Jude Law, with a bland suit and sinister, thinning combover plays Putin, described as the “tsar” throughout, convincingly fabricating Putin mannerisms like the thin smile, the wince of disgust at weakness or disloyalty, and the brief, fastidious handshake with cowed visitors followed by the curt gesture to the chair where they should sit. (This is in the era before petitioners and diplomats were made to sit at the end of a table the size of an aircraft carrier.) And the (supposedly) fascinating and enigmatic Baranov (the Surkov-style “wizard” or Rasputin-esque power behind the throne) is played by Paul Dano; a former liberal idealist, theatre producer and enthusiast for the anti-Stalin satirical novel We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, which inspired Orwell – but which Surkov, as he climbs the Putin ladder of power, effectively comes to regard as a blueprint for sophisticated repression.Sadly, Dano’s performance consists of a one-note, smirking, singsong dialogue delivery, almost as if he is speaking under hypnosis, which is soporific both in the way he does it on camera and in the interminable voiceover that drones its way through almost the entire film. (He is supposedly telling his story in flashback to a visiting American academic played by Jeffrey Wright.) Dano’s undirected, undifferentiated portrayal doesn’t have a fraction of the style and subtlety of, say, his performance as Count Bezhukov in theBBC’s War and Peace. And in fact the whole movie is completely without the style and real insight of the comparable fictions we’ve seen lately, such asPeter Morgan’s stage play Patriots, whose London production had Tom Hollander as Berezovsky and Will Keen as Putin, orKirill Serebrinnikov’s film Limonov: The Balladwith Ben Whishaw as former punk author turned Russian ultra-nationalist Eduard Limonov – who shows up briefly and far less excitingly in this film. Oddly, the Serebrennikov film was based on Emmanuel Carrère’s biographical novel.Law keeps the movie ticking over with his chilly impersonation of power – part pope, part mobster – but the movie is not especially interested in digging very deeply into his personality. I would love to see instead a Putin movie that shows the true story of how Putin, very excited at the Russian director Andrei Zvyagintsev’s Venice Golden Lion victory forThe Returnin 2003, invited him to tea at the Kremlin and exuberantly brandished his (pirated) DVD copy of the movie. But The Wizard of the Kremlin just feels pointless in its knowing cynicism, right up to the silly, unearned flourish of violence at the very end. Dano’s character doesn’t seem plausible, either as a young liberal or as a fully fledged political power broker, or as the retired bittersweet narrator of the present day. His performance is bloodless … and without magic.The Wizard of the Kremlin screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmVenice film festivalFilm adaptationsOlivier AssayasDrama filmsComedy filmsVladimir PutinreviewsShareReuse this content"

But despite a very robust lead performance from Pierfrancesco Favino, the enjoyably grizzled alpha male of Italian cinema, this completely runs aground in the third act, quite unable to decide if it should offer the traditional comeback story of an underdog sports movie, or if it should pursue its implied repudiation of the win-at-all-costs ethic. The other issue is whether its young hero should ignore what his dad has to say in favour of an attractive, if flawed, new mentor. The film does in fact appear finally to get off the fence on this last point, but not very satisfyingly or convincingly, and the final wink to the camera is irritating and misjudged.The setting is the early 1980s and Tiziano Menichelli plays Felice, a 13-year-old kid who has been fanatically schooled by his dad in Italian tennis’s lower, relatively undemanding “regionals” competition. Felice has been taught to revere the stolid, machine-like baseline play of Ivan Lendl, and Felice’s grinding efficiency wears down his opponents. But the father then decides that his son deserves glory at the national level and to that end hires a professional coach with money the hard-pressed family really doesn’t have. That coach is the handsome, charming and yet somehow unreliable Raul “the Cat” Gatti, played with grinning machismo by Favino, who once got to the last 16 of a big competition, was pictured in the gossip mags, but dissipated his talent with booze and womanising, and now desperately needs the money after recovering from a breakdown in a clinic, a subject the movie treats with cheerful bad taste.While on the road with his new young pupil, doing the more demanding national under-16 tour, Pavino tells young Felice to forget about boring old Lendl and instead idolise the impossibly glamorous figure of Guillermo Vilas, the Argentinian man-about-town who loved clubbing and the good things in life, even or especially before a big game. But sobersided Felice won’t loosen up and it seems that his baseline style is crumbling in the face of attacking play from opponents in this higher league. Young Felice has got to come up to the net – in tennis, and in life itself.It all looks good for an enjoyable, sentimental comedy, and yet the movie’s running time drags closer and closer to the finish without Felice either winning a match or winning any new wisdom outside the court; nor is Raul coming to terms with his demons, which turn out to be far more complex and disconcertingly serious than we thought. Really, the movie can’t tie up all the loose ends it lays out in front of us. At the very beginning, Di Stefano hints that this film is inspired by moments from his own life, and real life can indeed be messy and complicated and fail to fit the Hollywoodised narrative template. This needed some script revision.My Tennis Maestro screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalSport filmsDrama filmsComedy filmsTennisItalyFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, he could claim to be the pre-eminent specialist in this now very unfashionable movie form. But with his new one, a deeply pleasing and gently quietist triptych on the subject of family, he is giving us something new and personal.It’s the sense of mortality and the gathering cloud of darkness over our heads as we enter middle age, a perpetual nagging worry about the health and happiness of our elderly parents, with the guilt and sadness of not going to see them, or seeing them only rarely, and the related feeling of closeness – or perhaps the opposite – with your siblings for whom these parents are the number one topic of conversation. Then there’s the feeling of relief mixed with dissatisfaction and unease on the long car journey home.The movie is divided into three (apparently) unrelated panels of drama, events taking place in parallel in three different parts of the world: rural US, Dublin and Paris, and with images and gestures that fortuitously echo each other. In the first, Mayim Bialik andAdam Driverplay siblings Emily and Jeff, making the arduous trip out into the countryside to see their ageing dad, played by Tom Waits. His place seems chaotic and on the verge of poverty, an instant source of worry to them both, and Jeff also reproaches himself with having given his dad money over the years. And yet in the course of their awkward visit, they are disconcerted to notice what appears to be a genuine Rolex on the old guy’s wrist and there is evidence that their father is slyly faking his elderly disarray for opaque reasons of his own.Meanwhile, in Dublin,Charlotte Ramplingplays a characteristically self-possessed and self-assured woman who is welcoming her two grownup daughters for their annual visit for tea. She is entirely content to make these visits a rarity. They are the trendy Tim (Vicky Krieps) with pink hair, and the more staid and uptight Lilith, played, a little stagily, by Cate Blanchett, with glasses and sensible shoes.And finally, in Paris, siblings Skye and Billy – non-identical twins, in fact – are played by Indya Moore and Luka Sabbat; their parents have just died, apparently piloting a light aircraft in the Azores, a deadpan-jokey demise that the actors carry off with complete real-world seriousness. They pay a final visit to their late mum and dad’s Paris apartment, and chat to the housekeeper, played by iconic French veteran Françoise Lebrun. And they make a trip out to a storage depot and gaze at their parents’ belongings, crammed into a lockup. This was the material of their parents’ lives, and Skye and Billy have already wonderingly gone through old photos and marriage and birth certificates. It all seems like evidence of something. But what?The movie returns us to an age-old question: who are or were our parents? Did they have real existences before we were born that we will never understand? And are our own existences destined to be effaced and rendered irrelevant or taboo by our own children? For me, the first and third sections are the most naturalistically convincing as portraits of real life, the second is more theatrical, although the weird, slyly comic echoes of each other in each of the sections undermine or at least complicate this reality effect. You might sit through this film waiting for a crisis or a confrontation: some explosion of temper or passionate demand for honesty. None will arrive. Basically, there is a contentment and calm here, an acceptance and a Zen simplicity that is a cleansing of the moviegoing palate, or perhaps the fiction-consuming palate in general. It is a film to savour.Father Mother Sister Brother screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalJim JarmuschDrama filmsAdam DriverTom WaitsCharlotte RamplingCate BlanchettreviewsShareReuse this content"

A year ago, its management cancelled a concert by the pianist Jayson Gillham because of comments he made from the stage condemning the targeting of journalists in Gaza. Despite changes in management, Gillham’s case is still set to go to court – and the MSO remains a target for protest.This was the second ever Prom for the MSO, and twice it wasbrought to a haltby shouts from the balcony, where the Jewish Artists for Palestine group unfurled banners. The first time, the conductor Jaime Martín went off stage, then returned and started from the top; the second, he immediately resumed where they had left off. If anything it felt a little unfair that the piece disrupted should have been by Haunted Hills by the Australian composerMargaret Sutherland. With loping, almost balletic melodies dragging the ominous weight of tuba and other brass, this muscular 1950 tone poem evokes both the unchanging landscape and what Sutherland called the betrayal of Indigenous people by settlers. Her music still awaits an undisrupted Proms premiere.Next, in theory, was Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No 1, with Khatia Buniatishvili as soloist. The stage was rearranged, the piano wheeled out – and, a few minutes later, wheeled back again. Buniatishvili was understandably rattled, and so Dvořák’s Symphony No 6 would be played first.It’s a buoyant symphony and, as the performance unfolded unchallenged, it sounded all the more so. Yet while there were some lovely touches – the glassy violins and perky flutes as the first movement turned back towards the light; the rustic piccolo singing out in relief to the almost aggressive main dance theme of the third movement – the balance still felt weighted towards the brass, with the strings silky yet a little reticent.Buniatishvili finally took the stage after the interval, and with Martín in attentive support she gave a performance of almost relentless drive, bringing out the skittishness and spikiness behind this work’s grandeur. Her encore was JS Bach’s version of an adagio for oboe by Marcello, its melody highly decorated but introverted, played almost as if she were alone. A long silence followed: the end of a highly charged evening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

But which Christmas banger really grinds her gears?As told toRich PelleySun 31 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTShareThe first song I fell in love withWhen I was seven and I started playing the trumpet, my mum would take me to the library. They just happened to have Afro by Dizzy Gillespie, and I fell in love with Con Alma, which Dizzy plays on the trumpet with so much soul that it feels like a voice. I remember thinking: Wow, this is something else.The song I do at karaokeI can recognise the melodies in most songs because I have the ear of a musician. But I don’t really listen to the words – I feel having the words in front of me would throw me off, so I’ve never done karaoke. If Ihadto, I’d probably do an old classic like Crocodile Rock by Elton John.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toMy whole family has always loved Queen. When Queen played Knebworth in 1986, my granny and grandad lived in the village, so we felt like they’d come to play tous. My mum, dad, aunty and uncle all went. We were left behind, but could hear it across the fields. If we were on a long car journey, I’d insist on having it on five times in a row.The best song to play at a partyI went to see Earth, Wind & Fire as a teenager and was amazed by their horn section – the Phenix Horns. Who would not want to dance to Boogie Wonderland? It’s a classic dancefloor boogie moment.The song I’ve always hatedI don’t know why I hate Merry Xmas Everybody by Slade so much. Maybe it’s because you can’t get away from it. It reminds me of late-night desperate Christmas shopping when everyone’s run out of time.The song that makes me cryIestyn Davies singing Rodelinda by Handel with the English National Opera. Davies has the most beautiful countertenor voice and is one of the greatest opera singers in the world. It’s a ravishing recording and I feel privileged that he’s my friend.The song I’d like played at my funeralI argue with my manager: what is the ultimate, greatest piece of all time? She says Mozart’s Requiem; I say Bach’s St Matthew Passion. They are both masterpieces. So I’ll have both – even if it does make the funeral seven hours long.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Any time things threaten to get serious in this new adaptation by Elizabeth Newman, the band strikes up, the silvery frocks come out and the stage is alive with the charleston and foxtrot.The young dandies and flappers do not know the identity of Jay Gatsby, their wealthy host – in their snobby way, they suspect him of being an arriviste, perhaps a bootlegger, certainly not old money – but they are helpless in the face of so much glamour, celebrity and hedonism. No scene goes by without another sultry jazz standard played by a band disguised in glasses and gaberdines and perched high on Jen McGinley’s art deco set, with its twin staircases and marbled floor.Even the punctilious narrator, Nick Carraway (a commanding David Rankine), is swept up in the interwar fun. With his neat brown suit and polite demeanour, he looks more like a bond trader than the writer he wants to be, but still he cannot resist the allure of Gatsby’s extravagant parties.Oraine Johnson’s Gatsby is no mean hoofer himself. When it comes to the dance routines, the supposedly enigmatic host leads from the front. This adds much to the energy, but it also fuels an interpretation of Gatsby that pulls in two directions.View image in fullscreenIrresistible allure … David Rankine and Oraine Johnson in The Great Gatsby.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanThis Gatsby is never as unknowable as everyone claims. Where he could be inscrutable he is emotionally available, willing to play low status where you expect him to be aloof. His repeated phrase “old sport” comes across as a conversational quirk where it should be a sign of a man mirroring the class he aspires to. It makes it hard to see what his snooty guests know instinctively: that he has attempted to buy his way into their affections – in particular those of Daisy Buchanan (a warm-hearted Fiona Wood) – but he can never be one of them.As Gatsby’s sad story unravels, the tone grows darker and the frivolity abates. But although the production does well to capture the hangover following the jazz age party, it underplays the tragedy of a man whose fatal flaw is to believe in a meritocratic US.AtPitlochry Festival theatreuntil 25 September, then atDerby theatre3-25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatrePitlochry Festival theatreF Scott FitzgeraldreviewsShareReuse this content"

Even safer to say that had mother, wife and upper-class lover had such a meeting, they would not have spent the time filling each other in on their relationship with the great poet.No matter. The contrivance of John Binnie’s play, set on 25 January with an eye to performances on Burns Nights to come, paves the way for what really makes this show tick: an attractive compilation of favourite songs, sweetly sung by Alyson Orr (Agnes), Stephanie Cremona (Jean) and Eden Barrie (Clarinda), following the pretty harmonies of Orr’s arrangements and the simple acoustic guitar accompaniment of Chris Coxon.Seen at a preview performance, A Toast Fae the Lassies quickly makes you forget the staginess of the setup. The artifice seems more than justified by such tender renditions of Ae Fond Kiss, Charlie Is My Darling and A Red, Red Rose, as well as other songs and poems, especially when the actors step out of character to take on other scenes from the poet’s life.Harder to overlook is the graveyard set by Natalie Fern, which, with its raised platforms and scattered headstones, becomes an obstacle course for the actors, moving about the limited studio space in their period dress. It is needlessly cluttered.But what emerges forcibly, as the women trade notes, is a picture of a man who today would be called a sex addict. By the time he married Jean Armour, Burns had fathered several children by her – and by others, too – and however cerebral his meeting of minds with Clarinda, it did not stop him impregnating her maid.Here, the women are torn between being seduced and being outraged. On the one hand, the captivating hold of his language; on the other, poems they see as thinly disguised excuses for his philandering. In this way, Binnie, who also directs, paints a portrait of a contradictory man, one capable of indifference and tenderness, crude animal instinct and timeless beauty. It adds grit to a crowd-pleasing show.AtPitlochry Festival theatreuntil 24 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatrePitlochry Festival theatreRobert BurnsPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

They will find it at an exhibition of his extraordinary 90-metre frieze, A Year in Normandy, and other works at the Serpentine gallery inLondon.The free exhibition is likely to draw thousands of fans of the 88-year-old artist, adored for his vibrant images, bluff Yorkshire manner and defiant advocacy of smoking.View image in fullscreenDavid Hockney painting in Normandy.Photograph: David HockneyThe show will be mounted in the same year as the Bayeux tapestry – cited by Hockney as an inspiration for his frieze, and described by the artist as “one of the oldest and most remarkable artworks” – comes to London for the first time in nearly 1,000 years in a cultural exchange withFrance.Hockney moved to Normandy, the home of the Bayeux tapestry, in late 2019, and began producing images of winter trees on his iPad. “Then this virus started …”he told the BBC in the spring of 2020.He sent images to his friends, and publicly released one of daffodils, titled: Do Remember They Can’t Cancel the Spring. “Why are my iPad drawings seen as a respite from the news? Well, they are obviously made by the hand depicting the renewal that is the spring in this part of the world.”He added: “We have lost touch with nature rather foolishly as we are a part of it, not outside it.

It’s a character within a much broader story. We weren’t trying to define anything about anyone.”The film is an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli’s bestselling book of the same name and revolves around Vadim Baranov, a scheming Russian spin doctor (played by Paul Dano) who smooths Putin’s ascent to power in the 1990s. The character was inspired by a real-life fixer, Vladislav Surkov, who was key in shaping Russian political strategy.Dano, when asked if he found any positives in his character, said: “I don’t think you have to look for a positive, but I do think you have to be willing to discover the point of view of the character. If you were to just label a character like Baranov as bad, it would be a massive oversimplification, which does more harm than good.”Law said one of the challenges he faced was portraying an opaque figure whose tightly controlled public image revealed little of the man behind it.“The tricky side to me was that the public face we see gives very, very little away. There has been a term for him and that is ‘the man without a face’. There’s a mask. Understandably, Olivier would want me to portray this or that in a scene with a certain emotion, and I felt the conflict of trying to show very little.”View image in fullscreen(From left) Alberto Barbera, Jude Law, Olivier Assaya and Alicia Vikander attend The Wizard of the Kremlin premiere in Venice on Sunday.Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe film marks an English-language debut for Assayas, best known for Clouds of Sils Maria and Personal Shopper. It co-stars Alicia Vikander, Tom Sturridge and Jeffrey Wright.The timing of its release, three years into Russia’s war in Ukraine, has stoked questions about the state of contemporary geopolitics.The Wizard of the Kremlin review – no magic from Paul Dano as cynical Putin spin doctorRead moreAssayas, when asked whether Russia ruled the world today, said: “The answer is no, but I understand the question. The film is very much about how modern politics, 21st-century politics, was invented, and part of that evil raised from the rise to power of Vladimir Putin in Russia.”The 70-year-old said politics had “changed in a major way, especially for people from my generation”. “What’s going on right now is not only terrifying, but it’s even more terrifying by the fact that we haven’t really found the answer,” he said.Wright said the film made him think about America’s place in history and the dangers of contemporary authoritarianism. “There’s a specific Russian history, and here’s a specific American history that is in contrast to that,” he said.“We have had impulses toward fascism, impulses toward autocracy and all manner of sins. But what we also have had, from the very beginning, even within the timeframe of the original sins of America, even within that grotesqueness, we had an idea that we could be better, this idea that we could aspire towards some type of utopian perfectibility. If that is lost, as it is now, then we become the thing we see in this film,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The band’s five members were barely out of their teens with no real plan; it was purely “vibes-based”, as vocalist and guitarist Jules Crommelin remembers: “It’s the inevitable small town [thing] – you either stay forever or you leave as quick as possible.”That spontaneous move a decade ago turned out to be a fortuitous decision for the young band: Crommelin, percussionist Anatole “Toto” Serret, keyboardist and vocalist Louie Swain, bassist Noah Hill and keyboardist, vocalist and guitarist Patrick Hetherington. Their 2015 self-released debut EP caught the attention of the French record label Kitsuné, who signed them.A year later, when Parcels played their first-ever gig in Paris, a little duo called Daft Punk was in attendance. The dance pioneers liked what they heard and invited the band to their studio. The result wasParcels’ 2017 single Overnight, which ended up being Daft Punk’s final ever production.“[That] was the first time we’d ever been in a proper recording studio as a band,” Crommelin says. “Having them guide us and write with us and produce with us … They really helped us get on the tracks.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s been such a journey, us five being together over 10 years’ … Parcels.Photograph: Drew WheelerWorking with Daft Punk felt like a “university degree of lessons”, teaching the young band how to approach and refine their craft. “It was just an explosion of everything … how to record, how to put instruments together, how precise to be,” Crommelin says. “They are just absolutely so tapped into detail, and really focusing on this infectiousness of music and just getting it right … and things just having magic.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningParcels took those lessons and ran with them. The rest, you might say, is history. They released their self-titled debut album in 2018, with one single’s video starring Milla Jovovich, and chased it with an ambitious double album, Day/Night, in 2021. Blending Beach Boys-style vocal harmonies with disco and funk influences, Parcels’ simultaneously nostalgic and contemporary sound has clearly struck a chord – their music has topped 1bn streams worldwide.The band’s euphoric live performances also put them on the map. They’ve been in hot demand this year, playing Coachella and Glastonbury. They will return to the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado in October – a venue they sold out in five minutes last year – and kick off the Australian summer with east coast shows, including two gigs on the Sydney Opera House steps.Crommelin singles out Glastonbury as the pinnacle of a year full of highlights. “I just found that festival so wildly different to every other festival – just how people were, how people engaged with the music, the vibe, the energy of the crowd,” he says. “We just played an amazing show thanks to them – we got out there, and they were just so on for us.”View image in fullscreenParcels perform at the 2025 Coachella festival.Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for CoachellaThe band is firing on all cylinders, but that couldn’t have happened if they didn’t take some time to rest after almost a decade of nonstop touring and recording.

Each band member’s “wildly different” musical tastes have converged to make something new. Serret “is deep in dance and techno”, for example, while Crommelin just “admire[s] it”. But “I’ve always felt that the more we can all go our own directions, the better the band will be,” he adds, “because when you’re pulling the same references, you can start to feel like you’re in an echo chamber.”The title of the new album has a double meaning: being loved in both the past and present tense. These songs are about love in all its pain and glory, and that duality is baked into the music. “Our music [has] this overarching light spirit … but the lyrics often speak towards something deeper and sometimes darker,” Crommelin says. “The ultimate goal is to cry on the dancefloor.”The members of Parcels are now approaching their 30s; two of them have returned to live in Australia, while the others remain in Berlin. The beauty of a band being together for so long is that there’s space for both personal and artistic growth – but what has remained unchanged is their shared love of music. “It’s been such a journey, us five being together over 10 years,” Crommelin says. “Of course, from 10 years of life, everything’s different … [but] when we get together as a dynamic of five and when we play together, we sound like Parcels.”Parcels’ new album Loved is out 12 September (Because Music). The band is performing across Europe in September and October before heading to Australia in November and December.See here for all dates.Explore more on these topicsGuardian Australia's headline actDiscoPop and rockDance musicAustralian musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But they are only human. Increasingly, they are stretched thin, working long hours, under immense pressure, and often with limited resources. Of course, better conditions would help, including more staff and improved systems. But even in the best-funded clinics with the most committed professionals, standards can still fall short; doctors, like the rest of us, are working with stone age minds. Despite years of training, human brains are not optimally equipped for the pace, pressure, and complexity of modern healthcare.Given that patient care is medicine’s core purpose, the question is who, or what, is best placed to deliver it? AI may still spark suspicion, but research increasingly shows how it could help fix some of the most persistent problems and overlooked failures – from misdiagnosis and error to unequal access to care.As patients, each of us will face at least one diagnostic error in our lifetimes. In England, conservative estimates suggest that about5%of primary care visits result in a failure to properly diagnose, putting millions of patients in danger. In the US, diagnostic errors cause death or permanent injury to almost800,000 peopleannually. Misdiagnosis is a greater risk if you’re among the one in 10 people worldwide with a rare disease.Modern medicine prides itself on being scientific, yet doctors don’t always practise what the evidence recommends. Studies show that evidence-based treatments are offered only abouthalf the timeto adults in the US. Doctors can also disagree about diagnoses. Ina studyof more than 12,000 radiology images, reviewers offering second opinions disagreed with the original assessment in about one in three cases – leading to a change in treatment nearly 20% of the time. As the work day wears on, quality slips further: inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions rise, while cancer screening rates fall.As alarming as this is, there are understandable reasons for these failures – and viewed from another angle, it’s remarkable that doctors get it right as often as they do. The realities of being human – distraction, multitasking, even our body clocks – take a toll. But burnout, depression and cognitive ageing don’t just wear doctors down; they raise the risk of clinical mistakes.Medical knowledge also moves faster than doctors can keep up. By graduation, half of what medical students learn is already outdated. It takes anaverage of17 years for research to reach clinical practice, and with a new biomedical article published every 39 seconds, even skimming the abstracts would take about 22 hours a day. There are more than 7,000 rare diseases, with 250 more identified each year.In contrast, AI devours medical data at lightning speed, 24/7, with no sleep and no bathroom breaks. Where doctors vary in unwanted ways, AI is consistent. And while these tools make errors too, it would be churlish to deny how impressive the latest models are, with some studies showing theyvastly outperform human doctorsin clinical reasoning, including for complex medical conditions.AI’s superpower is spotting patterns humans miss, and these tools are surprisingly good at recognising rare diseases – often better than doctors. For example, inone 2023 studyresearchers fed 50 clinical cases – including 10 rare conditions – into ChatGPT-4. It was asked to provide diagnoses in the form of ranked suggestions. It solved all of the common cases by the second suggestion, and got 90% of the rare conditions by the eighth – outperforming the human doctors used as comparators. Patients and their families are increasingly recognising these benefits. One child, Alex, saw 17 doctors overthree years for chronic pain– none could explain his symptoms. Desperate, his mother turned to ChatGPT, which suggested a rare condition called tethered cord syndrome. Doctors confirmed the diagnosis, and Alex is now receiving proper treatment.Then there’s the problem of access. Healthcare is upside down. Those most in need – the sickest, poorest, and most marginalised in society – are the ones most likely to be left behind. Packed schedules and poor public transport mean millions miss appointments. Parents and part-time workers, including those with gig economy jobs, often struggle to attend checkups.American Time Use Surveydata shows patients sacrifice two hours for a 20-minute doctor’s visit. The problems are often worse for people with disabilities, who are aboutfour timesmore likely to miss out on care in the UK due to issues with transport, costs and long waiting lists. Compared with men with no disability, disabled women are more than seven times more likely to have unmet needs due to the cost of care or medication.And yet we rarely question the idea of waiting in line at the doctor’s office in town because it’s simply the way things have always been done. AI could change that. Imagine a doctor in your pocket offering information when and where you need it. Under Labour’s 10-year plan, Wes Streeting, the health secretary,has announcedthat patients will soon be able to discuss their health concerns with AI via theNHSapp. It’s a bold step – and one that could bring quicker, actionable clinical advice for millions.This will only work for those who can use it, of course. Internet access is improving globally, but there are still serious gaps: 2.5 billion people remain offline. In the UK,8.5 million peoplelack basic digital skills, and 3.7 million families fall below the “minimum digital living standard”, meaning they have poor connectivity, outdated devices and limited support. Confidence is a barrier too: 21% of people in the UK say they feel left behind by technology.At the moment, AI healthcare research almost exclusively fixates on its flaws. Examining the technology’s potential for bias and errors is a crucially important task. But this orientation doesn’t take account of the creaking and sometimes unsafe systems we already rely on. Any fair assessment of AI must be weighed against the realities of what we’ve currently got – a system that too often can be frustrating, out of reach, or just plain wrong.Charlotte Blease is a health researcher and the author ofDr Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us – and How AI Could Save Lives, published by Yaleon 9 September.Further readingDeep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Againby Eric Topol (Basic Books, £28)Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AIby Ethan Mollick (WH Allen, £16.99)Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humansby Melanie Mitchell (Pelican, £10.99)Explore more on these topicsBooksThe big ideaArtificial intelligence (AI)Health & wellbeingHealth policyNHSfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What about briefly closing one eye suggests impudence, flirtatiousness or mischievousness?Caroline, by emailSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyWinking has to be interpreted in context. Yes, it can be cheeky, but it can also serve as an affectionate show of support (“you got this!”), a flirtatious gesture or, as the Canadian prime minister so masterfully employed it, a signal to the world that one fully understands the absurd circumstance in which he finds himself. Winking at someone in the wrong context could obviously land you in an awkward or even confrontational dilemma. Because it’s so versatile, we must have situational awareness and an understanding of the audience.GlimmerTwinTXSocial anthropologists believe that winking originated from a deeply ingrained need to find a use for the semicolon key prior to the invention of the emoji.EddieChorepostWinking is considered cheekier than blinking. Otherwise, we’d be very naughty indeed.gleebitzBecause the English are sex mad.TavennaserThere are certain interesting features to winking. It’s silent, so it can be directed (to some extent) towards or away from people. It parasitises an automatic, unconscious behaviour and gives it a kind of explicit intentionality. It’s quick, potentially private and, for that reason, can be played off as ambiguous. It’s done with the eyes, which we might think are potentially leaking out truth and feeling. So there’s a potential for subversion of the social space in winking, by embedding a private moment that can’t be readily fact-checked.LaszloPanaflexBecause it enables you to apply mascarawithout opening your mouth?Paulo777Readers reply: Why can’t I put on mascara without opening my mouth?Read moreWinking, cheeky? Yes, when you do it your cheek moves up. So yes, cheeky.catchytitledAh yes, well, you see, English has developed mostly from East Frisian and is a Germanic language, as is German. Due to the existence of the North Sea, some of the word meanings have evolved in a slightly different manner.In German, the verb “winken” means to wave, predominantly to attract someone’s attention, including of course the “yoo-hoo I think you’re gorgeous” wave across a crowded beer hall, the discreet wave of “shall we meet later?” and the small wave in front of the mouth meaning “you can share my secret if you want”.Meanwhile, across theNordsee, “winken” has evolved into winking, to which has been added a touch of so-called British understatement, thus causing a reduction of movement from the hand to a not-always-so-subtle movement of the muscles around one eye. Add the natural loucheness of some of Britons and we arrive at the present situation.

Strap a comfy topper on to a hard mattress and it could transform the quality of your sleep at significantly less cost than anew mattress.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That’s the promise, anyway. In my neverending quest for a decent night’s kip, I slept on eight bestselling toppers – not all at once, Princess and the Pea style, but for a few nights, each on top of a firm mattress. I was surprised to find so many topper types available, from thick slabs of memory foam to airy cloudbanks of hollowfibre, with one even containing springs.Most of my test toppers went to charity straight after testing, but one improved my sleep so much that I hung on to it for weeks like a teenager refusing to acknowledge that the alarm went off hours ago. Here, I’ll reveal which topper turned me into a duvet-hugger and which one I kicked out of bed at 4am.At a glanceBestmattress topper overall:Simba Hybrid TopperFrom £299 (single) to £499 (superking) at SimbaBestbudget mattress topperSilentnight Airmax 1000From £44.95 (single) to £75 (superking) at Mattress OnlineBestcooling mattress topper:Panda BambooFrom £99.95 (single) to £199.95 (EU emperor) at Panda LondonBest firm mattress topper:Origin ContourFrom £120 (single) to £188 (superking) at OriginWhy you should trust meI’ve spent three decades reviewing products from smartphones tohay fever remedies, so I’m naturally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to improve our lives by buying their stuff. I also have a solid background in napping, insomnia and swearing at alarm clocks, so I welcomed the chance to sleep on the job – which has become something of a speciality for me at the Filter.How I testedView image in fullscreenThe mattress toppers were scored by a panel, slept on, and tested using weights and thermometers.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianTesting mattress toppers is not unliketesting mattresses– it just swallows up less space in your house – so I followed a similar methodology to that forbest mattresses. First, I sourced double size toppers from the manufacturers (or from Mattress Online, in the case of the Silentnight), then allowed them to fully expand. Most of my test samples contain memory foam, so they needed a couple of days to reach the ideal consistency.Then I sought feedback from people with assorted mattress preferences and sleep styles. I asked my dad (85), my niece (23), my sister and our husbands to join me for a topper-tasting session where we sat, laid down and rolled over on every test sample to compare them side by side. I collected everyone’s scores out of 10 for firmness, breathability and overall comfort, then worked out averages to draw up an initial ranking.Next, ably assisted by my husband Alan, I ran tests with weights, a heat pad, a thermometer and a glass of water to measure sinkage, temperature regulation and motion isolation. Mattress toppers vary less on these factors than full-size mattresses, but we still collected diverse and occasionally surprising data, especially on heat retention. For instance, when we warmed each topper’s surface to 35C using a microwavable heat pad, Panda’s memory foam topper cooled down even faster than those filled with microfibre or wool – despite containing a notoriously heat-hugging material. Clearly, foam technology is advancing, and we couldn’t make assumptions about toppers based simply on their lists of ingredients.Then we went to sleep. Alan and I slept on each topper for at least two nights across three weeks in July and August. Night temperatures were around 15C, ideal for sleep but warm enough to test whether, in practice, the foam toppers retained too much body heat for comfort. We attached them to a firm Sealy Posturepedic Elevate Emin mattress, which I’m currently reviewing for the Filter, on a slatted Ikea bed base.I considered each topper’s environmental credentials, too. Mattress makers are secretive about the lifecycles of their products, but I discovered what I could about the materials used, their manufacture and their potential for recycling.No mattress toppers were harmed in the testing process, but I struggled to find takers for them at the local refuges and hardship organisations that have collected my test mattresses. So I donated them to a local charity that means a lot to me:Farplace, which raises money for animal rescue.The best mattress toppers you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreenThe Otty mattress topper “looks glorious and feels instantly comfortable”.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBest mattress topper overall:Simba Hybrid TopperView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £299 (single) to £499 (superking) at SimbaMy favourite topper is essentially a thin bed-in-a-box hybrid mattress. It arrived vacuum-shrunk and rolled in plastic, and contains layers of memory foam and springs to offer a balance of comfort and support. So far, so similar to theSimba Hybrid Promattress – but I found it even more comfortable than its full-size counterpart.Why we love itIt’s rare for a mattress topper to contain springs, because there’s not much room for them. But Simba’s 6.5cm-deep topper squeezes “up to 1,900” conicaltitanium microsprings between its top layer of open-cell memory foam and base layer of high-density foam.My testing panel initially found it too firm, but that’s because they didn’t sleep on it. The foam adapted to the heat and shape of my body over four nights, developing just enough sink-in softness to feel gloriously comfortable without ever lacking support. It even relieved the rib pain that had meddled with my efforts to sleep on a firmer surface.Simba’s topper ended up going to charity like the others, but not until I’d slept on it for a few more weeks. This isn’t just because I loved it – I also wanted to check that it didn’t get soft in the middle, like my test sample of the Simba Hybrid Pro. It didn’t, possibly because it was attached to such a firm mattress, but I found it stayed most comfortable if I rotated it every week. Simba’s own recommendation is to rotate the topper “at least once per month” in the first three months.It’s a shame that …temperature regulation wasn’t as good as expected, both in our tests and my experience. The open-cell foam is designed to promote airflow, but like a lot of memory foam it struggles to avoid trapping heat when the nights are warm.Suitable for:anyone who loves a cosy but supportive sleeping surface and doesn’t want to fork out for an entire hybrid mattressType:hybrid (foam and springs)Depth:6.5cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTrial period:200 nightsWarranty:10 yearsSustainability credentials:Simba is B Corp certified and aiming for net zero by 2030.

It wins on convenience, too: it’s very light, rolls up small and will survive anelectric blanketor washing machine.Why we love itThe Silentnight topper looks perturbingly like a puffa jacket or bouncy castle. No mattress topper can iron out the bumps in a lumpy bed, but this one looks like itaddsthem. My testing panel was suitably sceptical. As with the Simba, however, the Silentnight proved its worth when I actually slept on it. The hollowfibre filling compresses under your sleeping body, feeling cosy without being too soft.This is one of the most breathable toppers I tested. Hollowfibre has none of the heat-trapping properties memory foam is known for, and we both woke up feeling refreshed. Silentnight also claims the filling is antibacterial and anti-allergy, and while I couldn’t test its resistance to dust mites I can confirm it didn’t set off myhay fever.It’s a shame that …this topper occasionally wears its cheapness on its sleeve. You have to keep plumping it up, and some of the 48 puffs are fatter than others.Suitable for:adding a comfy, allergy-resistant layer to a hard mattress or sofa bedType:hollowfibreDepth:claims 10cm but I found it closer to 4cm when in regular useCover:not removable; wash the whole topper at 40CTrial period:noWarranty:two yearsSustainability credentials:Silentnight is zero landfill, aims for net zero by 2040, and says it’s the first sleep brand to publish anEnvironmental Social Governance (ESG) reportBest cooling mattress topper:Panda BambooView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £99.95 (single) to £199.95 (EU emperor) at PandaPanda’s topper tackled my night sweats better than any other in our rundown – not what I’d expected from a slab of memory foam. It offers the cosy pressure relief of foam without the cost and commitment of an all-foam mattress.Why we love itThe Panda has a relatively simple construction, with a flat pad of memory foam inside a removable fabric cover, but it’s full of thoughtful details. I like the tiny rubberised dots on the base to stop it slipping when you get in and out of bed, and it’s the only topper I tested to have adjustable straps, so you can fit it securely to any depth of mattress.The Panda cooled down faster than any other topper in our heat-retention tests, and when I slept on it in late July, the “temperature-regulating hydro foam” genuinely seemed to emit a cooling sensation from below. The cover also contains bamboo fibre to help avoid overheating.This is a relatively soft topper and its high-viscosity foam moulds around your body, so it’s ideal for relieving joint pain. It will get softer over months of sleeping, but at 5cm deep it won’t dip far enough to leave you feeling unsupported, providing the mattress underneath it is robust.It’s a shame that …it will be too soft for some and there’s no bounce whatsoever, but at least that means you won’t feel the fidgeting of a restless partner.Suitable for:couples who share a bed but crave some peace from each other’s movements and body heatType:memory foamDepth:5cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CFree trial:30 daysWarranty:10 yearsSustainability credentials:FSC-managedbamboo,circle-of-liferecycling schemeBest firm mattress topper:Origin ContourView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £120 (single) to £188 (superking) at OriginIf the handsomeOrigin Hybrid Prois the James Bond of mattresses, the Origin Contour topper is young Bond: cool, slim and harder than it looks. Its high-density foam softens just enough to leave you feeling neither shaken nor stirred as you sleep.Why we love itThe Origin is the most orthopaedic-feeling of all the toppers I tested, and this made it my favourite for sitting up to read in bed. My family found it too firm for lying on, but I liked it – not least because it yielded slightly under the weight and warmth of my body over a few nights of sleeping, while remaining very supportive.The silky cover is described by Origin as “extra-cooling Tencel” and the upper foam layer contains “cooling gel-infused beads” to head off overheating. This topper lets the air circulate better than some, but I didn’t measure the same level of cooling as with the Panda or the Silentnight.It’s a shame that …some details don’t quite work. For instance, the fabric cover is a little loose and gets caught in the zip, while the straps are too tight for thicker mattresses – such as Origin’s own hulking 31cm-deep Hybrid Pro.Suitable for:adding gently cushioned support to a bed that’s seen better days, as long as it’s still firmskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

There’s a heftiness to it but it feels so comfortable,” said my sister Maeve. My husband Alan added: “It’s moulding to me but I’m not sinking in. The foam springs back fast, like baby skin. It’s making me want to go to sleep.” Indeed, I fell asleep unusually fast on this topper, which also offered brilliant motion isolation to help us both doze in peace.It didn’t make the final cut because …the topper softened under my sleeping body and I woke up at 4am feeling hot and, frankly, sunk. We dragged it off the bed and went back to sleep.

A mattress protector is more like a thick fitted sheet – often quilted, and sometimes waterproof – that helps to keep sweat, spills and dirt away from your mattress. A topper helps to protect your mattress from wear and tear, too, of course.Will a mattress topper fix a bad mattress?In most cases, no. If the mattress is “bad” because it’s too hard for your preference, then a mattress topper can fix it by adding a layer of cushioning. It will help prolong the mattress’s life, too. But if the mattress is saggy, torn or lumpy, the topper will simply follow the curve of its surface.“Where a mattress has lost its support or doesn’t provide enough support for your body shape, a topper won’t solve the problem,” says Hannah Shore, head of sleep science at Mattress Online. “Ultimately the topper will shape itself into those same lumps and bumps.”Can a topper make my bed feel firmer?All mattress toppers work best on a solid foundation. A firm topper such as the Origin Contour may briefly make you feel more supported if your mattress is too soft, but it’ll soon sink into the mattress and create an unstable, uneven surface. As a rule of thumb, lower layers should be firmer and upper layers should be softer.Don’t be tempted to use a mattress topper on the floor, either, says Hannah Shore. “They’re designed to be used in conjunction with an actual mattress. A topper on the floor won’t give you the support and cushioning you need to get a good night’s sleep.”What should I look for when buying a mattress topper?That depends why you want a topper. These bed-enhancers come in a surprisingly wide range of materials and tensions, each suited to different needs.Your bed feels too hard:look for a soft topper, ideally made from memory foam. Brands including Tempur and Simba have their own names for memory foam, but it’s all similar stuff: high-viscosity foam that moulds around your body to provide support as well as plush cushioning. It softens over weeks and months of being slept on, especially when the weather’s warm.You get too warm in bed:memory foam tends to trap heat, so hollowfibre or wool is traditionally a better choice if you tend to overheat at night. However, sleep brands are competing to devise breathable foam recipes such as Panda’s “HydroFoam”, whose open-cell design and “heat-sentisive micro gel” let the air circulate and draw heat away from your body as you sleep. This helped make the Panda Bamboo the best cooling topper in my test.You suffer aches and pains:orthopaedic sleeping surfaces can feel too firm, especially if you’re used to a softer surface. I love a firm mattress, but my ribs and shoulders are far happier with a thin, soft comfort layer on top of it, especially when I sleep on my side. The pressure relief of a memory foam topper is also great for soothing painful joints and other musculoskeletal maladies.You share your bed with a fidget:memory foam is brilliant for absorbing the movement of a sleeping partner, so you’re less disturbed by their tossing and turning.You suffer from allergies:wool is naturally hypoallergenic and also excels at temperature regulation, but it’s not vegan and is usually dry clean only. As a habitual morning sneezer, I’ve had excellent results with polyester hollowfibre and microfibre toppers that act as a barrier to allergens such as dust mites in my mattress. These toppers are also the easiest to wash in the machine.Can I wash a mattress topper?The Woolroom topper and Otty cover in my test are dry clean only, an annoying barrier to keeping them fresh and healthy. You can’t washordry clean memory foam, but memory foam toppers usually have removable fabric covers that you can wash in the machine at 40C or even 60C. With polyester hollowfibre and microfibre toppers, you can normally put the whole thing in the machine, although it’ll take a bit longer to dry – much like washing a summer duvet. Aheated clothes airerwill help when the sun doesn’t shine.What else should I bear in mind?Get the right size topper for your mattress: don’t try to save a few pounds by buying a double size topper for a king size mattress. The topper won’t attach securely, so it will move around while you turn in the night and could even slide off the bed.Mattresses vary in depth, of course, so check the size of straps if you can when buying your topper. Of the toppers on test, the adjustable straps on the Panda were the best, securing tightly to any depth of mattress. The Dunelm’s straps were particularly big, and the Origin’s were particularly small. A non-slip base like the ones on the Otty, Simba and Panda will help keep the topper in place. The double-sided Ikea has no straps or non-slip base at all, so it will need to be secured with a tight fitted sheet.All but the thinnest toppers will add a couple of inches of height to your mattress, so your sheets may struggle to fit. You can buy extra deep fitted sheets or even adjustable ones like the Pull Me Tight toggled fitted sheet (from £15 at Dunelm). Memory foam toppers add several kilos to the weight of your mattress too, so changing sheets becomes slightly harder work. Foam toppers also shouldn’t be used with electric blankets.Mattress toppers don’t typically come with the generous free trial periods and warranties that mattresses do, but some can be returned for a refund if you don’t get on with them. Check this before you buy. A good mattress topper will last three to five years if you take good care of it by using a mattress protector and rotating it regularly.Jane Hoskyn is a features journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

It’s also a very simple bake, because the show-stopping bit is all in the assembly.Prep1 hrCook1 hr 5 minServes8-10For the pastry layer (optional)60g plain flour5g cocoa powder25g caster sugar40g softened butterSaltFor the sponge6 large eggs140g soft light brown sugar60g cocoa powderSaltFor the filling750g fresh or frozen cherries, or 700g morello cherries in syrup (see step 1)60g caster sugar(only if using fresh or frozen cherries)1½ tbsp kirsch, or unsweetened cherry brandy (cherry liqueur will work, but is much sweeter)500ml double or whipping cream½ tsp vanilla extract50g icing sugar300g cherry jam1 square dark chocolate, shaved into curls1 A note on the cherriesTraditionally, this cake is made with sour cherries, which aren’t readily available in the UK. You can sometimes find them frozen, or use morello cherries in syrup/juice, instead, but there are still summer cherries in the shops, so I’ve devised this recipe to use the fresh sweet variety (skip step 2 if you’re using jarred or tinned fruit).2 Prepare the cherriesStone all but 10 of your fresh or frozen cherries, if need be, and set aside the unstoned fruit for now. The only easy way to do this is with a cherry pitter; they’re not expensive and some can also be used for olives.View image in fullscreenPut the stoned cherries in a saucepan with the caster sugar, set it over a medium heat and cook, stirring gently, until the cherries soften but are still holding their shape.3 Pasty or no pastry?Traditionally, the base of this cake is made from shortcrust pastry, rather than sponge, for the simple reason that it holds up better to being drenched in cherry juice and brandy than cake does. You can skip this and the next two steps for a simpler three-tier sponge cake that will require less cream and fewer cherries.4 Make the pastry doughView image in fullscreenLine the base of a 20cm, loose-bottomed tin with a circle of greaseproof paper that’s cut neatly to fit. Sift the flour and cocoa powder for the pastry layer, if making, into a large bowl, add the sugar and a pinch of salt, and whisk to combine. Squidge in the butter to make a soft dough.5 Bake the pastry layerUse your fingers to press the dough into the base of the lined tin, so it covers it in a thin, fairly even layer. Cover and chill for 20 minutes while you heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then bake for 15 minutes, until crisp. Take the tin out of the oven, carefully lift out the pastry and leave to cool.6 Start the cake batterLine the same tin with more greaseproof paper and turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.View image in fullscreenSeparate the eggs into two large bowls and whisk the yolks with the sugar until the latter dissolves and the mixture begins to thicken.View image in fullscreenSieve in the cocoa powder and a pinch of salt, and stir gently to combine.7 Finish the batter and bakeView image in fullscreenBeat the egg whites until stiff, then stir a spoonful of them into the egg yolk mixture, just to loosen. Gently fold in the rest of the egg whites, then carefully spoon the mixture into the lined tin. Smooth out the top and bake for 35-40 minutes, until the cake is puffed up and set on top. Leave to cool completely in the tin (and be warned that it will sink slightly).8 Flavour the cakeDrain the cooked cherries and mix 50ml of their syrup with the kirsch. Use a bread knife to cut the cooled cake into three layers.View image in fullscreenSpoon some cherry syrup over the top of each one, being careful not to overload them. Whip the cream until it starts to thicken, then add the vanilla, sift in the icing sugar and whisk again until voluminous, but not stiff.9 Finishing touchesSpread a third of the jam on to the cooled pastry, then top that with a quarter of the cream and a third of the cooked cherries. Lay one of the three sponge cakes on top and repeat the jam, cream and cherry layers.View image in fullscreenRepeat again with a second sponge cake and more jam, cream and cherries.View image in fullscreenTop with the final sponge, spread with a voluptuous layer of cream and decorate with shaved chocolate and the reserved fresh cherries.Explore more on these topicsCakeFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodGerman food and drinkDessertBakingFruitChocolatefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eat at Inis, then walk back via the artisan fromagerie and the padel court.The Wick was not always thus, especially for diners. Those who knew the place in the noughties, before its decimation and reconstruction forthe 2012 London Olympics, may well lament those bygone days. At one point circa 2005,Forman’s fish restaurant, which boasted a “view of the canal”, was one of the – cough – sole options round these parts. Back then, the canal, where these days young things frolic, was a swamp of shopping trolleys and sad-looking swans, and your salmon en croute might be accompanied by the spectacle of dehydrated ravers trying to find home two days after Friday’s squat party. Gentrification has come at a price, though, with stratospheric rents, in particular, but there are now also street art tours, sourdough pizzas and a great many places where you can buy terrible pre-mixed cocktails.View image in fullscreen‘Absolutely homemade’: Inis’ potato scallops with chip shop-style curry sauce.None of that is anything quite like Inis, which is open for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, and owned and run byLynsey Coughlan, formerly ofthe Ginger Pigbutcher, and ex-art director Lindsay Lewis, alongside head chef Craig Johnson. Inis, from the offset, seemed determined to treat its clientele as grownups and its postcode as a proper community in need of a nice, neighbourhood restaurant. The place clearly wanted to be somewhere to come and come again, and to take your parents to whenever they were in town. There’s alfresco dining, though that’s possibly advisable only if you’re keen on Lime bikes, joggers and enjoying the cleaner, fresher canal. Oh, and importantly, especially if, like me, you only really like five people and two of those are Irish wolfhounds, it’s dog-friendly, too.View image in fullscreenInis’ Cornish turbot comes ‘festooned with sea vegetables’.Inis is Irish in spirit, but it isn’t Irish-themed. Yes, you can expect Guinness on draft, of course, and Irish breads all rich with treacle and rye, oysters from the west coast of Ireland, Sunday roasts and mince on toast. Irish people who miss their mother’s cooking might go for the house-glazed ham with coleslaw, the Ogleshield cheese pastries or thechicken fillet rollsinspired by days frittered away on Pearse Street in Dublin. At night, however, the dinner menu reaches for deliciously lofty moments when rare duck and cucumber meet tahini and sweet, punchy hoisin, when a tranche of Cornish turbot comes festooned with sea vegetables, when elegant house martinis match with delicate watermelon salads, and when hunks of rare onglet come piled with excellent, al dente bobby beans and assertive homemade horseradish.The style is fresh, hyper-seasonal and absolutely homemade. It’s this that draws me back here time and again, the from-scratch element of the cakes and breads, in particular, because that’s as rare as hen’s teeth in British casual dining. On my first visit to Inis in its opening weeks, I popped by for a mid-morning coffee and maybe some soda bread with raspberry jam, and perhaps even a bowl of hot smoked trout on new potatoes, but I was immediately seduced by a fearsome and glistening lump of fine-looking Guinness cake that seemed to wink at me from under its glass cloche. “Is it freshly made?” I asked Coughlan. She assured me that chef had only recently tipped this majestic beauty out of its tin, and that it would be on that evening’s dinner menu and served with custard. At that exact point, my love affair with Inis was born.View image in fullscreenInis’ Guinness cake: ‘As good as it gets.’Since then, the place has gone from strength to strength, serving fantastic fresh potato farls at breakfast with pots of strong tea, and good, wobbly french toast, but in some ways Inis is just as cheffy as fellow local canal-side dining spotCafe Cecilia, where it’s pretty much impossible to get a table these days. It is a little patch of sanity in a postcode that, despite the constant hammering and cement-flinging, will never truly feel finished or functional. The welcome is always warm and the food reliably wonderful. Yes, it might take you three or four tries to find it, and your GPS might ask you to wade through the canal and walk through Westfield Stratford to get there. And, yes, it will be at least half-filled by Hackney Wick people with perplexing hairstyles and sore-looking piercings. But, as far as gentrification goes, this slice of it comes laced with Guinness and has a thick layer of cream cheese icing. And that’s really as good as it gets.Inis13 Rookwood Way, Fish Island, London E3, 07850 400920. Open Weds 8am-3pm, Thurs & Fri 8am-11pm, Sat 8-11.30am & 1-11pm, Sun 8-11.30am & 1-6pm.

If he’d had a history of dating younger people, I wouldn’t have pursued it because I think there’s an inherent power imbalance that comes with age-gap relationships. It’s something we discussed from the start, but it doesn’t come up for us sexually. I’ve been with more sexual partners than Luke has, so I had more experience than him in terms of kink and BDSM.About 80% of our sex is BDSM, but we’re both very touchy people, so there’s a lot of cuddling throughout the day. We were actually evicted from our home due to noisy sex. We were getting complaints from the neighbours downstairs. At one point, the housing association office came to the door when we were having sex – we call it our bang to rights moment.We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don’t want to cause people alarm, but we’re very noisy creatures. Now we’ve got the mattresses on the floor, so we’ve learned our lesson.I’ve been on testosterone a year and a half and that comes with increased libido – our sex has been tipped up a levelWhen we met, I was pre-transition, and I worried that someone who found me attractive then might not fancy me after I’d taken testosterone. I had my guard up, and while I enjoyed Luke’s company, I really didn’t think much would come of it.But both of us are really happy to be proven wrong, and it is a really beautiful thing to have been on this journey with him, and to have shared this experience.Luke finds me just as attractive with a bit of facial hair. He’s been super supportive, and I’m more self-confident in my own body now. I’m far more comfortable with who I am, and that is a fantastic feeling. It’s all had a really positive effect on my life – and on our sex life. I’ve now been on testosterone for a year and a half, which comes with increased libido. My desires are stronger than ever and I’m a feistier in bed now. Every time I go to the gender clinic, we pick up about 60 packets of lube, which we get through in about three days.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

When you’ve got someone else on board with that uninhibited expression of human sexuality, I don’t think there’s any greater joy.Sex with Chris is joyous and fun. We can’t get enough of each other. We met at a bar three years ago, and when we first started going out I wasn’t sure if we’d be long term as there’s a 20-year age gap. I thought it would lead to problems, or an imbalance in terms of emotion and life experience. But we had such a connection and I found life was so much better with him.We also use a lot of restraints, and we’ve ended up having a wider arsenal of things to doThis is how we do it: ‘Our lives are absorbed by raising kids, and we struggle to find time for sex’Read moreWe did get carried away at the beginning. It was probably five times a day after we moved in together. I had just lost my job and we had a lot more free time together, and that’s when we had a lot of noise complaints from the neighbour. We probably could have handled it a wee bit more diplomatically, but life is short so you might as well just go for it.I’ve found that dirty talk can really enhance sex, it’s like a little bit of seasoning you put on the experience. We also use a lot of restraints and things like that, and we’ve ended up having a wide arsenal of things to do.In the last year, Chris has started taking hormone replacement therapy, and his treatment has allowed him to feel more comfortable in his own skin. To see that has been one of the most rewarding and exciting things in my life. Even just using the correct pronouns while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added was absolutely lovely.It’s really nice to be there for someone throughout this process, and to have defied his expectations that someone would want to stay with him. It has been amazing to see our relationship flourish.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first step is sharing how you feelAnnalisa BarbieriSun 31 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 12.15 EDTShareIam 53 and my husband is 60. When our relationship started, he was the forgetful one; I tended to remember everything. I have always been mindful that I might need to look after him in his old age. But I am a caring person, and always thought I would manage.This is not how things have worked out. My husband is pretty healthy, while I amsuffering the beginnings of a noticeable cognitive decline– forgetfulness, overwhelm and a decrease in mobility– which I haven’t been to the doctorabout yet.My husband is not a very outwardly caring person, and Ihave no idea if he willcare enoughto look after me if I become more immobile orstart to forget things more. I want to feel loved, but I don’t.This is sad in itself, and really scary for the future.I have had some health challenges in the last year and am doing my best tolook after myself. My husband gives me a lot of advice about my weight and health, but he doesn’t walk or talk more slowly ifI struggle to keep up.Today we went to the cinema as a family. Ibookedit, paid and drove, but my husband and kidswalked offtothe cinemawithout me and I couldn’t catch up.I want to be together, but I’mleft behind.Thisfeels like a metaphor for our life.What I really wantmy husband to say is, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you, and you take care of me.” But I just don’t think he’s capable of it.Your letter was one of the saddest I’ve read. Not because it is without hope – quite the opposite – but because this gap between you and your family could be bridged with communication. But I know that takes courage.Please go to the doctor. A proper checkup could put your mind at rest, or give you concrete answers to present to your family. So many women your age, who have had a lifetime of looking after others, are exhausted and overwhelmed – not because they are failing, but because they are so capable. It’s time to start looking after you.Who took care of you when you were growing up? It seems you were taught to be the caring person who would always manageUKCP registered psychotherapist Meeri Rebane was “moved by your letter and your courage in asking for help. It seems that being the strong physically capable ‘carer’ is a role you’ve carried throughout your life. From the start of your relationship with your husband, you took on the responsibility of thinking about what and who needs taking care of in the family.” Rebane went on to say that there’s “nothing wrong with that, people can get great fulfilment from caring for others, but who took care of you when you were growing up? It seems you were taught to be the ‘caring person who would always manage’, but also that to ‘not manage’ was not OK.”We wondered if this was why you don’t feel you can ask for help now? I wondered about your life when you were a child.

Is it too late for her to try?Read moreWhen you’re the planner and the fixer, you and your needs can become invisible because you just get on with it. I don’t think your husband and children are uncaring – after all, you’ve shown them a lifetime of how to do it – but it’s very likely they have no idea at all how you feel.“Your husband may not be capable of giving you the response you need at first,” says Rebane. “His way of expressing care may be different to yours. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to take care of you. If you don’t tell him what you need, however, he can’t even try to support you.”Asking for things when we’re not sure we will get them is scary, but where you are feels scary too. I know it’s another thing you have to instigate (if only our families were mind-readers!) but seeing the doctor and then being clear and realistic about your needs is a really good way to help them help you.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

Some bring good news: you have overpaid and are owed a refund, but others claim you owe money. In both cases there’s an imminent deadline to act – sometimes with the threat of legal action, or penalties if you don’t.Scammers are taking advantage of people’s fears over bills to steal personal and banking information. Automated phone calls, and messages sent by text and email, typically tell you that you need to click on a link and log in to make a payment or claim a refund.In the year to 31 July, HMRC received more than 170,000 reports of scams, of which more than 47,000 involved fake refunds. These happen year-round, but often catch people out around the time of deadlines for self-assessment tax returns.HMRC says it will never contact you in that way to ask you to claim a refund, or give personal details, and that it never leaves voicemail messages threatening legal action or arrest.What the scam looks likeMessages can be very convincing and bear the logo and details of HMRC.View image in fullscreenHow emails from scammers can look.Photograph: HMRCThey will tell you to act quickly so you feel panicked into responding.View image in fullscreenScammers often try to invoke a sense of urgency.Photograph: HMRCThere will be a link, and the website it takes you to may also be very convincing.

Sadly, after this, I abandoned my DIY approach to fashionHannah Jane ParkinsonSun 31 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareI would love to have picked something super cute: a sparkly tutu; an adorable pair of Mary Janes. Or something cool: an oversized denim jacket with the collar popped, perhaps.But no. Here is an entirely unhinged photograph of me aged four wearing a homemade (obviously) hat – strong papal vibes unintentional – embellished with drawings of my teddy (name: Ted) and with actual Ted himself affixed to the hat. I am also wearing two anchoring hair slides because of the weight of this magnificent creation. This is a look that speaks to the boundless creativity of childhood, of making your own fun as the rest of the family snoozes in the late afternoon sun, in a time before the attention economy was monopolised by algorithms.I am holding my favourite stuffed toy, an elephant named Elephant (shut up). Elephant is wearing his own similarly styled hat, but he has his own likeness on it. I agree that this could be said to lack humility on Elephant’s part, but I should also point out that Mick Jagger is frequentlyphotographed in Rolling Stones T-shirts. American art collectiveMSCHF think they are being outre with theirBig Red Boot, but nothing since circa 1994 (when this picture was taken, on a holiday in Mallorca) has come close to the majestic whimsy of these hats. Nothing.Fashion is a notoriously circular phenomenon. I see gen Z wearing the same outfits I did as a teenager, and few things are more humbling than finding out that clothes you stopped wearing not long ago are now considered “vintage pieces”. But you will not find these hats on Depop. If there were any justice in the world, you would find them inthe Costume Instituteat the Met.I still love a hat. Like all women who sleep with women, I am no stranger to a Carhartt beanie; and I have recently entered my Cap Era. I like to think I’m giving “off-duty celebrity”, but it is possible that I am giving “undercover cop being very bad at being undercover”.There are other elements from my juvenescent style that I retain: mostly a deep and enduring love of corduroy in all its forms, sweatshirts louder than the sun, and trousers that are oversized (but these days purposely so) – but my DIY approach to accessories is no longer. I stopped at beaded friendship bracelets and “personalising” my jelly shoes with permanent marker as a tween – so I have a lot of respect for adults who knit their own clothes and tie-dye old T-shirts, YouTube tutorial playing in the background. But, look, sometimes you just have to quit while you – and your toy elephant – are ahead.Explore more on these topicsFashionChildrenYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Slovenian capital Ljubljana may be less than an hour away, but here in the Jezersko valley, just 3 miles from the Austrian border, it feels like another world.Bordered on the east by the Kamnik-Savinja Alps, and on the west by the peaks of the Karavanke mountain range, and with a tranquil green lake at the bottom of the valley, there’s a tangible sense of apartness – an idyllic escape from the world.View image in fullscreenBefore being confiscated by the communists in 1947, the farm had been in the same family for more than 500 years. It was returned in 2005 and passed down to current owner, Polona, by her grandmother. Today, three generations of her family live here and it’s very much a working farm as well as a place to stay. There’s camping in the meadow under the ash trees in summer (bring your own tent), parking for caravans and a choice of simple rooms and self-catering apartments in the farm buildings. Mine, up in the attic of the ancient farmhouse, has been restored using reclaimed wood. Resident goats, two big dogs, cats and chickens wander free-range, and Jezersko–Solčava sheep graze in the fields – though in summer they are taken up to the alpine pastures.It’s all very eco. Water comes from a glacier, heating is generated by wood chips from trees felled in the local forest, and all food is organic and grown on site (three polytunnels mean vegetables are harvested year-round). With the addition of new solar panels, the farm hopes to be fully self-sustaining next year.View image in fullscreenMountain stream-fed Lake Planšar is perfect for a bracing dip.Photograph: 24K-Production/AlamyVolunteers return time and again to help out in exchange for food and accommodation. Peggy and Pat Rebol, who’ve come from the US for the third time, tell me: “This place is magic, it’s not only the lake and the valley, it’s the people – this family captured our hearts and all we want to do is keep coming back.”I’ve come here to hike, so after a breakfast of meats and cheeses, homemade yoghurt and freshly collected eggs, I set out with Drejc Karničar, Polona’s husband (who also happens to be mayor of Jezersko’s 700 inhabitants). As we walk through forest towards the mountains, Drejc points out a rare “golden shoes” orchid at the edge of the wood. I’m not much of a botanist but this delightful plant lives up to its name – each yellow flower looks exactly like a Cinderella shoe. “They only bloom for 14 days,” says Drejc, “you’re lucky.”The hike up has wire cables screwed into the sheer mountain sides, wooden bridges and at one point a ladder across the rockWe make our way up toČeška koča(the Czech hut), a mountain lodge that was named Slovenia’s “hut of the year” in 2024. You can stay overnight or just grab a hearty lunch on the way up the mountain (the hut is open June to September; book by phone on +386 4028 3300). These high alpine slopes are where Drejc drives his sheep to graze for the summer. They used to go to a different pasture, he tells me, but that was on the bears’ commuting path and “those bears had a party”.The hike up feels like an Indiana Jones obstacle course, with wire cables screwed into the sheer mountain sides, wooden bridges and at one point a ladder across the rock.Drejc comes up to check on the sheep once a week in summer andbrings them salt, essential to their diet.View image in fullscreenA room at Senkova DomačijaMountain highs: biking and bivvying in SloveniaRead moreThe next day, I set my sights on summiting Velika Baba, known locally as Mount Baba, about 15 minutes’ drive from the farm. This is a far more demanding climb, so I’m accompanied by expert mountain guideTomo Česen. As we walk through the forest and climb towards the summit vibrant blue alpine flowers are strewn across the rocks, and purple heather borders the trail. There are no cables and the exposed ridge is slightly terrifying. I’m roped to Tomo for safety and scramble along, trying not to look down. Just as I reach the top, the clouds part cinematically, the sky clears, the snowy mountain peaks gleam white against the blue and I catch my breath – literally and figuratively.Tomo tells me this ridge marks the border between Austria and Slovenia, and on the way back we pass one of the original border stones, engraved with “SR” for Slovenian Republic. I pause for a moment, with one foot in Austria and the other in Slovenia, thinking I need to brush up on my history.Supper back at the farm is cooked by Polona (available Tuesday to Saturday, book in advance) and served outside, weather-permitting, accompanied by a panoramic view of the mountains. I tuck into Slovenian beef noodle soup, “Easter bread” (simple and rustic) with home-made salami, and lamb and potatoes with salad from the greenhouses.View image in fullscreenThe area is characterised by meadows, mountains and ornate churches.Photograph: Aliaksandr Mazurkevich/AlamyThe next day I cycle from the farm down to the village through an avenue of ash trees and across a flower meadow, known locally as “frog square”, to meetTanja Rebolj, a self-taughtčarovnica(herbalist), who makes a variety of teas, jams and herb-infused liquors that she sells from her home. She tells me there are more than 1,200 species of plant in the valley, one of the richest places to forage in Slovenia – and she sometimes runs workshops on herbs for visitors.Alongside its abundance of flowers and herbs, Jezersko is also one of the most densely forested valleys in the country, andAndreja Koširis my guide to the woods. A former UN translator, she now leads various forest experiences (family audio walk, €210). Hooked up with super-sensitive microphones and recording equipment, we stroll among the trees pausing to listen and record the “hidden sounds of nature”. An ants’ nest sounds just as frenetic as you might imagine. And when Andreja inserts specialist needle microphones into the earth, I hear water moving deep underground. “What fascinates me about nature,” she says, “is that trees can communicate so well. Beech trees are especially talkative – they exchange lots of information.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Today, the emerald green, heart-shaped, artificial Lake Planšar, proves irresistible as I cycle past. I gasp as I jump in – it’s bone-jarringly cold and I emerge flushed pink and energised, then ride home through sunlit meadows.On my last day, as the bells of St Andrej’s church ring out the hour, volunteers are busy in the farm’s Peter Rabbit gardens, chickens scratch at the grass and the sun slants through the apple trees.

So what’s the appeal? One writer and his reluctant companion join 30 other dogs at a showing of The Fantastic Four to find outWords:Tim Dowling. Photographs: Irina WerningSun 31 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 12.14 EDTShareIknow we’re off to a bad start when Jean refuses to board a tube train bound for central London. She plants herself on the platform and will not be moved. In the end I have to pick her up and carry her – squirming in protest and heavy – over the threshold. When the doors slide shut the woman standing next to me in the packed carriage asks if my dog has ever been on a train before.“No,” I say. “Can you tell?”“How far are you going?” she says.“Canary Wharf,” I say, “where we change trains, and then … ” The look of concern – or possibly scorn – on the woman’s face is such that I don’t finish my sentence: and then we’re going to the cinema.To be honest, I’d rank pet-friendly film-going pretty low on my list of needs. Taking your dog to the cinema strikes me as a bizarre and counterintuitive bit of entitlement. I go to the cinema to getawayfrom my dog.Dog-friendly screenings first appeared in Britain a decade ago and have been spreading steadily since the end of Covid restrictions. Greenwich Picturehouse in south-east London, where we’re heading, schedules dogs-allowed showings for Sunday mornings, when people are already out with their pets. But why?View image in fullscreenCanine and human film fans get set for a screening in Canterbury“It’s a community thing,” says deputy manager Mike Miles. “It gives people a chance to meet up with their dogs, and come and chill out. For us it’s about providing that experience. And obviously we get to look at the cute dogs as they come in and make a fuss of them.”I won’t lie: the idea filled me with such dread that I rang up ahead of time for some reassurance. How did it work? Did I need to buy a ticket for my dog, next to me?“It’s unallocated seating, just choose a seat when you arrive,” the customer service representative said. “And you don’t need to book one for the dog.”This summer, the photographer Irina Werning, who is from Argentina, wanted to spend a month focused on a very British story. “It had to be dogs,” she says. To her, dog-friendly cinema represents a level of canine indulgence you just don’t see in other countries. “There are 18 cinemas that offer this just in London,” she says, “and more across the UK. I think there is one in Paris.”Some cinemas restrict dogs to the floor, but the Picturehouse chain allows them on the seats, as long as you use one of the fleece blankets provided. On dog days they restrict sales to half capacity to make sure there’s plenty of space. They also lower the volume of the film slightly and keep the house lights dimly lit, making this not unlike the baby-friendly or “relaxed” screenings cinemas often schedule for autistic people or those with dementia. It opens up film-going to people who might not otherwise have access to it, and is an opportunity to fill cinema seats on an early weekend morning.View image in fullscreenAt the Curzon in Victoria, London …View image in fullscreen… Superman and Krypto the Superdog keep their canine audience grippedWerning spent August photographing dog-friendly screenings, often shooting on her knees to capture the dogs’ perspective. To minimise disruption, she took pictures only in the 15 minutes before the film started and the 15 minutes after it finished. In between, she took a seat and waited. “I saw The Fantastic Four twice, Jurassic Park twice,” she says. “I saw Superman … ”My dog and I, frazzled after our journey, arrive in good time for the 11am showing ofThe Fantastic Four: First Steps. There are dogs and owners outside, waiting to be let in. Because we are both still mildly hysterical, we keep a respectful distance until the doors open.“It’s our first time,” I say to the woman on the refreshment stand.“Exciting!” she says. I shrug.“She knows nothing of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” I say. I don’t say: neither do I.Picturehouse launched dog-friendly screenings in 2017 and half their sites regularly hold them; here in Greenwich they do one or two a month.“The next one isThe Materialists,” says the man checking tickets.“Oh, great,” I say.View image in fullscreenSusy and Pies watch Superman together at the Hackney Picturehouse in LondonWe walk in as the adverts are beginning. There are about 15 dogs in the room, and I pick two seats as distant from anyone else as possible – fourth row, far right aisle. But the place is filling up; there will be about 30 dogs by the end – mostly poodle crosses and sleepy lurchers. As I predicted, my dog is beside herself: she can’t believe she’s in a room full of dogs, without a ball in sight. I pat the seat beside me and she climbs on to it. Leaning in close, I speak to her in the quiet but commanding tone I plan to adopt for the next two hours.“I should warn you,” I say, “there might not be any dogs in this film.”It’s a question I’ve been asking myself: is dog-friendly cinema just for the owners? Do the dogs get anything out of going, apart from not being left home alone?“It’s for the humans, obviously,” Miles says. “If it’s got a dog in it, great, that’s cute. But you’re bringing your dog along more for the socialising aspect of being around other dogs and doing something new. It’s fun to put a dog-themed film on now and again, but we do find they sell the least tickets, because people are just like: why would I want to come and watch Beethoven?”Barking at the box office: can a dead dog make a movie lead?Read moreBut according to Werning, a dog angle can make a real difference. “Superman has a lot of scenes with dogs and people were going wild,” she says. “The dogs were all barking and people were laughing like an orchestra together, looking at each other and enjoying it.”Just before the lights go down in Greenwich, a couple with a tiny lapdog sit down behind us. Jean, a labrador cross, immediately tries to bound over the seats to introduce herself. The little dog growls. I grip the lead tightly. I want to explain to the couple that they have chosen their seats poorly; that my dog’s interactions with other dogs – especially tiny, hostile dogs – are characterised by a kind of doomed optimism. She will not give up trying to be friends just because the other dog hates her. Unless one of us moves, I want to say, we are in for a long afternoon.But the film has started and, for the moment at least, it’s blowing my dog’s mind. The opening montage of the Fantastic Four’s past heroics is probably the biggest, strangest thing she has ever seen. She sits bolt upright, her eyes darting all over the screen: explosions, music, people shouting. We’re both gripped, and neither of us has the slightest idea what’s going on.The dog remains rapt for almost a full minute before turning to look at me in perplexity, and whining softly.“The woman and the stretchy one are married,” I say. “That’s all I know.”View image in fullscreenTaro and Pomelo compare notes at the Hackney PicturehouseJean wheels round and sticks her snout between our seat backs. The little dog behind growls. I pull on the lead. Jean jumps off the seat and prowls around under my feet. The other dogs are silent and still. It’s actually one of the best behaved cinema audiences I have ever seen. There is an occasional yap from the back – perhaps three in all – but that’s it. It occurs to me that all these dogs have been to the cinema before. It feels as if Jean and I are the only ones not following the plot.Half an hour in, I produce a dog treat, unintentionally letting the dog see that I’ve brought the whole packet with me. For 15 minutes Jean is entirely fixated on my rucksack, until the treats are gone. Then she curls up in her seat and falls asleep. A little later, so do I.View image in fullscreenTim Dowling’s selfie of him and Jean at The Fantastic Four viewingAs I’m drifting off, I think: this must be what dog-friendly cinema is all about – a chance for you and your pet to sit in the dark together and sleep through loud noises. Then again, we could do this at home. We often do. Why pay to take your dog to the movies?“Lots of people I asked why they brought their dogs said: because it’s cheaper than daycare,” Werning says. “And I’m like, what? You leave your dog in daycare every time you leave your house? And they said yes, because the dogs suffer. This, I think, is also something our generation is carrying, this overprotection of pets.”I am woken by a sharp constriction in my left ankle – the lead is wrapped once round my leg and the dog is in the aisle, trying to get to a lurcher one row up and six seats over. The lurcher has some kind of soft toy, and Jean wants it. I try to calm her down, to coax her back to her seat, but she’s having none of it. After a blissful five-minute nap I’m suddenly back to wondering: what’s the worst thing that could happen, and is it about to?“There are occasions where dogs don’t get on with each other, little tiffs, shall we say,” Miles tells me later. “But we’ve never had to break anything up, which is good. It’s enough dealing with humans.”Jean will not retake her seat, or settle anywhere else. At about the hour and 10 minute mark, with my arms aching from holding the lead, I decide we both need a break from the film. I take the dog into the empty lobby, where we sit for a moment to collect ourselves.“Did you notice that the big stone guy was cousin Richie from The Bear?” I say. The dog stares up at me with a look of boundless urgency, and I decide we are never going to find out how The Fantastic Four ends.MarmadukeView image in fullscreenOne seasoned canine cinemagoer is Marmaduke, a 12-and-a-half-year-old pug. “He is very well behaved, sitting on our laps,” says Nick, watching with him at the Curzon in Canterbury, but he is choosy about his films: “If it’s bad, he’ll go to sleep; if it’s good, he’ll watch attentively.” His favourites? “Anything with fish, fruit or other dogs. He has good taste.”Blue and EliasView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFor Lynne, a trip to the Hackney Picturehouse isn’t complete without her five-year-old shih-tzu Blue, a “very chill dog” who typically sleeps through films. Superman wouldn’t normally be their first choice, but the promise of Krypto the Superdog sealed the deal for them, as presumably it did for Elias, too. The two-year-old Italian greyhound never arrives at the cinema underdressed. His outfit here is just one of many his film buddy Nick has styled for their cinema trips: “When we went to see Wicked, he wore a little witch hat.”BrugoView image in fullscreenBrugo came to the Chiswick Cinema in London with Lino and his wife, Anika, who found out about dog-friendly screenings through a blogger in 2024. They are now a favourite outing for the laid-back 11-year-old Pomeranian Japanese spitz mix, who usually snoozes through the action or snacks on popcorn, stirring only when another dog barks: “He’s a very good boy.”Additional reporting: Sundus AbdiExplore more on these topicsDogsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His sentence could reach 43 years, meaning the 70-year-old grandfather could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Bolsonaro stands accused of five crimes including involvement in an armed criminal organisation, coup d’état and violently attempting to abolish Brazilian democracy.Prosecutors have claimed one part of the sprawling conspiracy, codenamed Operation Green and Yellow Dagger, included plans to sow chaos – and justify a military intervention – by murdering Lula, his vice-president, Geraldo Alckmin, andAlexandre de Moraes, a supreme court judge, who is now overseeing Bolsonaro’s trial.Federal police investigators allege the pro-Bolsonaro coup only failed because the heads of the army and air force, Gen Marco Antônio Freire Gomes and Brig Gen Carlos de Almeida Baptista Júnior,refused to take part. The navy commander Adm Almir Garnier Santos, who is one of the seven alleged accomplices also standing trial, has been accused of offering his support, charges he denies.“The [prosecution’s] closing arguments are really hard-hitting – there’s so much evidence … It’s really hard to imagine an acquittal,” Eloísa Machado, a constitutional law expert from the Getulio Vargas Foundation law school, said of Bolsonaro.Such predictions are music to the ears of Leitão, the activist trumpeter, who hopes judges will throw the book at a politician he blames for trying to wreck Brazilian democracy and destroying Brazilian lives. During Bolsonaro’s 2019-2022 presidency, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians were killed by a Covid pandemic that the ex-president was accused of mishandling withhis anti-scientific responseand sluggish purchase of vaccines.“It’s going to be a moment of joy to see the country free itself of this instrument of destruction,” said Leitão, whom fans call the“Trompetista”– a play on the words “trumpeter” and “petista”, as members of Lula’s Worker’s party (PT) are known. “We always complain about our democracy and how fragile it is. But we’re doing much better than the United States, which never arrested Trump.”In the run-up to this week’s judgment, Donald Trump, who is Bolsonaro’s most powerful foreign friend, has waded into the courtroom drama, imposingsanctions on Moraes, the justice leading the trial, and 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports in protest at the supposed “witch-hunt” against his ally. “It’s really a political execution that they’re trying to do with Bolsonaro,” Trump declared recently.Bolsonaro’s third son, the congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, has relocated to the US and busied himself lobbying Trump officials to target Brazil’s top tribunal and Lula allies such as the health minister, whose wife and daughter were stripped of their US visas. “Trump is our only way out,” the president of Bolsonaro’s Liberal party, Valdemar Costa Neto,recently told reporters.Analysts believe the US coercion campaign will fail to sway the judges who will decide Bolsonaro’s fate. In a rare interview on the eve of the judgment, Moraes vowed to shrug off US pressure. “There isn’t the smallest of possibilities of retreating even one millimetre,” he told the Washington Post. “We’ll do what’s right: we’ll receive the accusation, analyse the evidence, and who should be convicted shall be convicted, and who should be absolved shall be absolved.”‘Classic tinpot dictator’: Trump exports his assault on democracy to BrazilRead moreBolsonaro, who wasplaced under house arrest in early Augustafter violating a court order banning him from using social media, denies engineering a coup.

It was a rare concession in response to mounting public anger.By Monday, “lawmakers will see certain allowances scrapped and overseas work trips suspended under a new moratorium,” Prabowo said.Police set up checkpoints across Jakarta on Monday, with more protest gatherings planned in several locations around Indonesia’s vast archipelago. A police spokesperson told broadcaster Kompas TV that officers were also patrolling the city to “protect” citizens and give a sense of security.Police had deployed a convoy of armoured cars and motorbikes to parliament late on Sunday, in a show of force to warn off protesters.The defence minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, a close ally of Prabowo, warned on Sunday that the military and police would take “firm action” against “rioters and looters”, after the house of the finance minister was pillaged.In anticipation of further unrest, TikTok on Saturday temporarily suspended its live feature for “a few days” in Indonesia, where it has more than 100m users.Fire kills three people in Indonesia after protesters torch council buildingsRead moreAfter nationwide protests escalated across the world’s third-largest democracy last week, Prabowo during the weekend summoned the country’s prominent figures and cancelled a high-profile trip to China. He met 16 religious figures and eight political leaders, including former president Megawati Sukarnopurti, the chair of the country’s only formal opposition party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle.Five days of protests began in Jakarta on Monday, sparked by reports that all 580 lawmakers receive amonthly housing allowance of 50m rupiah($3,075) in addition to their salaries. The allowance, introduced last year, is almost 10 times the Jakarta minimum wage.View image in fullscreenPresident Prabowo Subianto meets the family of Affan Kurniawan, a ride-hailing driver Affan Kurniawan who was run over and killed by police during protests in Jakarta on Thursday.Photograph: BPMI Presidential Secretariat/Cahyo/Sutantaaditya.com/ShutterstockCritics argue the new allowance is not only excessive but also insensitive at a time when most people are grappling with soaring living costs and taxes and rising unemployment.The protests grew wider and more violent after the death of 21-year-old ride-hailing driver Affan Kurniawan. A video on social media apparently showing his death during a rally in Jakarta on Thursday shocked the nation and spurred an outcry against the security forces.Kurniawan was reportedly completing a food delivery order when he was caught in the clash. Witnesses told local television that the armoured car from the National Police’s mobile brigade unit suddenly sped through the crowd of demonstrators and hit Kurniawan, causing him to fall. Instead of stopping, the car ran over him.Prabowo said police are investigating seven officers over the incident.The death toll from riots that broke out in multiple cities rose to six after the Amikom Yogyakarta University confirmed the death of 21-year-old student Rheza Sendy Pratama in protests on Friday. The circumstances around his death remain unclear.At least three people were killed in the eastern city of Makassar on Friday after a fire was started by protesters at a council building.Another victim died in Makassar on Friday after he was beaten by a mob on suspicion that he was an intelligence officer, local disaster agency official Muhammad Fadli Tahar told Agence France-Presse on Sunday.Prabowo reiterated that his government respects freedom of expression as guaranteed in Indonesia’s constitution and international conventions.“But when demonstrations turn anarchic, destroying public facilities, endangering lives, and attacking private homes or public institutions, this becomes a serious violation of law,” he said.Prabowo cautioned that violent acts risked veering into treason and terrorism, and warned “the state would not tolerate attempts to destabilise the country”.The former general further called on the public to express their aspirations in a peaceful and constructive manner, and promised their voices will be heard.“I sincerely ask all citizens to trust the government and remain calm,” Prabowo said, adding his government “is determined to always fight for the interests of the people and the nation.”Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaPrabowo SubiantoAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The SCO is a 10-member bloc of Eurasian nations, and the summit is also being attended by the leaders of 16 observer or “dialogue partner” nations.Xi personally welcomed several leaders including the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Turkish president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, before the delegates attended a formal reception.Xi told the welcome reception that in the past century there had been a “significant increase in instability, uncertainty and unpredictable factors”, and that the SCO had become an “important force in promoting the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind”.Footage published by Russian state media showed Xi and Putin, who arrived in Tianjin with an entourage of senior politicians and business representatives, warmly greeting each other at a photocall before calling in an interpreter for a lengthy and animated conversation.Putin and several other attenders are expected to stay on for a military parade in Beijing on Wednesday to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which China refers to as the war of resistance against Japanese aggression. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, isalso expected to attend.The Tianjin summit is the largest held by the bloc since it was formed in 2001. The SCO is a key part of Beijing’s push for stronger multilateral alternatives to western or US-led blocs such as Nato.Putin told the Chinese state news agency Xinhua on Saturday that the SCO meeting would “consolidate solidarity” among the Eurasian nations and “help shape a fairer multipolar world order”.The goal appears to have been helped by the upheaval brought by Trump’s tariff regime and other foreign policy moves. Modi and Xi’s meeting took place five days after Washington imposed punishing 50% tariffs on Indian goods due to Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.It isModi’s first visit to China in seven years, and comesamid efforts by China and Indiato rebuild trade ties and resolve long-running Himalayan border disputes.“We are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities,” Modi said after meeting Xi.Xi said China-India ties could be “stable and far-reaching” if both sides focused on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, state media reported.In a meeting with Erdoğan, Xi said China and Turkey should strengthen cooperation in the area of counter-terrorism, according to Chinese state media. Xi also met leaders of the Maldives, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and the autocratic leader of Belarus,Alexander Lukashenko, a key ally of Putin.The bilateral talks were held at the Tianjin Guest House, an intimate venue surrounded by lush greenery. Large sections of Tianjin were closed to traffic and a significant police presence was deployed around the city.Lim Chuan-Tiong, a researcher with the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia at the University of Tokyo, said Putin and Xi meeting again was a sign of the continuation of their “limitless” partnership, and closing ranks while both deal with a common foe – the US.“As long as the mutual opponent [US] has not been defeated, China and Russia’s off-limits cooperation will remain,” Lim said. “Their cooperation also serves to highlight a global order that exists beyond the United States.”Moscow’s claims over Ukraine and its full invasion in 2022, as well as Beijing’s claim over Taiwan and threats to invade, have further isolated both governments from western and other democracies.Russian analysts have saidthe Ukraine war is now a main pillar of the bilateral relationship and that Moscow would want know how Beijing would respond if the US were to ask it to put pressure on Russia to end the fighting.“The longer the war [on Ukraine] drags on, the more Russia will need China’s assistance, whether economically or other forms,” Lim said. “China also recognises that it is unlikely for Sino-US relations to return to their pre-2018 state and thus has no choice but to accept a close alignment with Russia.”Beijing purports to take a neutral stance on the Ukraine war but has become an economic lifeline for Russia, and Ukraine has accused it of providing direct aid to Moscow’s campaign. The two countries have separately increased joint military drills.A Chinese academic who spoke on condition of anonymity said Moscow had expected more support from its ally but Beijing had been at pains to avoid further punitive sanctions.“China says there is ‘no limit’ but in practice it hesitates, constantly looking over its shoulder, wary of pressure from the west, the EU and Nato. It has never really taken Russia seriously – and Russia saw through this long ago,” the academic said.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingVladimir PutinRussiaNarendra ModiIndiaRecep Tayyip ErdoğannewsShareReuse this content"

Lyon “continues to stand firm against hatred, antisemitism and racism”, the mayor said.The memorial was unveiled in January to mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp.The number of antisemitic incidents recorded in France has risen sharply since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the start of Israel’s retaliatory offensive, which has killed at least 63,000 Palestinians, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry.The French interior ministry said last week that 27% fewer anti-Jewish acts were recorded in France in the first six months of 2025 than in the same period the previous year, but that the number was more than twice as high as in the first half of 2023.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has accused Emmanuel Macron of contributing to a surge in antisemitism by calling for international recognition of a Palestinian state, a claim theFrench president describedas “abject” and “erroneous”.This week the French government, which has publicly denounced antisemitism and increased security at synagogues and other Jewish centres,summoned the US ambassador to Parisafter he accused it of not doing enough to stem anti-Jewish hate crimes.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Their lawyer, Elsa Crozatier, submitted a formal case accusing the state authorities of “serious failings” 18 months ago, but says there has been no answer. Crozatier will go to court in Paris on Monday to ask a judge to force them to respond.“I am scandalised by the hypocritical attitude of the state. It claims its priority is combating violence against women but the authorities failed to protect Sandra when she asked for help several times,” Crozatier told the Guardian.“It’s been four years and we’ve had no explanations of what happened and why. We’ve been told it wouldn’t happen today, but we’ve no idea what has changed.”Between 3 January 2021 when Pla, 31, ended their relationship and 18 June 2021, Falou, 40, bombarded her with 317 text messages and telephoned her 67 times. His almost daily presence outside her home was recorded by the doorbell camera her parents installed, but police said Falou was on the public highway and could not be prosecuted. Finally, Pla’s mother, Annie, and stepfather, Gérard, moved from Spain into her small apartment in Bordeaux to protect their daughter, who was so scared her doctor signed her off work for 15 days.In April 2021, police referred the case to social services, who recommended Falou be “made aware of the seriousness of his actions” and be obliged to undergo medical treatment. The following month, the Bordeaux family court granted Pla custody of the couple’s four-year-old daughter, limiting Falou to supervised access for two hours every fortnight.On 1 July, less than two days after he was put under investigation for harassment and ordered not to go near Pla, he killed her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They sent a letter that we found in her postbox after she died,” Crozatier said.Last year, 136 women were killed by partners or ex-partners inFrance, a rise of more than 44% on 2023. In the last five years, the French state has faced several cases brought by victims’ families who accuse it of failing to act to prevent the killings. In June, the state was ordered to pay €27,000 (£23,000) to the family of Nathalie Debaillie, killed by her former partner in Lille in 2019. It is facing at least two other cases, not including Pla’s: the murder of Chahinez Daoud, 31, who was burned alive by her husband in 2021 and the killing of Patricia Gomit, 51, by her ex-partner in 2022.Bernard Grelon, the state’s legal representative in the Pla case, said: “The state’s legal representative is reserving his comments for the court and I have no statement to make prior to the hearing.”Pla’s mother said last year: “For my daughter it’s too late, but women are still being killed. I cannot sit back with my arms crossed and do nothing.”Explore more on these topicsFranceFemicideEuropeViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the summer of 2015, and in a small flat in Amman, Jordan, this young Syrian’s only thought was how to turn a long and arduous journey into something more bearable. The engineering student had fledSyriathree and a half years earlier after refusing to enlist in the brutal regime’s army. He was now ready to begin a new chapter of his life, starting with a new task: to reunite with his younger sisters, still trapped in Damascus, and lead them to Germany, where their brother was living.“I was never worried or stressed about the trip,” says Somar, just 27 years old at the time. “I never had any thought about danger or failure. My only thoughts were how I could make the trip a happy adventure for me and my sisters.“For some reason,” he adds, “I was sure that I would arrive safely in Germany.’’View image in fullscreenSomar attends lessons in speaking everyday German, frequented mainly by Syrian and Iraqi refugees, in 2016.View image in fullscreenSomar and Lubna at a bus station in Catania, Sicily, where Somar and his sister were invited to speak at a festival about their journey.In 2015, nearly 1 million asylum seekers attempted to reachEurope– it was a year officials and aid workers would later describe as the peak of the migration crisis, that would put to the test the core values of the EU – itself born from the ashes of a war that displaced millions. At a press conference at a refugee camp in Dresden on 31 August, the then German chancellor Angela Merkel said “Wir schaffen das”(“We can do this”) as the country opened its borders to those in need.Today, Somar and his sisters’ journey would be immeasurably more difficult. Ten years have passed since then. A decade in which migration has reshaped political landscapes across the continent and paved the way for the rise of far-right parties.Map showing Somar Kreker’s route through EuropeThe year before, in 2014, Somar’s brother, Mousab, had managed to get from Libya to Sicily with his pregnant wife by boat. But for him, repeating that journey with his sisters was not an option: it was too dangerous. A few months earlier, on 18 April 2015, a fishing boat designed to carry no more than 30 passengers, crammed with more than 1,000 asylum seekers, collided with a Portuguese freighter that had approached to offer help. The vessel sank in the dark waters off the Sicilian coast. Most of the bodies would remain trapped inside the hull, wedged about 400 metres deep on the seabed. More than 800 people would lose their lives in what became the deadliest shipwreck in the history of the European migration crisis.There was only one alternative. Perhaps less deadly, but longer and more exhausting: the Balkan route, which, after travelling from Turkey to Greece in a rubber dinghy, cuts across at least four countries, through mountains and – in the colder months – snow-covered forests.View image in fullscreenLubna and Salsabil took a train from North Macedonia to the Serbian border in October 2015.View image in fullscreenLubna, left, waits for a train to Stuttgart en route to Schwäbisch Gmünd, where her brother had been living for a year.View image in fullscreenLubna, Somar’s youngest sister, in Mosbach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.“The plan was to meet my sisters, Salsabil, 21, and Lubna, 14, in Istanbul. They were arriving on a flight from Damascus. I reached Turkey on a flight from Amman,” says Somar.After a cross-country bus ride, they reached Kaş, a coastal town on Turkey’s Mediterranean shore, where smugglers would ferry them across to the Greek island of Kastellorizo – for about €1,000 each.View image in fullscreenSomar, centre, in Kaş, southern Turkey, looking out to the Greek island of Kastellorizo, just under 4 miles away, in September 2015.View image in fullscreenSomar and friends swim two days after reaching Greece.“We established my sisters would leave before me,” says Somar. “That was the most dramatic moment of my journey. Thinking that they had to cross alone – from Turkey to Greece – on a dinghy, drove me crazy with anxiety.”A few days before, on 13 September, at least 34 people, including 15 babies and children, drowned when their overcrowded boat capsized in high winds off the Aegean island of Farmakonisi. According to data from the UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, and International Organization forMigration(IOM), approximately 731 people died in the Aegean Sea attempting to reach Greece in rubber dinghies in 2015.Fortunately, the sea was calm that day and his sisters arrived safely in Kastellorizo – followed a few days later by Somar. Kastellorizo had experienced an influx of migrants, who now significantly outnumbered the residents.1:30Footage captured by Alessio Mamo shows journey along Balkan route – video“It was a wonderful island, with crystal‑clear water,” says Alessio Mamo, a Guardian photographer who had met Somar in Turkey and decided to document his journey. “The contrast between the stream of tourists and the thousands of migrants was stark. To shake off the fear after the dinghy crossing, we played football. Syria versus the rest of the world. Instead of shirts, the opposing team wore lifejackets.”The group set off again taking the ferry to Athens. From there, after a couple of days, Somar, his sisters and Alessio joined thousands of other migrants and made their way to the North Macedonian border, arriving at an open‑air camp run by the UNHCR.View image in fullscreenA group of refugees on the ferry from Kastellorizo to Athens.View image in fullscreenSomar and the rest of the group in Athens.“The borders were open in that period, unlike today. It was not hard to reach the Balkans,” says Somar.On 15 October, they took a train to Serbia – a country where the mood was growing increasingly tense. In the weeks leading up to their arrival, more than 13,000 migrants had crossed from Serbia into Croatia in just a few days, raising alarm among European governments. In Zagreb, officials feared they were facing the last line of defence against a purported “invasion” of asylum seekers – a narrative rapidly seized upon by far‑right parties across Europe.View image in fullscreenSomar and his companions on a train headed to the Serbian border.View image in fullscreenSomar’s sisters, Salsabil and Lubna, waited to take a bus from Athens to the border with North Macedonia.View image in fullscreenThe UN ran an open‑air camp for refugees at the Greek border with North Macedonia.View image in fullscreenRefugees waiting to enter the UNHCR camp in North Macedonia.Alessio was stopped by Serbian police. His passport showed no record of entry into the country. He was separated from the group and taken to a police station where he was questioned. He was then allowed to resume his journey and reached Croatia by bus.On their way to Europe, migrants lived in makeshift camps, out in the open or in cardboard shelters. Those who could not afford bus or train fares walked on foot, trekking through dense forests and mountains along barely passable trails. They slept whenever and wherever they could.View image in fullscreenSomar helps a Syrian family move a person in a wheelchair out of a patch of mud after crossing into Serbia from North Macedonia.On 17 September, Croatia closed seven of its eight border crossings with Serbia in an effort to limit the influx of refugees. A month later, Slovenia followed suit – a clear sign that Europe, struggling to manage unprecedented migration flows, was closing its doors.A month later, Somar, his sisters and Alessio arrived in Salzburg, Austria. A couple of days later – after 44 days and more than 2,755 miles (4,434km) – they reached Germany, their journey culminating in a long, emotional embrace with Mousab.View image in fullscreenThe emotional arrival at Mousab’s place in Schwäbisch Gmünd.

Her open-door policy welcomedhundreds of thousands of refugeesinto Germany.Judith Sunderland, associate director for Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division, said: “2015 was a year of tremendous contradictions that held the possibility – and at times what seemed the promise – of a generous, welcoming and fair Europe.“Ultimately, those contradictions were resolved with an embrace of cruel and repressive migration and asylum policies.“In the years since, the EU has turned progressively toward Fortress Europe,” Sunderland adds.Asylum applications in Europe graphicIn the aftermath of 2015, the Balkan route became much harder, with barbed-wire fences and armed pushbacks by border police.In the central Mediterranean, Italy’s humanitarian approach gave way. Operation Mare Nostrum, led by the Italian navy, and which had focused on rescuing migrant vessels in distress, was superseded by Operation Triton, which was intended to patrol the Mediterranean more than save lives.View image in fullscreenTorn clothing hangs from razor wire at a border crossing checkpoint on the Polish-Belarusian border near Kuźnica, eastern Poland.European prosecutors used laws designed to tackle organised crime to pursue people smugglers – not to stop the abuse of refugees on such routes, however, but to curb migration flows. When NGOs stepped in to fill the gap, launching rescue operations in Libyan waters, Italian authorities impounded ships and arrested volunteer crews.Italy began closing its ports to incoming migrant vessels from Libya. In 2017, the then‑interior minister Marco Minniti, of the centre‑left Democratic party,struck a deal with the Libyan coastguardto intercept and return migrants to Libya – where aid agencies have reported widespread torture and abuse.The migration crisis became a decisive issue in the European elections of June 2024, helping far‑right parties that demanded closed borders and mass returns to power – and many of them won.Last year, Italy’s far‑right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, opened two centres inAlbaniadesigned to hold men who were intercepted in international waters while trying to cross from Africa to Europe. Greece secretly expelled thousands of asylum seekers, abandoning many of them on inflatable life rafts in the Aegean Sea, while the Hungarian government ordered the closure of its border with Serbia and the construction of a fence along the frontier.The result has been a catastrophic rise in the number of deaths.View image in fullscreenRefugees from African countries aboard a small boat in distress in the Mediterranean Sea in 2017.Monica Minardi, president of Médecins Sans Frontières Italy, said: “More than 32,000 people have lost their lives in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea since 2014, while migrants and asylum seekers are left with no alternative than risk their life to seek safety and protection.“From Spain to Croatia to Greece, we have seen brutal and sometimes deadly violence used to prevent people from entering,” Sunderland says. “For all the terrible policies and practices we saw in 2015 (and before), it was still a time when Merkel said: ‘We can do this.’ Now the German government is pushing people back at the border and trying to abolish family reunification.”A decade has passed since Somar’s journey. Today, the future for migrants – and of Europe itself – remains uncertain, as intolerance grows across the continent. In Germany, where Somar lives, the far-right and anti-migration Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party came second in February’s federal elections, with more than 20% of the vote.Meanwhile, fortified with barbed wire and systematic pushbacks, Europe continues to close itself off.Additional reporting by Marta Bellingreri"

At least 11 UN personnel were detained.”He demanded that they be “immediately and unconditionally” released.Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme (WFP), earlier told the Associated Press that security forces raided the agencies’ offices in the Houthi-controlled capital Sana’a on Sunday morning.She said at least one staff member was detained in the city and others reportedly detained in other areas.“WFP reiterates that the arbitrary detention of humanitarian staff is unacceptable,” Etefa said.The offices of the World Health Organization and Unicef were also raided, according to a UN official and a Houthi official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The UN official said armed forces raided the offices and questioned employees in the car park. He said contact with several other WFP and Unicef staff members were lost and that they were likely also detained.Israeli strikes hit Yemen’s capital in retaliation for earlier Houthi attacksRead moreAmmar Ammar, a spokesperson for Unicef, said a number of the agency’s staff members were detained, and it was seeking additional information from theHouthis.Both Etefa and Ammar said their agencies were conducting “a comprehensive head count” of their employees in Sana’a and other Houthi-held areas.The raids were the latest in a long-running Houthi crackdown against the UN and other international organisations working in rebel-held areas in Yemen.They have detained dozens of UN staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the now-closed US embassy in Sana’a. The UN suspended its operations in the Houthi stronghold of Saada in northern Yemen after the rebels detained eight UN staff members in January.Sunday’s raids came after the killing of the Houthi prime minister and several of his cabinet members in an Israeli strike on Thursday.It was a blow to the Iran-backed rebels who have launched attacks on Israel and ships in the Red Sea in relation against the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The missile, which the Houthis said was aimed at Ben Gurion airport, prompted air raid sirens across central Israel and Jerusalem, forcing millions into shelters.The Houthis are likely to escalate their attacks on Israel and ships in the Red Sea, after they vowed in July to target merchant ships belonging to any company that does business with Israeli ports, regardless of nationality.“Our military approach of targeting the Israeli enemy, whether with missiles, drones or a naval blockade, is continuous, steady and escalating,” al-Houthi, the group’s secretive leader, said in a televised speech on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsYemenHouthisUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The latter has said France intends to recognise Palestine at the UN meeting.Starmer also spoke to Donald Trump before announcing his decision. The US president indicated the US would not object to such a move, but British officials are worried that his administration might retaliate by recognising Israeli jurisdiction over illegal settlements in the West Bank.Starmer’s conditions for Israel include taking “substantive steps” to end the war in Gaza, agreeing a ceasefire and committing not to annex parts of the West Bank.Far from taking steps towards satisfying any of those demands, however, Netanyahu has shown signs of violating them further.Reutersreportedthat Israel was considering annexation in the West Bank if France, the UK and other countries push ahead with recognising Palestine. Israeli officials said the subject was on the agenda for Netanyahu’s cabinet meeting on Sunday, but would not say where or when annexation could happen.The Foreign Office has just over a week to complete its formal assessment of Israel’s position. Senior government officials say the timing of the British recognition is being driven less by that process and more by diplomatic concerns that the government should be seen to be acting in concert with France.Lammy said on Sunday that the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where UN-backed expertsrecently declareda famine, was a “man-made catastrophe” caused by Israel’s refusal to let in aid deliveries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Israel has already blocked two attempts by activists to deliver aid by ship to the coastal territory, intercepting vessels offshore in June and July.Thousands of supporters flocked to the pier in the Catalan capital, some wearing kaffiyehs and chanting “Free Palestine” and “Boycott Israel”. The boats setting sail ranged from run-down old yachts to commercial vessels.“The story here is how people are being deliberately deprived of the very basic means to survive,” Thunberg said.Cunningham called the flotilla “an indication of the world’s failure to uphold international law and humanitarian law … and a shameful, shameful period in the history of our world”.Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, confirmed on Sunday that Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, had been killed in a joint operation with the Shin Bet domestic intelligence service in Gaza.There was no immediate comment from Hamas. However, the group did confirm the death of Mohammed Sinwar, its presumed leader in Gaza, more than three months after Israel said it had identified his body in a tunnel in central Gaza.The Barcelona flotilla’s departure came two days after the Israeli military ended temporary pauses in the area that had allowed for some aid deliveries. Gaza City was a “dangerous combat zone”, the military said in justification for its decision.In Jerusalem, Israeli officials said Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet would meet on Sunday evening to discuss the next stages of the planned offensive to seize Gaza City, although a full-scale offensive is not expected to start for weeks.Israel has said it aims to evacuate the civilian population before moving more ground forces in. Mirjana Spoljaric of the Red Cross said such a move would provoke a massive population displacement that no other part of the Gaza Strip would be able to absorb.About half of Gaza’s more than 2 million residents are sheltering in Gaza City, local sources estimate, although thousands are believed to have left or to be trying to leave, to seek refuge in more central and southern areas of the territory.Large crowds in Tel Aviv demonstrated against the war on Saturday night and the families of hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza protested outside the homes of Israeli cabinet ministers on Sunday morning.The war began with a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people – mostly civilians – were killed and 251 taken hostage. Forty-seven hostages are still being held in Gaza, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive.Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 63,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Gaza, considered reliable by the UN. It has left much of Gaza in ruins and plunged it into a humanitarian crisis.The UN this month declared a state of famine in the territory, saying 500,000 people faced “catastrophic” conditions.The Israeli army said on Sunday it had carried out a strike on a site run by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. “The existence of the site and the activity within it constitute a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,” it said.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Other ministers and officials were wounded, the statement added without providing further details.The head of the group’s supreme political council, Mahdi al-Mashat, said: “We promise to God, to the dear Yemeni people and the families of the martyrs and wounded that we will take revenge.”He warned foreign companies to leave Israel “before it’s too late”.The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Saturday that the strike was “a crushing blow” against the Houthis, adding that “this is only the beginning”.Israel said on Friday the airstrike had targeted the Iran-aligned group’s chief of staff, defence minister and other senior officials, and that it was verifying the outcome.The premier was targeted along with other members of his Houthi-controlled government during a “routine workshop held by the government to evaluate its activities and performance over the past year”, the Houthi statement said.Thursday’s Israeli strike took place as the rebel-owned television station was broadcasting a speech by Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the secretive leader of the rebel group, in which he was sharing updates on the latest Gaza developments and vowing retaliation against Israel. Senior Houthi officials used to gather to watch al-Houthi’s prerecorded speeches.The strike that killed the prime minister targeted a meeting for Houthi leaders in a villa in Beit Baws, an ancient village in southern Sana’a, three tribal leaders told the Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared repercussions.“Yemen endures a lot for the victory of the Palestinian people,” al-Rahawi said after an Israeli strike last week on an oil facility owned by the country’s main oil company, which is controlled by the rebels in Sana’a, as well as a power plant.On 22 Augustthe Houthis had launched a ballistic missile toward Israelthat its military described as the first cluster bomb the rebels had launched at it since 2023.The prime minister hailed from the southern province of Abyan, and was an ally to the former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. He allied himself with the Houthis when the rebels overran Sana’a and much of the north and centre of the country in 2014, initiating the country’s long-running civil war. He was appointed as prime minister in August 2024.Al-Rahawi is the most senior Houthi official to be killed since the US and Israel began their air and naval campaign in response to the rebels’ missile and drone attacks on Israel and on ships in the Red Sea. The US and Israeli strikes killed dozens of people. One US strike in Aprilhit a prison holding African migrantsin the northern Sadaa province, killing at least 68 people and wounding 47 others.Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst with the Crisis Group International, a Brussels-based thinktank, called the killing of the Houthi prime minister a “serious setback” for the rebels.He said the escalation marks an Israeli shift from striking the rebels’ infrastructure to targeting their leaders, including senior military figures, which “poses a greater threat to their command structure”.The Houthis launched a campaign targeting ships in response to the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, saying they were doing so in solidarity with the Palestinians. Their attacks over the past two years have upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which about $1tn of goods pass each year.In May, the Trump administration announceda deal with the Houthisto end the airstrikes in return for an end to attacks on shipping. The rebels, however, said the agreement did not include halting attacks on targets it believed were aligned with Israel.Explore more on these topicsYemenIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Passengers will be able to travel without planning or booking journeys in advance.The technology, which has previously been tested in Switzerland, Denmark and Scotland, is being piloted in England first on East Midlands Railway services between Leicester, Derby andNottingham, with trials to be extended to Northern Trains in Yorkshire from the end of the month. Up to 4,000 passengers are expected to take part in the pilots.The DfT said the scheme demonstrated its commitment to improving the passenger experience and trialling innovative technology to save time and money.The rail minister, Peter Hendy, said: “The railway ticketing system is far too complicated and long overdue an upgrade to bring it into the 21st century. Through these trials we’re doing just that, and making buying tickets more convenient, more accessible and more flexible.“By putting passenger experience at the heart of our decision-making, we’re modernising fares and ticketing and making it simpler and easier for people to choose rail.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If a company is prosecuted it will have to prove to the court that it had reasonable anti-fraud measures in place.The law will apply to large organisations that meet at least two of three criteria: having more than 250 employees, £36m turnover or £18m in total assets.“Today marks a pivotal moment for businesses, and this new offence strengthens our anti-fraud culture to protect businesses, build corporate trust and support long-term economic growth,” said David Hanson, the fraud minister. “Fraud is a shameful crime and we are determined to bring those responsible to justice wherever it takes place.”The law firm Irwin Mitchell said it marked a “fundamental shift” in corporate accountability by removing the previous need to prove that senior management were complicit.It said that failure to comply with the new law,under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act, could result in unlimited fines, reputational damage and criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office or Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).“The new offence will have a significant impact on organisations and their risk exposure,” said Colette Kelly, a regulatory specialist and partner at Irwin Mitchell. “[However], whether procedures are deemed to be sufficient will be a matter for the court to establish, and until we start to see the outcome of prosecutions this is somewhat of a watching brief.”Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a 31% increase in fraud last year.Loan ‘irregularities’ led to collapse of Prax Lindsey oil refineryRead moreThe Home Office said the new offence was intended to encourage organisations to build an anti-fraud culture, in the same way the failure to prevent bribery legislation did when introduced in 2010.“The new law represents a major step forward in holding to account those who commit corporate crime,” said Hannah von Dadelszen, the CPS’s chief crown prosecutor leading on fraud and economic crime. “Large organisations must act to put robust fraud prevention systems in place or leave themselves open to legal action.”Irwin Mitchell said businesses should be undertaking a review of fraud risk assessments, update internal controls and ensure that staff and third parties were trained and aware of whistleblowing procedures.Explore more on these topicsCorporate governanceCrimeSerious Fraud OfficeCrown Prosecution ServicenewsShareReuse this content"

Cooper is understood to be looking at similar changes, as well as setting a minimum period refugees must be settled before being allowed to invite their families.The home secretary will alsoconfirm changesto the asylum process which will remove the power of judges to hear appeals, handing them to a select panel of trained experts. Officials say this will operate in a similar way to the magistrate system, with trained members of the public hearing cases under the supervision of legal experts.Cooper will also highlight the number of “disruptions” law enforcement officials are making to people smuggling gangs, whether through arrests, asset seizures or action to close communication networks. The government says officers took 347 such actions in 2024-25 – the highest on record.They also point to an unexpected dip in small boat crossings over August to the lowest levels in four years – something they say was triggered in part by law enforcement operations to seize dinghies at the Bulgarian border over the summer.This recent drop has not been enough to appease public anger, especially at the ongoing use of hotels to house those whose claims have not yet been processed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Protests must end by 8pm, while demonstrators will be stopped from blocking the road and could be ordered to remove face coverings, the force said.In response to the protests, Farage announced a series of policy proposals to bar most asylum seekers from Britain.Faragewas criticisedover the weekend by Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, who called his policy “isolationist, short-term [and] kneejerk”.But he received backing in part from an unexpected quarter as Jack Straw, a formerLabourhome secretary, added his name to a list of experts who believe the UK can leave the European convention of human rights without undermining peace in Northern Ireland.Downing Street last week accused the Reform leader of not being a “serious person” for advocating the UK’s departure from the convention, which it said would damage the Good Friday agreement.Straw, however, on Monday gave his backing to a report from the thinktank Policy Exchange claiming this was not the case. “The debate about our future relationship with the ECHR … should be conducted on its merits,” he said.“This paper [from Policy Exchange] argues, in thorough and forensic detail, that ‘whatever the merits of UK withdrawal from the ECHR, nothing in the Belfast agreement rules it out as a viable course of action.’”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumYvette CooperLabourReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

According to Ragusa, prior to the incident, Giuliani was flagged down by a woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident.“Mayor Giuliani immediately rendered assistance and contacted 911. He remained on scene until responding officers arrived to ensure her safety. Following this, while traveling on the highway, mayor Giuliani’s vehicle was struck from behind at high speed,” Ragusa said.Giuliani was transported to a nearby trauma center where he was treated for a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple cuts and bruises, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg.Giuliani’s business partner and medical provider were contacted and arrived at the hospital to oversee his care, Ragusa said, adding that Giuliani is in “good spirits and recovering tremendously”.He went on to say that the incident “was not a targeted attack” and urged the public to “refrain from spreading unfounded conspiracy theories”.In response to a comment from an X user who said: “Does anyone think the victim’s abuser waited for the car who helped her, to ram them? Maybe not even knowing it’s Giuliani,” Ragusa replied: “He was in a rent a car no one knew it was him.”In 2024, Giuliani took a tumble at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, when he fell into some chairs. Following the incident which was shared widely across social media, Giuliani said: “I tripped as I was checking out the convention floor. The eyes of the world are on Fiserv Forum and the RNC, so my trip was seen by many. As a famous person once said: ‘Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.’”Giuliani served as New York City’s mayor from 1994 to 2001. He later went on to serve as Donald Trump’s lawyer before being disbarred inWashington DCandNew Yorkover false statements he made about the 2020 presidential election.In 2023, a juryorderedGiuliani to pay $148.1m to two former election workers from Georgia after he falsely accused them of attempting to steal the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.Explore more on these topicsRudy GiulianiNew HampshirenewsShareReuse this content"

But a federal judge in Washington said those children couldn’t be deported for at least 14 days, and after a hastily scheduled hearing on Sunday, she enforced that they needed to be taken off the planes and back to the Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities while the legal process plays out.Judge Sparkle L Sooknanan, a Joe Biden appointee, began the Sunday afternoon hearing by ensuring that the justice department had received her expanded order and that government officials were aware of it. “I do not want there to be any ambiguity,” she said, adding that her ruling applies broadly to Guatemalan minors who arrived in the US without their parents or guardians.Government lawyers, meanwhile, maintained that the children weren’t being deported but rather reunited at the request of their parents or guardians – a claim that the children’s lawyers dispute, at least in some cases.“I have conflicting narratives from both sides here,” Sooknanan said. She said that what she was hearing from the government lawyers “doesn’t quite line up” with what the children’s advocates had told her.Similar emergency requests were filed in other parts of the country as well. Attorneys in Arizona and Illinois asked federal judges there to block deportations of unaccompanied minors, underscoring how the fight over the government’s efforts has quickly spread.At the border-area airport in Harlingen, Texas, the scene on Sunday morning was unmistakably active. Buses carrying migrants pulled on to the tarmac as clusters of federal agents moved quickly between the vehicles and waiting aircraft. Police cars circled the perimeter, and officers and security guards pushed reporters back from the chain-link fences that line the field. On the runway, planes sat with engines idling, ground crews making final preparations as if departures could come at any moment – all as the courtroom battle played out hundreds of miles away in Washington.A government lawyer confirmed on Sunday evening that the children that it had planned to fly to Guatemala had been taken off the airplanes and were being returned to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.According to a letter sent on Friday by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, theTrump administrationstruck an agreement with Guatemala that would allow unaccompanied children to be sent back to the country and planned to start deportations this weekend. The Guatemalan government had said it was ready to take them in.Melissa Johnston, the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement’s program for unaccompanied children, sent an email to staff on Thursday calling for a halt to the release of all Guatemalan children except for those sponsored by parents or legal guardians in the US, according to a copy reviewed by Reuters and one of the former officials.By the numbers: the latest Ice and CBP data on arrests, detentions and deportations in the USRead moreLawyers for the Guatemalan children said the US government doesn’t have the authority to remove the children and is depriving them of due process by preventing them from pursuing asylum claims or immigration relief. Many have active cases in immigration courts, according to the attorneys’ court filing in Washington.Although the children are supposed to be in the care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the government is “illegally transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or torture”, argues the filing by attorneys with the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights and the National Immigration Law Center.Migrant children traveling without their parents or guardians are handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement when they are encountered by officials along the US-Mexico border. Once in the US, the children often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor – usually a family member – living in the country.In a legal complaint filed on Sunday, the National Immigration Law Center and Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights said the deportations would be a “clear violation of the unambiguous protections that Congress has provided them as vulnerable children”.“Defendants are imminently planning to illegally transfer Plaintiffs to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or even torture, against their best interests,” the complaint read.The US Department of Homeland Security, Ice’s parent agency, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Guatemala’s foreign ministry declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US politicsGuatemalanewsShareReuse this content"

Recently, the White Houserequestedthat a US military base on the outskirts of Chicago assist with immigration operations as theTrump administrationplans a broadertakeoverof Democratic-run “sanctuary cities”.Pritzker, a Democrat, told CBS on Sunday: “Any kind of troops on the streets of an American city don’t belong unless there is an insurrection, unless there is truly an emergency. There is not … I’m going to do everything I can to stop him from taking away people’s rights and from using the military to invade states. I think it’s very important for us all to stand up.”Chicago mayor signs executive order directing city to resist Trump’s immigration raidsRead morePritzker spoke after Trump on Saturday took to Truth Social to rant about Pritzker and Chicago, saying: “JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor ofIllinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming!”Meanwhile, Pritzker said that no one from theTrump administrationhas contacted his team, the city of Chicago or any other local officials.In his interview with CBS, he said: “It’s clear that they’re secretly planning this. If they actually send in US troops, it would amount to an invasion. They should be coordinating with local law enforcement, telling us when and where they’re coming, and whether it’s Ice, ATF, or another agency. But they’re not doing that. And I have to say, it’s disruptive and dangerous. It stirs up tension on the ground when we’re left in the dark and can’t coordinate with them.”Pritzker also pushed back against accusations from Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, who said that Illinois “refuses to have our back”.“That’s not true,” he said, adding: “There were police officers who made sure that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the Ice officials that were here … People have a right to their first amendment … and we protect that too in the city ofChicago… We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of our city and by the way, we’re succeeding at that job, but when they bring people in and don’t coordinate with us, they’re going to cause enormous problems.”Pritzker continued: “If he wants to send troops, he should call. I’ve been very clear about what it is that we’d like help with. But, instead, he’s talking about sending troops. Nobody’s called, literally nobody from the White House … If they actually wanted to help, they might call and say, what help do you need? … I don’t know why they haven’t bothered to reach out if they have plans of their own, but honestly, we’d be happy to receive a call.”The governor also accused Trump of having “other aims, other than fighting crime”, pointing out the handful of Democratic cities that have been the target of Trump’simmigration crackdowns, includingWashington DCandLos Angeles.White House seeks to use Chicago-area military base for ‘sanctuary cities’ crackdownRead more“The other aims are that he’d like to stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections. He’ll just claim that there’s some problem with an election, and then he’s got troops on the ground that can take control if, in fact, he’s allowed to do this. We have sovereignty,” Pritzker said.With an imminent federal crackdown in Chicago expected to take place as soon as the end of this week, Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson,signedan executive order on Saturday in an effort to push back against the White House’s “out of control” plan to deploy federal troops into the city.The new order bars Chicago police from aiding federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or related patrols, as well as traffic stops and checkpoints during the crackdown.Johnson also ordered all city departments to protect the constitutional rights of the city’s residents “amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or national guard deployment by the federal government”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationChicagoUS immigrationDonald TrumpUS politicsIllinoisDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!!,” the US president said on Truth Social late on Saturday.Trump also claimed he wants to ban all voting by mail except for those who are very ill or in military service.The US constitutiongrantsprimary authority to regulate elections to the US states, while empowering Congress to enact election laws or regulations. It givesno explicit authorityto the president to regulate voting.The voting reform push by Trump stems from baseless claims that the 2020 election he lost was stolen from him. Earlier this month, Trumpfalsely claimedonly the US uses mail-in voting. Dozens of countriespermitat least some form of mail-in voting.‘He’s trying to rig the midterms’: Trump intervenes to protect his allies in CongressRead moreTrumphimself has castelection ballots by mail. In the 2024 elections, 14 states and Washington DC had voter turnout by mail exceeding 30%, with Trump winning half of those states, including Utah, which had91.5% voteby mail turnout and whose elections are overseen by Republicans.Some36 US stateshave laws requesting or requiring voters to show identification at the polls, with the remaining states and DC using other forms of identity verification. Voter fraud is incredibly rare and voter ID laws have beenshownto disproportionately impact minorities, low-income individuals and disabled voters.“As many as 11 percent of eligible voters do not have the kind of ID that is required by states with strict ID requirements, and that percentage is even higher among seniors, minorities, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students,” the Brennan Center for Justicestates.Aprevious attemptby Trump to require proof of citizenship to vote wasblockedby a federal judge in June 2025, as the law risked disenfranchising millions of Americans who don’t have passports, may not have easy access to birth certificates, and millions of married women with name changes may not have citizenship documents with their current legal name.Enforcement would likelyaffecttens of millions of Americans every election cycle who vote for the first time or update their voter registration information.

She wasn’t the last.Since then, Trump has fired a slew of government officials, including the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) chair, Gwynne Wilcox, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, and most recently, he has attempted to fire the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook.Abruzzo served at the agency for nearly 30 years before Trump fired her in January 2025, a moverecommendedin Project 2025. Now she is warning that the attacks on the US’s top labor watchdog threaten to return workers’ rights to levels unseen since 1935 and empower corporations to run roughshod over the agency.“My fear is that if this continues, where corporations and corporate billionaire donors have an outsized voice and directly influence our democracy, we’re going to find ourselves living in an environment such as what we lived in before 1935 when the National Labor Relations Act was enacted,” said Abruzzo. “Working families will be dealing with lower wages, substandard working conditions, and no real channels for them to fight back.”In May, the supreme court declined to reinstate Wilcox while she challenges Trump’s decision to terminate her without cause. A lower court will now have to rule on the issue, with the supreme courtlikelyto follow on appeal.In the meantime, the agency’spowershave been effectively blocked and, Abruzzo worries, worse may be to come.The move was seen by opponents as a challenge to a landmark 1935 case, Humphrey’s Executor v United States, that ruled Congress can limit the president’s power to remove officials from independent administrative agencies.Abruzzo worries that Wilcox’s firing could pave the way for theNational Labor Relations Act, enacted in 1935 to federally protect workers’ rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining, to be repealed entirely.“If the supreme court majority eliminates or limits the reach of Humphrey’s Executor and allows the president to fire decision-making officials in the executive branch, including at the NLRB, at his whim, then I anticipate the next step will be figuring out whether or not, if they are found unconstitutional, those provisions should be severed, or the whole [NLRA] act could conceivably be repealed,” Abruzzo said.In the meantime, Abruzzo argues, the NLRB has been rendered toothless.“It’s going to take years to sort out, the agency’s going to be completely ineffective in enforcing the statute, and working families are going to continue to suffer and not be able to get any redress for the violations of their rights. It’s why I think states need to step in and protect their citizenry.”Major corporations are already making ground against the agency after the ruling. On 19 August, the US court of appeals fifth circuitruledpreliminary injunctions halting unfair labor practice cases againstElon Musk’s SpaceX and two other employers can remain in place as the employers’ challenge the constitutionality of the NLRB.The NLRB declined to comment.SpaceXdid not respond to multiple requests for comment.“I think we’re going to see a flood of employers forum shopping and flocking into district courts in the fifth circuit area seeking to get preliminary injunctions preventing the NLRB cases that frankly are seeking to hold corporations accountable for their law breaking from moving forward, and that’s going to put an end to the NLRB being able to enforce the act in any meaningful way,” said Abruzzo. “This is all about elevating corporate interests above workers’ rights.”The firings have also left the NLRB without a quorum throughout most of theTrump administration, rendering it unable to issue decisions on cases.In January 2025, after TrumpfiredWilcox, the first Black woman to serve as chair of the NLRB board. Trumpnominatedtwo membersto the board. They are awaiting a vote in the Senate for confirmation, while the term of one of two remaining board members, Marvin Kaplan,expiredon 27 August.The agency has alsoproposeda 4.7% budget cut of $14m for fiscal year 2026, after noting the agency expects to lose nearly 10% of its staff to voluntary resignation and early retirements.The acting general counsel of the NLRBarguedearlier this month that the board “has largely been unaffected” by the lack of quorum. But since Trump took office, the NLRB has onlyissuedsix decisions compared with fiscal year 2024, when the boardissued259 decisions.“Unless an employer is willing to go along with what the board says, the employer can stall a case indefinitely right now,” said Lauren McFerran, whoservedas chair of the NLRB during the Biden administration and as a board member from December 2014 to December 2019 and again in July 2020 to January 2021.“So whether it’s a [union] election case, whether it’s an unfair labor practice case, the minute the employer says that they’re not willing to go along and that they want to raise an objection to the board, you’re stuck for the foreseeable future at this point,” added McFerran.Abruzzo argues the firing of Wilcox by Trump, if allowed to stand by the courts, would eliminate the independence of the NLRB in favor of corporations. It’s up to the public to push back on these trends of stripping away protections for workers at the behest of wealthy, powerful corporations and billionaires like Musk, she said.“There is strength in numbers, and we all need to remember we matter. We make an impact on each other’s lives each and every day, and we can’t let the voice of corporate billionaires drown out our voices or squelch our actions and our spirit,” said Abruzzo.“We’re not powerless, and we have the power to demand changes to the way we’re governed, to the way we live our lives. That includes taking to the streets, frankly, and protesting over inadequate wages and working conditions and over economic, social and racial injustice. We need to do more in amplifying our voices, to make sure we’re heard and that actions are taken that are going to benefit us, because that’s, in my opinion, how the tactic of divide and conquer is going to be vanquished.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The great migration – when the shift to remote work prompted people to quit their jobs in droves – is officially over. Now comes the big hold.According to anew surveyfrom consulting firm Robert Half, 73% of respondents – workers at companies – said they plan to stay in their current roles through 2025. They gave reasons like having “positive company culture” and “feeling professionally fulfilled” or “being well compensated” at their current job. But there’s also a fourth reason why so many are staying put: thejob market isn’t greatand people are worried.Job growthis significantly down.Job openingsfell again to under 7.5m last month, a level that’s 4m below the openings available back in 2022.Wage gainsduring that same period had fallen from 6.7% to 4.1%.Microsoft,AT&T,JP Morgan,Amazonand other companies are mandating their employees to return to their offices or lose their jobs. AI is already replacing workers attech companies,Wall Street firmsandretailersand some fear greater job losses in the not too distant future. Other cost cutting measures are leading big brands likeCiti, Accenture, Tesla and Inteland other corporate giants to lay off tens of thousands of workers.And what a great opportunity for small businesses!For example, there’s my friend in Illinois. He has over 100 employees in his office. For years, he’s been spending half his days just walking around and talking to them. Telling them how important they are. Checking in on their lives and families. Asking them what they’re doing and what problems they’re having. Imagine working for that guy. Someone who genuinely cares about his workers. His turnover’s low. His retention is high.Or another client of mine in Pennsylvania who allocates a big piece of his operating budget every year to employee technical training. Fear AI? “No way”, he tells me. “I want my people to embrace it! They need to learn about all the AI features in our software applications so that they can not only get more work done for me during the day but have a more balanced life themselves.” Did I mention that he gets workforce development money from his state that pays for this extra training? Now you know.Another client of mine gives employees a $1,000 educational “credit” to use however they want. “They can learn origami or take a knitting class for all I care,” she said to me. “Becoming a better person makes you a better worker too.” Not coincidentally, she also enjoys the tax deductions allowed for providing this benefit.There are other tax benefits that small business owners can use to recruit and retain all this available talent for healthcare, childcare, for hiring workers who were formerly incarcerated, off welfare or out of the military.In the midst of all this job chaos, small business hiring and employment has remained constant. The latestSmall Business Employment Watchreport from Paychex, the giant HR and payroll processing firm, found that in July hiring among those companies with less than 50 employees “remained steady” which, according to the company’s CEO “speaks to the resiliency of small businesses given the amount of uncertainty they faced so far this year”.Ever since I can remember my small business clients have complained about competing with big companies and the government for talent. Well, now the tide has turned. Big companies are laying off people by the tens of thousands. Governmentsare cuttingtheir headcounts. The labor market is softening. But small businesses – who already employ half of this country’s workers – are still hiring and always looking for talent. The softening job market is a great opportunity for them. And for many workers.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessUS work & careersUS personal financefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even though it’s not for me, it’s for the Americans, it’s fine,” Krejcikova said. “I’m looking forward to seeing you again in my next match – I think against another American.”Townsend dominated the opening set and looked poised to win the second as well, with Krejcikova saving her first match point in the 10th game.It was the tiebreak that really saw the 29-year-old pull off her Houdini act, though, Krejcikova saving her best for when it really mattered to fight off seven more match points, recovering from 3-6 before taking her third set point.The Czech then took an off-court break, leaving Townsend sat on her chair wondering what might have been, and it was Krejcikova who had the momentum in the deciding set.“It just stings, because I literally gave everything,” Townsend said. “She came up with some really, really great tennis in moments where she was down, and I thought I had it.”Krejcikova next faces another American, fourth seed Jessica Pegula, who lost in the final last year and breezed through to the last eight again with a 6-1, 6-2 victory against Ann Li. Pegula hasn’t dropped a set this year at Flushing Meadows, and only once has she been kept on court for more than 75 minutes.“Probably the best match, honestly, I’ve played since, like, before Wimbledon I feel like from the start to finish. So that was encouraging,” Pegula said. “I was just hitting the ball, doing everything well, executing my strategy very well and got through it pretty quick.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open tennisUS sportsTennisUS Open Tennis 2025newsShareReuse this content"

You really can. You can get it. Getting it is a distinct and achievable outcome. There is just one caveat. You do have to actually show some sign of wanting to get it, to throw a little risk to the wind.This seemed to be the catch forMikel Artetaat Anfield, on a day where for long periods his Arsenal team were in the ascendancy, dishing up a performance that was assured and compact, but also a bit like watching a politician giving a campaign interview on live TV where the idea is to simply say nothing, wear the right tie, filibuster, convinced that if nothing happens then good things are probably happening. This felt like a kind of high-end Starmer-ball. Hold the line. Let the other guy lose.Dominik Szoboszlai’s wonder strike sinks Arsenal and sends Liverpool topRead moreFrom the startArsenalplayed in a way that said, well, it’s going to take something special to beat us today. The only problem with this is that quite often something special actually does happen. There is an irony in the fact a game of poker‑faced sideways manoeuvring was decided by the most brutally direct of moments.Or perhaps not irony. This was simply good sense and a case of seizing your moment when it arrives. Dominik Szoboszlai’s execution forthe only goal of the gamewas stunning, beautifully pure and also notable for its blatant lack of disguise.Curtis Jones took the ball on the half turn and was fouled 32 yards out. Szoboszlai stood alone over the free‑kick, no decoy, no misdirection, a straight run that said this is going nowhere except at goal. Watch while I put this ball into the top corner past David Raya’s flailing right hand.And so he did, taking six paces, striking the ball up and over the top of the wall, sending it curving and dipping away from David Raya’s flailing right hand and into the top corner.Arteta later dismissed this as a moment of brilliance, something you just can’t plan for. And, to be fair, football is always absurdly outcome-based in its narratives. Why didn’t you just try to win, Mikel? Why not score goals, why not lay on a banquet of free-flowing devastation, seizing the day, blowing smoke from your nostrils. Thrilling us all with your cold, hard will to power? Why not do that?But sport is always telling you things. And this was also a great game for Arne Slot, whose repurposed right-back, the princely Szoboszlai, has now won a huge league game late on twice in a week.View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai thrashes his free-kick past David Raya.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesWhereas for Arsenal that sense of a missed opportunity will linger, because there was more here for them than they ever tried to take. Anfield had been drenched in watery late summer sun at kick-off, the pitch a perfect soft lime green.The opening act was a hard, flat, pre-planned Arsenal touch finder over the head of Szoboszlai, a Rob Andrew-style move for position and structure up the pitch. The approach seemed fair. No quarter. Keep the zero with which you came into the game.But Arsenal also played well enough early on to create a sense of something more. Arteta had picked a conservative-looking team, with three solid central midfielders up against Slot’s more chancy Gravenberch‑Mac Allister pivot. Alexis Mac Allister had started one game since April. Arsenal are a weather front in midfield. They began, if not to dominate then to gain a numerical hand.View image in fullscreenGabriel Martinelli spent ‘90 minutes doing shuttle runs near a game of football’.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersAnd then, nothing happened. A splinter had been prised away from the door. Nobody crashed through it. And this kept happening. Szoboszlai isn’t a specialist right-back, doesn’t have the grooved defensive body shapes, the muscle memory. He must have been delighted to face Gabriel Martinelli, who presents only one challenge – a straight-line foot race. You don’t pick Martinelli for goals. You pick him for yardage. He’s a diesel estate player, a fleet car player, low-risk motorway miles.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guys, we’re definitely not conceding from this breakaway attack. Is this the way to win a league? With a super quick winger who basically spends 90 minutes doing shuttle runs near a game of football? Another advantage had presented itself. Again, nothing happened.‘I should mention Trent’: Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai savours free-kickRead moreArsenal had other points of strength, most notably a right‑footed right‑winger and a No 9 in the box. Noni Madueke seemed to have the run of Milos Kerkez. He didn’t see the ball enough, didn’t get it quickly enough, had to wait as the system scrolled through its patterns. In the centre Arteta came to Anfield with a bullocking centre-forward, and rare opportunity to at least disturb Virgil Van Dijk, whose game is as act of minimalism these days. Less Van Dijk is moreLiverpool. Unmussed, unbothered Van Dijk is a barometer of victory. What’s his sweat reading? Is the hair still perfect?Instead Viktor Gyökeres touched the ball twice in the opening half hour. He wrestled endlessly with Ibrahima Konaté, all flailing arms and legs and biceps. Again, an opportunity went unexplored. Arsenal did successfully rack up five corners, then watched Declan Rice spoon and punt and swirl them into weird areas.Meanwhile Liverpool stuttered a little. They played in bursts. By half-time it felt like a game still firing up the warp drive, plotting the angle of ascent. And this was always a problem for Arsenal, because it was also their chance to win it.Before long Liverpool had re-geared, with Curtis Jones on and more space on Mo Salah’s flank. Arteta did the right thing, bringing on Martin Ødegaard and Eberechi Eze. But the tension had relaxed. Liverpool always looked like the only team that was going to win from there.It would still be unfair to call this a big chance missed. It was more a failure to try hard enough to make it one, to be happy instead with a cagey, processed parity, sport without rage or risk. By the end a close 1-0 defeat felt a little more than a close 1-0 defeat, shot through with a sense of flinching with the moment there to be seized.Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetaLiverpoolanalysisShareReuse this content"

With seven laps to go when he was in second place and just over one second behind Piastri, Norris was left helpless as his car ground to a halt by the side of the track.Piastri opens gap in title race after Norris forced to retire from F1 Dutch GPRead moreNine meetings remain this season and Piastri has enough of a lead that catching him will take a herculean effort from Norris, which the British driver acknowledged.“It’s only made it harder for me and put me under more pressure but it’s almost a big enough gap now that I can just chill out about it and just go for it,” he said. “The only thing I can do is try to win every race. That’s going to be difficult, but I’ll make sure I give it everything I can.”Piastri dominated from pole in Zandvoort and was unlikely to have been passed by Norris even had he made it to the flag. The British driver conceded that clawing back the points in the fight against his teammate, who now has seven victories this season, would be an immense task.“It’s just close, I have a good teammate, he’s strong,” Norris said. “He’s quick in every situation, every scenario.

Asked if he thought he could now play the percentages on the run-in to the title he was unequivocal. “No, there’s still a long way to go,” he said.“I need to keep pushing and trying to win races still. I wouldn’t say it’s a very comfortable margin. As we saw today, it can change with one DNF very, very quickly.”McLaren have yet to confirm if the oil leak came from the engine or chassis after a very unusual reliability failure in the most recent phase of the turbo-hybrid era – poor fortune which Norris had to accept.“It’s not like in the olden days when you used to pretty much blow up every other race,” he said. “Then I think it was inevitable. We don’t expect it nowadays. It’s just frustrating, unlucky, and that’s it.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve got to play better for us to win. I think I beat myself today.”Manning was shaky from the start and had only 26 passing yards at halftime. He was stuffed at the goalline trying to score in the third quarter.“We’ve gotta have those,” Manning said. “And I’ve gotta make more of a push because that was a big swing in the game.”Overall, Manning came up short in his debut as the full-time starter for the Longhorns, but didn’t want to talk about injured receivers or excessive turnover on the offensive line from the 2024 College Football Playoff version of Texas.As Manning said he hoped he would be able to look back at Saturday’s loss as his worst performance of the season, head coach Steve Sarkisian was quick to remind Manning and Texas not to put too much stock in the first chapter of what the Longhorns expect to be a memorable season.“For Arch, the expectations were out of control on the outside,” he said. “But I’d say let’s finish the book before we judge it. This is one chapter, and we’ve got a long season to go play.”Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He seized his opportunity from 30 yards against theArsenalgoalkeeper David Raya, who claimed the new Puma ball being used in the Premier League this season had deceived him.Szoboszlai said: “I was confident in myself, I tried it. I should mention Trent because he was taking the free-kicks in the past. Finally I could have my chance and I did it. I had to take a risk and shoot a little bit harder because I knew Raya likes to jump behind the ball. He’s an unbelievable goalkeeper. If it goes a bit more inside he saves it.”Raya credited the Hungary captain with “a hell of a strike” but also cited the new match ball as a factor in Arsenal dropping points for the first time this season. “I remember the ball moving a lot and moving away from me,” the keeper said.“It’s different to the Nike ball so we have to adapt to it. The grip is different, the kick is different. We just have to adapt after playing with the Nike ball for many years. It’s the same for everybody.”Mikel Arteta defended his approach and argued Arsenal were the dominant side, despite creating few chances. The manager started Mikel Merino in place of Martin Ødegaard, who had not trained all week because of a shoulder problem, and left the new £67.5m signing Eberechi Eze on the bench until the 70th minute.“We didn’t do our game plan to frustrate them, we did it to win the game,” Arteta insisted.“I think we elevated the game and the dominance to a point that they had to raise their game. They did. Then you could see that there were no margins in the game and when that happens the game is going to be decided in two ways. One, with an individual error or two, with a magic moment. They created a moment that was incredible. That has won the game and that was the difference, nothing else.”William Saliba had to be substituted after only five minutes as he joined Arsenal’s lengthy injury list. Arteta said: “He twisted his ankle during the warm-up. He said he believed that he could carry on and play but he suffered in the first two actions. I could see that he couldn’t cope and we had to get him out, unfortunately. But thank God we have [Cristhian] Mosquera, who we put in for the first time in the Premier League, his debut, not expecting it at Anfield, and he was really, really good.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ibrahima Konaté and Florian Wirtz hobbled off late on but the head coach hopes both were experiencing cramp.“It wasn’t an injury, it was a welcome to the Premier League,” Slot said of £100m summer signing Wirtz. “After 85 minutes I don’t think he knew he could have cramp in so many different places and that’s what happened.

It was Manchester City’s second defeat of the season, the first time they have lost two of their first three league games in 21 years.City had taken the lead through Erling Haaland and seemed to have the game under control when the Brighton manager, Fabian Hürzeler, made a quadruple substitution after an hour and levelled from a James Milner penalty seven minutes later.Dominik Szoboszlai’s wonder strike sinks Arsenal and sends Liverpool topRead more“We played brilliantly the first hour but conceded a goal and then forgot to continue playing,” said Guardiola. “We decided to play long but we were not good enough. Sometimes the momentum changes the shapes. I used to be a player. I understand this.”Before the collapse, Guardiola had seen positive signs. “I had the feeling we are more active compared to last season,” he said, “but last season we lost to Spurs and Brighton and this season it happened again. It’s difficult at the start of the season, but we have to find a way to win games.” He also confirmed Rayan Cherki is likely to be out for two months with a thigh injury.Brajan Gruda claimed Brighton’s winner in the 89th minute. “At that moment, we were tired.” Guardiola said, pointing out that if Abdukodir Khusanov had not gone off injured four minutes earlier, his pace might have covered the gap that undid City.“We are missing the level,” said Rodri, after his first league start in almost a year. “It is a matter of the team and the changes, new players have to adapt and, of course, when you change the team that much it is difficult. But some of the mistakes we are making are kids’ mistakes, not concentrating and paying attention. The reality is that we have to raise the level if we want to compete.”Hürzeler spoke of “a feeling that comes from inside” as having guided his substitutions. “In some moments my body says something to me. Not just in football but generally in life you need to have the courage to take the decisions you want to if you feel they are the right thing to do. But with four subs you don’t change the game,” he said. “You need 11 players who are changed by the subs, by their energy and belief.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are the last team in England’s top four divisions yet to score a league goal this season.A highly underwhelming summer’s transfer window was compounded by yet another disappointing result against Palace. We will never know whether Emiliano Martínez would have saved Guéhi’s peach of a shot as Villa’s regular goalkeeper was unavailable for selection amid reports of Manchester United’s renewed interest.Dominik Szoboszlai’s wonder strike sinks Arsenal and sends Liverpool topRead moreUnai Emery confirmed the World Cup winner was too distracted to play. “We need the players focused 100%,” the Villa manager said. “He wasn’t.” Emery did confirm there had been no bid from United. “He was not available. Tomorrow is the line and we will see how we finish it.”Emery also conceded that Martínez’s situation has contributed to Villa’s poor start. “It’s not helping us. This is one of the circumstances we are having now not helping, but tomorrow, we’ll see. I am confident after tomorrow for we are going to try to manage the group we will have.”The Palace fans serenaded their potentially departing hero by singing “Marc Guéhi, I wanna know how you scored that goal” after their captain followed a run out from defence by curling home a beautiful shot into the top corner for 2-0 midway through the second half. If the England defender is leaving for Liverpool on Monday, then what a way to sign off.Oliver Glasner conceded that it is up to Steve Parish, the Palace chairman, whether the club give in to “temptation” and accept Liverpool’s bid for the England player who has entered the last year of his contract. “We need to keep Marc if we want to have a successful season,” the Palace manager said. “We had a meeting in March and we have an agreement that we sell Marc if we have the right replacement in. There’s no replacement in the building so it’s clear one part of the agreement is not fulfilled.“I know if we don’t sell Marc, he would accept it because he loves Crystal Palace. It’s all about Crystal Palace’s future, about this season. We have such great times, maybe the most successful in the club’s history. And Marc is not just a small part of the puzzle.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr heads Crystal Palace’s third goal from close range.Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images“But I don’t have the final decision. You know about Adam and Eve and the apple? The whole situation is tempting. If you want to progress, we have to keep him. If we accept the offer, maybe falling a step back, we say OK.”Palace dispatched Villaby this scoreline at Wembley before winning the FA Cup final in May in a run of 14 games unbeaten, their best such run as a top-flight club. They have won five and drawn one of their last six games with these opponents over the past two years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Emery is convinced the bad vibes will dissipate once the transfer window shuts and the players return for their away games at Everton and Sunderland before commencing on their Europa League campaign.Though Villa fielded a very offensive team, once Palace went ahead their fogginess re-emerged. Youri Tielemans could have headed home after corners at either end of the first half, but it was Jean-Philippe Mateta’s penalty that established the tone after Marco Bizot, the Dutch goalkeeper signed from Brest in the summer, felled Daichi Kamada. Only Mohamed Salah (13) has scored morePremier Leaguegoals than Mateta’s 11 since the start of this year.Villa regained the ascendancy before succumbing to Guéhi’s gambit. The Palace captain started the move from deep in his own half before playing the ball wide to Kamada. When Kamada then won a loose ball off John McGinn, the England defender curled a sumptuous shot into the far top corner.Palace’s win was rounded off when Maxence Lacroix headed on Jefferson Lerma’s long throw and, at the far post, Ismaïla Sarr nodded in. “Aston Villa, it’s happened again”, sang the triumphant travelling fans, thoroughly enjoying their 270-mile round trip on a Sunday night.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Jackson is due to return to London but is understood to be disappointed with how the situation has played out. Enzo Maresca, the Chelsea head coach, may face a challenge to lift the forward’s spirits when he rejoins the squad after the international break.It had seemed Jackson was set for a new challenge when he was given permission to fly to Munich on Saturday after Bayern reached an agreement on a loan with an option to buy for €65m (£56m). However, Chelsea contacted the German club to inform them that they wouldnot permit the deal to go aheadafter Liam Delap sustained a hamstring injury against Fulham later in the day.Yoane Wissa urges Brentford to ‘keep their word’ and allow him to leaveRead moreDelap is due to have a second scan this week and although it is hoped that the damage is not severe enough to require surgery the striker is expected to be out for at least eight weeks.Maresca is reluctant to proceed with only one fit striker given his team’s packed schedule over the next two months. However, Chelsea’s instruction for Jackson to return to London on Saturday afternoon fell on deaf ears at first. The Senegal international remained in Bavaria with his representatives, who spent much of Sunday trying to find a solution with Bayern.But with Chelsea willing to consider only a permanent deal, the Bundesliga champions walked away from talks over Jackson last night. Bayern, who spent heavily 12 months ago, only wanted a loan and are moving on to other targets.Chelsea were willing to let Jackson leave after buying João Pedro and Delap this summer. Jackson, who has scored 24 goals in 65 Premier League appearances, has dropped down the pecking order and asked to leave in August. He has also been targeted by Aston Villa, Newcastle, Napoli and Juventus. It remains to be seen if anyone moves for Jackson before the transfer window shuts on Monday night. Newcastle could be an option if they sell Alexander Isak to Liverpool.Chelsea have considered contingency plans in the unlikely event of Jackson leaving. They are looking at permanent deals rather than loans and have made inquiries about a number of forwards, including Sporting Lisbon’s Conrad Harder. However, they have reached an agreement to recall Marc Guiu from his loan at Sunderland.Harder, a 20-year-old Danish forward, joined Sporting from Nordsjælland last year and has scored six goals in 32 league appearances. RB Leizpig have been linked with Harder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Five days since confronting angry supporters after Graham Potter’s side succumbed to a third successive defeat, Bowen’s clever first-time finish, with full time looming, was the catalyst for West Ham’s first win of the season.Goals by Lucas Paquetá, poised to stay after West Ham dismissed an inquiry from Aston Villa, and Callum Wilson, the former from the penalty spot, ensured an eerily comfortable finish. By the end, as Bowen was serenaded by the delighted supporters in the away end, it was hard to remember which of these teams was supposed to be engulfed by crisis.Gruda fires late winner in Brighton’s comeback win over Manchester CityRead moreIf discussions in the coming days dictate the future of Nuno Espírito Santo atNottingham Forest, then the international break will surely bring a little respite for Potter. For Forest – in front of the watching owner, Evangelos Marinakis, this was a dreadful performance and a pathetic, and untimely, collapse. Bowen could have made it 4-0 deep into added time but Matz Sels prevented the England forward from inflicting further damage.“It is a really pleasing day for us because with the results we’ve had it is very easy to be negative and lose trust and confidence,” Potter said. “This is the world we’re in, you get written off in your job after a week, which is ridiculous.”The day after Forest supporters hastily booked flights and hotels following the hotly anticipated release of their Europa League fixtures, this match fell flat and West Ham fashioned the best chances. Wilson, who arrived on a free this summer, impressed off the bench, forcing Sels to tip over a deflected strike within a few minutes of replacing Niclas Füllkrug and he later tested the Forest goalkeeper from an awkward angle after showing strength in the box.Marinakis has spent more than £160m on 10 signings this window after the arrival of the goalkeeper John Victor, with another, the left-back Cuiabano, also from Botafogo, poised to join before the transfer deadline on Monday. Forest’s most recent arrival, Nicolò Savona, was paraded on the pitch before kick-off but while five began on the bench only one of their summer additions, Dan Ndoye, started. James McAtee replaced Ndoye, who struggled, approaching the hour while Igor Jesus later replaced Chris Wood, something of a like‑for‑like change. Nuno waited until the penultimate minute of normal time to introduce the forwards Arnaud Kalimuendo and Omari Hutchinson.For so long this was a contest punctuated by misplaced passes and unforced errors, the West Ham debutant Mateus Fernandes, a £42m signing from Southampton, one of few players to make a positive impression before Bowen, with six minutes of regular time to play, produced another moment to remember. Until then it seemed West Ham would take heart from not only avoiding the ignominy of a fourth defeat in a row courtesy of a disciplined display but also a welcome first clean sheet.Bowen’s goal, which stemmed from an El Hadji Malick Diouf throw‑in down the left, gave West Ham the leg‑up that prompted Forest to crumble. An on-the-turn Bowen squeezed his shot in at Sels’s near post and raced towards the away fans, sliding on his knees and then kissing the West Ham badge. Paquetá went ballistic, losing his footing after booting one of the balls behind the goal as his teammates mobbed Bowen.Then it was Paquetá’s turn, the Brazil midfielder sending Sels the wrong way after Crysencio Summerville, on as a substitute, was tripped in the box by Ibrahim Sangaré, who had been a target for West Ham. Paquetá celebrated by pretending to throw away a mobile phone – presumably a call from Villa – before beating his chest and kissing the irons on his shirt. The defender Nayef Aguerd, who has made it clear he wishes to leave West Ham, was conspicuous by his absence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chris Wood sent a tame header at the West Ham goalkeeper a minute into the second half but it was a listless display. Nothing came off for Morgan Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson, whose consistent performances were rewarded with an England call-up, was also outfoxed in midfield. Wilson capped the scoring, glancing in Diouf’s cross unmarked after eluding Murillo and Sels prevented Bowen making things uglier.Those talks with Marinakis promise to be interesting. Might this result now give the conversation a different twist? “It doesn’t help,” Nuno said. “It was shocking today. Everybody at Forest, we are very sad and upset, but there is no connection between [these] things. We will try to separate it and move forward in the right direction.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A Davis pass sent Arthur Atta driving towards the danger zone and he steered his shot from the edge of the area into the far corner.“After the last season, I realised where we could improve and Atta was one with more potential,” the Udinese manager, Kosta Runjaic, told DAZN. “Now he has certainly become more dangerous.“Juventusscraped a 1-0 win atGenoain their Serie A clash, with Dusan Vlahovic coming off the bench to score for the second successive game.

Doing so for the WSL newbiesLondon City Lionessesis nigh-on impossible because they have undergone a complete squad overhaul. A staggering 15 players have come in (with two then going out on loan) and 11 have exited. Change isn’t limited to the pitch either, with the training ground in flux, buildings coming down and going up as the club try to turn Cobdown Park in Aylesford into an environment fit for elite professionals.There isn’t a precedent set by another promoted club that would give us an indication of the side’s potential because no promoted team have had the level of investment that London City have had pumped in this summer. They are an anomaly, powered by the investment of their billionaire owner, Michele Kang.The ambition is high. As Kang said to Sky Sports at the end of last season: “We have been building a team to be at a minimum, on day one, mid-tier WSL”.The five-time Champions League winning midfielderSaki Kumagai, who joined Kang’s project in January, echoed that sentiment last week. “For us, it’s not about staying in the WSL, though of course we want to, but it’s about pushing towards that top three or four so the following season we can start pushing for Champions League qualification,” she said.The task will be stitching together a patchwork quilt of players. London City have signed some big names, in Daniëlle van de Donk, Nikita Parris, Katie Zelem and others, who join players such as Kumagai and the Swedish forward Kosovare Asllani, but these are arguably players closer to the end of their careers than the start. Marrying that experience with the young talents who have joined into a team capable of competing in the league consistently is a big ask, but the quality is there.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerJocelyn Prêcheur was poached by Kang from Paris Saint-Germain in 2024. He had taken the reins there after his father, Gérard Prêcheur, departed, stepping up from being an assistant coach. That was the second time 43-year-old had worked with his father, having assisted him at Jiangsu Suning in the Chinese Super League. He won his first and only trophy with PSG in 2024, the Coupe de France, and helped guide London City to the Championship (now WSL2) title in his first season. The test gets harder in the WSL but having gelled a side capable of helping the club achieve their objective of reaching the WSL he has shown he can get new players working together.View image in fullscreenJocelyn Precheur helped guide London City to the Championship title in his first season as manager.Photograph: Molly Darlington/The FA/Getty ImagesOff-field pictureThe purchase and redevelopment of their 28-acre training facility is symbolic of Kang’s commitment towards her growing women’s football empire – with Washington Spirit and Lyon also owned by the billionaire. Kang has made clear she is not expecting short-term returns on these investments, though she sees the potential for profit in the long term given the trajectory of the women’s game. London City’s promotion on the final day of the season was justification for the investment. A mid-table finish this season would do that further.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How about one with experience and one rising in Van de Donk and Jana Fernández respectively. The Dutch midfielder Van de Donk returns to London, where she won the FA Cup, League Cup and WSL title with Arsenal, after four years and eight trophies, including a Champions League with Lyon. Fernández represents the desire to build a squad with a future, the 23-year-old defender recruited from Barcelona, where she was part of a squad that won three Champions Leagues.Stepping upIsobel Goodwin returns to the WSL after leaving Aston Villa for Coventry United in January 2023 having made three top-flight appearances. After six months with Coventry she joined Sheffield United and her 15 goals in 19 games for the Blades caught the eye of promotion-hungry London City. Last season she scored 16 times in 18 games as London City battled their way to the title. How will she fare on her return to the WSL and with star-studded signings providing for her? It’s an exciting prospect.It was a good summer for …With London City spending big, selling clubs have probably had the best summer. A host of their new squad competed at the 2025 Euros this summer, though with England emerging victorious none will have walked away particularly happy. The 20-year-old Freya Godfrey made her loan move permanent this summer, having spent time with Ipswich and Charlton on loan from Arsenal before spending last season with London City. The young midfielder scored in a 3-1 friendly defeat by Lyon in August.Main initiative to attract more fansAttracting fans is one of London City’s biggest challenges. As an independent club, unconnected to a men’s team, they have no existing fanbase to pull from, unless some Millwall Lionesses fans switched across when the women’s team broke away from the club in 2019. Playing at Princes Park in Dartford hasn’t helped. A move to Bromley’s Hayes Lane has come with attempts to build a local fanbase, and investment is being made in the matchday experience. The club have also connected with about 40 local girls’ teams across London, who have become sister clubs.Explore more on these topicsLondon City LionessesWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Russell Martin and Brendan Rodgers duly delivered. Perhaps it was inevitable that a derby supposed to endorse such strongly held viewpoints about one half of Glasgow would end in stalemate.The boos that rang out at full time demonstrated the scale of work Martin has to do in order to win over hearts and minds. The Rangers manager has been on the back foot since day one, with apoor start to the seasonstrengthening the widely held sense that this is wrong man, wrong club, wrong time.Rangers 0-0 Celtic: Scottish Premiership updates – at it happenedRead moreRangers were actually the better side and the one which showed more attacking purpose, but four draws to open aScottish Premiershipcampaign is not a healthy position. In that quartet of games Rangers have scored just three times. Fans held banners with “Enough is enough” as a message before kick-off against Celtic. The visiting contingent, 2,500 of them, were noticeably subdued. The Ibrox atmosphere was a strange one.Martin has decided Scotland’s fourth estate is partly responsible for his predicament. Perhaps websites are making an error by printing theRangersscores. “Until we win football matches there will still be noise,” the Rangers manager said.“It’s a reaction to games, the job the media have to get clicks. My job is to win games, the media’s job is to create miscommunication between people. The noise gets louder but it doesn’t change one thing we do inside the building. I’ve had it before as a player and manager already. The only way to change the noise is to win matches.”It was not the press who decided to leave Nico Raskin, Rangers’ best midfielder, out of the squad for Celtic’s visit amid speculation about the Belgian’s future. Martin refused to discuss Raskin’s situation but confirmed the Rangers squad was addressed on Saturday by the club’s American owners. The message there was apparently clear; that Martin would be going nowhere. “I haven’t felt one change in the owners’ attitude towards me,” Martin said. “If anything I’ve felt more support than ever in the last week.”Celtic’s scenario is more complex. Rodgers is clearly irritated by the champions’ failure to recruit forward players well in advance of this season. One glance at the Irishman’s face as he took to the Ibrox podium told us all that much. They have paid the penalty throughChampions League elimination. “I think it’s about profile of player,” Rodgers said. “I think I’ve been very clear on that.“It’s been so clear what the team has needed and what’s required. I really hope that in this period we can do that because it’s Celtic’s DNA; attacking intent, mentality and that bit of quality when you arrive into the final third.View image in fullscreenBojan Miovski showed promise on his Rangers debut but his claims for a penalty after being challenged by Liam Scales were turned down.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockTwelve months ago with the dynamism in the team and the speed and the creativity, everything was there and you feel you can go into games and be really dynamic and creative and that’s what we all want to see.“We’ve had a long time to reinforce the squad and listen, I’m hopeful that we can do that and get it over the line. The game is about the quality of your player. You can take the game to different levels based on your players.”It feels nonsensical that Celtic, cash rich and supposedly ambitious, find themselves in this pickle with only hours of a transfer window remaining. They were painfully blunt in what was a rare scoreless Old Firm joust. Celtic have failed to score in three of their past four games. “We can assess it at the end of the window,” Rodgers said. “I repeat again, every manager wants players in early to bed them in and adapt his system and the styles and get that profile of play what we need. But we’re hopeful that we can do our work in this next period.”What came before really was a non-event. John Souttar had the ball in the Celtic net after half an hour, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside. Rangers had earlier appealed in vain for a penalty after Bojan Miovski, who showed promise on his debut, tumbled under a challenge from Liam Scales.Long before full time, Celtic seemed content to take a point. Rangers, who have been prone to defensive calamity, were grateful for the clean sheet. “The quality of the game wasn’t at a high enough level,” Rodgers said. What a wonderful understatement.Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipRangersCelticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

United saw a loan inquiry for Martínez dismissed out of hand earlier in the window, with Villa only willing to part with Martínez for a significant fee, thought to be about £40m.United are mulling over whether to sign a new No 1 and also retain an interest in Royal Antwerp’s 23-year-old Senne Lammens, a long-term target. Martínez was in tears during Villa’s final home game of last season but, aside from United’s loan bid and interest from the Saudi Pro League, firm bids for the 32-year-old have not materialised.Villa left Martínez out of their squad at home to Crystal Palace on Sunday with his immediate future uncertain. Villa signed Marco Bizot from Brest as backup to Martínez and their priority targets to replace Martínez have since moved on; Joan García has joined Barcelona and Lucas Chevalier has moved to Paris Saint-Germain.On the eve of the season Unai Emery suggested Martínez could depart despite beginning the season at Villa. “I am so, so happy with him,” Emery said. “Of course, maybe as well, he can be in the windows with the possibility to leave.”Meanwhile, Villa are closing on a deal for the free agent Victor Lindelöf, who left Manchester United in the summer after eight seasons. The 30-year-old Sweden defender has been identified because he is a versatile option, capable of playing at centre-back and right-back. Villa loaned Chelsea’s Axel Disasi, who also plays both positions, for the second half of last season.Jamie Vardy is flying to Italy on Sunday to finalise a move to Serie A club Cremonese. The 38-year-old, who left Leicester City at the end of last season, has been considering offers in recent weeks. Vardy – regarded one of Leicester’s greatest players having led the line in their Premier League triumph in 2016 – is expected to sign an initial one-year contract.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowNottingham ForestBotafogoFulhamManchester UnitedAston VillanewsShareReuse this content"

As the Hundred signed off on its opening chapter – next year will bring new owners, rebranding andpotentially an extreme makeover of squads– this was a fitting result, the Invincibles men having been the standout side for much of it.Will Jacks and Nathan Sowter, both of whom played in the Invincibles’ first match in 2021, were the ones responsible this time, with Trent Rockets falling to a 26-run defeat. Jacks provided the hits in the first half, finishing with 72 off 41 balls as the Invincibles put up 168, and Sowter ruined the chase quickly. A 10-ball set by the leg-spinner accounted for the Rockets’ top three of Tom Banton, Joe Root and Rehan Ahmed. Marcus Stoinis briefly threatened with 64 off 38, but it never turned into a serious fright.Superchargers cruise past Brave to clinch Women’s Hundred titleRead moreThere probably will not be a Last Dance-style docuseries in 25 years on the Invincibles’ Hundred success, with Sam Curran puffing on a cigar as he explains his takedown of Sam Cook at the Oval. But the south London side have been thoroughly watchable, finishing top of the league stage in three successive seasons, their excellence driven by a stable set of players. They entered this contest with nine of the XI from the final last year, confident enough to leave Gus Atkinson on the bench.“It’s nice to play with people that have been with this team for five years,” said the Invincibles’ Jordan Cox, the leading run-scorer this season. A new player recruitment system next year could rip that connection up. “We’ll try our best to keep a little group together but the cricket world’s changing, whatever they do, the people in the hierarchy can decide that. We’ll just play cricket and try and entertain.”The Rockets arrived after a rain-ruined eliminator the night before, their second-place finish sending Northern Superchargers out. Their run was powered by the energy of Ahmed, the 21‑year‑old twirling his leg-breaks while batting at No 3, and very capable of carrying that charisma into a Lord’s final. But this remained a difficult task for the Rockets made harder by an injury sustained by Lockie Ferguson in the warmups, prompting the last‑second introduction of Dillon Pennington for his first game of this year’s tournament.Pennington was the first to strike after the Invincibles batted first, his opening delivery a wide loosener to Tawanda Muyeye. An invitation to send the ball into the grandstand was rejected, Muyeye edging behind for 15.But the opening exchanges still belonged to the Invincibles as Jacks thumped away while Cox settled in at the other end. Stoinis thought he had Jacks caught in the deep but the full toss was a touch too high, prompting the no-ball call. Ahmed’s stump‑to‑stump fizz was handled, too, Jacks getting the reverse sweep out to find the boundary. The Invincibles had 83 runs after 50 balls.View image in fullscreenNathan Sowter jumps for joy, next to teammate Sam Billings, after taking the wicket of Joe Root for 10.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesBen Sanderson was pummelled through the off-side and George Linde felt double pain from a dropped chance; the left-arm spinner failed to take a return catch off Cox and the blow to the hand forced him off the field. Jacks tonked Ahmed over midwicket to bring up his half-century off 32 balls, with the Rockets threatening to disintegrate. Ahmed did account for Cox on 40, but Jacks remained locked in, driving Pennington over extra cover for six and perishing with 15 balls left in the innings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a 32-run powerplay, some hoo-ha was needed against spin. Adam Zampa was the big-name leggie in the Invincibles lineup but it was his less heralded colleague who broke through.Sowter, one of two players in the XI without an international cap, invited a Root launch to Jacks at long-on and rattled Ahmed’s stumps for a duck. Sam Billings kept Sowter on for another five, a call that resulted in a miscue from Banton. Ten consecutive deliveries resulted in three runs and three wickets, Sowter in effect bringing the match to an end with 60 balls to spare.A new-look tournament awaits, though the prospect of a switch to Twenty20 does not appeal to Cox. “I absolutely love the [Hundred] format, I think it’s the best format,” he said, questioning the value of competing with the Indian Premier League. “What’s the point in trying to change it to be second best?

You get a message one night, a day and a half later you’re on a plane, and then a day and a half later you’re on the field.”The final was a rematch of the 2023 game which Brave won comfortably, while this season the Southampton‑based side had enjoyed a faultless procession to the final, winning all eight of their group-stage matches. But Brave faltered at the last after being put in to bat by a Superchargers side high on confidence following their 42-run hammering of London Spiritin the eliminator on Saturday.Kate Cross quickly found herself on a hat-trick, Sophie Devine and Freya Kemp both holed out in the 20s, and Brave’s captain Georgia Adams was run out after hitting the ball straight back to the bowler Cross and dashing out of her ground. Brave put just 115 runs on the board.“A final’s a final and you’ve got to go into that on a fresh start, wipe what’s happened away,” Adams said. “We didn’t hit our straps early enough with the ball today and put enough pressure on them.”Brave had defended a total of 106 three days ago at Southampton against Welsh Fire, but Superchargers are a far stronger batting side. The world’s leading proponent of the switch-hit, the 22-year-old Australian left-hander Phoebe Litchfield, once again showcased her extraordinary talent, with two of her five boundaries hit from a right-handed stance. She was ultimately undone with a conventional sweep which ended up in the hands of Lauren Bell at short fine leg, but by the time she was dismissed – shortly after a 15-minute rain delay – the equation was down to a run a ball and an unbeaten partnership of 60 from 24 balls between Carey and Annabel Sutherland saw Superchargers home with 12 balls to spare.Superchargers enjoyed their fair share of luck – Chloe Tryon could have seen off Carey lbw first ball had Brave referred the not-out decision to the third umpire, while Bell actually clipped the top of Sutherland’s stumps but failed to dislodge the bails – but the pair remained unbeaten to the end, Sutherland sealing the win in style with a six lofted over long-on.Whatever happened in the final on Sunday was scarcely going to eclipse the events of 24 hours previously, whereby the 18-year-old prodigy Davina Perrin struck a once‑in‑a-lifetime century to propel Superchargers into the final, and herself into England contention.All eyes were on Perrin as she walked out to the middle at Lord’s and continued where she had left off with back-to-back boundaries against Bell, including disdainfully ramping her bouncer – the shot of a supremely confident player who has just played the innings of her career.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Who knows, next summer we might see Dav up in lights here in a World Cup final for England.”There was a sigh of disappointment around the ground when Perrin skied a catch to mid-on for just 17. But while she could not quite match her mammoth efforts of the previous day, she can look back with satisfaction on an innings which launched her side to an odds-defying Hundred title.Perrin’s innings may also have wider significance, showcasing the quality of the Women’s Hundred at a time when female players are anxious about their future in a tournament now with a new set of owners who are making noises about possible changes to the double-header format, team names and player-selection process.“We absolutely love playing it, we love the format, we love playing alongside the men,” Adams said. “The nature of what we’re doing now is you’ve just got to roll with what’s happening, roll with the changes, be open to change. But everyone feels like it’s just starting to take off. Hopefully they don’t change too much, but we’ll just have to wait and see what’s thrown at us.”Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

So much has been said about the winger, with the former Black Fern Kendra Cocksedge saying she “isn’t human” and the New Zealand star Ruby Tui describing her as “out of this world”. On Sunday Woodman-Wickliffe became New Zealand’s all-time record try‑scorer as the side secured their quarter-final place with a big win.Jess Breach hails ‘phenomenal’ feeling as she eyes 50th England cap against AustraliaRead moreWoodman-Wickliffe moved one ahead of Doug Howlett, who scored 49 tries in 62 Tests, while the Black Ferns wing reached her 50 tries in 30 Tests. She also added to her record number of World Cup tries which now stands at 22.Asked if there are any more records for her to break, the 34-year-old Woodman-Wickliffe replied: “Plenty. I don’t know what they are but it is a testament to the team. I had to tell my mum ‘don’t talk about it’, there is so much external pressure about it. I thought: ‘I am going to score this one and get it done and out of the way and then I don’t have to think about it for the rest of the game.’“Ultimately it is the team, my job is to finish what the team creates. If I can do that and it adds to the records, so be it, but in my mind that has nothing to do with what I do. I just go out there and do my job.”Braxton Sorensen-McGee also laid down a marker, the full-back scoring an impressive hat-trick and kicking four conversions, while the back-row Jorja Miller ran in two tries.Silence descended over Sandy Park for the Haka but there was a rumbling of “ooo” as Japan formed an arrow and moved forward into a line to lay down their own challenge to New Zealand. The Black Ferns legend Tui was sitting just in front of the press box and she stood and followed along with the Haka too, rippling the atmosphere into the stands.Less than a minute into the game the Japan full-back Sora Nishimura was injured after colliding with one of her teammates and it invigorated the players. They scored one of the best team tries of the tournament so far with the wing Sakurako Hatada finishing well. But you blink and New Zealand can turn a game around, and they did just that with Woodman-Wickliffe’s try.View image in fullscreenBraxton Sorensen-McGee scored a hat-trick of  tries in New Zealand’s emphatic win.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe score was a pretty special piece of individual skill but Miller’s score next somehow eclipsed it, she ran a lovely line and evaded two defenders. Katelyn Vahaakolo, Sorensen-McGee and Kennedy Tukuafu all scored before Haruka Hirotsu received a yellow card which was sent for a bunker review for a high tackle but it remained a sin‑bin only.The second half began with a New Zealand yellow card for the replacement back‑row Laura Bayfield for a deliberate knock‑on. Japan then scored a try as Moe Tsukui went over but it was not long until the Black Ferns added to their points with Sorensen‑McGee in for her second.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Spaniard is serving well, striking his forehand cleanly and thinking clearly on court.Medvedev, Tsitsipas, Ostapenko: why does anger keep boiling over at US Open?Read moreDespite his incredible success, Alcaraz has rarely navigated the earlier stages of a grand slam tournament without some drama. This is the first time in his career that he has got to the quarter-finals of any grand slam championship without dropping a set. He is in the most consistent form of his career so far, having reached the final in each of his past seven events, and he has put himself in a strong position to continue this run.At 22, he is the youngest man in the open era to reach 13 grand slam quarter-finals, beating Boris Becker’s record set in 1990, but this is the first time in his career that he has reached the quarter-finals of all four grand slam titles in a calendar year.One year since her breakthrough run to the US Open final, Jessica Pegula continues to find her form at the perfect moment. Pegula, the fourth seed, defeated her compatriot Ann Li 6-1, 6-2 to return to the US Open quarter-finals. Despite her successful history on US hard courts, Pegula had arrived at Flushing Meadows in poor form, compiling a 2-4 record since Wimbledon. The No 2 American endured a hellish preparation week before the tournament, but she has now found her best form on the court.“I felt terrible coming into this tournament, honestly,” she said. “I had a practice Wednesday, I think I hit with Sabalenka. She killed me. I was playing terrible. Then we went out for a second hour, and I stopped like halfway through the hour and was, like: ‘I’m done, like, this isn’t good. I don’t know why I’m out here practising.’“It was hard, because that was the day after the mixed [doubles] finished, so we were switching to different balls, and I was a little frustrated. The day was really cold and windy. I was, like: ‘Yeah, I’m done for today.’ So I kind of walked off the court not very happy. Went and did an escape room with my friends and had two drinks and I was like, I need to just chill and stop getting so frustrated and overthinking all these practices.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The match stretched to three hours and 48 minutes and finished shortly before midnight, delaying the night session that followed.Coco Gauff settles serve and nerves to book Osaka clash in US Open last 16Read more“It feels really good,” said Auger-Aliassime. “I’m still young, but I’ve been working at this for years. Some people may have been watching me for the first time tonight, and to show that kind of tennis on this stage means a lot. The tournament isn’t over, the job’s not done, but nights like these keep me going.”Zverev, the 2020 runner-up in New York and a semi-finalist at the Australian Open earlier this year, had looked in full control after breaking in the opening game and sealing the first set with ease. But once Auger-Aliassime edged a gruelling second-set tiebreak, saved from the brink by bold shotmaking and helped over the line by a net cord, momentum shifted decisively.The German grew increasingly agitated as his groundstrokes misfired, slamming his racket after conceding an early break in the third set. Auger-Aliassime consolidated with clutch serving and forehand winners, keeping Zverev under pressure in extended rallies. When the Canadian broke to love midway through the fourth set, Armstrong’s packed crowd sensed the upset. He closed it out on serve, pumping his fist as Zverev trudged off to his earliest US Open exit since 2018.For Auger-Aliassime, the result was a tonic after uneven seasons and recurring injuries. Once tipped as a future champion, he admitted that belief has been tested. “I’ve had ups and downs,” he said. “But you keep working, you keep believing. Tonight shows what’s possible.”Zverev, still chasing a first grand slam crown at 28, leaves New York in the third round for the first time in seven years. His summer hard-court swing has faltered after a first-round defeat at Wimbledon, despite a strong spring that included another run to the Roland Garros quarter-finals.Auger-Aliassime advances to a fourth-round meeting with Russia’s Andrey Rublev, the 15th seed, who earlier beat Hong Kong’s Coleman Wong Cameron Norrie in five sets. Rublev has never progressed beyond the quarter-final stage at a major in 10 tries, but has been consistent at this level, making the second week in New York for the sixth time.Elsewhere in the men’s draw, Jannik Sinner, the world No 1 and one of the championship favorites, swept past Canada’s Denis Shapovalov in four sets to keep his title push intact.On the women’s side, Iga Swiatek recovered from 5-1 down in the opening set to oust Anna Kalinskaya in two, extending her unbeaten streak at night sessions in New York. The match that followed on Armstrong, Maria Sakkari against Beatriz Haddad Maia, did not begin until 11.28pm because of the Auger-Aliassime–Zverev marathon.The schedule strain again highlighted the ongoing debate over late-night finishes at grand slams. The US Open introduced a rule last year allowing referees to shift matches not begun by 11.15pm to outside courts, but with Armstrong already deep into play there was no realistic option.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Alexander ZverevTennisUS Open tennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But they are only human. Increasingly, they are stretched thin, working long hours, under immense pressure, and often with limited resources. Of course, better conditions would help, including more staff and improved systems. But even in the best-funded clinics with the most committed professionals, standards can still fall short; doctors, like the rest of us, are working with stone age minds. Despite years of training, human brains are not optimally equipped for the pace, pressure, and complexity of modern healthcare.Given that patient care is medicine’s core purpose, the question is who, or what, is best placed to deliver it? AI may still spark suspicion, but research increasingly shows how it could help fix some of the most persistent problems and overlooked failures – from misdiagnosis and error to unequal access to care.As patients, each of us will face at least one diagnostic error in our lifetimes. In England, conservative estimates suggest that about5%of primary care visits result in a failure to properly diagnose, putting millions of patients in danger. In the US, diagnostic errors cause death or permanent injury to almost800,000 peopleannually. Misdiagnosis is a greater risk if you’re among the one in 10 people worldwide with a rare disease.Modern medicine prides itself on being scientific, yet doctors don’t always practise what the evidence recommends. Studies show that evidence-based treatments are offered only abouthalf the timeto adults in the US. Doctors can also disagree about diagnoses. Ina studyof more than 12,000 radiology images, reviewers offering second opinions disagreed with the original assessment in about one in three cases – leading to a change in treatment nearly 20% of the time. As the work day wears on, quality slips further: inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions rise, while cancer screening rates fall.As alarming as this is, there are understandable reasons for these failures – and viewed from another angle, it’s remarkable that doctors get it right as often as they do. The realities of being human – distraction, multitasking, even our body clocks – take a toll. But burnout, depression and cognitive ageing don’t just wear doctors down; they raise the risk of clinical mistakes.Medical knowledge also moves faster than doctors can keep up. By graduation, half of what medical students learn is already outdated. It takes anaverage of17 years for research to reach clinical practice, and with a new biomedical article published every 39 seconds, even skimming the abstracts would take about 22 hours a day. There are more than 7,000 rare diseases, with 250 more identified each year.In contrast, AI devours medical data at lightning speed, 24/7, with no sleep and no bathroom breaks. Where doctors vary in unwanted ways, AI is consistent. And while these tools make errors too, it would be churlish to deny how impressive the latest models are, with some studies showing theyvastly outperform human doctorsin clinical reasoning, including for complex medical conditions.AI’s superpower is spotting patterns humans miss, and these tools are surprisingly good at recognising rare diseases – often better than doctors. For example, inone 2023 studyresearchers fed 50 clinical cases – including 10 rare conditions – into ChatGPT-4. It was asked to provide diagnoses in the form of ranked suggestions. It solved all of the common cases by the second suggestion, and got 90% of the rare conditions by the eighth – outperforming the human doctors used as comparators. Patients and their families are increasingly recognising these benefits. One child, Alex, saw 17 doctors overthree years for chronic pain– none could explain his symptoms. Desperate, his mother turned to ChatGPT, which suggested a rare condition called tethered cord syndrome. Doctors confirmed the diagnosis, and Alex is now receiving proper treatment.Then there’s the problem of access. Healthcare is upside down. Those most in need – the sickest, poorest, and most marginalised in society – are the ones most likely to be left behind. Packed schedules and poor public transport mean millions miss appointments. Parents and part-time workers, including those with gig economy jobs, often struggle to attend checkups.American Time Use Surveydata shows patients sacrifice two hours for a 20-minute doctor’s visit. The problems are often worse for people with disabilities, who are aboutfour timesmore likely to miss out on care in the UK due to issues with transport, costs and long waiting lists. Compared with men with no disability, disabled women are more than seven times more likely to have unmet needs due to the cost of care or medication.And yet we rarely question the idea of waiting in line at the doctor’s office in town because it’s simply the way things have always been done. AI could change that. Imagine a doctor in your pocket offering information when and where you need it. Under Labour’s 10-year plan, Wes Streeting, the health secretary,has announcedthat patients will soon be able to discuss their health concerns with AI via theNHSapp. It’s a bold step – and one that could bring quicker, actionable clinical advice for millions.This will only work for those who can use it, of course. Internet access is improving globally, but there are still serious gaps: 2.5 billion people remain offline. In the UK,8.5 million peoplelack basic digital skills, and 3.7 million families fall below the “minimum digital living standard”, meaning they have poor connectivity, outdated devices and limited support. Confidence is a barrier too: 21% of people in the UK say they feel left behind by technology.At the moment, AI healthcare research almost exclusively fixates on its flaws. Examining the technology’s potential for bias and errors is a crucially important task. But this orientation doesn’t take account of the creaking and sometimes unsafe systems we already rely on. Any fair assessment of AI must be weighed against the realities of what we’ve currently got – a system that too often can be frustrating, out of reach, or just plain wrong.Charlotte Blease is a health researcher and the author ofDr Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us – and How AI Could Save Lives, published by Yaleon 9 September.Further readingDeep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Againby Eric Topol (Basic Books, £28)Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AIby Ethan Mollick (WH Allen, £16.99)Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humansby Melanie Mitchell (Pelican, £10.99)Explore more on these topicsBooksThe big ideaArtificial intelligence (AI)Health & wellbeingHealth policyNHSfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet for Ukrainians, the reality remains unchanged:airstrikes still thunder across their cities, homes still burn, lives are still lost. Against this grim backdrop, the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, has seemed more than content to bask inthe literal red-carpet treatmentafforded by the president of the United States.Donald Trump, who has anointed himself mediator of this war, has nearly exhausted the lexicon of contradiction. Some days he proclaims thathealone can end this war. Then he insists thatpeace talks should be left to the two parties.At times he boasts that Putin“respects” him; at others, he castigates Putinfor “going absolutely crazy”. This month, Trump vacillated between putting US troops on the table andruling it out. Now he is reportedly considering usingUS private military firmsfor the job.For those watching – whether in Kyiv, Moscow, Washington or beyond – the effect is dizzying. Policy by improvisation is not strategy. And in a war where lives hang on the credibility of US commitments, unpredictability is not strength. It is abdication.So what is Trump doing,Nobel peace prize ambitionsaside? Has he finally realised that Putin has no interest in a treaty that falls short of his maximalist goals? Or is this simply another chapter in a familiar playbook – headline chasing, image first, strategy later – where the costs will be borne not in Washington but on the streets of Kyiv?After a long learning curve, Trump may finally be realising that Putin has played him – that the two are not the close friends he once imagined. His repeated threats to imposenew sanctions and tariffson Russia are one example. Yet Trump has also shown time and again his willingness to forgive and forget, so long as Putin offers a new promise that this time things will be different.In the meantime, Ukraine appears to have found a workaround for direct US military aid, though one that comes at immense cost. With European financing, Kyiv cankeep buying US weaponswhile Ukraine and the EU scale up production. It is hardly optimal, but it sustains the status quo: Ukraine survives, Trump claims credit for US arms profits, and Europe keeps Russia bogged down elsewhere. As long as this arrangement holds, the war will go on. Russiawill continue to attack, but it will not defeat Ukraine. And in the absence of genuine US leadership, the conflict will persist as long as Putin can throw bodies forward.0:45Russian attack on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region leaves dozens injured – videoAt the same time asUkrainescrambles for survival, Putin is playing a different game altogether. He is the unlikely winner in this mayhem. Unable to seize an upper hand at the negotiating table through battlefield victories, he has fallen back on the tools that have served him for decades: obfuscation, manipulation and the grinding down of adversaries. Putin may not yet have secured everything on his wishlist, but he is nothing if not patient.Unlike democratic leaders, Putin faces no checks – only an inner circle ofmilitary and conservative eliteswith an imperialist worldview. To them, Ukraine is not just another territory to be bartered away to help boost Trump’s ego. It is the key to restoring Russia’s lost greatness.Putin also understands that US audiences crave clarity; they tire quickly of drawn-out talks and muddled messages. Fatigue becomes Putin’s ally. The tedium, the phone calls, the visits that go nowhere – these are not failures of diplomacy. They are the strategy. Once the war fades from headlines, his hope is to strike a bargain in the shadows: sanctions lifted, aid to Ukraine frozen. For Putin, every hour of confusion is an investment. The question is whether anyone else at the table has the stamina to see through it.The real loser in this, other than Ukraine, is Trump himself. For all his posturing, he risks selling himself short if his ambitions stop at a medal in Oslo. He imagines more – and he might even achieve it. If he emerges with a clear policy to end the war, this could be his Reagan moment: a chance to be celebrated as the saviour of the free world.The Guardian view on Russia’s strike on Kyiv: Putin is testing Trump’s will and Europe’s resolve | EditorialRead moreTrump is not wrong that Joe Biden was too cautious to claim such a mantle. Trump, in contrast, could. Whether or not Putin personally respects him is debatable, but Putin does respect US military power. And there are options available, many well short of all-out war: thebipartisan Graham-Blumenthal bill, expanded air support, lifting missile restrictions and major increases in direct military aid, among others.Like any autocrat, Putin can be coerced. Biden was too timid to test that premise. Trump may not be. After all, unpredictability is his calling card. Should Trump force Putin to back down and end the war, he would secure a legacy as the unexpected hero. But if he allows Putin to dictate the outcome, the laurels will fall to Moscow. History will record not a peacemaker but a president who helpedRussia, the US’s longtime adversary, reclaim its imperial standing while cementing the decline of US hegemony.Olga Chyzh researches political violence and repressive regimes.

Then they came for Cracker Barrel.Whether it’s the museums or the corporations – or the universities, law firms, federal departments and agencies – the attack lines of the Trump culture war and its culture warriors are the same. The vicious full-scale assault on the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain after the company naively wandered on to the battle zone by altering its “Old Timer” logo exposes the cynicism of the whole operation and its ulterior motive to impose an authoritarian regime over every aspect of American society.On 19 August, Donald Trump launched his purge campaign against the Smithsonian with apostdenouncing it as “the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE’ …where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.”Within 24 hours, the son echoed the father, but with a different target in the crosshairs. The day after Trump denounced the Smithsonian,Donald TrumpJr took umbrage at Cracker Barrel, joining a rightwing social media mob.Cracker Barrel’s sales had gone flat partly due to its creaky image, symbolized by a logo featuring a geezer in overalls seated cross-legged and leaning on a barrel, promoted as the “Uncle Herschel” of the store’s founder. At the company headquarters in Lebanon, Tennessee, the“Uncle Herschel Memorial”features statues of “Uncle Herschel” seated on a bench listening to a Cracker Barrel waitress. Marketing research, however, showed that the rickety ambience was off-putting to a younger suburban clientele. So “Uncle Herschel” was retired, the logo cleaned up with just the brand name front and center, the interiors with dark brown log cabin walls whitewashed and more brightly lit.‘A proxy for America’s culture war’: why Cracker Barrel’s new logo sparked ire on the rightRead moreBut this marketing facelift, a common corporate design “refinement”, as it is known, was a new frontier beyond “the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE’”. Don Jr retweeted a post by an account called theWoke War Roomattacking Julie Felss Masino, the Cracker Barrel CEO: “She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding. She should resign and be replaced with leadership that will restore Cracker Barrel’s tradition.”If Don Jr had ever eaten at a Cracker Barrel, he would have had to leave the confines of Manhattan and Palm Beach. There is not a single Cracker Barrel to be found in any borough of New York City, or on Long Island either. His personal experience with “tradition” is not located in the biscuit mix section of the country store. If Don Jr’s complaint is with “soulless branding”, it does not extend to the sale of the$DJTJR(Donald J Trump Jr) crypto memecoin. But this bit of brazen hypocrisy is lost in the ocean of the Trump family’s grifting.When the right launched its version of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, now with the power of theTrump administrationbehind it, nobody predicted that Cracker Barrel would become collateral damage. The Tennessee-based chain, founded in 1969, trafficked in faux rustic pre-second world war nostalgia, an image from before the existence of supermarkets, shopping malls and the interstate highways where most of the restaurants are located. Cracker Barrel was a little theme park. Customers entered through a retail outlet that resembled a country store. On the restaurant’s walls hung old advertising signs, farm implements and framed antique photos of 19th-century folk with a grim American Gothic look. The menu consisted of “homestyle food”, including “the best classic meatloaf” with mashed potatoes and gravy.But in the 1990s and early 2000s the business suffered protests after thefiring of employees suspected of being gayand reached an agreement with the justice department to change its management practices after allegedly segregating Black diners. The clientele that favored the kitsch decor also dwindled. In response, the company shed its old prejudiced practices and recently unveiled its makeover to update its tired image. That provided the pretext for the calculated Maga explosion.Hillsdale College, a rightwing citadel in southern Michigan that has been vehement in ramping up the culture wars, posted on X the plain Cracker Barrel logo on one side of a frame with a statue of George Washington splattered with red paint on the other under the line: “Same energy.” The Hillsdale account added: “Cracker Barrel is a beloved cultural icon, tied to the lifestyle and memories of truth-seeking Americans.”According to this college, a center of conservative thought, the restaurant chain is apparently the cultural equivalent of the Smithsonian, or should be exhibited there, and its customers who have pulled in for the chicken fried steak are “truth-seeking Americans”, presumably as opposed to those who stop for the chicken wings at Chili’s. The culture war doesn’t stop at the logo’s edge.TheWoke War Roomthat aroused Don Jr used the attack line that Cracker Barrel perpetrates a “DEI regime”. The CEO’s picture was placed next to the rainbow logo of the LGBTQ+ Alliance. The post also noted that America First Legal, a far-right group founded by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy involved in Ice raids, the culture war against universities and apparently much else, hadfiled complaintswith the Equal Opportunities Employment Commission and the Tennessee attorney general alleging racial discrimination by Cracker Barrel because of its DEI policy. The Maga mob piled in with misogynistic tweets against the female CEO.A Maga social media influencer, Robby Starbuck, advancing himself within the rightwing constellation as an anti-DEI activist,threatened: “Oh my goodness. When you see what we’ve got on Cracker Barrel … Wow. I don’t think anyone knew it was as bad as the stuff we received. We’re talking total capture by leftism at the exec level. We have photos, videos, etc. Should I put it all in 1 video or release 1 by 1?”In 2022, Starbuck, whose given name is Robert Newsom, was excluded from running in the Republican primary for the Tennessee fifth congressional district by the Tennessee Republican party, which found that he was not “a bona fide Republican”. His exclusion was upheld by theTennessee supreme court.On 23 August,Fox Newsfeatured his video denouncing Cracker Barrel for its involvement in gay pride events – “a microcosm of the parasitic operating procedure of leftwing activists” with a “soulless, godless, hedonistic vision of the future”. This month, he began advising Meta “on efforts to curb what they describe as political bias in its AI tools”, according to theWall Street Journal. His advisory role comes amid a defamation settlement after a Meta AI chatbot inaccurately said he had been involved in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. He has only been part of social media mobs.Stoking the ferocity of the onslaught against Cracker Barrel,Starbuck spoke with Christopher Rufo, who has positioned himself among the chief culture war activists on the right. He had been the key adviser to the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, in his crusades to ban books, attack the Walt Disney Company as “woke” and assail universities.Rufo is a certain kind of zealot who has achieved his greatest influence under Trump, like Miller and Project 2025’s Russell Vought, now the head of the office of management and budget, self-styled ideological commissars with a Bolshevik mentality.In aspeechin 2022 at Hillsdale College, which Rufo titled Laying Siege to the Institutions, he boasted of his “very aggressive” campaign against Disney. “You have to be ruthless and brutal in pursuit of something good,” he said, in a Leninist spirit, describing a “narrative war” with American corporations and institutions. “We get in there, we defund things we don’t like, we fund things we do like.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have never set foot in a Cracker Barrel and, as such, have little stake in what is emblazoned above its doorways,” Rufo wrote inCity Journal, the magazine of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative thinktank where he is a senior fellow. “The logo change might have caught the public’s initial attention, but the underlying political story had real stakes. If companies that depend on conservatives adopt radical left-wing policies, they must face the consequences.”Rufo decided that Cracker Barrel was a worthy target for the overarching culture war. “Some might dismiss the Cracker Barrel campaign as minor, or even embarrassing … But there is enormous value in making an example of the company and cementing a fear that conservatives can spontaneously lash out at any institution that crosses the line. Today, it’s Cracker Barrel; tomorrow it might be Pepsi, Target, or Procter & Gamble.”Cracker Barrel’s “Old Timer” logo had to be manufactured into a cause célèbre for a larger purpose. “Even if we don’t care about Cracker Barrel in particular,” Rufo wrote, “we should all care about the ideological capture of American institutions and use whatever power we have to reverse it. And for that to occur, the Barrel must be broken.”With that call to arms, Rufo gives the game away. He doesn’t really take the conspiratorial fiction seriously. It is useful only as an instrument for bludgeoning those designated as objective enemies in order to build toward absolute power. In the gradation of his hierarchy of conservative principles, the highest value is cynicism. Rufo’s rhetoric has the characteristic tone of Stalin’s statement on 29 July 1936 declaring his Great Purge: “The inalienable quality of every Bolshevik under present conditions should be the ability to recognize an enemy of the Party no matter how well he may be masked.”On 26 August, Trump entered the fray, saying that Cracker Barrel should “admit a mistake … Make Cracker Barrel a WINNER again. Remember, in just a short period of time I made the United States of America the ‘HOTTEST’ Country anywhere in the World. One year ago, it was ‘DEAD.’ Good luck!”That evening, Cracker Barrel executives reportedly called the Trump White House to offer unconditional surrender. “They thanked President Trump for weighing in on the issue of their iconic ‘original’ logo,” Taylor Budowich, the cabinet secretary,posted. “They wanted the President to know that they heard him … and would be restoring the ‘Old Timer.’ So smart! Congrats Cracker Barrel and America!” The White House issued an official statement announcing the restoration as if it were a decisive presidential action: “Congratulations Cracker Barrel!” Nobel prize!“Uncle Herschel” was back, the “woke” conspiracy again defeated, another victory in the culture war.

And yet, he said, he was miserable. How could he be happy about his success when so many terrible things were happening in the world?It’s a good question, and one that I hear from a lot of people these days. As I write these words, humanitarian disasters are unfolding in Gaza, Sudan, Yemen, Myanmar, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Global climate action has not moved fast enough, and we are perilously close to creating an uninhabitable planet. Meanwhile here in the United States, immigrants have been rounded up and shipped to foreign countries without legal protection. Trans people have been demonized. Meaningful government agencies have been cut. Research destroyed. Universities attacked. The legal system pushed to the brink and corruption rampant.Is it cruel to be happy when there is so much destruction? Or is it simply foolish to tie one’s mental health to this unpredictable and often violent world? I told my friend that both questions hold some truth: if he is going to feel the world’s pain, he should remember to feel its joys as well. In saying this, I was relying on some of the oldest beliefs in the world – ones that we’d do well to remember today.The idea that we should feel the pain of others is deeply etched into many cultural and religious beliefs. A foundational image for this is an understanding of humanity as members of a single body. We can find versions of the concept in the religious texts of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity.In finding beauty in the broken, we can form a bridge between the mundane and the divine | Jackie BaileyRead moreThere is, for example, St Paul in one of his letters to the Corinthians: “For just as the body is one and has many members … so it is with Christ … If one member suffers, all suffer together with it.” Centuries later, Ralph Waldo Emerson offered a secular formula: “It is a doctrine alike of the oldest and of the newest philosophy, that man is one, and that you cannot injure any member, without a sympathetic injury to all the members.”Those today who doubt their own right to happiness are echoing this noble tradition of thought. It is reasonable and moral to think that when others are being injured, you, too, should feel that injury.But feeling what others feel does not limit you to their pain. The St Paul quote above continues: “If one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.” There is some logical truth in this: if we experience the injuries done to others, shouldn’t we experience their joys as well?Some Buddhist texts suggest that this is part of the process of enlightenment. Buddha recommends spreading one’s consciousness across the whole universe and experiencing all the joys of others encountered on the way. This feeling is calledmudita, often translated as sympathetic joy. A German term –freudenfreude, pleasure in another person’s pleasure – nicely captures this idea.When we doubt whether we should feel good right now, we are only feeling the pain of others. We focus so much on what’s going wrong in the world that we neglect to also experience the goodness – the new feats, delights, births, achievements, decencies, kindnesses – all around us. While focusing excessively on the positives makes us saccharine, ignoring them completely makes us cynical.Recognizing the need to experience both the pain and joy of others helps us move past the traps of feeling bad for feeling good or feeling good only by ignoring the world. It helps us overcome the common pitfalls of retreating into the empty sloganeering of positive thinking or the equally unhelpful downward spiral of doomscrolling depression. We can instead appreciate the very real nature of our feelings: miserable and elated, horrified and happy.As connected members of an unfurling and complex world, we are bound to experience this range of moods. The trick is to learn to let ourselves experience them all and not get fixated on any particular feeling. The times we live in are full of horror and delight. So are our souls. It’s okay to feel both.To say this is not to cave into normalization and acceptance of our current political situation. There is much more chaos and cruelty than there ever should be. And that’s part of the point: the current administration wants to “own the libs” and create pain and confusion. Political action is the main venue to fight back. But taking care of ourselves also matters. Feeling bad some of the time about the state of the world is part of being a connected human. Feeling good some of the time is part of our resistance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

History gives me hope because we’ve managed to overcome so many terrible things before. I look back and see so much unnecessary death and destruction, but I also see that humans bonded together and formed ways of living that were kinder and more caring. It teaches me that we are at least capable of overcoming the horrors of the present.That’s also why alliances matter.

A few days later, the Associated Press, a leading global news agency that is also a linguistic bible for newsrooms across the US, said that while it would acknowledge Trump’s order, it wouldmostly continue to use the original name. In response, the White Housebanned AP journalistsfrom certain media availabilities. Trump accused the agency of failing to follow the law. The AP said the government was trying to dictate what words it can and cannot use.This week, Nottinghamshire’s Reform-led county council said that it would impose a sweeping ban on the Nottingham Post, its affiliated website and BBC-funded reporters who work there. At issue, apparently, was a story that the paper had written about a proposed reorganisation of local government. The leader of the council insisted that he welcomes scrutiny, but has a “duty” to combat “misinformation”. The Post’s editorcalled the decision“a massive attack on local democracy” – and it’s hard to disagree.The Guardian view on Reform UK v the Nottingham Post: a council’s boycott of its local paper is both petty and alarming | EditorialRead moreThe ban has clear echoes of Trump’s tactics, andsomecriticssaid as much explicitly.

But one doesn’t need to look as far as that to understand the Nottinghamshire ban. Indeed, Reform has been accused before of shutting out reporters, or otherwise treating them with disrespect: last year,the party reportedly excluded certain adversarial outlets and journalists from its conference; earlier this summer, Reform’s leader Nigel Farageaccused local reporters in Scotlandof helping to coordinate protests against him. It all seems to add up, on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond, to a moment in which hard-right politicians, in particular, feel that they don’t need to engage with traditional news outlets to get their message out, and that they won’t suffer electoral consequences for shutting them out. They might even benefit from doing so, turning the media into a foil as part of a broader war against the establishment.And yet, there are also reasons to doubt these conclusions, or at least to texture them. It’s true that Trump, for example, has shut out journalists whose stories displease him. (In addition to the AP imbroglio, his White Houserecently barred a reporter from the Wall Street Journalfrom a trip to the UK, after that paper reported unflatteringly on Trump’s alleged ties to Jeffrey Epstein.) At the same time, though, Trump will routinely talk to pretty much anyone who will listen, the mainstream media very much included. (Earlier this year, he called the editor of the Atlantic a “sleazebag” – thengranted himan interview not long after.) Indeed, Trump has long used media coverage successfully to set the political agenda.In the UK, Farage seems to be using the same playbook. Sure, he has leaned, in particular, on the rightwing press. But such papers aren’t necessarily natural allies for Reform given theirdeep cultural ties to the Conservatives. And Farage has sucked up oxygen in more hostile quarters, too. This week, just as Nottinghamshire council was banning journalists, Farage was being praised,by Politico, for answering questions about his mass deportation plans with a directness that other parties should seek to emulate.Trump has clearly proven that there aren’t hard electoral consequences for press-bashing. But there are still important differences between UK and US political culture. Trust in the media is at alow ebb here, too. But in the recent past, rightwing political figures who have used Trumpian rhetoric to deflect blame for their own failures on to the media haven’t always been successful. Dominic Cummings goaded the press after his Covid-era drive to Barnard Castle,but could not escapemassive public anger. Boris Johnson dodging tough questions –from the Today programme, for example, which his government boycotted – didn’t spare him from the glare of scandal in the long run.This doesn’t guarantee that the leaders of Nottinghamshire council will suffer from banning their local paper. Indeed, it might very well be to Reform’s advantage to let Farage suck up attention nationally while dodging scrutiny for the actions of the party’s councillors across the country; the party surely wants the media talking about immigration, not the reorganisation of local government. And local outlets might seem an easy target, diminished in power and reach in an age of cuts to local news and unchained online discourse.View image in fullscreenPresident Trump meets members of the media at the White House.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersAnd yet Reform’s leadership of councils is an important test for the party in a country where voters still, to some extent, value competent governance. “If Reform can’t even face questions from the Nottingham Post,” the Conservative party chair Kevin Hollinrakewondered this week, “what hope is there that they could ever face the serious responsibilities of government?” He’s surely not the only one asking that question. Even in the US, where the culture of political press-bashing is more entrenched, local Republican legislators in some statesare cooperatingwith proposals to steer more resources to their dwindling local news outlets. This isn’t some act of altruism, advocates say, but one born of the realisation that they need voters to know what they’ve been doing when elections roll around.The Reform ban might hold. But at some point, local Reform councillors will want to trumpet an achievement, and when they do, it would not be a massive surprise if they go running to the Nottingham Post. Politicians can, of course, reach voters on social media these days. But established local news brands can still confer prestige. And good publicity is good publicity. For now, Trumphasn’t let up on the AP. But he hasn’t been shy about showcasing its journalism when it suits him.

Bill* was one of these clients. He sat before me, avoiding eye contact, arms crossed.“I didn’t hurt anyone, not like those other blokes did,” he said.Bill had been placed in a sex offenders group treatment program but was terminated for non-attendance. He said he had found it too hard to hear how the others had offended so he stopped going.In his mind he was different to them.I’d read Bill’s file carefully before seeing him. In forensic work this is a non-negotiable, as the version of events clients present is often different to the way events transpired, and there are often rationalisations or justifications for behaviours.I knew Bill had been convicted of possessing and distributing child exploitation material (CEM) and had been found with hard drives containing thousands of folders of it. He had been distributing it for years in return for other CEM images. He was identified as being at higher risk than the average CEM offender and treatment was mandated.In the wake of childcare allegations, how should I talk to my kids about body safety?Read moreBefore starting treatment, we spoke about the limits of confidentiality in detail. As a registered psychologist, I am mandated to report any child sexual or physical abuse, including the use of CEM, and it was important that Bill understood what this meant for our therapy.He insisted that he was not aroused by children. This is a common occurrence among CEM offenders and is a reflection of the instinctive human need to shy away from admitting something shameful. Nevertheless, clinical judgment based on his years of CEM abuse and use of aclinical measure of sexual interest in childrensuggested that he probably had paedophilic interests, which amplified his risk of reoffending.Treatment for CEM use is still at a nascent stage and there have been few comprehensive evaluations of programs to assess whether they are successful in reducing risk.For Bill, as for most of my forensic clients, I used a tailored approach based on a formulation of his offending and his needs, and aligned this with the existing research surrounding risk factors for CEM within therisk-needs-responsivity modelof rehabilitation.Bill’s denial that his offending was problematic is a common rationalisation for CEM users but pointed to offence-supportive thoughts we needed to address. We also identified that he had experienced longstanding anxiety and fears of sexual inadequacy.We needed to work on building better emotional regulation skills so he could manage stressBill also had great difficulty managing emotion and often experienced high anxiety and stress levels. Outside his connections on the dark web he was isolated and spent most of his time playing video games. This isolation had stopped him from acknowledging the reality of his CEM abuse – until police raided his home.Our work began with getting Bill to identify a few things he wanted to work on. This kind of “buy-in” is important when working with mandated clients and is a key part of making them ready for treatment. We identified that we both wanted the same thing – for Bill to not reoffend – and this shared goal allowed us to form an alliance.We also focused on developing a shared understanding of his offending to ensure he understood his “offence map”, the unnoticed steps which resulted in his decision to offend. We needed to work on building better emotional regulation skills so he could better manage stress, and also started discussing ways we could reduce his use of the internet, as absorption in the online world facilitated his offending.We also needed to help him find ways to manage his urge to use CEM in future, and built a “toolkit” to support him at these times, including use of theStop it now serviceand techniques such asurge surfing.While Bill remained in denial about the extent of the harm his behaviours had likely caused to real children, he was sincere about his desire to ensure he didn’t reoffend. We were able to make some progress towards reducing the likelihood that he would, with Bill monitored by the sex offender registry and community corrections to further manage the risk he posed.*All clients are fictional amalgamsIn Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800, or Bravehearts on 1800 272 831, and adult survivors can contact Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

When I was 20, I worked as a lifeguard and swimming teacher at the council-run swimming pool in Cambridge. There were some intriguing regulars. Prof Stephen Hawking would watch poolside as his nephews swam. There was also a smattering of ex-Olympic swimmers, including a Maltese guy who moved through the water with such precision and power that he barely made a ripple. Watching him was hypnotic.One of the city’s swimming club coaches had competed at the Munich Olympics. I confided in her that I planned to swim the Channel. I knew it would take at least two or three years of hard training, I told her, but I was committed and time was on my side – I was only 21. She looked me up and down and told me that there were not enough geese in the world to render the fat required to insulate my skinny legs from 12 cold hours in the Channel. “Find another dream,” she said.Her comment stung. My family had famously scrawny legs: straw-thin and devoid of any tactical muscle. They were legs destined to reside in perpetuity beneath the troglodyte darkness of an office desk, not power through the seas to cross-Channel glory.Despite this, I’d always been a strong swimmer at school and later swam anywhere I could: freezing mountain lakes near my village in Snowdonia, rivers, pools, ponds and quarries. Bodies of water drew me towards them with magnetic power. It was the 1980s, when wild swimming was known only as “swimming” and Dryrobes wouldn’t bringwarmth and derisionfor another three decades.I was strong but wiry, like a steel coat hanger, a racing snake. I wasn’t built for long-distance open-water swims. To swim distances, you need a degree of body fat density, buoyancy and power. I had none of this. For years, I chomped my way through peanut butter and banana sandwiches, protein shakes and ice-cream in the hope of achieving the bulk needed to stave off the cold. I could swim three miles in cold water before I started to freeze and shut down. No matter how hard I tried, I seemingly could not get past this distance barrier. Any fat I managed to lay down was burned off instantly with my constant training. I realised the swim coach was probably right, and I let my dream sink into the abyss. But what I couldn’t have known was what would take its place – and how rewarding it would be.Around this time, the city council decided that it would offer special closed-session swimming lessons to small groups of adults who wanted to learn but had a crushing fear of water. It was decided by the pool manager that I would run the class on Tuesday nights. I thought this was a nod to my expertise and maturity, but it just turned out that nobody else wanted to do it.My first group consisted of six adults of varying ages; the youngest was 23, the oldest 79. During the first session, we sat on the poolside and talked about their experiences. Flora, the oldest, had a lifelong desire to learn but had never had the opportunity; work and family had consumed her life (nobody in her family apart from her grandchildren could swim). Many of them had lived through traumatic childhood incidents – one had been pushed into a river, another had been humiliated during a family seaside holiday.It requires real courage to share your fear and shame with a stranger, and learning to swim also requires you to undress, all your vulnerabilities shrink-wrapped into a singular experience. For that reason, there were no spectators. During those evening sessions, the pool was silent and still, the lights to the spectator gallery dimmed, the building transformed into a temple of tranquillity.By week three, everybody was standing waist-deep in the shallow end of the pool. The challenge was to walk across the 10 metres to the other side, hands clamped to a swim float that I was holding. The tiles underfoot were slippery and losing balance was easy. The last to go was a guy named Raj. He was twice my size and his desire to learn to swim was driven by a need to conquer a fear that had plagued him since childhood. He was dreading this exercise more than anyone else. By week seven, he was swimming, float held in front, legs furiously churning water.Week after week I had assured them that one day they would jump into the deep end and swim a full length of the pool, unaided by floats. Nobody believed this was possible; most only wanted to be able to float and tread water. I loved these sessions. Watching somebody slowly overcome a long-ingrained fear was deeply gratifying.I’m no sportsman, but a rugby legend’s simple, sage advice struck a chord | Richard ColesRead moreBy summer, I had migrated the class to a nearby outdoor pool, a staggeringly beautiful 100-yard lido surrounded by trees. The cold water was a shock but soon the realisation that they were away from the calm, safe privacy of the indoor pool hit them: they were out in the world doing something they could never have imagined themselves doing. It was glorious.I taught this class for a year before leaving to enrol at college as a mature 23-year-old. I like to think the course was a success and that the council continued with it, but sadly, a year later the pool was partially demolished and a smaller pool built, run by a private contractor. It had all the charm of a shopping-centre gym and there didn’t seem to be any classes for people who had sat too long on the riverbank watching and dreaming.At its most basic, swimming is about breathing and floating. The rest is just style. If you were lucky enough to learn as a kid, then great; lots of people didn’t get that opportunity to experience the amniotic weightlessness of being in a blue rectangle of water, or feel their toes brush along the pebbled bottom of a slow-moving river. The hard work and willpower it took my class to overcome something so debilitating for such a simple reward stayed with me for the rest of my life. None of them were ever going to swim the Channel, but of course, I never told them that.Gareth Roberts is a freelance writer living in SnowdoniaExplore more on these topicsSwimmingWords that changed everythingFitnesscommentShareReuse this content"

Her brilliance turns it into genuinely moving TVLucy ManganSun 31 Aug 2025 17.00 EDTShareIs there any comfort to be had in knowing that police incompetence is not a new phenomenon? Not really, no. But it might be all you can find to cling on to during this harrowing, heartbreaking four-part drama. I Fought the Law is based on the true story of Ann Ming ,the murder of her 22-year-old daughter Julie in 1989 and her 30-year campaign to change the double jeopardy law so Julie’s acquitted killer could be tried again for the crime.I Fought the Law has two great strengths. First, the awareness that although the overturning of a law that had existed since Magna Carta is technically the most astonishing part of Ming’s tale, it is not the most televisual. That, for better or worse, will always be the body blows she withstood, from finding her daughter’s body three months after she went missing to the two horrendous trials she sat through and years of injustice. These would have felled anyone less extraordinary (and indeed threatened to fell her husband and their marriage, although both made it through in battered but unbowed form). The drama wisely confines the legal machinations to the final episode and concentrates three-quarters of its time on limning the lives of the Ming family before and after Julie’s murder.The second great strength – as is almost always the case – iscasting Sheridan Smith in the main role. Ordinary women in extraordinary circumstances are what she does, and few do it better. Here, she elevates a workaday script that dares not take too many liberties, lest it be seen to dishonour the story, and makes it genuinely moving. She gets help from the strong cast that is – again, as ever – assembled round her.Special mention must go to the chilling ordinariness Jack James Ryan brings to the part of the murderous Billy Dunlop, and to Daniel York Loh as Ann’s husband and Julie’s father, Charlie Ming, a man at first too broken to support his wife and devoid of her crusading zeal, but who digs deep to try to bring her what she needs to survive.For all its formulaic structure and the traditional beats it is careful to hit (winsome child asking poignant questions about mummy, bureaucratic nightmares and class snobbery as the doughty nurse faces down the British establishment), I Fought the Law does an unusually good job of sympathising with, rather than condemning, the half of the partnership to whom fighting for justice does not come naturally. Charlie would probably – like, I suspect, most of us – prefer to crawl into a ditch and pray for some kind of impossible peace. In its way, his quieter journey is as impressive as Ann’s, and the drama takes the trouble to show us how.‘I was bawling my eyes out’: Sheridan Smith on drink, death and the hardest role of her careerRead moreThe police spent the initial period of Julie’s disappearance insisting that the mother of one, who saw or spoke to her mother at least once a day, must have decided to leave her son, Kevin, behind and move to London without telling anyone when she separated from her husband. After relentless pressure to investigate from Ann, a forensics team was sent to examine the house. After five days, they had found nothing to indicate foul play. Eighty days after Julie’s disappearance, Ann was trying to trace a bad smell in her daughter’s bathroom and found her body under the bath.The delay by the police in investigating and finding Julie – leaving aside the unfathomable suffering it would have saved her mother – meant that the evidence the jury heard in court about the cause of death, and other details potentially connecting Dunlop to the killing, was weaker than it should have been. That almost certainly contributed to the two hung juries and his resulting compulsory acquittal. He was then heard in local pubs bragging about committing the murder, safe in the knowledge that he could not be tried again. Or so, of course, he thought.The overturning of the archaic double jeopardy law is not a pyrrhic one for the family – it gets the violent Dunlop off the streets and will help to protect other bereaved people suffering as the Mings did. But we are aware of how life changed for them for ever: that their daughter (and Kevin’s mother) will never be restored to them because one man felt like killing her, could and did.

The band’s five members were barely out of their teens with no real plan; it was purely “vibes-based”, as vocalist and guitarist Jules Crommelin remembers: “It’s the inevitable small town [thing] – you either stay forever or you leave as quick as possible.”That spontaneous move a decade ago turned out to be a fortuitous decision for the young band: Crommelin, percussionist Anatole “Toto” Serret, keyboardist and vocalist Louie Swain, bassist Noah Hill and keyboardist, vocalist and guitarist Patrick Hetherington. Their 2015 self-released debut EP caught the attention of the French record label Kitsuné, who signed them.A year later, when Parcels played their first-ever gig in Paris, a little duo called Daft Punk was in attendance. The dance pioneers liked what they heard and invited the band to their studio. The result wasParcels’ 2017 single Overnight, which ended up being Daft Punk’s final ever production.“[That] was the first time we’d ever been in a proper recording studio as a band,” Crommelin says. “Having them guide us and write with us and produce with us … They really helped us get on the tracks.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s been such a journey, us five being together over 10 years’ … Parcels.Photograph: Drew WheelerWorking with Daft Punk felt like a “university degree of lessons”, teaching the young band how to approach and refine their craft. “It was just an explosion of everything … how to record, how to put instruments together, how precise to be,” Crommelin says. “They are just absolutely so tapped into detail, and really focusing on this infectiousness of music and just getting it right … and things just having magic.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningParcels took those lessons and ran with them. The rest, you might say, is history. They released their self-titled debut album in 2018, with one single’s video starring Milla Jovovich, and chased it with an ambitious double album, Day/Night, in 2021. Blending Beach Boys-style vocal harmonies with disco and funk influences, Parcels’ simultaneously nostalgic and contemporary sound has clearly struck a chord – their music has topped 1bn streams worldwide.The band’s euphoric live performances also put them on the map. They’ve been in hot demand this year, playing Coachella and Glastonbury. They will return to the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado in October – a venue they sold out in five minutes last year – and kick off the Australian summer with east coast shows, including two gigs on the Sydney Opera House steps.Crommelin singles out Glastonbury as the pinnacle of a year full of highlights. “I just found that festival so wildly different to every other festival – just how people were, how people engaged with the music, the vibe, the energy of the crowd,” he says. “We just played an amazing show thanks to them – we got out there, and they were just so on for us.”View image in fullscreenParcels perform at the 2025 Coachella festival.Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for CoachellaThe band is firing on all cylinders, but that couldn’t have happened if they didn’t take some time to rest after almost a decade of nonstop touring and recording. In 2023, Parcels hit pause for six months, and Crommelin returned to Australia for some downtime: “I finally got to be with friends and just have a normal life.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

During the break, the band members continued to write and work on music individually, without the pressures of deadlines or touring. It all comes together intheir upcoming third album, Loved, which was recorded all around the world in studios in Byron Bay, Berlin, Sydney and Mexico.Loved builds on their signature disco grooves, while also taking inspiration from a raft of different genres – CrommelintoldBillboard that Katy Perry, the Plastic Ono Band and the seminal post-rock group Tortoise all influenced the sound. Each band member’s “wildly different” musical tastes have converged to make something new. Serret “is deep in dance and techno”, for example, while Crommelin just “admire[s] it”. But “I’ve always felt that the more we can all go our own directions, the better the band will be,” he adds, “because when you’re pulling the same references, you can start to feel like you’re in an echo chamber.”The title of the new album has a double meaning: being loved in both the past and present tense. These songs are about love in all its pain and glory, and that duality is baked into the music. “Our music [has] this overarching light spirit … but the lyrics often speak towards something deeper and sometimes darker,” Crommelin says. “The ultimate goal is to cry on the dancefloor.”The members of Parcels are now approaching their 30s; two of them have returned to live in Australia, while the others remain in Berlin. The beauty of a band being together for so long is that there’s space for both personal and artistic growth – but what has remained unchanged is their shared love of music. “It’s been such a journey, us five being together over 10 years,” Crommelin says. “Of course, from 10 years of life, everything’s different … [but] when we get together as a dynamic of five and when we play together, we sound like Parcels.”Parcels’ new album Loved is out 12 September (Because Music). The band is performing across Europe in September and October before heading to Australia in November and December.See here for all dates.Explore more on these topicsGuardian Australia's headline actDiscoPop and rockDance musicAustralian musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

They will find it at an exhibition of his extraordinary 90-metre frieze, A Year in Normandy, and other works at the Serpentine gallery inLondon.The free exhibition is likely to draw thousands of fans of the 88-year-old artist, adored for his vibrant images, bluff Yorkshire manner and defiant advocacy of smoking.View image in fullscreenDavid Hockney painting in Normandy.Photograph: David HockneyThe show will be mounted in the same year as the Bayeux tapestry – cited by Hockney as an inspiration for his frieze, and described by the artist as “one of the oldest and most remarkable artworks” – comes to London for the first time in nearly 1,000 years in a cultural exchange withFrance.Hockney moved to Normandy, the home of the Bayeux tapestry, in late 2019, and began producing images of winter trees on his iPad. “Then this virus started …”he told the BBC in the spring of 2020.He sent images to his friends, and publicly released one of daffodils, titled: Do Remember They Can’t Cancel the Spring. “Why are my iPad drawings seen as a respite from the news? Well, they are obviously made by the hand depicting the renewal that is the spring in this part of the world.”He added: “We have lost touch with nature rather foolishly as we are a part of it, not outside it. This will in time be over and then what? What have we learned?”Golden gifts, spindly sculptures and an etching innovator – the week in artRead moreHockney joined together all 220 pictures of the changing seasons into one continuous frieze. “The viewer will walk past it like the Bayeux tapestry, and I hope they will experience in one picture the year in Normandy,” he said.Hockney was born in Bradford in 1937, the son of a devout Methodist mother and a socialist activist, first world war conscientious objector father. He decided at the age of 11 he wanted to be an artist, and studied at the Bradford School ofArtand the Royal College of Art in London.View image in fullscreenA Year in Normandie, 2020-2021 (detail).Photograph: David HockneyIn the 1960s he produced some of the works that he is still famous for: swimming pools, palm trees, blue skies and beautiful people in Los Angeles.

But which Christmas banger really grinds her gears?As told toRich PelleySun 31 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTShareThe first song I fell in love withWhen I was seven and I started playing the trumpet, my mum would take me to the library. They just happened to have Afro by Dizzy Gillespie, and I fell in love with Con Alma, which Dizzy plays on the trumpet with so much soul that it feels like a voice. I remember thinking: Wow, this is something else.The song I do at karaokeI can recognise the melodies in most songs because I have the ear of a musician. But I don’t really listen to the words – I feel having the words in front of me would throw me off, so I’ve never done karaoke. If Ihadto, I’d probably do an old classic like Crocodile Rock by Elton John.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toMy whole family has always loved Queen. When Queen played Knebworth in 1986, my granny and grandad lived in the village, so we felt like they’d come to play tous. My mum, dad, aunty and uncle all went. We were left behind, but could hear it across the fields. If we were on a long car journey, I’d insist on having it on five times in a row.The best song to play at a partyI went to see Earth, Wind & Fire as a teenager and was amazed by their horn section – the Phenix Horns. Who would not want to dance to Boogie Wonderland? It’s a classic dancefloor boogie moment.The song I’ve always hatedI don’t know why I hate Merry Xmas Everybody by Slade so much. Maybe it’s because you can’t get away from it. It reminds me of late-night desperate Christmas shopping when everyone’s run out of time.The song that makes me cryIestyn Davies singing Rodelinda by Handel with the English National Opera. Davies has the most beautiful countertenor voice and is one of the greatest opera singers in the world. It’s a ravishing recording and I feel privileged that he’s my friend.The song I’d like played at my funeralI argue with my manager: what is the ultimate, greatest piece of all time? She says Mozart’s Requiem; I say Bach’s St Matthew Passion. They are both masterpieces. So I’ll have both – even if it does make the funeral seven hours long.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Any time things threaten to get serious in this new adaptation by Elizabeth Newman, the band strikes up, the silvery frocks come out and the stage is alive with the charleston and foxtrot.The young dandies and flappers do not know the identity of Jay Gatsby, their wealthy host – in their snobby way, they suspect him of being an arriviste, perhaps a bootlegger, certainly not old money – but they are helpless in the face of so much glamour, celebrity and hedonism. No scene goes by without another sultry jazz standard played by a band disguised in glasses and gaberdines and perched high on Jen McGinley’s art deco set, with its twin staircases and marbled floor.Even the punctilious narrator, Nick Carraway (a commanding David Rankine), is swept up in the interwar fun. With his neat brown suit and polite demeanour, he looks more like a bond trader than the writer he wants to be, but still he cannot resist the allure of Gatsby’s extravagant parties.Oraine Johnson’s Gatsby is no mean hoofer himself. When it comes to the dance routines, the supposedly enigmatic host leads from the front. This adds much to the energy, but it also fuels an interpretation of Gatsby that pulls in two directions.View image in fullscreenIrresistible allure … David Rankine and Oraine Johnson in The Great Gatsby.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanThis Gatsby is never as unknowable as everyone claims. Where he could be inscrutable he is emotionally available, willing to play low status where you expect him to be aloof. His repeated phrase “old sport” comes across as a conversational quirk where it should be a sign of a man mirroring the class he aspires to. It makes it hard to see what his snooty guests know instinctively: that he has attempted to buy his way into their affections – in particular those of Daisy Buchanan (a warm-hearted Fiona Wood) – but he can never be one of them.As Gatsby’s sad story unravels, the tone grows darker and the frivolity abates. But although the production does well to capture the hangover following the jazz age party, it underplays the tragedy of a man whose fatal flaw is to believe in a meritocratic US.AtPitlochry Festival theatreuntil 25 September, then atDerby theatre3-25 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatrePitlochry Festival theatreF Scott FitzgeraldreviewsShareReuse this content"

A new show at the Tate explores the dramatic side of an uncompromising artistJonathan JonesSun 31 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 15.25 EDTShareShe is called the Weeping Woman, but that is an understatement. She grinds her teeth on a handkerchief that’s like a jagged white-and-blue spearhead while her fingers claw at her face, tearing the flesh to expose her skull. Her chin is two grenades, her eyes are filled with horror – black silhouettes of planes are held in her transfixed eyeballs. They are the German bombers that attacked the Basque town Guernica on 26 April 1937.Picasso’s Weeping Woman was bought from him by the British surrealist Roland Penrose in November 1937, fresh off the easel. Fifty years later, his son gave it in lieu of tax to the Tate Gallery. Now it is about to star in aTate Modernexhibition that showcases the museum’s Picasso collection, enhanced with terrific loans from the Musée Picasso in Paris.Weeping Woman is a hair-raising example of Picasso’s feel for drama. Tate Modern’s blockbuster, calledTheatre Picasso, is “staged” rather than curated, by the contemporary film artist Wu Tsang and writer Enrique Fuenteblanca in a series of cabaret and theatre-like spaces they hope will give visitors “a rhythmic experience”. Picasso, says Tsang, anticipated “the fluid relationship that artists have today with performance”.Picasso’s theatre gave him the imaginative power to do what few other artists managed: make art that fought fascismHe certainly loved a good show. Picasso’s passion for drama included a spectacle that ended in real bloodshed – bullfighting. The corridas fuelled some of his greatest art. Guernica evolved from visceral, densely compacted paintings he did in the 1930s of dying matadors, horses gored by bulls and the artist’s alter ego, the man-bull Minotaur.Yet he was equally at home at the ballet, creating sets and costumes for the production Parade in 1917 with Jean Cocteau and Erik Satie, and going on to collaborate with Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. His first marriage in 1918 was to a dancer in the company, Olga Khokhlova – it was disastrous, and the artist’s treatment of women has in recent years been heavily scrutinised.The most gossipy exhibit in Theatre Picasso suggests he was an opera fan, too: in a clip from a movie shot by Man Ray, the stocky painter drags up as the opera heroine Carmen. “It’s a bit of a gem to me to see him with the mantilla and the cigar,” says Tsang.But it was his later fierce rejection of the world of ballet and high-society elegance that produced the greatest Picasso in the Tate collection. The Three Dancers, painted in 1925, is violent, apocalyptic and has never calmed down. It’s a drama we don’t fully understand but whose brutal denouement we watch like a stunned audience.View image in fullscreenPablo Picasso at his home, La California, in Cannes, France, in 1955.Photograph: Express/Getty ImagesIt’s like a stage set, a room with a view, except beyond the windows, which are weirdly opaque, is only a blue Mediterranean sky of hard pigment suggesting unbreathable air. Life is a theatre, this painting suggests, where we move among fake furniture in an illusory set with no freedom or space.The people in The Three Dancers unleash themselves in Dionysian frenzy. The woman in the centre flings her arms in the air as she raises her head to the sky: she is dancing to hot jazz, surely, in 1925, the year The Great Gatsby was published. But this dance is lethal. You can feel it get faster and madder. On the left, a woman gyrates even more ecstatically, twisting over so there seems to be a round hole showing dead sky where her heart should be. Her face has the empty nose socket and eyes of a skull. On the right, a male dancer has a partly brown, partly white body, suggesting the multiculturalism of jazz, more embraced in 1920s France than the segregationist US – Josephine Baker first performed in Paris in October that year.The Three Dancers is one of Picasso’s crucial revolutionary works. He regarded it as better than Guernica and kept it with him until 1965, when he sold it directly to the Tate. With its flattened space and overlapping, hard-to-read images, the piece helped to revive cubism, an artistic experiment that seemed to be have ended by 1914, at the outbreak of the first world war.The movement, undertaken by Picasso and Georges Braque from 1907, had asked fundamental questions: what is the fabric of reality, and can art see it? By 1913, when Picasso collaged and drew Bottle of Vieux Marc, Glass, Guitar and Newspaper, he and Braque used real things in their art, inventing the appropriation of found materials as an artistic technique.Then came the war. Picasso stepped back from this dizzying demolition of art as Europeans then knew it. Some people even blamed the war on the chaos of cubism. By 1918, Picasso participated in the “Call to Order” movement that hoped to restore civilisation with a more traditionalist art. Seated Woman in a Chemise from 1923 is a captivating example of this quieter phase of his work: when Picasso chose to draw or paint “properly”, he could do so better than anyone. As he justifiably claimed, he was born with the talent of Raphael and had to learn to paint like a child.The fuse that set Picasso back on a revolutionary road came in 1924, when a younger group of artists, the surrealists, published their manifesto declaring that all creativity comes from the unconscious and erotic compulsion. The Three Dancers’ jazz age cocktail of cubism and the surrealist cult of desire liberated Picasso to create his most pungent artworks, including The Acrobat, a wondrous painting of an impossible body, and the rampant sculpture Cock (the bird, but it’s truly cocky). The early 1930s was also when he pursued sex as a Sadeian theatre and discovered cubism’s most shocking use – to show all a lover’s orifices at the same time. A dazzling work from this era is his 1936 print Faun Revealing a Sleeping Woman, in which he changes into a mythic creature looking at his lover with unabashed voyeurism.Picasso’s scandalous theatre of sex and death gave him the imaginative power to do what few other artists managed: make art that fought fascism. The year he painted Weeping Woman, there were bombers in his eyes. In his loft in a 17th-century building on Rue des Grands Augustins, Paris, he planned and executed the gut-wrenching Guernica, which he finished by early June and unveiled in July in the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris international exhibition.Picasso is certainly theatrical, but his true genre is tragedy. The Weeping Woman cannot stop herself seeing those murderous planes. The nightmare is turning her skin green, as if she rots. Yet a honeybee sucks from a tear: out of this paralysed rage, some hope might come, if people act. The Weeping Woman is often identified with his lover Dora Maar, but why are her fingers so chunky? They look more like Picasso’s. Just as he could imagine himself as Carmen, Picasso is the woman weeping, merging with Maar in grief for the murdered of Guernica and those yet to die in the age of total war.When I look at Guernica now I see Gaza, I see Ukraine. When I look at Picasso’s satirical strip The Dream and Lie of Franco, I see today’s far-right populists and new-style dictators. Picasso lived in a time of emergency and so, it seems, do we. He was far from a perfect human being in his private life. But he was ultimately a political artist who acted in history. On that stage he was on the side of the angels – and of the Weeping Woman.Scene setters: works from the Tate exhibitionView image in fullscreenPablo Picasso’s Bust of a Woman 1909.Photograph: Rod Tidnam/© Succession Picasso/DACSBust of a Woman, 1909Picasso was making sculpture for the first time, carving raw wooden images that pay homage to African art, when he painted this early cubist “portrait”. This woman has rough-hewn wooden body parts and a featureless face, as the artist takes apart the European belief that pictures must be clear, legible perspective windows on the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But why did he paste in such an old (1883) sheet from Le Figaro? Perhaps it mourns a bohemian cafe lifestyle that was already old.View image in fullscreenPicasso’s The Three Dancers, 1925.Photograph: TateThe Three Dancers, 1925Picasso signed this painting in 1965 when he sold it to the Tate – he’d kept it until then. He also revealed: “While I was painting this picture, an old friend of mine, Ramon Pichot, died and I have always felt that it should be called The Death of Pichot rather than The Three Dancers.” Pichot’s profile is the silhouette on the right of this jazz-age nightmare.View image in fullscreenPablo Picasso’s The Acrobat, 1930.Photograph: RMN-Grand Palais (Musée national Picasso-Paris)/Adrien Didierjean/© Succession Picasso/DACSThe Acrobat, 1930Picasso was fascinated by circus folk. These performers star in his early Rose Period paintings, holding horses, balancing on balls or gathering in a family group with a clown as its patriarch. Here, he purifies what it means to be an acrobat: this character is all arms and legs, with no torso, as it contorts inconceivably. The closed eyes tell us it’s a dream – this is a surrealist vision.View image in fullscreenPablo Picasso’s Nude Woman in a Red Armchair, 1932.Photograph: Tate/© Succession Picasso/DACS London 2025.Nude Woman in a Red Armchair, 1932Cubism was often seen as ugly in its distortions of the human figure, but here Picasso uses it to glorify his lover Marie Thérèse-Walter, composing her face from two different views, full-on and in half-moon profile. He suggests she has got two personalities: one daylit, the other nocturnal, mysterious.View image in fullscreenPablo Picasso’s Cock, 1932, cast 1952.Photograph: Tate/© Succession Picasso/DACSCock, 1932, cast 1952Picasso was a brilliant sculptor in a casually magical way, as this incredibly alive, spiky creation illustrates.

It looks exactly like what you’d expect of a bar in the Financial District. Men in button-up shirts stand around a tall table with folded arms, ranting about the current season as multiple baseball games are playing on TV screens all around the bar.I feel out of place as I wait for a friend, but I know it’s only a matter of time until things change. A stream of women slowly trickles in, group by group. The mood abruptly changes when the TV screens flicker on to a clip of sparkling water. The bar cranks up the volume, a wistful three notes plays over the speaker, the brief theme song of what has become a show so popular that sports bars in Manhattan are throwing watch parties for women who, like me, are years older than the show’s protagonist.I have a confession: when I first watched The Summer I Turned Pretty upon the series’s release onAmazonin 2022, I only got through two episodes. I quickly deemed the show too cringe-inducing to handle. I believed I had grown out oflove trianglesdriven by hormones and a lack of a fully developed prefrontal cortex. Growing up had taught me there were much, much more important choices to make in life than who you take to debutante ball. Also, the lead character’s name is Belly, and no one’s questioning that?Stop bullying The Summer I Turned Pretty cast and start ‘acting normal’, Amazon tells fansRead moreBut when I gave the show another chance this summer, after the encouragement of a friend, I realized just how wrong I was. Once I dropped my defenses and settled into life in Cousins, the fictional beach town where the show is set, I was hooked. And when my social media feeds adjusted to my new obsession, I realized just how many people were as well.Videoaftervideoshowed theheavy investmentadultshavein this teen drama, fromscreamingat TVs tofull-on tearsfrom the show. Primereported25 million worldwide viewers tuned into the third season’s premiere the week of its release, a 40% increase from the second season’s release in 2023.It’s been a strange summer for American pop culture. After Charli xcx’s Brat painted last summer green, there’s been a curious absence of the standard “song of the summer”. The closest contender, some argue, is the “nothing beats a Jet2 holiday” ad that’s been featured in clip after clip online. Themovie theaterswere filled with reboots and sequels forSupermanandJurassic Park. And the most popular TV show in the US appeared to beLove Island, which had near-daily episodes of eye-rolling drama for six weeks until mid-July.Instead of a clubby pop song, this summer’s rhythms have been dictated by constant updates to the rapidly changing world we’re living in. Americans seem to be feelingmore uncertainabout their futures than ever. News notifications can feel like a never-ending barrage for anyone trying to keep up.In other words, the timing was ripe for a show that provides an escape. As temperatures started to peak, the third and final season of The Summer I Turned Pretty premiered in mid-July and has cemented itself, for many, as the show that saved summer.The series centers Isabel “Belly” Conklin (Lola Tung), whose family spends every summer at the Fishers’ giant beach house at Cousins, a town resembling the neighborhoods of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The series starts the summer that Belly turns, you guessed it, pretty and begins to attract the attention of boys, including the two Fisher brothers, Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno).Summer sizzlers! It’s the 20 hottest TV shows of the seasonRead moreIn the backdrop of this coming-of-age summer is the cancer diagnosis of Susannah (Rachel Blanchard), the Fisher matriarch who is the college best friend of Belly’s mom. Susannah’s diagnosis is a secret to most, allowing many of the characters to have their carefree teenage summer. Belly’s biggest concern appears to be whether Conrad, the brooding older brother and her longtime crush, has any feelings for her – or whether she should be with Jeremiah, her “best friend” who is drawn to her.In its third season, the series has wholeheartedly embraced this Austenian love triangle, framing it against complex emotions around grief. Susannah’s death less than a year after that first summer has only heightened Belly’s emotional hold over both brothers. Their late mother, on her deathbed, called Belly “my special girl” and often referred to her as the daughter she never had.But by the start of the season, Belly, who was 15 in the show’s first season, is now about to turn 21 and has made her choice. After an intense but failed relationship with Conrad, Belly has chosen Jeremiah. The two have been together in college for three years while Conrad was on the west coast. But while the three characters pretend things are good and settled, they are clearly far from it.As a grown adult, I’m fully aware of how absurd this plot is. A love triangle with two brothers is only a huge red flag right next to an arrow pointed toward a therapist’s office. But at some point, I accepted The Summer I Turned Pretty as a fantasy world that is a pastel-tinged version of our own and learned to bask in its endless, wonderful melodrama.View image in fullscreenGavin Casalegno and Lola Tung.Photograph: Erika Doss/PrimeThe Summer I Turned Pretty is the second success for author Jenny Han, co-runner of the series and author of thetrilogythat inspired the show. Her other booktrilogy, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before wasadaptedfor Netflix and became one of its most-watched original movies when it was released in 2018.The series feels like a surprise hit for Amazon, which has found more success with shows targeted to male audiences such asThe Boys,Jack RyanandReacher. Netflix has been the traditional home for originals geared toward young women and teens likeNever Have I Ever,HeartstopperandXO, Kitty, the spin-off show from To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.Han seems to have mastered teen romance, making it all feel refreshingly tender and sweet, taking seriously what is often dismissed as frivolous. Her stories ask readers and viewers to step into worlds where the choices these teenage girls make feel undeniably consequential.It’s a kind of unapologetic sincerity that evokes the teen dramas of the early 2000s. In The Summer I Turned Pretty, declarations of love are delivered with full gusto, the sound of waves crashing in the background. And the show never fails to lean on its seemingly unlimited soundtrack budget. So far, the series has played no less than20 Taylor Swift songsthat punctuate its emotional high points. Many have pointed out that the show shares a filming location – Wilmington, North Carolina – withOne Tree Hill, which premiered over two decades ago.And unlike the first and second seasons, which were released in batches, the 12 episodes of this final season are released every Wednesday. To those of us who grew up with cable, it’s reminiscent of the feeling of rushing home to catch the newest episode of a TV show. The wait encourages anticipation, what feels rare in an era of endless, bingeable content online. It’s also proof that old-fashioned scripted TV shows, under a traditional weekly release schedule, can still have pull over younger audiences who areincreasingly drawnto platforms including YouTube.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueAs much as the show brings me back to the days ofGilmore GirlsandThe OC, its huge online presence makes it feel distinctly modern. The endless stream of content has culminated into a sort of communal viewing experience. With clips on TikTok, fans can relive the show’s moments over and over again with plenty of commentary and mockery.Of course, the show indulges in the drama surrounding its love triangle. As with any teen love triangle, people have divided themselves into “teams”. Who you root for suddenly becomes a barometer of your core values. The passion over the characters have become so intense that Prime Video and members of the show have had toremind viewersto conduct themselves respectfully online. Han, in an Instagram story, told fans that “the cast shouldn’t have to endure harassment because of the roles they play”. Amazon reminded fans that “the show isn’t real but the people playing the characters are”.Some elements in the third season seem so excessive and ridiculous as to be made for virality. (Some spoilers ahead.) In a scene in the season’s sixth episode, Conrad and Belly make a pit – stop at a roadside peach stand. As Belly eats a peach, a heavy stream of juice runs down her mouth. Conrad untucks his plain white T-shirt – clearly a part of hiscoastal-dad drip– to gingerly wipe the juice from her mouth.Videoson TikTok quickly turned the scene into aninside jokeamong fans. Even Nobel prize laureate and assassination-attempt survivor Malala Yousafzaiposteda picture of herself on Instagram holding up a peach, with the caption “counting the minutes until Wednesday”.For me, the absurdity of it all is a reminder that the show is very much fiction, a world to step into like a book splayed open on a poolside lounge chair. I can’t help but root for Belly. We all know what it’s like to be young, naive and feel like the weight of the world rests on each choice we have to make for ourselves. Tuning in every week feels like a quick escape back to that time – far away from the usual cadences of life, as evocative as summer itself.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionTelevisionAmazon Prime VideoDramaRomance booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If I look that good when I’m dead I’ll be absolutely thrilled,” says Pat, who is one to watch. The rules are a tad confusing, as is the opening task, but it’s the bitching and backstabbing that keep it juicy. And at the Division Ceremony, where players must vote for who gets the first chunk of cash, one of them causes so much beef that Rinder shouts: “Decorum please!

This Elizabeth Hurley-starring series is a confusing, overcomplicated muddle that it’s hard to care aboutJack SealeSun 31 Aug 2025 17.05 EDTShareAsprawling mansion, full of look-at-me reality contestants trying to win money by playing a parlour game based on manipulation and persuasion? It’s either a new season ofThe Traitors, or a clone trying to steal some of The Traitors’ addictive, gossip-worthy magic. Welcome to The Inheritance, a clone that has clearly been carefully worked on, but which has still come out a bit wonky.Thirteen players – spanning the usual reality-TV spectrum of age and class, from a student/influencer and a debt-ridden scaffolder to a flawlessly styled socialite and a wily pensioner – convene at a country pile, the rich owner of which has supposedly died. The contestants are the would-be beneficiaries of the estate and are given a new group task each week. But, instead of this cash being added to a shared fund, the group must nominate one player to receive all of it.It’s fiendishly simple! Except that, no it isn’t because there are many, many conditions to apply. Players who think they deserve the money put themselves forward as a “claimant”, ie a candidate standing for election. The claimants are not in the room when the rest of the group – the “jury” – decide who wins. Then the winner can either keep all the money, or choose to gift some back to members of the group, divided in whichever way they wish – with the proviso that they cannot give money to other claimants. Being a claimant, therefore, means running the risk of ending the round with nothing. Which would be bad, because at some point, the player with the least money will be eliminated. Oh, and the weekly winner divvies up the money (or keeps it all) in secret, so they can lie about how much they bestowed on others. Although, when the poorest player is booted out, presumably this will enable players to deduce who lied about sharing their cash. If this sounds confusing, rest assured that when you watch The Inheritance for yourself, it is confusing.A flawed format is not a dealbreaker in this genre: after all, the aim of the game in The Traitors is meant to be voting out all the traitors, which can’t be allowed to happen because it would end the show, so swathes of that show’s early action have to be a sham. But The Inheritance is an overcomplicated hotch-potch, the obvious issue being that there are only likely to be one or two plausible candidates for the winner of each task, which leaves everyone else scrabbling for a purpose since there’s no weekly elimination.The players deal with this by reverting to their base reality-telly instincts. They build alliances, form cliques, then berate other people for forming cliques and building alliances and cry about being excluded. The main motivation for making friends is meant to be to ensure that if you don’t win a task, the person who does may decide to share some money with you. But, since you don’t know if they’ve actually done that, it’s all a bit hypothetical – and it’s hard to care who’s side anyone is on.In any case, the main showdown in each episode is about who should win the task, and that’s just a debate about observable reality: people make claims about their contribution, which others can dispute because they were there. There’s no equivalent to thosedelicious moments in The Traitorswhere players face instant death if they can’t deflect baseless conspiracy theories hurled at them by the mob. Nobody can brazenly bluff it.Players arguing about the tasks brings up another problem: we have to care about the tasks. You may even feel obliged to actually watch them, instead of skipping to the bit where everyone has a massive barney. But they’re pure reality slop, the tedious spectacle of fools failing at contrived projects – bottling wine in the opening instalment, herding farm animals in episode two – constantly interrupted by clips from contestants’ post-task interviews, where they chirpily tell us things we’ve just observed perfectly well ourselves.Overseeing all this are our hosts (plural, because it takes more than one person to try to replace the godlike Traitors presenterClaudia Winkleman). Officiating from moment to moment isRob Rinder, who doesn’t have much to do beyond reading the rules off a sheet. He appears to be aiming for an air of sophisticated indifference, but just looks bored to death. The big hire isElizabeth Hurleyas the deceased stately homeowner, but even her camp video messages (“Hello, darlings! I’M DEAD!”) soon lose their lustre and become superfluous. The Inheritance could turn out to be playing a cunning long game, but there are enough reasons here to vote it off in week one.The Inheritance is on Channel 4 nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionElizabeth HurleyReality TVGame showsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a moving, uplifting look at how children can shine with support. What a tonic for all the bad news stories about education in BritainPhil HarrisonSun 31 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 31 Aug 2025 16.02 EDTShareThe trailer for the new series of Educating Yorkshire is a work of art. Shot in one take and clocking in at more than three minutes, it was written and performed by the children of Thornhill community academy in Dewsbury – in collaboration with Dougal Wilson, the director of Paddington in Peru – and takes in a school band, percussionist dinner ladies and a child seemingly being fired out of a cannon from the roof. It’s sweet and funny, but it’s pointed, too, in style and content.This hasn’t been a great year for the public profile of British secondary schools. The national orgy of hand-wringing prompted byNetflix’s superb Adolescencehas led to something approaching despair at the state of education, entrenching the perception that overstretched and under-resourced teachers act as little more than crowd control, leaving children neurotic and dysfunctional, making them sitting ducks for malignant influencers such as Andrew Tate.This revival then, is perfectly timed. In the trailer, the one-take style showcases humour, variety and invention. The show itself suggests that while many things have changed since we last spent time at this school, in 2014, plenty more has stayed the same. Mr Burton – last seen movingly coaxing fluent speech out ofa stammering pupil, Musharaf– is now Thornhill’s headteacher. Britain has had six prime ministers since 2014. Sometimes a slow but steady uphill trajectory is the most worthwhile path for a public servant to take.So who are our new Musharafs? The very clever and very disruptive Riley is certainly an early candidate. Might he have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? Or dyslexia? Or is his clowning, as Mrs Delaney-Hudson puts it euphemistically, “a behaviour choice”? He faces significant sanctions if his erratic modus operandi can’t be clinically explained. A neurodiversity screening doesn’t help. His mum is nonplussed. Maybe a food diary will offer some answers? The gentleness with which Riley is guided towards better habits is striking. As Mrs D-H puts it: “He absolutely thrives off the positivity.” Who doesn’t?View image in fullscreenSame school, different headteacher … Mr Burton.Photograph: Tom Martin/Channel 4Then there is Amy. “I’m just a mixture of random stuff, put together incorrectly,” she says. She is underselling herself considerably, of course. Amy is a thoroughly eccentric and entirely charming kid, grappling with Tourette syndrome and the absurd (but, at 12, deadly serious) micropolitics of schoolyard friendships.In a pastoral care session, she struggles to find a single good thing to say about herself. It can be stated with confidence that viewers will feel very differently. Amy is obsessed with the school’s hash browns and says quirky, funny things (“Why are your tights so holey? They’re like the Bible”). She is a star; as you watch, you can feel the country’s collective heart begin to melt.Amy’s trajectory illustrates the genius at the heart of this series. What an incredibly careful and delicately performed editing job is routinely done here: to make these children hilarious, but never the butt of the joke; to show their vulnerability, but also their strength; to render their triumphs and tragedies serious, but never overwhelming. It shows us the nuance and the nuts and bolts of their developing personalities, their muddled impulses and motivations, the gently irresistible force of their forming identities.View image in fullscreen‘Thoroughly eccentric and entirely charming’ … Amy.Photograph: Tom Martin/Channel 4The care of the film-makers echoes that of the teaching staff. When Amy has a mild falling out with her friend Millie, the student manager for year 8, Mr Wilson – who isn’t a teacher and is more like a benign big brother – simply brings them together in his office, puts his headphones on and lets them get on with setting their incredibly minor difference. “I don’t think I opened up to people when I was at school,” he reflects later. “But then I don’t know if there was anyone I could have opened up to.” This will chime with many viewers of a certain age who may wish things had been different in their day.There is something gently polemical going on here. Sadly, there will be people who observe this school, with its wellness hub and its positive reinforcement and its atmosphere of listening, rather than shouting, and decry it as “woke”. What happened to the stiff upper lip? To discipline? To “spare the rod and spoil the child”? Educating Yorkshire reinforces something quite different. Things have changed. These children are given tailored, individual pastoral care. They will be better adults for it.For viewers in search of confirmation for their biases, clouds will certainly gather in later episodes. Smartphones will be discussed; social media, too. But initially, at least, solutions are hard-earned, but relatively simple. Is Educating Yorkshire rose-tinted? Probably. Is it filmed and edited to show everyone involved in as positive a light as possible? Almost certainly. Does it feel like a necessary blast of optimism? You bet it does.Educating Yorkshire is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Some roles she chose and wrote herself; others were forced upon her, like an ugly hat or an ill-fitting suit. She was the convent girl and the teenage bride, the 60s It girl and the rock star’s girlfriend. She was the pop singer, the folk singer, the tragic addict and the indomitable survivor. Broken English, a flawed but ardent new documentary from Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, effectively arranges all of these incarnations like museum exhibits and invites its subject to review each one in turn – and then smash the glass to set them free.Faithfull broke the mould, and so it is fitting that the film of her life should do the same, except that Forsyth and Pollard’s main conceit feels jerry-rigged and overdramatised to the point where it risks obscuring our view of the woman herself. We’re ostensibly inside “the Ministry of Not Forgetting”, an institution dedicated to examining truths and myths and the porous line between the two. It’s a defiantly analogue place, stuffed with tape decks and rotary phones, and presided over byTilda Swintonin the role of a sharp-suited bureaucrat. Faithfull is the project and Swinton its exacting overseer. “We need to take a proper look at Marianne’s role as a destabilising influence,” she says by way of moving the action forward.Given her formidable reputation, one might imagine that Faithfull would have balked when confronted with this kind of art school posturing, but she seems game enough and graciously consents to be interviewed – very gently, it must be said – by the ministry’s record keeper, who is played by George MacKay. She’s relaxed and charismatic, happy to wander back across her past lives. But her health has been ravaged by emphysema and Covid and she’s vague on some details and unwilling to revisit some others, and has to occasionally pause to insert an oxygen tube. In this way, Broken English catches the legend’s last glow, just before the light went out for good.View image in fullscreenThe porous line between truth and myth … Tilda Swinton in Broken English.Photograph: Amelia TroubridgeThe ministry’s project purports to be a dispassionate investigation. In reality, it’s an appreciation, a reclamation, a film that lovingly toasts Faithfull’s fabulous, confounding career. She was the major’s daughter with the cut-glass accent who sang As Tears Go By and wrote the extraordinary Sister Morphine. But she was framed by the press as Mick Jagger’s muse, a good girl gone bad, and suffered through a decade of addiction before her galvanic reinvention. In the late 1970s she engineered a fresh role as a new wave powerhouse, the creator of the tour de force album from which this film takes its name.Marianne Faithfull was a towering artist, not just the muse she was painted as | Alexis PetridisRead moreFaithfull was inconsistent and capricious, a self-confessed romantic, drawn to beauty and death. But she was also the casualty of a misogynistic culture that refused to acknowledge her as an artist and could barely contain its delight when she stumbled. The film-makers stumble a little themselves at this point by having Zawe Ashton and Sophia Di Martino crop up as an adoring Greek chorus, energetically fulminating on their idol’s behalf. But there’s no ignoring the impact of the archive montage in which a succession of sexist broadcasters excitably grill Faithfull about her celebrity lovers and debilitating drug use. “I was a kid,” she tells one as a way of explaining her missteps. “I didn’t grow up.” And while her later incarnation as the art scene’s weathered Mother Courage arguably risked replacing one cliche with another, here at last was one that she had scripted herself and could wholly lean into.Forsyth and Pollard were responsible for the fine Nick Cave documentary20,000 Days on Earthback in 2014. Cave makes a late appearance here as well, rolling into the ministry to assist on what would prove to be Faithfull’s final performance, filmed shortly before herdeath in January of this year. After all the fussy bells and whistles – the elaborate setup, the constraining conceit – it’s only right and proper that Faithfull should be allowed the last word. Appropriate, too, that she should go out with a song.Broken English screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalMarianne FaithfullDocumentary filmsMusic documentaryTilda SwintonCelebrityreviewsShareReuse this content"

Even safer to say that had mother, wife and upper-class lover had such a meeting, they would not have spent the time filling each other in on their relationship with the great poet.No matter. The contrivance of John Binnie’s play, set on 25 January with an eye to performances on Burns Nights to come, paves the way for what really makes this show tick: an attractive compilation of favourite songs, sweetly sung by Alyson Orr (Agnes), Stephanie Cremona (Jean) and Eden Barrie (Clarinda), following the pretty harmonies of Orr’s arrangements and the simple acoustic guitar accompaniment of Chris Coxon.Seen at a preview performance, A Toast Fae the Lassies quickly makes you forget the staginess of the setup. The artifice seems more than justified by such tender renditions of Ae Fond Kiss, Charlie Is My Darling and A Red, Red Rose, as well as other songs and poems, especially when the actors step out of character to take on other scenes from the poet’s life.Harder to overlook is the graveyard set by Natalie Fern, which, with its raised platforms and scattered headstones, becomes an obstacle course for the actors, moving about the limited studio space in their period dress. It is needlessly cluttered.But what emerges forcibly, as the women trade notes, is a picture of a man who today would be called a sex addict. By the time he married Jean Armour, Burns had fathered several children by her – and by others, too – and however cerebral his meeting of minds with Clarinda, it did not stop him impregnating her maid.Here, the women are torn between being seduced and being outraged. On the one hand, the captivating hold of his language; on the other, poems they see as thinly disguised excuses for his philandering. In this way, Binnie, who also directs, paints a portrait of a contradictory man, one capable of indifference and tenderness, crude animal instinct and timeless beauty. It adds grit to a crowd-pleasing show.AtPitlochry Festival theatreuntil 24 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatrePitlochry Festival theatreRobert BurnsPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Slovenian capital Ljubljana may be less than an hour away, but here in the Jezersko valley, just 3 miles from the Austrian border, it feels like another world.Bordered on the east by the Kamnik-Savinja Alps, and on the west by the peaks of the Karavanke mountain range, and with a tranquil green lake at the bottom of the valley, there’s a tangible sense of apartness – an idyllic escape from the world.View image in fullscreenBefore being confiscated by the communists in 1947, the farm had been in the same family for more than 500 years. It was returned in 2005 and passed down to current owner, Polona, by her grandmother. Today, three generations of her family live here and it’s very much a working farm as well as a place to stay. There’s camping in the meadow under the ash trees in summer (bring your own tent), parking for caravans and a choice of simple rooms and self-catering apartments in the farm buildings. Mine, up in the attic of the ancient farmhouse, has been restored using reclaimed wood. Resident goats, two big dogs, cats and chickens wander free-range, and Jezersko–Solčava sheep graze in the fields – though in summer they are taken up to the alpine pastures.It’s all very eco. Water comes from a glacier, heating is generated by wood chips from trees felled in the local forest, and all food is organic and grown on site (three polytunnels mean vegetables are harvested year-round). With the addition of new solar panels, the farm hopes to be fully self-sustaining next year.View image in fullscreenMountain stream-fed Lake Planšar is perfect for a bracing dip.Photograph: 24K-Production/AlamyVolunteers return time and again to help out in exchange for food and accommodation. Peggy and Pat Rebol, who’ve come from the US for the third time, tell me: “This place is magic, it’s not only the lake and the valley, it’s the people – this family captured our hearts and all we want to do is keep coming back.”I’ve come here to hike, so after a breakfast of meats and cheeses, homemade yoghurt and freshly collected eggs, I set out with Drejc Karničar, Polona’s husband (who also happens to be mayor of Jezersko’s 700 inhabitants). As we walk through forest towards the mountains, Drejc points out a rare “golden shoes” orchid at the edge of the wood. I’m not much of a botanist but this delightful plant lives up to its name – each yellow flower looks exactly like a Cinderella shoe. “They only bloom for 14 days,” says Drejc, “you’re lucky.”The hike up has wire cables screwed into the sheer mountain sides, wooden bridges and at one point a ladder across the rockWe make our way up toČeška koča(the Czech hut), a mountain lodge that was named Slovenia’s “hut of the year” in 2024. You can stay overnight or just grab a hearty lunch on the way up the mountain (the hut is open June to September; book by phone on +386 4028 3300). These high alpine slopes are where Drejc drives his sheep to graze for the summer. They used to go to a different pasture, he tells me, but that was on the bears’ commuting path and “those bears had a party”.The hike up feels like an Indiana Jones obstacle course, with wire cables screwed into the sheer mountain sides, wooden bridges and at one point a ladder across the rock.Drejc comes up to check on the sheep once a week in summer andbrings them salt, essential to their diet.View image in fullscreenA room at Senkova DomačijaMountain highs: biking and bivvying in SloveniaRead moreThe next day, I set my sights on summiting Velika Baba, known locally as Mount Baba, about 15 minutes’ drive from the farm. This is a far more demanding climb, so I’m accompanied by expert mountain guideTomo Česen. As we walk through the forest and climb towards the summit vibrant blue alpine flowers are strewn across the rocks, and purple heather borders the trail. There are no cables and the exposed ridge is slightly terrifying. I’m roped to Tomo for safety and scramble along, trying not to look down. Just as I reach the top, the clouds part cinematically, the sky clears, the snowy mountain peaks gleam white against the blue and I catch my breath – literally and figuratively.Tomo tells me this ridge marks the border between Austria and Slovenia, and on the way back we pass one of the original border stones, engraved with “SR” for Slovenian Republic. I pause for a moment, with one foot in Austria and the other in Slovenia, thinking I need to brush up on my history.Supper back at the farm is cooked by Polona (available Tuesday to Saturday, book in advance) and served outside, weather-permitting, accompanied by a panoramic view of the mountains. I tuck into Slovenian beef noodle soup, “Easter bread” (simple and rustic) with home-made salami, and lamb and potatoes with salad from the greenhouses.View image in fullscreenThe area is characterised by meadows, mountains and ornate churches.Photograph: Aliaksandr Mazurkevich/AlamyThe next day I cycle from the farm down to the village through an avenue of ash trees and across a flower meadow, known locally as “frog square”, to meetTanja Rebolj, a self-taughtčarovnica(herbalist), who makes a variety of teas, jams and herb-infused liquors that she sells from her home. She tells me there are more than 1,200 species of plant in the valley, one of the richest places to forage in Slovenia – and she sometimes runs workshops on herbs for visitors.Alongside its abundance of flowers and herbs, Jezersko is also one of the most densely forested valleys in the country, andAndreja Koširis my guide to the woods. A former UN translator, she now leads various forest experiences (family audio walk, €210). Hooked up with super-sensitive microphones and recording equipment, we stroll among the trees pausing to listen and record the “hidden sounds of nature”. An ants’ nest sounds just as frenetic as you might imagine. And when Andreja inserts specialist needle microphones into the earth, I hear water moving deep underground. “What fascinates me about nature,” she says, “is that trees can communicate so well. Beech trees are especially talkative – they exchange lots of information.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Swinging in a hammock, I glimpse the sky through the canopy, bird song rings out around me. A simple pleasure, but I leave with a profound feeling of wellbeing.I take one last look up at Mount Baba before turning for home, feeling clearer and lighterCenturies ago, Jezersko was covered with a massive glacial lake, but an earthquake caused it to drain away in the 14th century. Today, the emerald green, heart-shaped, artificial Lake Planšar, proves irresistible as I cycle past. I gasp as I jump in – it’s bone-jarringly cold and I emerge flushed pink and energised, then ride home through sunlit meadows.On my last day, as the bells of St Andrej’s church ring out the hour, volunteers are busy in the farm’s Peter Rabbit gardens, chickens scratch at the grass and the sun slants through the apple trees. I take one last look up at Mount Baba before turning for home, feeling clearer and lighter. Mountains, forests and fairytale flowers, long hikes, cold swims and nurturing organic food … sometimes it’s the simple things that make for a magical holiday.The trip was supported by the Slovenian Tourist Board andŠenkova Domačijafarm.

Food styling: Loïc Parisot.Felicity Cloake's masterclassCakeHow to make black forest gateau – recipeThe classic Bavarian dessert is made up of layers of booze-soaked chocolate cake, cream and cherries, and is a winning closing act to any mealFelicity CloakeSun 31 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareIthink a long enough time has passed since the heyday ofSara Leeto concede the magnificence of the OG BFG: that towering torte of cherry brandy-soaked chocolate sponge, cherries and whipped cream whose name nods to the German Schwarzwälder’s many cherry trees and the black, white and red of its traditional dress. It’s also a very simple bake, because the show-stopping bit is all in the assembly.Prep1 hrCook1 hr 5 minServes8-10For the pastry layer (optional)60g plain flour5g cocoa powder25g caster sugar40g softened butterSaltFor the sponge6 large eggs140g soft light brown sugar60g cocoa powderSaltFor the filling750g fresh or frozen cherries, or 700g morello cherries in syrup (see step 1)60g caster sugar(only if using fresh or frozen cherries)1½ tbsp kirsch, or unsweetened cherry brandy (cherry liqueur will work, but is much sweeter)500ml double or whipping cream½ tsp vanilla extract50g icing sugar300g cherry jam1 square dark chocolate, shaved into curls1 A note on the cherriesTraditionally, this cake is made with sour cherries, which aren’t readily available in the UK. You can sometimes find them frozen, or use morello cherries in syrup/juice, instead, but there are still summer cherries in the shops, so I’ve devised this recipe to use the fresh sweet variety (skip step 2 if you’re using jarred or tinned fruit).2 Prepare the cherriesStone all but 10 of your fresh or frozen cherries, if need be, and set aside the unstoned fruit for now. The only easy way to do this is with a cherry pitter; they’re not expensive and some can also be used for olives.View image in fullscreenPut the stoned cherries in a saucepan with the caster sugar, set it over a medium heat and cook, stirring gently, until the cherries soften but are still holding their shape.3 Pasty or no pastry?Traditionally, the base of this cake is made from shortcrust pastry, rather than sponge, for the simple reason that it holds up better to being drenched in cherry juice and brandy than cake does. You can skip this and the next two steps for a simpler three-tier sponge cake that will require less cream and fewer cherries.4 Make the pastry doughView image in fullscreenLine the base of a 20cm, loose-bottomed tin with a circle of greaseproof paper that’s cut neatly to fit. Sift the flour and cocoa powder for the pastry layer, if making, into a large bowl, add the sugar and a pinch of salt, and whisk to combine. Squidge in the butter to make a soft dough.5 Bake the pastry layerUse your fingers to press the dough into the base of the lined tin, so it covers it in a thin, fairly even layer. Cover and chill for 20 minutes while you heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then bake for 15 minutes, until crisp. Take the tin out of the oven, carefully lift out the pastry and leave to cool.6 Start the cake batterLine the same tin with more greaseproof paper and turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.View image in fullscreenSeparate the eggs into two large bowls and whisk the yolks with the sugar until the latter dissolves and the mixture begins to thicken.View image in fullscreenSieve in the cocoa powder and a pinch of salt, and stir gently to combine.7 Finish the batter and bakeView image in fullscreenBeat the egg whites until stiff, then stir a spoonful of them into the egg yolk mixture, just to loosen. Gently fold in the rest of the egg whites, then carefully spoon the mixture into the lined tin. Smooth out the top and bake for 35-40 minutes, until the cake is puffed up and set on top. Leave to cool completely in the tin (and be warned that it will sink slightly).8 Flavour the cakeDrain the cooked cherries and mix 50ml of their syrup with the kirsch. Use a bread knife to cut the cooled cake into three layers.View image in fullscreenSpoon some cherry syrup over the top of each one, being careful not to overload them. Whip the cream until it starts to thicken, then add the vanilla, sift in the icing sugar and whisk again until voluminous, but not stiff.9 Finishing touchesSpread a third of the jam on to the cooled pastry, then top that with a quarter of the cream and a third of the cooked cherries. Lay one of the three sponge cakes on top and repeat the jam, cream and cherry layers.View image in fullscreenRepeat again with a second sponge cake and more jam, cream and cherries.View image in fullscreenTop with the final sponge, spread with a voluptuous layer of cream and decorate with shaved chocolate and the reserved fresh cherries.Explore more on these topicsCakeFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodGerman food and drinkDessertBakingFruitChocolatefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eat at Inis, then walk back via the artisan fromagerie and the padel court.The Wick was not always thus, especially for diners. Those who knew the place in the noughties, before its decimation and reconstruction forthe 2012 London Olympics, may well lament those bygone days. At one point circa 2005,Forman’s fish restaurant, which boasted a “view of the canal”, was one of the – cough – sole options round these parts. Back then, the canal, where these days young things frolic, was a swamp of shopping trolleys and sad-looking swans, and your salmon en croute might be accompanied by the spectacle of dehydrated ravers trying to find home two days after Friday’s squat party. Gentrification has come at a price, though, with stratospheric rents, in particular, but there are now also street art tours, sourdough pizzas and a great many places where you can buy terrible pre-mixed cocktails.View image in fullscreen‘Absolutely homemade’: Inis’ potato scallops with chip shop-style curry sauce.None of that is anything quite like Inis, which is open for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, and owned and run byLynsey Coughlan, formerly ofthe Ginger Pigbutcher, and ex-art director Lindsay Lewis, alongside head chef Craig Johnson. Inis, from the offset, seemed determined to treat its clientele as grownups and its postcode as a proper community in need of a nice, neighbourhood restaurant. The place clearly wanted to be somewhere to come and come again, and to take your parents to whenever they were in town. There’s alfresco dining, though that’s possibly advisable only if you’re keen on Lime bikes, joggers and enjoying the cleaner, fresher canal. Oh, and importantly, especially if, like me, you only really like five people and two of those are Irish wolfhounds, it’s dog-friendly, too.View image in fullscreenInis’ Cornish turbot comes ‘festooned with sea vegetables’.Inis is Irish in spirit, but it isn’t Irish-themed. Yes, you can expect Guinness on draft, of course, and Irish breads all rich with treacle and rye, oysters from the west coast of Ireland, Sunday roasts and mince on toast. Irish people who miss their mother’s cooking might go for the house-glazed ham with coleslaw, the Ogleshield cheese pastries or thechicken fillet rollsinspired by days frittered away on Pearse Street in Dublin. At night, however, the dinner menu reaches for deliciously lofty moments when rare duck and cucumber meet tahini and sweet, punchy hoisin, when a tranche of Cornish turbot comes festooned with sea vegetables, when elegant house martinis match with delicate watermelon salads, and when hunks of rare onglet come piled with excellent, al dente bobby beans and assertive homemade horseradish.The style is fresh, hyper-seasonal and absolutely homemade. It’s this that draws me back here time and again, the from-scratch element of the cakes and breads, in particular, because that’s as rare as hen’s teeth in British casual dining. On my first visit to Inis in its opening weeks, I popped by for a mid-morning coffee and maybe some soda bread with raspberry jam, and perhaps even a bowl of hot smoked trout on new potatoes, but I was immediately seduced by a fearsome and glistening lump of fine-looking Guinness cake that seemed to wink at me from under its glass cloche. “Is it freshly made?” I asked Coughlan. She assured me that chef had only recently tipped this majestic beauty out of its tin, and that it would be on that evening’s dinner menu and served with custard. At that exact point, my love affair with Inis was born.View image in fullscreenInis’ Guinness cake: ‘As good as it gets.’Since then, the place has gone from strength to strength, serving fantastic fresh potato farls at breakfast with pots of strong tea, and good, wobbly french toast, but in some ways Inis is just as cheffy as fellow local canal-side dining spotCafe Cecilia, where it’s pretty much impossible to get a table these days. It is a little patch of sanity in a postcode that, despite the constant hammering and cement-flinging, will never truly feel finished or functional. The welcome is always warm and the food reliably wonderful. Yes, it might take you three or four tries to find it, and your GPS might ask you to wade through the canal and walk through Westfield Stratford to get there. And, yes, it will be at least half-filled by Hackney Wick people with perplexing hairstyles and sore-looking piercings. But, as far as gentrification goes, this slice of it comes laced with Guinness and has a thick layer of cream cheese icing. And that’s really as good as it gets.Inis13 Rookwood Way, Fish Island, London E3, 07850 400920. Open Weds 8am-3pm, Thurs & Fri 8am-11pm, Sat 8-11.30am & 1-11pm, Sun 8-11.30am & 1-6pm.
