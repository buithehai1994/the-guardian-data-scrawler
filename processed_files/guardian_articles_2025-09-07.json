His unearthing of energy, humour and a desire to achieve deserves our supportJack SealeSun 7 Sep 2025 16.10 EDTLast modified on Sun 7 Sep 2025 16.12 EDTShare‘Talk about grassroots cricket,” says Freddie Flintoff, leaning on a rickety railing outside a dilapidated Liverpool sports club. “This is in t’soil, this.” After three years on air, Field of Dreams, the documentary where the former England captain trains teenagers from deprived areas to play a sport they have no previous interest in, has reset to zero. His original group of lads from Preston, Lancashire, have become a team (season one) that has toured India (season two). They returned as young men who love cricket but no longer need their friend Fred’s help.For the series to continue, the format needs to start again. And it is now a format: all the emotions and challenges are familiar as Flintoff arrives in Bootle, Liverpool, another neglected area of deindustrialised north-west England. A representative of the local cricket club, once a thriving community hub that is now regularly vandalised, takes Flintoff on a tour of the neighbourhood’s derelict and boarded-up buildings, explaining that kids there commit petty crime and join gangs for a lack of anything else to do. When Flintoff visits a class of 16-year-old boys at a PRU – a pupil referral unit, ie a school for children who are unable or no longer welcome to attend mainstream schools – they have never heard of him and think cricket is a way for posh eccentrics to waste time.But even as they snigger at the idea of cricket and report that the dominant after-school activity in Bootle is smoking weed, we can see some of the sparkling potential that took a while to identify in Preston. At a park knockabout session overseen by Kyle, the gentle assistant coach who fills in when Freddie is off on celebrity business, the first wave of volunteers enjoy giving cricket a go, and key personalities emerge in the form of natural leader Ryan and charismatic trouble-maker Stevie. When the lads’ behavioural issues cause strife at a subsequent training session and Flintoff makes his comment about this being something beyond grassroots sport, we suspect it will all come good in the end.View image in fullscreenAssistant coach Kyle Hogg with Flintoff.Photograph: BBC/South ShoreA cynical viewer might check out here, feeling vindicated in their suspicion that Field of Dreams is a comforting fantasy: its miracle transformations only happen to young people who have won the lottery and been visited by a superstar with TV cash behind him. That’s one way to look at it. Another is that the show is a beacon of hope. It may put these kids into unusual circumstances, but the qualities it brings out of them – the energy, the humour, the desire to achieve – are not unusual at all. They are in every young person, not far below the surface. Organised sport brings them out, and Field of Dreams does not have to do much to demonstrate that. Flintoff’s fame is a shortcut to success, but the time and money the show invests are not massive. The experiment could be replicated.To underline the point, this year Flintoff runs several teams at once. Soon he is at South ShoreCricketand Squash Club in Blackpool, which is like every other venue in Field of Dreams: a sad relic that would easily be revived by a minor adjustment in national budgeting priorities. In the bar, a lonely room still warmed by good times of the past, one of the senior members looks as though he is holding back tears as he concedes that the club currently has no youth team, which means it is doomed.Flintoff and co set up a girls’ squad, which means a change to the show’s regular rhythms. Getting the new recruits to concentrate on the game and not muck about is not a problem, but communicating with them is. “With the lads you just chat, you’ve got an idea of what they’re going to say,” says our hero, flummoxed and a little scared by all the probing questions, unpredictable emotions and sudden outbreaks of dancing. “With the girls, no.” When 16-year-old Madison fixes Flintoff with her gaze and asks how he recovered mentally from the serious car crash he was involved in three years ago, and the permanent change to his physical appearance it caused, we see him surprise himself with a revealing, vulnerable answer about dealing with depression and struggling to achieve self-acceptance, and how those problems were already there before the accident.That Flintoff is not your average alpha male sports legend is one more reason why we can tolerate him going through the reality-TV motions of questioning whether the girls’ team will flourish, when we are sure it will. His uniquely nuanced charm, and the important core message Field of Dreams plaintively sends out, still deserve our wholehearted support.Freddie Flintoff’s Field of Dreams: Ultimate Test aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAndrew FlintoffCricketreviewsShareReuse this content",

Last month’s remake of The Naked Gun employed a campaign that directly addressed this problem,with an ad that played like a PSAabout such a lack and why supporting one was of societal importance (the plea only mildly worked, with the film finishing with decent, but not quite decent enough, box office). At the Toronto premiere of Aziz Ansari’s Good Fortune, festival chief Cameron Bailey made reference to the now unusual sensation of laughing with an audience, and the actor-writer-director himself has beenimpressingupon people his desire to make a theatrical comedy in the billion-dollar wake of Barbie. He believes in its importance so why doesn’t the industry?Winter of the Crow review – Lesley Manville commands cold war thrillerRead moreA raft of recent green lights suggests that Hollywood is finally realising the demand is more than misty-eyed nostalgia but there’s still a certain unfair pressure on the few that are coming out to prove the genre’s commercial viability (Adam Sandler’s giant Netflix numbers for Happy Gilmore 2 just served to show where audiences have learned to expect their comedies to be). There are noble intentions to Good Fortune, in ways related to both the resurrection of the big-screen comedy and its of-the-moment through-line about the increasingly untenable class divide in America, but also not a lot of laughs, the idea of its existence more appealing than the experience of watching it.Ansari, who has been out of the spotlight for the past few years, is an undeniably funny person but his style of humour isn’t an obvious fit for a belly-laugh comedy. His smart and stylish Netflix series Master of None was a show of wry observational humour about the often absurd realities of dating and work and friendship. It felt like the perfect mode for Ansari, who also made for a charismatic lead. Transporting his sensibility to a high-concept comedy fantasy is a gambit that just sadly doesn’t work, the multi-hyphenate losing himself and his personality.After his first attempt as director, a more reportedly dramatic comedy called Being Mortal,fell apart during productionafter allegations aimed at star Bill Murray, Ansari reassembled two of the film’s other stars – Seth Rogen and Keke Palmer – for something broader. Good Fortune is his attempt to mash together Freaky Friday and Trading Places, a magical life-swap comedy for an R-rated audience. It’s also his attempt to say something about the impossibility of today’s gig economy, a cruel system getting crueller by the day as the gap between the uber-wealthy and the rest of us widens. He plays Arj, a should-be documentary editor who spends his days rushing between thankless retail and app-based service jobs and his nights sleeping in his car. Life is an unfair struggle, especially when he’s reminded of how the other half get to live, like indulgent tech bro Jeff (Rogen), whose world is a mix of cold plunges, $250,000 watches and half-assed work meetings over exorbitantly imported sushi. Arj finds himself briefly working as Jeff’s assistant but he’s unceremoniously fired and returns to a life of scraping by after his brief taste of luxury. They’re both being watched by concerned and ambitious guardian angel Gabriel (Keanu Reeves) who sees an opportunity to help.He switches their lives, with Gabriel believing that as soon as Arj sees the reality of Jeff’s life, that it isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, he’ll want to go back. But it turns out that being rich actually does solve a ton of problems and Arj refuses to switch. Convoluted chaos ensues.It’s a film about the harsh differences between upstairs and downstairs, which struggles because of the harsh differences within its construction. It’s a shaggy, looser take on the kind of comedy that used to be tightly structured, shot like it’s lo-fi and grounded but with hokey magical plotting, designed around big comedy yet mostly reliant on the kind of small smile-worthy moments Ansari was known for on his show. The idea is initially, briefly amusing, but Ansari quickly exhausts it and finds himself stuck in a messy and repetitive back-and-forth, stretching the limits of half-thought rules. There’s no sense of pace to it, with some rushed and alienating editing, Ansari desperately in need of the confident hand and slicker formula found in the films he’s trying to emulate. He’s as likeable as ever, as is Rogen, and it’s refreshing to see Reeves out of franchise mode but his one-joke character tires, most of his humour based around how apparently hilarious it would be to see the actor do and say certain things (Reeves saying chicken nuggies is really not as funny as the film seems to think).It’s three characters learning mostly surface-level life lessons about commerce and community (Palmer is reliably charming but under-used as a love interest trying to start a union) and while Ansari has his heart in the right place, he can’t find a way to weave in timely commentary on class and work into a heightened knockabout comedy, and ends his uneven film on a note of unearned schmaltz. It’s harder than he seems to think it is, and harder than it should be for us to watch.Good Fortune is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released in cinemas on 17 OctoberExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewKeanu ReevesAziz AnsariSeth RogenComedy filmsToronto film festivalComedyreviewsShareReuse this content",

Given that the last six teams to come up have conceded a total of 515 goals (85.8 each on average) on their way straight back down, it’s not a bad position to focus on. Burnley replaced James Trafford with Martin Dubravka, while Leeds saw Lucas Perri as a safer pair of hands than Illan Meslier. Sunderland’s recruitment of Roefs, a small part of their £150m summer outlay, might be the best decision of all. Standing 6ft 4in tall, the Dutchman has a presence and composure that belies the fact he is only 22. Roefs has quickly become a fan favourite and saved a penalty to helpSunderland beat Brentford, their second win in three Premier League games.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead more2Ferran Jutglà (Club Brugge to Celta Vigo, £4.7m)Celta’s decision toreplace Rafa Benítezwith B-team coach Claudio Giráldez last year was an inspired one. Giráldez transformed them from relegation candidates to European qualifiers in a single season and did so with minimal spending, building his team around a young, homegrown core of players. With a European campaign looming and winger Fer López sold to Wolves, reinforcements were needed this summer. Jutglà, a versatile attacker raised at Barcelona, could scarcely fit the Celta profile better – and with a year left on his contract, the 26-year-old was snapped up for less than £5m. If a three-year stint in Belgium was an unexpected step in his development, Jutglà still delivered: 31 goals in 105 games, including a fine strike toseal a surprise Champions League winover Atalanta. He may well cause more shockwaves in the Europa League this season.View image in fullscreenFerran Jutglà honed his skills at Barcelona before a stint at Club Brugge.Photograph: Aflo Co. Ltd./Alamy3Ernest Poku (AZ Alkmaar to Bayer Leverkusen, £8.7m)It has been a turbulent summer for Bayer Leverkusen, with an entire XI’s worth of players coming and going under the watch of Erik ten Hag, who was thendismissed after three gamesin charge. An uncertain few weeks lie ahead for Leverkusen’s new recruits, including a trio of promising youngsters. Playmaker Ibrahim Maza and centre-back Abdoulaye Faye – plucked from second-tier Hertha and Swedish side Häcken respectively – are intriguing prospects, but flying winger Poku could make the quickest impact. Discovered in amateur football, Poku wasquickly identified as a rising star, helping unfancied AZ Alkmaar win the Uefa Youth League in 2023. Able to play out wide, up front or behind a central striker, Poku claims to “leave defenders behind for breakfast” with his raw pace, but is also blessed with a delicate touch. Whoever replaces Ten Hag would be wise to give him a chance to shine.Quick GuideSarr to Scienza: how last season's picks faredShowFederico Chiesa (Juventus to Liverpool, £10m)Reduced to a bit-part role, Chiesa was one of the very few disappointments in Arne Slot's first season at Anfield – but the Italian stayed put and scored a big goal against Bournemouth (pictured) to open this season.Khéphren Thuram (Nice to Juventus, £17.1m)It was another underwhelming season for Juve, but Thuram slotted in as one of their most-used players, and has kept his place in the starting XI under Igor Tudor while providing enough magic to earn an official highlights reel.Alejandro Francés (Zaragoza to Girona, £3m)A promising start was stalled by an injury as Girona endured a tough campaign. Turning out at left, right and centre-back in the Champions League will at least have been a useful learning experience.Ismaïla Sarr (Marseille to Crystal Palace, £12.5m)The flying winger has proved to be a perfect addition to Oliver Glasner's squad, scoring 15 goals and nine assists so far. Played a big role in run to FA Cup glory and will be missed over the next month with an injury.Luka Sucic (Salzburg to Real Sociedad, £8.5m)In a disappointing season for La Real, Sucic still caught the eye and played down rumours he could emulate 'role model' Luka Modric with a move to Real Madrid.Samuel Dahl (Djurgarden to Roma, £3.4m)Swedish left-back's move to Italy did not work out – he played just an hour of football before being loaned out to Benfica. Things have gone much better in Lisbon, though, with Dahl making the move permanent this summer.Léo Scienza (Ulm to Heidenheim, £420k)Plucked from lower-league obscurity, the Brazilian excelled in the Bundesliga, scoring a last-gasp goal to keep his club up. That earned a £7m move to Southampton, a huge profit on FCH's original investment.Jorge Cuenca (Villarreal to Fulham, £5.7m)Found his chances limited in his first season, making just four Premier League starts, but Marco Silva shut down transfer talk and sees the Spaniard as one of his four regular centre-backs for this season.Leopold Querfeld (Rapid Vienna to Union Berlin, £2.5m)Defender made an unexpected impact by scoring the Bundesliga goal of the season against Stuttgart, capping a strong debut season where he became a regular starter.Theo Bair (Motherwell to Auxerre, £1.4m)The Canada striker could not continue his scoring form in Ligue 1, netting twice in 29 appearances. Has joined Lausanne on loan in bid to earn a place in co-hosts' 2026 World Cup squad.• Read last year's listherePhotograph: Shutterstock/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.4Adrian Truffert (Rennes to Bournemouth, £11.4m)Bournemouth sold four players this summer for fees in excess of £40m, three of whom were key cogs in Andoni Iraola’s defence last season. The Cherries may have been picked apart but they have responded in the summer market with a range of smart mid-price signings. Truffert could be the best of the bunch; the left-back brings a very different physical profile to thedeparted Milos Kerkez, but offers an attractive blend of youth and experience. Still only 23, Truffert racked up 150 Rennes appearances and captained the club for part of last season. He also brings big-game prowess to this ambitious corner of the south coast, having featured in all three current Uefa competitions and won asilver medal with Franceat the Paris Olympics.5Santiago Hidalgo (Independiente to Toulouse, £2.5m)Before he had signed his first professional contract, Hidalgowas already aiming high. Having switched position from left-winger to striker, his ambition was to emulate Sergio Agüero. It was another Argentina legend that slowed his progress at Independiente; Carlos Tevez came in as head coach and sent Hidalgo to the reserves. After opting against a free transfer away, he outlasted Tevez and began to attract interest from Europe – including Toulouse, who havebuilt an analytical modelunder Damien Comolli with scouts in 70 different countries. Comolli has left for Juventus this summer but the club’s approach continues, negotiating a cut-price fee for a player with a reported €20m release clause. Hidalgo has hit the ground running as an impact substitute, notching two assists in three Ligue 1 games so far.View image in fullscreenSantiago Hidalgo has made an impact since arriving at Toulouse.Photograph: Nathan Barange/DPPI Media/Alamy6Borna Sosa (Ajax to Crystal Palace, £3m)Crystal Palace are masters of a canny cut-price deal, but even by their standards, landing a defender of Sosa’s calibre and experiencefor a fee of up to £3mwas exceptional work. Seen as a rising star at Stuttgart, where he recorded a league-leading 24 assists across three seasons at left-back, Sosa’s career stalled when the former Stuttgart sporting director, Sven Mislintat, brought him to Ajax in 2023 – and was sacked three weeks later. Out of the picture in Amsterdam, Sosa struggled on loan at Torino but already looks a better fit on the left of Oliver Glasner’s 3-4-3 formation. Tyrick Mitchell remains first-choice in that position, but Sosa’s solid European experience will be hugely beneficial as Palace embark on their first continental campaign.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also bolstered Les Dogues’ reputation as one of Europe’s leading clubs in terms of talent development. Having banked £47.6m for academy product Chevalier, Lille spent less than 10% of that fee on their new No 1, who wasplaying first-team football at 18for Turkish side Altinordu. Özer joined Fenerbahce but found his path blocked by Altay Bayindir, and took loan moves to Belgium and Portugal in order to play before settling back in Turkey with Eyüpspor. It was Lille’s previous history with Turkish stars like Burak Yilmaz that swayed Özer to move and he has started well, making big saves against Monaco before saving a penalty and notching an assist as Lille dismantled Lorient 7-1.Transfer window and deadline day: Premier League club-by-club analysisRead more8Christian Ordoñez (Vélez Sarsfield to Parma, £6.7m)Another club with a hard-earned reputation for developing players are Parma, aiming to stabilise in Serie A after a turbulent decade. Undernew head coach Carlos Cuesta– previously an assistant to Mikel Arteta at Arsenal – the club have cast their net wide this summer in search of young talent. Ordoñez, a tough-tackling midfielder, and January recruit Mateo Pellegrino were both signed from Argentinian side Vélez. Pellegrino scored twice in Cuesta’s first game in charge, a Coppa Italia win over Pescara, while Ordoñez has the ball-winning skills to make a big impact on Serie A midfields. Having flashed up on Manchester United’s radar, Ordoñez is happy to join a club “where so many important Argentinian players made history”. He and Pellegrino could quickly join that list.View image in fullscreenParma’s Christian Ordoñez has the presence and ability to make an impact in Serie A.Photograph: Cristiano Barni/Alamy9Carlos Soler (PSG to Real Sociedad, £6.9m)Not every good-value transfer involves an unfamiliar name on an upward trajectory. Soler would once have fit those criteria, but his career stalled after leaving hometown club Valencia for PSG’s crowded midfield engine room. He made 50 league appearances in Paris, but only played the full 90 minutes six times, and a season atWest Ham on loansaw him fall into a similar bit-part role. Real Sociedad’s deadline-day move is therefore something of a gamble, but the Anoeta seems an ideal location for Soler to rediscover his best form. Back in La Liga, where he made 182 appearances in his first stint, his flexibility and work ethic will be useful to a team rebuilding under new manager Sergio Francisco. If so, fans can thank former midfield star Mikel Merino, who encouraged the move in a phone call with Soler last week.10Nikola Stulic (Charleroi to Lecce, £4.3m)When a key player is snapped up by a bigger club, some teams prefer a like-for-like replacement. That appears to be the case at Lecce, who have signed Serbian striker Nikola Stulic as the successor to Nikola Krstovic, the Montenegrin forward who has joined Atalanta. Krstovic (Red Star) and Stulic (Partizan) both developed at a Belgrade giant, and both took a sidestep on their way toSerie A. While Krstovic found his scoring touch at Slovakian side Dunajska Streda, Stulic bagged a goal every other game with Charleroi last season. There’s no guarantee that Stulic will keep following his predecessor’s path, but the bargain fee reduces any risk. If Krstovic is a hit in Bergamo, Lecce’s 10% sell-on fee might well cover the cost of signing Stulic entirely.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowPremier LeagueLigue 1Serie ABundesligaEuropean club footballLa LigafeaturesShareReuse this content",

Via video call from her beloved farm in Lexington,Virginia, she’s gabbing with me as if we are long-lost friends, breezily dropping one-liners and only occasionally invoking an internal censor that tends to arrive a little too late. All this energy services a profound curiosity, an intense work ethic and a meagre capacity for sitting still that has seen her declared one of the most influential photographers working today.What’s the risk of being honest? Other than ridicule, which I’m used toBorn in Lexington in 1951, Mann was, she has said, a “near-feral” child, the last of three children in a bohemian family, who hardly wore clothes until she was five. Her father, a country doctor, gave her her first camera. At school, she emerged from the darkroom “ecstatic” with the results.View image in fullscreenPictures and posters on Mann’s wall. The portrait of her three children is from her Immediate Family seriesShe gradually built a respectable following for her atmospheric photos that drip with the soul of the US south. But in 1992, she was catapulted into the centre of the US’s culture wars when she released her third book of photos, Immediate Family. The book was ostensibly a homage to life with her husband, Larry, and three young children on her beloved farm, and was chock full of beautiful black-and-white images capturing family moments shaded with ethereal transcendence, loving intimacy and bracing intrusiveness.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen‘I’m a peasant’: Mann tends her 45-acre farm while keeping up with her art; she was born and brought up in LexingtonSeeing the photos in Immediate Family can feel like glimpsing private family events. With a wash of overexposed light, an image such as The Perfect Tomato turns her daughter Jessie into a literal angel ballet-dancing naked on the family picnic table. It could rightfully be called a perfect photograph, but it – and others like it – also pushed a lot of buttons. After the book’s publication, Mann faced atorrent of criticism. She was declared an unfit mother, branded a child pornographer, excoriated in the New York Times, and found herself hunted by a stalker. Though criticism has softened as her work has been reappraised in recent years, it’s still a live issue for Mann – The Perfect Tomato was recently among five photos seized by police at an exhibition of her work at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas, after it caught the attention of religious conservatives.Mann doesn’t shrink from controversy, and doesn’t take kindly to having her artistic expression curtailed. “What’s the risk of being honest,” she asks, “other than ridicule, which I’m used to.” But she also says that she probably wouldn’t release Immediate Family today, because parasocial relationships enabled by the internet have changed the equation.View image in fullscreenChemical bottles in Mann’s ‘dirty studio’ where she experiments with techniques; she has tried many different mixtures as part of her processView image in fullscreen“My family pictures were an unanticipated risk, in that they made people think that they knew us. A lot of people feel like they know you because you’ve made yourself available. I don’t think the family pictures would have been prudent going out in the world now, because there’s so much access to people. That just gives me the willies – what goes on to the internet and how available people are now.”But as much as Mann says she doesn’t like the spotlight,her oeuvredoes indicate a certain willingness to share. In 2015, she published her memoir, Hold Still, an extremely open book that found her airing all kinds of family history, while sharing personal diaries, letters and photographs. The book dives into the dark heart of racism in the US south and considers her immigrant family’s background of desperate poverty and death. It shocked readers with just how macabre and forthcoming she could be, and also featured startling images of personal vulnerability – we see Mann’s spread legs and pubic hair in a photo she orchestrated to capture the moment her third child emerged during delivery. (Sadly, Mann labels the photo a “dud”.)View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenA book of film processing instructions for different papers; she collects all kinds of objects to study – here, a mummified creature hangs on the wallThe memoir was highly acclaimed, labelled the autobiography of the year, and once again brought the photographer into the spotlight. Though for Mann – who has a master’s degree in creative writing and has described writing and photography as her “twin artistic passions” – the move wasn’t easy. “Switching from being a photographer to writing a book felt a little risky to me,” she says. “I thought I was going to get humiliated. Of course I was thrilled when it was well received, but I did spend five years on it, so I would have been gutted if it hadn’t gotten some attention.”But she hasn’t left photography behind. Her eerie black-and-white landscapes of the American south have been collected in Deep South (2005) and Southern Landscape (2013), and she documented the effects of her husband Larry’s muscular dystrophy on his body in the intimate 2009 series Proud Flesh. (“The pictures are like one big caress,” she has said.) “I get this little frisson of excitement every time I pick up those cameras and head out to take pictures,” she says. “I like risk. I couldn’t take the same pictures over and over again. If it’s not challenging, it’s probably not good.”View image in fullscreenMann’s print room with work on display; proofs and a dustjacket of her new book,ArtWork: On the Creative Life; and a stack of filed printsView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenNow, 10 years on from her memoir, she is releasing her follow-up piece of writing, Art Work, a book of advice for budding artists. “It’s a how not-to, rather than a how-to,” she says in her deadpan, slightly self-deprecating way. Just like her memoir, this book contains personal stories – many of them humiliating and vulnerable. Talking to her, it’s clear that Mann has been telling these stories for a long time and truly enjoys sharing their every twist and turn. “There were so many stories I thought of after Hold Still,” she said. “This new book seems to be all the stories I tell at dinner parties, stories that just stick around in my head that I think are funny. I made a list of all the things that didn’t get in Hold Still that I wanted to write about. It sort of grew on me after a while.”Mann agrees that some of the tales in Art Work stray from the book’s ostensible purpose of imparting artistic advice in favour of telling a great yarn. This is particularly evident in the aptly titled chapter Distraction, a twisty story of two ne’er-do-wells armed to the teeth, to whom Mann has the misfortune of renting a refurbished trailer. Before long she’s talking with a bomb squad and watching her beloved trailer get demolished into splinters.Photographer Sally Mann’s best shootRead moreAs fascinating as the story is, one might ask what it has to do with making art. But Mann says it has a purpose. “It seemed a bit of a stretch at first, but I thought it was really important for people to know that you can lie fallow for a period while your mind processes. The whole time I was dealing with that trailer, I was just furious about it. That incident didn’t immediately redound to good art, but it gave me some sense of perspective. It made me want to get back to my art. Maybe that’s the point of enforced fallowness, that you really want to get back to work. When you get to the point that it’s harder not to work than to work.”The stories in Art Work frequently sound a little too good to be true. Here’s another: as a cocky young twentysomething in the early 1970s, Mann becomes taken with a man on a plane wearing a pocket square and unceremoniously seats herself beside him. (This was back when air passengers could just saunter up to any empty seat.) After chatting with him, she learns that he is a wealthy astrophysicist named Ron. By the time they land, this stranger is giving Mann the key to his mansion smack in the middle of Manhattan’s choicest real estate. Ron, it turns out, is Ronald Winston, son of the late jewellery magnate Harry Winston.View image in fullscreen‘I get this little frisson of excitement every time I pick up those cameras and head out’Wouldn’t we all be so lucky? Reading Art Work, you might be excused for thinking that Mann has lived a charmed life – one moment she’s getting the key to Ronald Winston’s home, the next the emir of Qatar is positively begging her to take his money in exchange for a portrait.But for whatever dumb luck she has managed to fall into, she has shown an equally intense amount of grit. From her teenage years, she was hustling for every photographic opportunity she could get. Living in the middle of nowhere, the self-taught photographer had to work hard to make her mark. In fact, Mann has folders and folders full of rejection letters on her computer hard drive, which she charmingly shares in Art Work.Always have another body of work waiting in the wings that you’re equally excited aboutToday, Mann still lives on her farm, and spends her days tending her 45 acres of land while keeping up with her art. “I spend enormous amounts of time running a weed eater [strimmer], or taking my chainsaw and cutting trees off my trails,” she says, detailing the impressive work she undertakes in between the equally intense work of shooting and printing photos. “I’m a worker, I’m a peasant, I’m really strong, I can do almost anything.” She’s currently working on two new photography projects: one is digital, a medium she’s never fully explored before, and which represents a huge artistic departure given that she’s known for not only making her own darkroom prints but also for using challenging large-format cameras. The other project uses an archaic form of film rarely employed these days.Hold Still by Sally Mann: a seductive memoir by a controversial artistRead moreView image in fullscreenTools of the trade … scalpel and brushes for print workSurprisingly, Mann tells me that her favourite piece of advice for younger artists didn’t make it into the book. “I get asked ‘What would you say to artists?’ a lot. If I could say one thing, it’s to always have another body of work waiting in the wings that you’re equally excited about,” she says. “It’s so easy to get discouraged when you finish a body of work, you think you’ll never do anything as good. I always think that I have nothing left, and then I go out and find something.”It’s this restlessness that probably has her continuing to fret over Art Work. “Just the other day I thought of four things I wanted to add to this book,” she says. “I ran them by my editor and he said: ‘Sally, the book is shipping today. It’s already printed. It’s done.’”At the end of our time together, Mann seems downright disappointed. As I wrap up by asking if there’s anything else she wants to say, explaining that it’s common practice to do so, because people are usually holding back on something, she promptly declares: “I never hold anything back.” She’s probably very right about that.Art Work: On the Creative Life by Sally Mann is published by Particular Books on 18 September (£25).To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

He said on Sunday it “would be really, really foolish for the government to row back on key manifesto commitments that are popular with the public and will show what a positive difference aLabourgovernment can make”.Downing Street and Labour sources insisted the legislation would proceed despite pressure from businesses to water down some of the protections against unfair dismissal. One senior government source said: “This reshuffle is about boosting growth, productivity and making people better off. Higher pay and stronger rights for working people is a key part of the government’s programme.”Nevertheless, there was still a high degree of nervousness among unions, with Peter Kyle, the new business secretary, phoning general secretaries this weekend to reassure them that the bill would go ahead.Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, urged the prime minister to commit to implementing the legislation “in full”; while the Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “If they don’t become a workers’ government, the workers will seek other answers. The stark warnings are already there.”It is understood Starmer’s first meeting of his reshuffled cabinet on Tuesday will focus solely on growing the economy.No 10 is braced for a deputy leadership contest in which candidates publicly criticise Starmer’s first year in government, and during which Nigel Farage’s Reform party has risen in the polls.They have attempted to head off the criticism with a decisive reshuffle of ministers and change of senior aides in No 10, acknowledging that they want to speed up the pace of policies.However, there is already deep anxiety among Labour MPs about the direction of the reshuffle, which promoted a number of ministers seen as being favoured by the right of the party, includingShabana Mahmood, Pat McFadden, and Peter Kyle.One senior Labour source said the reshuffle was an example of “groupthink”, adding that whether “they win or lose in May, it’s all on them as there’s no one now who isn’t signed up to this way of working. It’s clear from this reshuffle they aren’t interested in listening.“This is going to reinforce rather than solve their problems - the deputy contest then takes on the form of an intervention and not just filling a vacancy.”Thornberry told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “Domestically, things just don’t seem to be working … People hear about the mistakes. And the question is, why are we making these mistakes?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And the last thing we want is to go from a position where it was thought we would be in for two terms, to hand our country over to Farage.”Speaking to the Guardian, Burnham issued a similar message on the need for greater listening across the party. “Labour’s got to be less factional and more inclusive, more pluralistic. If he’s going to rise to the challenge ahead of us, all parts of the Labour family need to be involved and engaged in adding what they can. And certainly the Labour governments I was in worked more like that.”The Guardian can also reveal that Burnham is backing a new political network on called Mainstream, which is drawn largely from the soft left and aims to influence the direction of the party.Steered by the thinktank Compass, it is planning to mobilise a grassroots motion at party conference demanding the abolition of the two-child benefit cap, as well as aiming to campaign in constituency Labour parties and across the country for what they describe as bold but practical reforms.Burnham said he was concerned about the balance of the cabinet after the reshuffle and the deputy leadership contest was a moment to try to shift the party away from being London-centric. One of his preferred candidates, Haigh, who resigned last year over a scandal about a conviction for fraud over a missing mobile phone, is understood not to have made up her mind whether to run.However, there is likely to be a huge array of candidates battling for nominations as soon as the terms of the contest are decided by the national executive committee on Monday.These could include David Lammy, Lisa Nandy and Shabana Mahmood in the cabinet; Haigh, Powell, Jess Phillips, Stella Creasy, Thornberry, Sarah Owen, Anneliese Dodds, Dawn Butler and Meg Hillier on the backbenches; plus Richard Burgon, Nadia Whittome and others more on the left of the party.MPs and their supporters are already frantically sounding out colleagues to see if their bids are viable. One MP tipped Phillips as gaining support, saying she was “an ideal successor to Angela [Rayner]. Brave, strong, principled, clear values, great communicator, sounds like a normal person.”The party’s ruling national executive committee is scheduled to meet on Monday to outline a timetable for the deputy leadership election. Burgon, a former shadow cabinet minister under Jeremy Corbyn, called on the committee “not to skew the process to deliver the outcome the current leadership wants but ensure this is a fully democratic process”. Butler also urged the party not to “shy away from a fair process when selecting our next deputy leader”.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourAndy BurnhamAngela RaynerGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content",

That is right anyway, but it’s really right for the times we’re in now.“We’ve got to get beyond this culture where everything’s a threat. If people are speaking out, it can actually be an opportunity to make changes.“Labour’s always been factional but it’s become more so in recent times than I can remember in almost 40 years in the party. You don’t win through a factional approach. You win through a broader approach.”Its founders say it is designed to be the “home for Labour’s radical realists”, promising to provide a space for members to discuss vision, policy and electoral strategy. They also aim to campaign in constituency Labour parties (CLPs) and across the country for what they describe as bold but practical reforms.At the same time its Labour members are preparing to put a child poverty motion on the conference floor calling on the prime minister to scrap the two-child benefit limit, a policy blamed for pushing hundreds of thousands of children into poverty.The conference motion, backed by Momentum, Open Labour and Compass, floats raising £6bn through levies on banks and the online gambling industry to pay for its abolition, an idea that has been supported by the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown.Compass’s decision to re-engage within Labour follows polling that has showed broad support for members who back wealth taxes, democratic reform and stronger action against child poverty.View image in fullscreenAndy Burnham has thrown his weight behind former cabinet minister Louise Haigh for the Labour deputy leadership.Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/ShutterstockMainstream’s supporters believe the Labour government is struggling to communicate the coherent vision, policy and strategy needed to change the country. They acknowledge the huge electoral threat from the populist right in Reform UK and believe Starmer and his top team “seem lost and unprepared to develop and champion a popular left alternative”.The network vows to become openly campaigning, unlike other networks such as the Labour-aligned Fabian thinktank, seeking to get the support of members who feel the government has been too cautious.With Angela Rayner forced to resign after being found in breach of the ministerial code, Labour faces a deputy leadership contest. Burnham said it should not be “a running commentary on the government” but a debate about “the running of the party”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farage is on their tail’Read moreBurnham has long been viewed as a possible successor to Starmer. Asked if Mainstream could become a vehicle for him to return to Westminster, he replied: “It’s about culture rather than people … it’s bigger than any one personality.”Pressed again, he said: “I’m really happy where I am. I think what we’ve done through devolution is connect people with politics in a different way. This is intended to help the government … it’s tough being in government and Mainstream is here to help them.”Organisers say its not a faction or a caucus, but a broad church of the party’s progressive left, stretching from the soft left through to non-aligned activists who would class themselves as centrists.Labour figures say it would not be surprising for an organisation set up in this way to seek to propose its own candidate for the party’s upcoming deputy leadership contest, and even shape the ground for a future leadership contest.While Starmer’s reshuffle indicated his plans to tighten his grip on his ministerial team with a focus on tackling immigration and taking on the fight to Reform UK, his party management will be tested at conference.Mainstream organisers believe supporters are looking for a bolder offer from the government, to also avoid being outflanked by the Greens led by their new eco-populist leader Zack Polanski or theCorbyn-Sultana alliance.Neal Lawson, chair of Compass, said: “At this moment of peril for the party, Mainstream launches as a historic alliance in Labour. Never before have the centre, soft left and hard left come together to save its heart and soul.”Explore more on these topicsLabourAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerLouise HaighLucy PowellnewsShareReuse this content",

The pandemic pushed buyers into leafier, more lifestyle-driven locations, but today’s movers are more pragmatic,” Beveridge said.As growth in prices in the capital has slowed, or even gone into reverse in some areas, someone leaving inner London can afford a 32% smaller home than in 2016, Hamptons found, losing them on average the equivalent of 553 sq feet or two double bedrooms.Prices have risen 26% outside the capital over the last five years, triple the 8% pace recorded in London.Separate data published on Monday by the estate agents Knight Frank showed that average house prices in prime central London – which stretches from Chelsea to Camden and Notting Hill to Westminster – fell 3.2% in the year to August. Prices in prime outer London – defined as Barnes, Battersea, Canary Wharf, Chiswick, Clapham, Fulham, Hampstead, Richmond, Riverside, Wandsworth, Clapham, Wapping and Wimbledon – were up 0.5% on average but the number of transactions across London as a whole was down 6%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thousands have also been released without charge, often after months of detention.Rights groups have documented widespread abuse in prisons and detention facilities, including insufficient food and health care, as well as poor sanitary conditions and beatings. In March, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy died at an Israeli prison and doctors said starvation was likely the main cause of death.The ruling came in response to a petition brought last year by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) and the Israeli rights group Gisha. The groups alleged that a change in the food policy enacted after the war in Gaza began has caused prisoners to suffer malnutrition and starvation.Last year, the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the prison system, boasted that he had reduced the conditions of security prisoners to what he described as the bare minimum required by Israeli law.In Sunday’s ruling, the panel of three justices ruled unanimously that the state is legally obliged to provide prisoners with enough food to ensure “a basic level of existence”.In the 2-1 ruling, the justices said they found “indications that the current food supply to prisoners does not sufficiently guarantee compliance with the legal standard”. They said they had found “real doubts” that prisoners were eating properly, and ordered the prison service to “take steps to ensure the supply of food that allows for basic subsistence conditions in accordance with the law”.Ben-Gvir, who leads a small far-right ultranationalist party, lashed out at the ruling, saying that while Israeli hostages in Gaza have no one to help them, Israel’s supreme court “to our disgrace” is defending Hamas militants. He said the policy of providing prisoners with “the most minimal conditions stipulated by the law” would continue unchanged.ACRI called for the verdict to be implemented immediately. In a post on X, it said the prison service has “turned Israeli prisons into torture camps”.“A state does not starve people,” it said. “People do not starve people – no matter what they have done.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content",

He called the package the boldest tax reform enforced inGreecein more than 50 years.The policies build on other initiatives by the centre-right government to tackle the issue.With fertility rates in Greece among the lowest in Europe – at 1.4 children a woman, the reproduction rate is well below the replacement level of 2.1 – Mitsotakis has called the problem a “national threat”.The Greek population is on course to fall from the current 10.2 million to well under 8 million by 2050, when 36% will be above the age of 65, according to Eurostat.Acknowledging the decline had assumed existential proportions, finance minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis said fertility rates had halved since the start of the country’s economic crisis 15 years ago.“Our taxation reform will give great emphasis to this problem … as head of the economic team, I’d say our top priority is the demographic issue,” he said.Greece’s near decade-long crisis has been widely blamed for the alarming drop. This is partly because younger people were among those hardest hit by austerity measures required in return for international rescue funds that kept bankruptcy at bay and debt-stricken Athens in the EU.More than 500,000 Greeks left the country in search of work during the crisis, an exodus of mostly young and talented citizens the government is trying to reverse.The latest measures, which include dropping tax obligations for those living in rural settlements with fewer than 1,500 residents, will be funded with money from the fiscal surplus as the economy has recovered.Officials say falling fertility rates are putting the pension and health systems, as well as labour markets and national security, at unprecedented risk at a time of geopolitical uncertainty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The subsidy has since risen from €1,700 for a first child to €3,500 for a fourth in addition to a monthly stipend of up to €140 per child.But as the cost of living also soars in a country with some of the lowest wages in the EU, the policies appear to have had little effect. Greece’s education ministry announced this month that it had closed more than 700 schools nationwide citing a lack of pupils.With his government’s popularity dented by corruption claims and cost of living concerns, Mitsotakis vowed to increase pensions and affordable housing by constructing properties on abandoned military facilities.A real estate tax in remote areas will also be scrapped to encourage young people to move to the countryside, where prices are often a far cry from those in cities. Unaffordable housing is such that younger Greeks frequently complain they are forced to live with their parents into their 30s – another reason raised for the lack of interest in having children.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropeKyriakos MitsotakisTax and spendingPopulationnewsShareReuse this content",

Because every little helps.”Campaigning groups the New Weather Institute, Badvertising and Adfree Cities, which havesuccessfully pursuednumerous bans on ads by asking the ASA to investigate, have lodged a complaint claiming that the watchdog’s own marketing is misleading and inaccurate.The ASA’s campaign, which has run in different iterations over the past few years and was most recently renewed in July, features claims that it regulates ads “across all media” and “wherever you see or hear them”.However, the campaigning groups argue this is inaccurate and misleading as the ASA’s remit does not cover the regulation of ads in some media where mass audiences can see them.The complaint says exceptions include ads in shop windows and at point of sale, parts of airports, flyposters, on pitch-side hoardings of sports events on TV and some social media content.Andrew Simms, a co-director of the NWI thinktank and a co-founder of the campaign group Badvertising, said: “The ASA wants us to think they will protect the public from all toxic adverts, but they are in fact powerless to prevent multiple ads that misinform from going on show every day in the UK.“It matters all the more that the body responsible for maintaining standards in advertising lives up to them itself. If a regulator publishes its own misleading ads you have a problem.”The ASA was set up in 1962 as an independent bodyto self-regulate the UK advertising codeand is funded through a levy collected from ad agencies based on media spend.Last year the ASA secured theamendment or withdrawal of 33,309 ads. Overall, it received 37,284 complaints about 24,015 ads and has introduced artificial intelligence monitoring that led to the ASA processing 28m ads.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As with any other regulator, there is a start and end point to our remit. For obvious reasons, it would not be appropriate for the ASA to investigate complaints about its own ad.”While the ASA is independent of the ad industry, the ASA Council – which makes decisions on whether an ad has broken the UK rules – is not, as it effectively acts as the regulator’s board. There is no body or organisation to investigate the ASA’s own ads.Media owners have the option of declining the use of their ad space for ASA campaigns if they feel the content or claims breach the advertising code. The ASA also theoretically has the option of pulling its own campaign, which has been put together using experts at its disposal in the UK advertising code.The ASA has received complaints about the various ad campaigns it has run in the past. The groups that have lodged the latest complaint are campaigners for total category and sector bans in areas including the climate crisis, gambling, alcohol and junk food and would prefer the ASA to be replaced with a statutory regulator.Robbie Gillett, a co-director at Adfree Cities, said: “We urge the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to review the ASA’s limited remit and consult with a broader range of groups about how the marketing industries should be properly regulated.”Explore more on these topicsAdvertising Standards AuthorityAdvertisingRegulatorsThinktanksnewsShareReuse this content",

Some central rail stations with tube interchanges will be closed.Transport for London (TfL) expects the impact to be most keenly felt from Tuesday, with midweek days now the busiest for commuters since working from home became widespread.Docklands Light Railway trains will also not run on Tuesday or Thursday because of strikes arising in a separate dispute.TfL has promised to operate as many services as possible, after making a last-ditch appeal to theRMTunion on Friday to call off the London Underground strike. It said it had now made a pay offer of 3.4%, which it urged the union to put to its members.TfL described the offer as fair and in line with RPI inflation and other pay deals agreed in the rail industry, but said it could not meet demands from the RMT to look at reducing the hours in the working week, currently at 35 hours.Members of the train drivers union, Aslef, are not involved in the strikes. It has yet to formally accept the deal but is not expecting to ballot for any action.One estimate puts the potential economic impact of the strikes on the UK economy at more than £230m. The Centre for Economics and Business Research thinktank said its figure was fairly conservative as it is only accounted for direct losses from striking staff and commuters unable to reach work and not ripple effects such as lost productivity and lower spending by shoppers.The series of RMT strikes, which began on Friday night with depot managers in west London, will start to affect services late on Sunday, as power and track access controllers take action.Staff working on trains and stations will strike on Monday and Wednesday, and signallers and service controllers on Tuesday and Thursday, bringing the underground to a halt until 8am on Friday 12 September.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said that TfL would “welcome further engagement from all of our unions about managing fatigue across the network, but a reduction in the contractual 35-hour working week is neither practical nor affordable”.An RMT spokesperson said: “We believe a shorter working week is fair and affordable particularly when you consider TfL had a surplus of £166m last year and a £10bn annual operating budget. There are 2,000 fewer staff working on London Underground since 2018 and our members are feeling the strain of extreme shift patterns, giving rise to potential health problems due to fatigue.”The last planned tube strike,in early 2024, was called offafter the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, ambushed negotiations with news of an extra £30m for pay rises.Bus drivers working for First Bus in west London are also due to strike for three days from Friday, bringing disruption on some routes.Explore more on these topicsLondon UndergroundTfLRMTRail industryRail transportTransportLondonnewsShareReuse this content",

But drone images and new research shared exclusively with the Guardian reveal that the number of such centres operating along the Thai-Myanmar border has more than doubled since Myanmar’s military seized power in 2021, with construction continuing to this day.Interactive showing expansion of KK Park scam centre compound from 2019 to 2025Data from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute(Aspi), a defence thinktank in Canberra, shows that the number of Myanmar scam centres on the Thai border has increased from 11 to 27, and they have expanded in size by an average of 5.5 hectares a month.Drone images and photographs of KK Park and other Myanmar scam centres, Tai Chang and Shwe Kokko, taken by the Guardian in August show new features and active building work.View image in fullscreenThe sprawling Tai Chang compound on the banks of the Moei River, Myanmar’s border with Thailand.Photograph: Jittrapon Kaicome/The GuardianAt the Tai Chang complex, additional structures have emerged over the past year, including a floating dock that was built in recent months to allow supplies to be brought in more easily from Thailand. The Guardian’s drone footage also shows white squares visible on the roofs of both Tai Chang and KK Park, which are likely to be satellite internet receivers. These are to allow them to stay online after Thailand cut off cross-border supplies of electricity, internet and gas to areas hosting scam centres earlier this year in an attempt to disable them and halt the criminal gangs.Thai authorities have previously stated that Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite internet service, is being used by scam compounds, and haveintercepted smuggled terminalsthey believe to be heading across the border.Drone and satellite imagery seen by the Guardian of other scam centres inside Myanmar show strong fortifications and security systems. The Dongmei Park compound is surrounded by fencing and guarded by a checkpoint and perimeter watchtowers, according to analysis by Aspi.Map of Myanmar-Thai border along Moei River showing locations of scam centresThe sites also feature a range of facilities for senior staff and visitors. In some compounds, luxury housing is reserved for “management teams” running the workers, or used as a setting for video calls with their intended victims, to convince them they are speaking to someone extremely wealthy, whose investment advice they should follow.View image in fullscreenAccommodation inside KK Park, one of the major hubs for scam centers and human trafficking in Myawaddy, Myanmar.Photograph: Jittrapon Kaicome/The GuardianMyanmar civil war: a quick guide to the conflictRead moreGrim accounts of the treatment of trafficked workers trapped inside the centres have gained increased global attention in recent months, with those who have managed to escape recounting the extreme violence, torture and punishments they endured at the hands of the scam centre bosses.About7,000 people were freed from the compoundsearlier this year, through a complex rescue effort that involved neighbouring Thailand, China and other countries whose citizens were trapped, as well as the Myanmar military and armed groups that control border areas.View image in fullscreenAlleged scam centre victims after being freed by Karen forces at the border checkpoint with Thailand in Myawaddy in February.Photograph: AFP/GettyBut experts say this is just a drop in the ocean.

According to the group, some victims have lost body parts and have been blinded or permanently disabled as a result of violent abuse by crime bosses.Mateo*, from the Philippines, spent six months trapped inside KK Park. He had travelled from his home to Thailand last year, believing he had secured a legitimate job as a customer service representative.Four years after the coup, chaos reigns as Myanmar’s military strugglesRead moreInstead he was trafficked across the border and his passport was taken away. Each day he was required to message hundreds of older American men on social media sites, building their trust until they shared their WhatsApp number. The contact would then be passed on to another scamming team.If he failed to meet targets he would be punished with a stun gun or with gruelling physical penalties in the searing heat outside. Leaving the compound was not an option. “There are many armed guards,” he says.Myanmar’s military junta has allowed the spread of scam centres inside the country as these criminal enterprises have become an essential part of the country’s conflict economy since the coup, helping it rise to thetop of the global listof countries harbouring organised crime.View image in fullscreenBuilding last month in the Shwe Kokko scam centre.Photograph: Jittrapon Kaicome/GuardianAccording to Aspi’s analysis, Myanmar’s military, which has lost huge swathes of territory since the coup and is struggling to retain its grip on power, cannot take meaningful measures against the scam compounds without endangering its precarious relations with the crucial armed militias who are profiting from them.Nathan Ruser, an open source data analyst at Aspi, says: “In many ways, this industry is now an existential necessity for the embattled Burmese military.”Myanmar’s military has previously said there was a need for shared responsibility to tackle the issue, including with the home countries of trafficking victims and the countries through which they transit.View image in fullscreenAmy Miller from Acts of Mercy International.Photograph: Jittrapon Kaicome/The GuardianInternationally, governments mistakenly view scam centres as a relatively small human trafficking concern, says Amy Miller, south-east Asia director for Acts of Mercy International, a US evangelical organisation that works with victims of human trafficking.“To me, that’s such ignorance, in not understanding the scale of this and where it will grow to,” she says, adding that there are already signs of similar schemes emerging in countries such as Sri Lanka and Nigeria.Mateo was eventually rescued from KK Park, and is now recovering with other freed workers. He is still too traumatised to reflect any more on his experiences inside the scam centres but his friend, who was trapped along with him, says of the scam bosses: “For them, money is more important than human life. They don’t care if they tread on others – what matters to them is money.”It feels, he says, “like all the evil in the world” exists inside those compounds.* Names have been changed to protect identitiesExplore more on these topicsHuman traffickingRights and freedomOrganised crimeMyanmarMyanmar coupHuman rightsScamsSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content",

Many came cloaked in the US flag or carried posters asking Trump to act.“He’s the only one who can save us … Trump is our only salvation,” said Rodrigo da Silva, a 45-year-old salesman who was one of thousands of Bolsonaro voters to gather in the capital, Brasília, under a fierce sun.View image in fullscreenA demonstration in support of Jair Bolsonaro also took place in São Paulo, Brazil, on Sunday.Photograph: Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty ImagesHours earlier, Lula used his independence day address to condemn foreign attempts to influence the outcome of Bolsonaro’s trial.“We are not, and never again will we be, anyone’s colony … we do not take orders from anyone,” Lula declared, denouncing the “traitorous” rightwing politicians who were “encouraging” Trump’s campaign against Brazil.Bolsonaro’s congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, has spent recent months in the US lobbying Trump officials to target the Brazilian authorities in an attempt to save his father from prison.At Sunday’s demonstrations, Bolsonaro devotees urged Trump to do more to help their 70-year-old leader, who has beenliving under house arrest since early Augustafter violating a court order banning him from using social media. If convicted this week, he faces a sentence of up to 43 years. The verdict is expected on Thursday or Friday.“He represents our last resort,” a woman who gave her name as Maria da Silva said of Trump at the rally in Brasília.Standing near a sound truck decorated with a banner reading “America Save Brazil”, Silva insisted Bolsonaro was innocent and attacked the supreme court’s “totally biased” treatment of the rightwing populist.“They want to eliminate Bolsonaro and there is no one else to turn to in Brazil. There is only Trump who is turning his eyes to us. That’s why he’s our last resort,” added the woman, hoisting into the air a placard that said: “We [heart sign] Trump”.“I am a woman of faith and I believe that God will help us. He can use Trump to help us,” she added in English.View image in fullscreenThousands joined a pro-Bolsonaro rally at Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday.Photograph: Pilar Olivares/ReutersIn Rio, thousands of demonstrators flocked to Copacabana beach to show their support for Bolsonaro, who retains the support of millions of Brazilians despite police claims he orchestrated a failed coup. The former president denies the charges but has admitted seeking “alternative” ways of staying in power.“Trump was the only one who raised his voice to put an end to the supreme court’s persecution of Bolsonaro,” said Jorge Faria, 78, who was one of many at the Copacabana rally carrying a flag that mixed Brazil’s yellow and green standard with the US stars and stripes.In São Paulo,​ thousands more pro-Bolsonaro protesters packed the avenue outside the city’s ​museum of ​ar​t and unfurled a giant US flag.Addressing the throng, the rightwing state governor, Tarcísio de Freitas​, who is considered a likely Bolsonaro heir, lashed out at the “tyranny​” of Moraes, one of five supreme court judges who will decide the former president’s fate over the coming days.Leftwing joy over the anticipated conviction of a politician who prosecutors claim tried to plunge Brazil back into authoritarian rule has been tempered by anger over Trump’s intervention and fears the country’s conservative-dominated congress could eventually approve an amnesty for Bolsonaro.Lula says Trump would be put on trial in Brazil if January 6 riots took place thereRead more“I’m really worried about my country and I think it’s my obligation to fight for our freedom and our independence,” said Hilda Resende, a retired civil servant who is part of a leftwing embroidery collective calledBorda Luta.Resende’s group was distributing embroidered brooches that say “Get out Trump” and caps carrying the words “Brazil belongs to Brazilians” at a pro-Lula rally in Brasília on Sunday.“We cannot accept the president of any foreign power trying to give orders to our country and our justice system – no matter how many weapons they have,” Resende said, adding: “It’s our business who we put in jail and who we don’t put in jail. It’s a domestic matter.”Ricardo Cappelli, a leftwing politician who Lula put in charge of Brasília’s security after January 2023’s rightwing riots, said he agreed with JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, who recently called Trump“a wannabe dictator”.“He behaves like a dictator – but he can’t get away with that here in Brazil. We’re a sovereign country and … no foreign agent will meddle in our country’s domestic affairs,” Cappelli said at the pro-government event in Brasília.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasDonald TrumpLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaRio de JaneiroThe far rightfeaturesShareReuse this content",

Can you identify a “monochrome mammal”? And what on earth is an “unfortunate ungulate”? They are all attempts by journalists – either elegant or absurd, depending on your outlook – to avoid repeating a noun already featured in an article. In the cases above, they are genuine journalistic attempts to describe fish fingers, a panda and a sheep stuck in a car.Spotting examples of eye-catching “second mentions” became a hobby for couple Juliet and Matthew Maguire. They began collecting examples after Juliet encountered them during her journalism training. Their interest grew into a social media account, which became a lively exchange of the distinctive descriptors.They have now compiled their favourite examples into a book – The Little Book of Second Mentions – which also examines their history, structure and mixed reputation.“It turned out there are a lot of like minded people who also enjoy seeing them,” said Juliet. “Sometimes journalists get in touch and say: ‘I’m writing a story about penguins and I can’t think of a second mention. Can anybody help?’ We get requests.”View image in fullscreenThe panda, or ‘monochrome mammal’, as it has been referred to previously.Photograph: gui00878/Getty ImagesThe married monographers say the art can arguably be traced back to Homer, who specialised in giving new nomenclature to his characters. Thus, Odysseus became “the great tactician” and Athena “the bright-eyed goddess”.Whether or not reporters were actually drawing on the Odyssey, the use of linguistic variations has been a regular feature in British newsrooms, where they are also known as “nobbly monsters”. The name supposedly originates from a journalist at The Sun newspaper tasked with writing up a crocodile attack.At the Guardian, subeditors sometimes refer to them as “povs” – a reference to “popular orange vegetables”, more commonly known as carrots.Matthew said that while causing amusement and irritation, appropriate second mentions could also enhance writing. “They can allude to the mood of an article,” he said. “WhenJustin Timberlake was arrestedrecently [after driving through a stop sign], his second mention was ‘the Cry Me A River singer’. It just fits the nature of the article perfectly.”The Maguires suspect some more outlandish examples were inserted by journalists simply hoping to enjoy a frisson of subversive joy in seeing their synonym of choice appear in print.They say animals often make for the best material. Beavers are dubbed “dam-building rodents”. Zebras have even become “striped equids”.The pair said pigs, pandas, giraffes and hedgehogs seem particularly prone to new descriptions. However, they were once disappointed to find an article that used the word “hedgehog” 27 times, without any mention of a “prickly animal”.View image in fullscreenFish fingers are a dinner-time favourite for many children, but how many know them as ‘cod digits’?Photograph: Jamie Grill/Getty ImagesFood also features heavily. Bananas have been renamed as “the energy-rich treat” – awkward, but preferable to salmon once being described as “the pink-fleshed crowd pleaser”.While the traditional tabloids may have been the main purveyors of the endearing epithets, second mentions are documented everywhere in the media. The Financial Times has described noodles as “the rapid foodstuff”, while pork pies have been referred to in the Telegraph as the “iconic meat and hot water crust pastry combo”.Over years of searching, the Maguires have acquired their own favourites. “If I ever see a fatter animal called a porker – particularly pigs – I just love it,” said Matthew. “The ‘errant porker’, ‘the runaway porker’, ‘the mischievous porker’ – anything porker related will get a laugh from me.”‘Existential crisis’: how Google’s shift to AI has upended the online news modelRead moreJuliet prefers those that elevate mundane items, such as rebranding a scotch egg a “porcine poultry hybrid”. “It sounds very grand for something that’s very simple and everyday,” she said.Opinion has always been split over whether second mentions enhance the reading experience or simply amount to lazy journalism, with writers lapsing into absurd phrases no one would ever use in everyday life.It was certainly frowned upon by HW and FG Fowler in their 1906 book The King’s English, who warned some variations “are not justified by expediency, and have consequently the air of cheap ornament”.While Juliet said it is a fine balance, she said the originality behind the mischievous missives should be applauded. “We see our book as more of a celebration of creativity,” she said. “There are people who might frown upon it, but we only see the joy.“The news is quite a serious place at the moment. So if this brings just a bit of levity and fun into people’s lives, then that’s what we’re aiming for.”Explore more on these topicsMediaJournalism booksnewsShareReuse this content",

Writer Clive Martin defined these graven images of the algorithm as being regionally specific, lurid, rowdy, funny and hedonistic. As a former member of Little Mix, a girl band put together via public vote on The X Factor, Jade Thirlwall might not seem like the likeliest bedfellow of this unhinged movement. But the South Shields pop star’s debut solo single, last year’s Angel of My Dreams, dodged focus-grouped smoothness to present a sublimely whacked-out, thoroughly British pop vision that felt like spinning through someone else’s for you page and realising they exist in a markedly different universe from your own.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for That’s Showbiz Baby!It started with a wound-up sample of Puppet on a String, exploded into a falsetto-spiked power ballad, then grinding electroclash paired with a withering rap, then sped through each mode again, variously at double and half speed. Its wild energy was fuelled by contradiction: Gucci glamour paired with lines such as “If I don’t win, I’m in the bin”. And while Jade dissed Syco and X Factor boss Simon Cowell (“selling my soul to a psycho”), the song’s vaulting soundclashes defying his bland vision of pop, Angel was also her love letter to the toxic paramour of fame: a status that might be easier to sustain with more conventional fare than whiplashing Sandie Shaw into growling synths. It was crackers and brilliant: no former boy- or girl-bander has come close to making such an arresting reintroduction since – and I mean this as the highest possible praise – Geri Halliwell burned bright through a short-lived fit of dadaist genius.Jade: Angel of My Dreams – videoIt set the bar extremely high for Jade’s long-awaited debut album, That’s Showbiz Baby! At least in its first half, ideas brawl for space and kick up thrilling novelty from the dust. The contrast between lavish balladry and techno wub on It Girl recalls Beyoncé’s brazen tapestry-like song constructions; the saucy, stalking Midnight Cowboy, about “givin’ you the Ginuwine”, imagines what it might have been like had her western-inspired Cowboy Carter been as much ribald, clubby fun as its predecessor Renaissance. The rhapsodic Fantasy is Jessy Lanza with budget, its lyrics about egging each other on to get freaky in bed mirrored by the song’s speeding momentum. FUFN (Fuck You For Now) is a dry ice-swathed Eurovision stomper that’s far more poised than Jade’s lyrics about the messiness of a drunken fight with a lover on a night out – but in its all-pistons-firing Gaga maximalism, it honours this particularly British display as a moment of high-diva drama.Not all the experiments land so well. Unconditional is a tribute to Jade’s mother, who has lupus. “I thought: how can I write a really sad song that we’re all going to want to shake our tits to?”Jade has said. It’s an admirable aim, but the lovely shift from New Order-style melancholy electronica to Moroder adrenaline would work better without the slamming blasts of electric guitar and the distracting “pew pew” synths. And Headache, about knowing you’re sometimes a massive pain in the arse to your long-suffering partner, proves its point too effectively in its racket of thumping bass and dentist-drill vocals.‘I have a daily battle with myself not to go on Ozempic’: Jade Thirlwall on anorexia, protest in pop and life after Little MixRead moreIf there’s a theme amid the madness, it’s finding the freedom to be exactly yourself – at work, in relationships, in bed. Jade’s lyrics are spiked with veryher, very British moments without overdoing it: Midnight Cowboy has the excellent triptych, “I’m a real wild bitch, yeah I’m mental / I’m the ride of your life, not a rental / I’m the editor, call meMr Enninful.” And she nails some really lovely specific sentiments. Plastic Box channels Robyn’s pained electropop solitude as Jade struggles with the knowledge that her partner had relationships that came before her – she knows it’s irrational, but still honours those very real anxieties with solemn beauty. “Can I have your heart in a plastic box?” she asks. “Never used, fully clean, untouched / Like I’m the only one you’ve ever loved.” Disingenuousness gets short shrift: Natural at Disaster almost certainly reads former Little Mix bandmate Jesy Nelson her rights, after she burned through several metric tons of goodwill witha racially insensitive solo debutand kept slating her ex-bandmates for headlines. “‘Cos you were all snakes no ladders / You’re happiest when you make me sadder,” Jade sings, the delicate verses and dramatic, gospel-spliced choruses echoing Billie Eilish’s deconstructed classicism.The force of Jade’s presence on these songs makes it disappointing when she disappears from view. Self-Saboteur is a bit Robyn, a bit Carly; Lip Service has a nice synaptic tingle but could be by anyone from Normani to Rihanna pre-Anti. Before You Break My Heart is chunky disco based around a Supremes sample that seems like a dated vestige of the sample-pop wave from a few years ago; Silent Disco channels Midnights-era Taylor Swift, its lyrical intimacy amid gauzy synths conveying the sense of a couple shutting out the world in a crowded room.It’s in these moments that the album’s title seems like a shrug:hey, them’s the breaks when you need to be playlisted on Capital FM. But in its most bravura moments, That’s Showbiz Baby! sounds Jade holding a pose breathless in the spotlight after a dazzling turn, no idea how she quite pulled it off, letting pretenders know how it’s done.Explore more on these topicsMusicLittle MixPop and rockThe X FactorreviewsShareReuse this content",

The first is his epic biopic starring Austin Butler and now he has unleashed another called EPiC:Elvis Presleyin Concert, remixing archival material with never-before-seen footage from the singer’s residency in Las Vegas. What’s remarkable about them both, apart from the director’s obvious affinity for his subject’s showmanship, is his refusal across so many hours of jiggling and swivelling to meaningfully hold Elvis to account.California Schemin’ review – James McAvoy’s directorial debut is an unlikely rap taleRead moreLuhrmann’s Oscar-nominated 2022 film acknowledged Elvis’s cultural appropriation: how his phenomenal success owed so much to the R&B, gospel and rock he grew up around and the racist institutions that put him on a pedestal while holding down the Black artists that birthed and gave that music its soul. The movie also painted Elvis as a bleeding heart for the Black community, projecting so much torment on the crooner over the injustices he witnessed, despite his refusal to say anything publicly – for the community he benefitted from – during the civil rights era. It was all the craven and exploitative Colonel Tom Parker’s fault, according to Luhrmann’s Elvis, depicting the leery and controlling manager (played by Tom Hanks) as the reason for the singer’s strict silence, and the root of so many sins.That same crafty apologia continues in EPiC, which features a moment when a journalist questions Elvis on his thoughts as the Vietnam war was raging. “I’m just an entertainer,” Elvis responds, with Luhrmann carefully pointing out that Tom Parker is always lurking nearby. When pressed further about expressing his feelings, Elvis continues, “I can’t even say that.”Luhrmann emphasizes the “I can’t,” replaying those words like a haunting echo to fill the silence, as if drilling down on the idea that Elvis was a victim of his own circumstance. Luhrmann even interjects that moment over footage of Elvis performing the bleeding-heart ballad about a child raised in hardship, In The Ghetto, as if that song hints at where the singer’s heart was at. It’s a slick choice, stacking the deck in Elvis’s favour and giving him the benefit of the doubt.Moments like this, where Luhrmann quickly dispenses with the unflattering when it comes to Elvis’s biography, are a thorn in this otherwise boisterous celebration’s side – though not enough to prevent fans at the world premiere in Toronto from getting up and dancing in the aisles during the big numbers like Burning Love.Elvis is of course a tailor-made subject for Luhrmann, the Moulin Rouge director’s trademark bombast and razzle dazzle so in tune with the singer’s rattle and roll, which comes through in both his biopic and now EPiC. The latter, Luhrmann says, is neither a documentary nor a concert film. Actually, it’s pretty much both of those things, but with an obvious slant, which the director accounts for by explaining “the storyteller is Elvis himself”. There are no talking heads here, just excerpts from Elvis’s interviews offering a running commentary over unearthed footage that shows off what an electric performer he was, even during a 70s Las Vegas residency when some may assume he was washed up.Elvis is a hypnotic stage presence, even when just mumbling off sounds with his deep baritone while swiveling his hips, the dexterity in his voice unhindered by antics like swallowing a mic whole. The larger than life spectacle of his performances, backed by an all white band while his Black backup singers remain off to the side, are nicely tempered by Elvis’s easy-going, tenderly flippant charm. It’s just as entertaining watching him lay on his back and keep the audience hanging off his pillowtalk as it is watching his mesmerizing seizure-like moves. Luhrmann even slows down his typically aggressive editing styles to take it all in, only revving things up by cutting to different angles when in tempo with his king.The director gets most of his kaleidoscopic visual kinks off in the blistering prologue, when he sets the stage for the Vegas shows by frenetically recapping Elvis’s life and career up to that point. Your favourite photo collage and TikTok remix apps have nothing on everything Luhrmann throws at the screen when the movie covers Elvis’s hits, his run-ins with the law for obscenity, his Korean War years and the Hollywood career that made him feel alienated from his own popular image.Tellingly, Priscilla Presley is not mentioned or seen in those highlights. She of course was the subject of Sofia Coppola’s 2023 film Priscilla, which was released the year after Luhrmann’s Elvis. Coppola’s film made obvious how much of the singer’s grooming and abusive behaviour Luhrmann conveniently swept under the rug in his adulatory biopic.That continues in EPiC. Priscilla, and her baby daughter Lisa Marie, are glimpsed for mere seconds after the one-hour mark in archival footage. Their happy times briefly but strategically deployed alongside footage of Elvis performing his mournful rendition of Always On My Mind, reaching for a sentimentality that – genuine or not – feels craven and unearned in this movie.EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert is screening at the Toronto Film Festival and will be released at a later dateExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewElvis PresleyBaz LuhrmannDocumentary filmsToronto film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content",

Writer-director Rian Johnson’s 2019 whodunnit brought us back to the starry, slippery fun of the 70s and 80s, when films like this would be a dime a dozen and it was a surprise hit, making almost eight times its budget at the global box office. While Kenneth Branagh had seen commercial success already with his Poirot revival two years prior, his retreads felt too musty, and the actor-director too miscast, for the genre to truly feel like it was entering an exciting new period.Fuze review – twisty London-set heist thriller should have stolen some personalityRead moreJohnson’s threequel, Wake Up Dead Man, is the second as part of his Netflix deal (one that cost an estimated $450m) and arrives as the whodunnit genre has found itself close to over-saturation on both big but mostly small screen. Yet as many murders as there might have now been inbuildingsorresidencesinvolvingcouplesandstrangersof questionable perfection, nothing has quite captured that same sense of kicky, sharp-witted fun that Johnson had shared with us way back when. His first Knives Out film premiered at the Toronto film festival to one of the most buzzed audience reactions I can remember, a thrill I was able to feel once again as he returned to unveil his latest chapter, a rip-roaring return to form that shows the series to be confidently back on track and heading somewhere with plenty more places to go on the way.In his introduction, Johnson spoke of the versatility within the whodunnit genre and while this is another assemblage of famous names all facing suspicion from Daniel Craig’s master detective Benoit Blanc again, he told us this one would be a gothic tale with inspiration from Edgar Allen Poe and John Dickson Carr, the stormier dark to Glass Onion’s sunshiney light.Craig’s second in command is played this time by Josh O’Connor, one of the few recent indie breakouts to find an equally convincing career in more mainstream fare, who stars as Jud, a boxer-turned-priest being handed a new position underneath a controversial small town priest, played byJosh Brolin. His flock is faithful despite his cruel ways and Jud finds himself to be the rare outlier who can’t find anything worth praising. So when he’s killed in a baffling manner, Jud is the main suspect and he has to work with Benoit to find out the truth behind a murder that seems unsolvable.O’Connor is joined by new recruitsKerry Washington, Glenn Close, Cailee Spaeny, Mila Kunis, Andrew Scott, Daryl McCormack and Jeremy Renner, thankfully not playing himself after his fictional hot sauce made for one of Glass Onion’s least amusing pop culture jokes.What had spoiled the fun of the last one for me, and limited its rewatchability, was the feeling that Johnson had spent too much time reading the internet while he wrote it, buoyed by the positive reaction to the first film and overdosing on trending gimmickry, relying on humour designed to appeal to a terminally online audience (as a Covid film, that’ssomewhatforgivable). Strangely what seems to have fixed the third film is the very same practice but this time it feels like he has been focusing on the bad rather than good response to the second. Gone is the excess, the cameos, the smugness, everything that felt like a distraction and instead, all of that effort has been redirected to the basics of storytelling. Not that the plot here is anything close to basic, it’s as twisty and stuffed with second and third guessing as one would want but its charmingly convoluted nature feels as elegantly composed as it felt in the original, building to a finale that leaves us with a satisfied smile.In Knives Out, Johnson’s online sensibility was also apparent but it was sparingly used in a smarter way to modernise an old-fashioned template. It’s used considerably more here but in ways that feel similarly thought through. Without clumsily making it the Knives Out film we need right now, Johnson jabs at the growing religious hypocrisy of the far right and how blind faith is warped to uphold figures too focused on the selfishness of power to do any real good. The obvious shadow of Trump looms over Brolin’s vile and destructive head of parish, whose double standards and hateful rhetoric do nothing to quell the unquestioning support of his followers. We have more than enough examples of blunt attacks on a beyond parody president mostly serving to make the left look self-satisfied and impotent and while to those with both ears open, Johnson’s prods are not hard to decipher, they’re embedded in a way that also feels rooted in plot. This time, his knives are out toward bigots, charlatans, opportunists and YouTubers, targets that make it easy for us to cheer when he draws blood.Craig is as mercifully re-energised as Johnson, after the risk of falling into parody in Glass Onion, the script finding new ways to add depth and discovery to the character and while not all of the new cast members have enough time to shine (Spaeny feels particularly shortchanged), there are no bum notes here with Close and Washington having the most fun aside from a standout O’Connor whose leading man status is now fully confirmed.Set in upstate New York but filmed in the UK, there are parts of the film that often feel a little too set-based and artificial, not exactly cursed with theNetflixsheen but missing a certain old studio-level authenticity. It’s a minor complaint when the streamer is footing the bill for a series that’s really found its footing again, a wealth of fun to be had in ways that are constantly surprising, a franchise fully woken up.Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released in cinemas on 26 November and on Netflix on 12 DecemberExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalDaniel CraigFestivalsGlenn CloseJosh BrolinJosh O'ConnorreviewsShareReuse this content",

Asurvey by the Gym Group, which operates hundreds of gyms across the UK, found 22% of 18- to 24-year-olds spend more than £50 a month on fitness-related memberships and activities, 18% prioritise spending on health and fitness instead of socialising, while 16% place it above going to pubs or restaurants.Willis says he has seen a “big shift” among his friends, who go out to dinner less and go to “nicer” gyms instead which, as well as featuring fully kitted gyms and fitness classes, include saunas and steam rooms, massage guns and hydrotherapy pools. “It’s more than a gym,” says Willis. “I go and relax there; I work from there all the time. There’s other stuff, too, like yoga and sound-bath meditation.”The gym has also served as a form of escape from house-sharing. At one point, Willis was living with six people, in a house that had a mouse infestation and only two showers. Damp towels were scattered across the bathroom floor and the shower was crusted with limescale. As a result, he never showered at home. “It was really horrible. Then I’d go to Third Space and the concierge would know my name and give me a fluffy towel when I walked in. If they knew what my apartment was like at the time, they probably would have cancelled my membership,” he jokes.View image in fullscreenOn reflection … the male changing room at the Surrenne gym in Belgravia.Third Space is kitted out with irons, starch spray and even, for an additional cost, a dry-cleaning service. “I don’t own an iron so, if I needed to iron something, I would cycle to the gym and do it there,” says Willis. His use of the gym’s facilities has kept other costs low. He rarely buys toiletries, using the expensive products available in the changing rooms instead, and even though he now lives alone, he still only has a shower at home about once a month.The rise of young gym devotees like Willis mean the luxury gym business is booming. Third Space – which has expanded its number of clubs from one in 2001 to 13 in 2025, with more on the way – saw consumer spending in its gyms rise by 41.1% between December 2023 and December 2024, according to the business consultancy firmCACI. Other chains – including Third Space’s suburban competitor, David Lloyd, where memberships for its flagship locations can set you back £150 a month or more – have also seen soaring growth. Asurvey by UKActive, the trade body that represents most of Britain’s fitness operators, found thatgen Zis the key demographic driving the record numbers of Britons going to the gym.View image in fullscreen‘A new paradigm for wellbeing’ … the Tracy Anderson studio at the Surrenne gym in Belgravia.The gyms themselves are also becoming more luxurious. AtLanserhof, the gym at the Arts Club in Mayfair, memberships start at £6,500 a year. Surrenne in Belgravia, central London, charges £10,000 a year for membership, plus a £5,000 joining fee (patrons will apparently experience a “new paradigm for wellbeing”). CPASE in Cheshire, which has beendescribedby Tatler as a “gym more luxurious than any other”, offers “oxygen-enriched air” in its “revolutionary fitness playground” for nearly £4,000 a year. A membership for the fitness facility at Cliveden House, the grand Berkshire manor that was the site of the Profumo affair, will set you back nearly £6,000 a year.View image in fullscreenBreathe easy … a hyperbaric chamber treatment room at the Surrenne gym.Niyi Akinseye has been training in the gym for more than 10 years.“It began with me being an overweight and uncomfortable 15-year-old,” he says. “I was very conscious about the way I looked.” The 26-year-old, who works as a regional project lead at a human rights charity, is planning to make a career switch next month to become a full-time fitness coach.He goes to GymBox, which wascalledone of London’s best luxury gyms by Esquire in 2023. After his membership, £95 a month, and other classes and equipment, Akinseye says he spends about £250 a month on fitness, or 10% of his take-home pay. Akinseye says he has met friends “with similar goals and passions”, and affluent clients for his burgeoning fitness-coaching services. “The more I pay for the gym, the better opportunities I’ve found,” he says.After being greeted by the receptionist, then handed a fresh towel, with the knowledge a sauna session is just around the corner, he says he “feels happy and like I’m ready to do my work”. He calls fitness a “form of therapy – there’s something very therapeutic about moving your body and finding something you can channel your emotions into”.View image in fullscreenFine dining … the cafe at the Surrenne gym in Belgravia.It is no secret that young people, including gen Z, face big challenges. Akinseye says this was partly why he became interested in fitness. “Seeing the results was very satisfying in a world where there are lots of uncertainties for young people,” he says. “A job isn’t guaranteed in this world, as it perhaps was for previous generations.” Having a gym membership, he says, has helped give him a sense of stability.Exercise classes have also become more popular with young people. Nishka Parekh, who lives in London, spends about £75 a month on various classes, including pilates. For the 24-year-old marketing manager, fitness is “definitely a social activity”. She says: “Sometimes, me and my friends would plan to go to a workout class on a Friday before going to the pub.”While she hasn’t gone fully teetotal like many other people her age, Parekh says it’s nice to do something social that “doesn’t revolve around drinking and is better for your health”, physically and mentally. “Fitness definitely helps improve my mental health,” says Parekh. “If I’m having a really rough day at work, or a tough time in general, going to an exercise class or the gym always makes me feel a lot better.”Willis feels similarly. “I get more out of it outside of fitness,” he says. “The mental health benefits of going to a nice gym are massive, because you’re surrounded by people who are also more invested in their fitness.”‘Crafts are like medicine!’: Gen Z and the rapid rise of cosy hobbiesRead moreUnlike the grotty sweatboxes that once dominated the market (and where many sped through their workouts, eager to leave as soon as possible), luxury gyms are working incredibly hard to keep clients there as long as possible. Third Space’s CEO, Colin Waggett, hassaidits members should “get the same sort of experience [in our clubs] as in a Firmdale hotel” – referring to the boutique hotel chain. On top of high-end fitness equipment, many Third Space clubs have dedicated workspaces, cafes and wellness centres. In its flagship Canary Wharf branch, members can have botox (starting at £189 for one area) or a Brazilian lymphatic drainage massage (£95 for a 50-minute session).At David Lloyd, as part of a £500m investment in its clubs, the firmannouncedearlier this year that it was going to add workspaces and spa retreats to a number of locations, to create clubs that, the company says, are places for “me-time, together-time, work, rest and playtime”.Willis says scaling back his fitness spending, especially axing his Third Space membership and swapping to a cheaper alternative, is “out of the question”. “I haven’t really thought about moving to a cheaper gym; it’s just never going to be the same,” he says. “I’d probably go once, say: ‘I don’t want to stay here any more,’ and leave.”Explore more on these topicsFitnessHealth & wellbeingHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content",

Later photograph: Simon Webb. Styling: Andie Redman. Hair/makeup: Alison Dunwell. Archive photograph: courtesy of Katherine KellyBorn in 1979 in Barnsley, Yorkshire, Katherine Kelly studied at Rada before beginning her career with the Royal Shakespeare Company and going on to perform at the National Theatre and Manchester’s Royal Exchange. Her first major television role came in 2006, when she joined Coronation Street as Becky McDonald, a part she played until 2012. Since then she has appeared in The Night Manager, Gentleman Jack, Mr Bates vs The Post Office and Inside No 9. She stars inIn Flight, available now on Channel 4.This is a very typical image of meaged four. I spent most of my preschool life with a towel on my head. It was a replacement for the long hair I so desperately wanted.I’m the eldest of four; my two brothers and I were born within four years of each other. Because my mum is a very practical Yorkshire woman who hates waste, she bought boys’ coats for me so that they could be handed down. By the same token, she wouldn’t let me grow long, flowing hair. She said she didn’t have time for it – which, to be fair, was true. I was so dedicated to the pretend hair, I put ribbons in it and made them into pigtails.Until I hit double figures, I was a very quiet child. I spent a lot of time in adult company and was very mature for my age. I wasn’t shy but I was like a sponge – I watched, took it all in, then it all came out in play. Even though I am very young in this picture, I can tell by how I’m ironing that skirt that I’m deep in character; “the busy mother”.At this age I’d get changed three times a day using clothes from the fancy dress box. I had a rural upbringing: always on my bike, running around in fields or building dens out of all the haystacks, but I’d always add a layer of imagination to the situation. My brothers and I would be playing football and I’d go, “Right, so let’s imagine we’re this kind of team, and your name’s this, and your name’s that.” They’d reply, “Or, let’s just play football?”Even though I was quite unusual, I managed to fit in and had loads of friends. Still, I had this deep suspicion about myself. Maybe it was my family. Most people probably think their family is different, but mine really were. There was a bohemian-ness to my house. Before they had kids, my parents were club singers, and even after we were born they were night owls. We didn’t have much routine. The Kellys were that family who were always late. Music was on everywhere all the time – my dad plays everything, all self-taught; so do my brothers. They would think nothing of eating dinner, then getting the instruments out. My friends were very accepting of me being a bit different, but I remember feeling very embarrassed when they came to mine and my dad was trying to get them to join in with an old Irish ballad they’d never heard of. Aside from the sociable spirit, my dad was a coalminer and we had that Yorkshire work ethic. A very practical, down-to-earth attitude; an interesting blend.I’d rather take a risk and do something interesting so I can see where it lands, instead of being beige and predictableAt high school, when my hormones kicked in, I became a new person. I was very outward and good fun, all for the craic. My parents were invested in applauding everything we did. They did amateur dramatics and took us to watch rehearsals or performances because they didn’t have babysitters. My siblings and I were really embraced by the community there. When I was nine, Mum asked me if I’d like to be in one of the musicals in the chorus. The director was Simon Armitage’s father, Peter. I never had some epiphany that acting was my destiny. Opportunities just presented themselves. I walked through one door and another opened.When I was 18I started applying for drama schools and I got into Rada. I wasn’t nervous at the audition as I was prepared for them to say no. Acting was something I enjoyed and I would not stop if I didn’t get in. If I could pay my mortgage doing it – what a bonus.When I finished at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2005, I found myself surrounded by exciting prospects – from the RSC asking me back for the next season to auditions at different theatres. But metamorphosis is so important to me, and I remember saying to my agent, “I should probably do a bit more telly.” My biggest ambition has always been to play the widest variety of characters I can, and I was worried I was being put in a lane. Miraculously, my agent called and said, “There’s this character in Coronation Street; she’s only in it for six episodes. What do you think?” I can’t bear snobbery – I don’t regard art as high brow or low brow – so I said, “Of course I want to audition!” Thankfully, I got it, and I did the six episodes, which turned into years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The idea of playing the same character for that long felt unbearable. How wrong I’d have been. The writers took Becky McDonald on such a journey she was almost unrecognisable by the end – she was the seven deadly sins rolled into one. I left just as things risked becoming repetitive, and went back to theatre. They greeted me with, “Hello again! Where’ve you been?” Even now, the stage is the great love of my life.Sam Ryder looks back: ‘I thought I should put a smile on my face, no matter how I felt’Read moreHave I ever faced any challengesin my career? If I said yes, I would be lying. There’s no such thing as failure in art, I don’t think. Of course, not every part I’ve played has been a success, but I enjoy the artists that “fail” – the ones that tread the line – because that’s what’s captivating. I’d rather take the risk and try to do something interesting so I can see where it lands, instead of being beige and predictable.In Alice in Wonderland the Cheshire Cat says, “We’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad. You must be, or you wouldn’t be here.” When I look at the girl in the photo, I realise how lucky I was to find the career I ended up in – to meet others with the same intense imagination. Throughout my childhood, mine felt in overdrive compared with everyone my age in the small town I grew up in. It was too much for them, and at times too much for me. Back then I had to rein it in a little. I mean, as a busy mother, you have to go to the shops sometimes, no matter what your hair looks like.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyDramaTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content",

It’s an important attempt to do justice to a deeply dark taleRachel AroestiSun 7 Sep 2025 17.00 EDTShareWhen exactly is true crime a force for good? It’s a question we should probably ask ourselves every single time we consume something in this lurid and inevitably exploitative genre. Death of a Showjumper is, in many ways, a standardly sensationalised account of a young woman’s murder: paced for maximum dramatic intensity; details judiciously withheld to spin the most compulsively watchable yarn. But its broader subject matter – the epidemic ofviolence against women, and the ways such abuse is silenced, minimised and weaponised against the victims themselves – is one of the few that can justify the existence of a series like this.It’s easy to feel cynical at first. Visually stunning and thematically arresting, Death of a Showjumper’s backdrop is tailor-made for a TV crime drama. It’s set amid the equestrian community of Northern Ireland, and we are transported to a place brimming with bucolic beauty as well as “secrets and silence”. The lifestyle is familiar but subtly alien: horses are ubiquitous and the associated culture not reserved for toffs – the hunt is an adrenaline sport for skilled riders. And 21-year-old Katie Simpson was one.Simpson’s world revolved around horses: this three-part documentary portrays her as a hard worker with huge potential and an irreverent sense of humour (she named her horse Satan). But in August 2020, Simpson’s friends and family were told she had hanged herself from a banister; she died in hospital six days later. To say they were baffled by the circumstances of her death is an understatement. For the journalist Tanya Fowles, this apparent suicide was more than just out of character – it was deeply suspicious.A veteran court reporter who had known Simpson since she was a child, Fowles is one hero of this story. When she found out who had discovered the body, alarm bells grew louder: it was Jonathan Cresswell, the perpetrator of one of the most disturbing domestic abuse cases she had ever covered. He was also the partner of Simpson’s sister; the three of them lived together.When Fowles contacted the police with her concerns, they dismissed her as a nuisance. So she phoned detective sergeant James Brannigan – the other hero here – who Fowles remembered had once cracked a domestic abuse murder without a body. The pair’s pursuit of justice in the face of authorities who were ambivalent at best (Brannigan also met with significant resistance from colleagues) is the stuff of bleak cop drama that somehow ends up restoring your faith in humanity. Cresswell was chillingly close to getting away with murder; Brannigan put him on trial against all the odds, risking his own career in the process.This strand of the story may be TV-friendly, but the rest is mired in almost inconceivable darkness. We get a lengthy account from Cresswell’s ex-girlfriend Abigail Lyle – now a dressage rider who represented Ireland in the 2024 Olympics – of the abuse she suffered at his hands. It proves that Cresswell was a depraved and dangerous monster. But, after his release from a brief stint in prison, locals threw a party for him, while Lyle was ostracised. The community’s response was, by the sounds of it, a combination of denial and contempt for anyone accusing a charming man of heinous violence. Many were under Cresswell’s spell. Jill Robinson, another ex-girlfriend, is interviewed extensively here; she was one of three women eventually convicted of perverting the course of justice or withholding information, contributing to the cover-up of Simpson’s murder. However poorly judged Robinson’s behaviour was – she claims she had no idea how Simpson died – it is clear she was one of Cresswell’s victims too.Death of a Showjumper concludes amid a cloud of hopelessness. Due to events not revealed until the final episode, there are numerous aspects of this crime that will never be uncovered. Meanwhile, Brannigan quit his job owing to his frustrations with the case and the intimidation he experienced in the police during his investigations. More generally, the programme hammers home how widely tolerated domestic violence remains. (It partly attributes this to the rural, insular area Cresswell and Simpson were from, but the proper context is a merciless global patriarchy, not the equestrian community of County Armagh.)There is a fine line between using a harrowing crime to create entertainment, and using entertainment to exact some semblance of justice. Death of a Showjumper may reel in viewers using a litany of true-crime tricks of the trade, but it is a valuable endeavour in itself. This is a series made propulsive and gripping by teasing the prospect of Cresswell finally paying for his crimes. By telling Simpson’s story as comprehensively as possible, it ends up being the closest we’ll ever get.Death of a Showjumper aired on Sky Documentaries and is on NowIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Among midday pints, onstage pyrotechnics and a huge stand advertising the wonders of investing in gold, a party led by those bumptious public schoolboys Nigel Farage and Richard Tice was suddenly rejoicing in the departure of British politics’ most prominent working-class woman. The news, moreover, only boosted an atmosphere of energy and optimism, laced with a delighted surprise at what might be the UK’s defining political fact. We all know it: this new party has a tiny handful of MPs, no meaningful policy platform and a worldview thatconstantly blurs into conspiracy theory, but Reform UK is on course to either form or lead the next British government.There are lots of reasons for that, and most of them cast very harsh light on the failings ofKeir Starmerand his allies. As toxic as its messages always are, Reform has vivid and simple stories – about immigration, diversity and the supposedly endless failings of the two traditional parties. Its leading figures instinctively understand that politics has long since turned raw and primary-coloured. And it uses its complete inexperience of power as an advantage: the only answer to the UK’s inertia and failure, it says, is to hand the keys to untried outsiders.Whether we like it or not, Farage is also the embodiment of the transformation of politics by celebrity culture, a change massively accelerated by the dominance of social media. Jargon-heavy, technocratic, man-in-a-suit politics suits neither our modern means of communication, nor a world that seems to be constantly gripped by noisy chaos. Instead, success increasingly requires an altogether more performative, authentic – or, in his case, faux-authentic – style of leadership, and the ability to confidently rise above the din and make yourself heard.With all that in mind, look at the Starmer government and where the events of the past few days leave it. Rayner was hardly a political wizard, but until she was swamped by stories about stamp duty and seaside flats, she was probably the only Labour high-up who brought a visibly human element to the business of government, and could talk movingly about life at the sharp end. Her policy priorities – not least her energeticchampioning of social housing– were focused on exactly the parts of the electorate to whom Farage most powerfully speaks. Moreover, she was at least a modest counterweight to the power wielded by Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney – who has seized the opportunity provided by her resignation for a reshuffle, and seemingly encouraged Starmer to lean even further into the blank, technocratic approach that has defined this government from the start.At cabinet level, there has been a frenzy of job swapping, but no sense of any rethink. We will see what transpires at Labour’s conference, but the PM and his colleagues still seem to be spurning narratives and stories in favour of the vapid idea that power can be reduced to a model of “delivery” that shows no real signs of actually delivering anything. If you want an instant sense of how little this has to offer, look again at the videoStarmer put outa few days before the Rayner crisis: 35 tedious seconds in which he talks about getting “all the No 10 staff together” and “marching forward to the next phase of government”. The resulting feeling is all too familiar: he looks like a man standing close to a burning house, promising a set of new shelves and a couple of nice rugs.1:38'That was just the beginning': Reform UK conference arrives in Birmingham – videoMeanwhile, some of the biggest questions about what he and his colleagues are doing centre on the government’s approach to what Farage thinks is his strongest ground. The new home secretary is the Birmingham MP Shabana Mahmood – who,we are told, will intensify the government’s cold, punitive rhetoric on asylum, immigration and so-called small boats. Clearly, the government needs to sort out the chaos in the asylum system, and it should sometimes talk – carefully – about the challenges of integration. But as evidenced by Starmer’s “island of strangers” speech, it is actually floundering into much more dangerous political spaces, again and again.For yet more proof, go back only a fortnight, to thespeech Farage gave about mass deportations, paying the Taliban to take back people who come here from Afghanistan, and yet another suggestion that the UK is on the brink of social collapse. Starmer’s spokespersondeclined to criticise any of it. Labour, in other words, does not want to contest his most fundamental ideas, nor point out how dangerous they are; indeed, its instinct is to blankly validate them. The result: Reform UK is not just riding high thanks to Farage’s shamelessness and skill. Amazingly, Labour is actively helping.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the real crisis for Starmer may have only just begun | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreWhich brings us to the awful urgency of this moment. If Reform UK succeeds in taking power, what does anyone think will happen to state education, our systems of justice, crime and punishment, or the BBC? What will everyday life feel like amid Farage’s promised mass deportations? If you woke up a couple of weeks ago and found your neighbourhood suddenly covered in flags (note thepathetic response of Yvette Cooper, the-then home secretary: “Oh put ’em up anywhere. I would put them up anywhere”), imagine the people who glory in that kind of sectarian territory-marking running the country. Then watch Starmer in action, and ask yourself: does he understand what’s at stake here?Of course, there is nothing easy about any of this: to shout “be bold” and deny the gravity of the government’s predicament would be as crass as many of its own pronouncements. But deep uncertainties nag away, and Rayner’s exit makes them even more pressing. In a new political age, does the prime minister understand what leadership really involves? And even if he does, can he actually provide it?Those concerns can be put another way, which cuts straight to the ice-cold political winds that I felt whirling around Birmingham. The idea that we are at one of the gravest moments in our peacetime history might sound melodramatic, but it has to be confronted. And so does a question that will sooner or later become unavoidable: does Starmer’s presence at the top help or hinder the onward march of the darkest forces to have ever been so close to taking control?John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionAngela RaynerKeir StarmerShabana MahmoodReform UKNigel FarageRichard TicecommentShareReuse this content",

Maybe Swift is on to somethingSun 7 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 7 Sep 2025 10.08 EDTShareHow do you like your men? Yes,obviously, we shouldn’t be dismissively taxonomising a whole gender like boxed Barbies. But in the era oftradwivesandnu-gen gold diggers, in which the manosphere remains alive and kick(box)ing, telling teenage boys lies about women, I reckon there’s a way to go before we reach reductive objectification parity. Does that make it OK? No. Am I going to do it anyway? Yes, a bit.So, returning to the question, my answer is “like my coffee”: small, strong, dark and highly over-stimulating, brewed by my sister’s boyfriend in Scarborough … No, hang on, this is falling apart. Regardless, my ideal man is wildly at odds with the zeitgeist and my husband needs to punch up his protein intake and stop having opinions, because theNew York Timesclaims a new dream man has dropped and he’s “beefy, placid and … politically ambiguous”.What do we know about the nouveau-neutral hunk? Well, apart from the essential 1:1 neck-to-head ratio and thighs like sequoias, he’s “sweetly naive, simple, almost oafish … unfazed by the byzantine requirements of modern masculinity, largely because he doesn’t know or care that they exist”. Grazia agrees, issuing an appreciation of what it is calling the “Woke Jock”: “As unremittingly blokey as he’s gentle”, the Woke Jock is comfortable with vulnerability and happy to be out-earned.Speaking of out-earning, the original placid beefcake – and the reason, surely, the archetype has merited NYT appraisal – is Mr Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce. I refuse to recognise any under-50 male celebrities – my tiny blow against the patriarchy – so I had to cram the various Chrises, Kelces and Hemsworths to understand this phenomenon, but having done the (bro-appropriate) heavy lifting, I like what I see with Kelce. Built like Oak Furnitureland’s XXL wardrobe aisle, seemingly light on ego despite excelling at whatever a “tight end” does in American football, and touchingly delighted when Swift uses polysyllabic words, Kelce seems comfortable in his own skin in a way that’s very winning. Others include Channing Tatum (lauded for cheerfullytelling a storyabout getting educated on director AkiraKurosawa by a video store employee) and evolved man-mountainJason Momoa, who has declared: “I embrace the feminine side and also feel like I am OK to be vulnerable.”This is something of a turnaround. You may recall 2024’s “hot rat summer” (I paraphrase) when slight, rodenty men became pin-ups; or our recent collective yearning for the rumpled, thoughtful rizz of“daddy” Pedro Pascal. And we’re still laughing at an entirely different 2025 archetype: theperformative male. If you were living under a rock all summer (enviable), let me explain: the much-satirised, tote bag-toting, ostentatiously DavidFoster Wallace-reading, hojicha-drinking, self-proclaimed feminist performative male is the anti-benign meathead. An over- rather than under-thinker, he’s self-aware to a fault, fashioning himself into what he believes women want – purely, the theory goes, to get into their pants.But apparently women want something quite different now. They’re concluding that Swift is right, as she is about many things: that cartoonish muscles and the ability to bench-press a grizzly bear can make for a partner who wears his masculinity lightly, with an identity that isn’t threatened by a successful, independent woman. That not having strong opinions means a restful absence of mansplaining.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMenTaylor SwiftTravis KelceDatingChanning TatumcommentShareReuse this content",

Narendra Modi is the latest world leader to learn this lesson the hard way. Wooing his “true friend” in the White House, India’s authoritarian prime minister thought he’d conquered Trump’s inconstant heart. The two men hit peak pals in 2019, holding hands at a “Howdy Modi” rally in Texas. But it’s allgone pear-shapedthanks to Trump’s tariffs and dalliance with Pakistan. Like a jilted lover on the rebound, Modi shamelesslythrew himselfat Vladimir Putin in China last week. Don and Narendra! It’s over! Although, to be honest, it always felt a little shallow.Other suitors for Trump’s slippery hand have suffered similar heartbreak. France’s Emmanuel Macron turned on the charm, feting him at the grand reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. But Trump cruelly dumped him after they argued over Gaza,calling hima publicity-seeker who “always gets it wrong”. The EU’s Ursula von der Leyen, desperate for a tete-a-tete, flew to Trump’s Scottish golf course to pay court. Result: perhaps the most humiliating,lopsided trade dealsince imperial Britain’s 19th-century “unequal treaties” with Peking’s dragon throne.The list of broken pledges and dashed hopes is lengthy. Relationships between states normally pivot on power, policy and strategic interests. But with faithless, fickle Trump, it’s always personal – and impermanent. Disconcertingly, he told Mexico’s impressive president,Claudia Sheinbaum, that he “likes her very much” – then threatened to invade her country, ostensibly in pursuit of drug cartels. Leaders fromCanada, Germany, Japan, South Korea and South Africa have all attempted to ingratiate themselves, to varying degrees. They still haven’t fared well.All this should set red lights flashing for Britain’s Keir Starmer ahead of Trump’s state visit in 10 days’ time. The prime minister’sunedifying Trump-whisperer acthas produced little benefit to date, at high reputational cost. Starmer apparently believes his handling of the US relationship is a highlight of his first year in office. Yet Trump ignores his Gaza ceasefire pleas and opposes UK recognition of a Palestinian state. He hugely boosted Putin, Britain’s nemesis, with his half-baked Alaska summit. US security guarantees for postwar Ukraine are more mirage than reality. His steel tariffs and protectionist policiescontinue to hurt UK workers.His second state visit is an appalling prospect. The honour is utterly undeserved. It’s obvious what Trump will gain: aroyal endorsement, a chance to play at being King Donald, a privileged platform from which to deliver his corrosive, divisive populist-nationalist diatribes at a moment of considerable social fragility in the US and UK. Polls suggest many Britons strongly oppose the visit; andmost don’t trust the US.So what Starmer thinks he will gain is a mystery. The fleeting goodwill of a would-be dictator who isdismantling US democracyand wrecking the global laws-based order championed by the UK is a poor return.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump holds up a photograph Putin gave him in the White House on 22 August 2025.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesAs he demands homage from abject subjects, this spectacle will confirm the UK in the eyes of the world as a lackey state, afraid to stand up for its values. Starmer’s government is now so morally confused that it refuses to acknowledge that Israel, fully backed by Trump,is committing genocidein Gaza, while at the same time making the wearing of apro-Palestine T-shirt a terroristact. The Trump travesty will be an embarrassment, signalling a further descent into colonial subservience. As next year’s 250th anniversary of US independence approaches, thechronically unhealthy “special relationship”has finally come full circle.Not everyone is genuflecting to Trump – and evidence mounts that resistance, not grovelling, is by far the best way to handle this schoolyard bully. Modi’s geopolitical fling in China showed he’s learned that when dealing with Trump, firm resolve, supported by alternative options, is the better policy. Last week’sdefiant speechby China’s leader, Xi Jinping, reflected a similar realisation. Both he and Putin have discovered that when they dig their heels in, whether the issue is Ukraine, trade or sanctions, Trump backs off. Xi has adopted an uncompromising stance from the start. Putin uses flattery, skilfully manipulating Trump’s frail ego. The result is the same. Like cowards the world over, Trump respects strength because he’s weak. So he caves.The bigger the wolf, the more sheepishly Trump responds. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, like Putin, an indicted war criminal, has shown that by sticking to his guns (literally, in his case), he can face down Trump. More than that, Trump can be co-opted. After Netanyahuattacked Iran in June, against initial US advice, he induced the White House to join in – although, contemptibly, Trump only did so once he was certain who was winning. Then, typically, he claimed credit for a bogus world-changing victory. North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un,similarly bamboozledTrump during his first term. Having learned nothing, and nursing his implausibleNobel peace prize ambitions, Trump is again raising the prospect of unconditional engagement with Kim.Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has the right idea. The more Trump tries to bully him with 50% tariffs and a barrage of criticism, the morehe resists. Trump is particularly exercised over the fate of Jair Bolsonaro, Lula’s hard-right predecessor, who, like Trump, mounted a failed electoral coup. But Lula is not having any of it. “If the United States doesn’t want to buy [from us], we will find new partners,” he said. “The world is big, and it’s eager to do business with Brazil.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Every day he would try to make conversation and play with the other children, and every day he would be ignored. One night it got so bad that my grandma found him crying himself to sleep, unable to process, as an eight-year-old, why no one would want to talk to “the brown kid”. This kind of social exclusion was sadly all too familiar in postwar Britain – my white grandma had endured her own share of abuse ever since she fell in love with my Sri Lankan grandad in 1966, committing the family’s original sin of interracial marriage.When I heard these stories as a child, they felt like terrible tales from a different time – one of National Front marches and street battles, shot with big bulky cameras on black-and-white film. Growing up at a multicultural school in south-west London in the 2010s, I certainly had a different childhood to my father’s – the notion of being an outcast because of the colour of your skin was nothing short of laughable. Now, though, it doesn’t seem quite so funny.Just a year ago, in the aftermath ofthe Southport killings, towns and cities up and down the country were hit with what can only be described as attempted pogroms. Hordes of men in Middlesbrough stood at intersectionschecking the skin colourof drivers; family homes were vandalisedwith racist graffiti; rioters in Rotherham tried to set fire to asylum seeker accommodation. As I turned 19 in the midst of the chaos, I was being taught an important lesson, one that much of my generation has had the luxury of forgetting. For the first time I learned what it really means to live in fear because of the colour of your skin, and it has never left me since.This is all a far cry from my own laissez-faire childhood, which reflects many of the experiences of young people of colour who grew up at a time when racist attitudes were in decline. In 1993almost halfof Britons said they’d be uncomfortable if their child married someone of a different ethnicity; by 2020 that numberhad fallento just 4%, a stunning drop. Likewise, the percentage of people saying that you have to be white to be truly British has fallen from 10% in 2006 to 3%. While British society has always been far from perfect (many have rightly taken aim at the continued prevalence of institutional racism and unconscious bias) a consensus seemed to have evolved that racism was itself a fundamentally bad thing that was on the way out.There have been many acts of racist violence in the past 30 years – from theLondon nail bombingsof 1999 to theIslamophobic attacksthat accompanied the “war on terror”. But something feels different now. Racists in Britain are both more unapologetic than ever and more in touch with mainstream opinion, as our media and politicians happily scapegoat asylum seekers. What this means, in practice, is that I’ve experienced more racism in the last 12 months than the rest of my life put together. Whether it’s being told to go back to my country by a stranger at a London club during Pride or having the slur “Paki” thrown my way more times than I can recall (one particularly uncomfortable incident occurred at a pub on a family holiday in Cornwall), it has now become a regular feature of my life. And it’s not just me feeling this way. Mothin Ali, the new deputy leader of the Green party, took to Instagram just last week to sharea videoof several men yelling “Paki bastards” at himself and his family. “I haven’t experienced this kind of random racism on the streets since I was a child in the 80s,” he wrote. “I was hoping my own children wouldn’t have to go through the same thing.”The answer lies not in falling into an alarmist panic, but in rediscovering the lessons that previous generations learned the hard way: the necessity for organised resistance and the strength of our collective power.Last year, at the height of the riots, a message was circulating around from a far-right Telegram group that was organising hate marches across the country. “Niggers, Muslims, Pajeets,” it opened, “you will be slaughtered on Wednesday if you arrive at the protests. Think wisely or die.” That message was designed to scare people such as me away from showing up to counter-protest, to maintain the illusion that it is only the racists who have a voice in our country. But all that message left me with was anger, not fear. That Wednesday I did show up, along with tens of thousands of other antiracists from up and down the country. In Walthamstow, east London, not a single far-right group dared show their faces, and the streets were instead filled with people from all walks of life celebrating together late into the night.Rather than slipping into despair, it is time for young people to lead the charge against those who want to drag us back to the dark ages. On 13 September, Tommy Robinson and his acolytes are planning on terrorising central London with yet another one of their hate marches, and, once again, we will be on the streets to make clear that we will not live in fear. It doesn’t matter how many homes the far right vandalise, slurs they spew or how much they dominate our political discourse. Just like our mothers and fathers before us, our generation’s fight has come. We will have the audacity to keep winning, so that no child ever has to cry themselves to sleep again.Rohan Sathyamoorthy is a 19-year-old writer from south-west Londonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the etiquette of when to offer your seat is complicatedSun 7 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 7 Sep 2025 10.22 EDTShareIt’s easy to jump to conclusions, especially about human nature, particularly when your verdict is negative. But now and then, all is not as it seems. For example, in the case ofCelia Imrie, who recently hosted the 80th anniversary VJ Day commemoration at the Armed Forces Memorial in Staffordshire. King Charles and Queen Camilla were in attendance, and she described the day as “extraordinary”. Unfortunately, the experience was dampened somewhat by her journey home to London.“Now, I never make a fuss, but I had to stand all the way back for two-and-a-half hours because nobody decided to give up their seat,” the 73-year-old tolda recent interviewer. “I couldn’t believe it,” she said, attributing this to being invisible to younger generations, who have no respect for their elders. “So if you’re asking me, do people not really notice you as you get older, I’m afraid I do notice that,” she continued. “Even just walking on the street, you’re not envisioned. It’s really weird. I wear a bright coat.”Never mind the coat, Imrie also has an extremely recognisable face, which has been gracing screens big and small for decades. So fame opens doors, but doesn’t provide seating?This isn’t a tale of young people lacking esteem for the more mature members of society, though. It’s a matter of potential awkwardness. The etiquette of when to offer your seat on public transport is some of the most complicated we’re forced to navigate – probably worldwide, but definitely in Britain, where most of us are easily mortified, and could then be trapped together, at least until the next stop, to endure the aftermath. When you factor in that it must be done in full view of numerous spectators, no wonder so many commuters pretend not to notice who is standing near them. Make a mistaken offer and you’ve insulted a stranger, to their face, in front of a live audience. You’ll carry the shame with you for ever, on some level, as anybody who has had their Good Samaritan moment ruined by the reply “I’m not actually pregnant, thank you very much” can attest.Let’s agree from the off that those who choose priority seats (the ones clearly marked for people with a greater need to sit down), and then fall asleep or become engrossed in their phone/book/thoughts, are the absolute worst. If you sit there, you are entering into a moral contract. With great comfort comes great responsibility. You’re duty-bound to monitor your surroundings, and leap up if the need arises.If a priority seat holder makes a wrong call, and offers their seat to someone who didn’t actually need it, it’s only half as embarrassing as a standard seat holder doing it; they’ll still be self-conscious and scarlet-cheeked, of course, but consoled by being inherently noble and on the right side of public transport history.Recently, I saw a man give up his seat in an extremely misguided attempt at a meet-cute. He was clearly trying to be chivalrous because the woman in question was very attractive, and obviously nowhere near seat-requiring age, but she was visibly horrified. She did accept, but probably only so she could have her hands free to Google facelifts. As a dating strategy, this was imaginative and brave, but should be avoided at all costs – even by a real standup guy, in either or both senses.Opinion varies on how many birthdays a fellow passenger must have celebrated to be deemed seat-worthy, but short of asking to see their ID, there’s no way of being certain they’ve reached that milestone, and the possibility of offending is high. The train track to hell is laid with good intentions – you may genuinely mean “Please do sit down, I care about your wellbeing,” but they will hear “You are ancient, or overweight, or perhaps both.”In a nutshell, you have to be pretty confident of the facts before you dare open your mouth. If Imrie is bothered by ageing, she should take the lack of offers she received as a compliment, albeit an uncomfortable one.Polly Hudson is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsSocial etiquetteOpinionTransportCelia ImrieAgeingcommentShareReuse this content",

Not only does the ageing president alter his demands on a whim, but it is unclear to what extent he has the power to make them stick.Yet even if the “reciprocal” tariffs first announced on 2 April are rolled back, they are only one aspect of a much wider assault on the last vestiges of what was once known as the “Washington consensus”.Trump’s war on Fed is ‘serious danger’ to world economy, says ECB headRead moreTo name just a few of Trump’s recent interventions, he hastaken a 10% government stakein the US tech company Intel,demanded 15% of the revenueof Nvidia’s chip sales to China and suggested the chief executive of Goldman Sachsshould go.This at the same as taking a sledgehammer to Federal Reserve independence bylobbing insultsat the chair, Jerome Powell, andtrying to sack Lisa Cookfrom the central bank’s board.The head of the Bureau of Labor Statisticswas removed by Trumpafter a run of poor jobs data; the chief of the National Labor Relations Board, Jennifer Abruzzo,was fired, too.The tech bros who back Trumploathe the NLRBfor its role in upholding workers’ rights – mandating unionisation ballots at Amazon warehouses, for example.Trump’s approach is simultaneously systematic, in its determination to smash existing norms, and utterly chaotic. It is hard to categorise: corporate America is being unleashed – through the wilful destruction of environmental and labour standards, for example – and brought to heel.The leftwing senator Bernie Sanders welcomed Trump’s efforts totake a stake in Intelin exchange for government grants, for example –something he advocated in the Guardian back in 2022– while some Republicans have condemned the approach as (heaven forbid) “socialism”.Partly because it coincides with the AI-fuelled stock boom that has propelled the value of tech companies into the stratosphere, the market response to this torching of the status quo has so far been modest.Whatever emerges from another three and a half years of this maelstrom is likely to be unrecognisable as the US economic model of recent decades.Its destruction has not happened overnight. The days were already long gone when the US, as the world’s undisputed economic superpower, could export free market, financialised capitalism worldwide.After the 2008 crash, the conditions for which were created in Wall Street boardrooms, any moral or practical claim the US had to offer an economic example to other nations evaporated.As the turmoil rippled out through the global economy, and the US government responded by bailing out large chunks of its financial sector, the lie of laissez-faire was laid bare.The crisis exposed the risks of turbocharged capitalism to countries outside the US, too – not least in the former Soviet bloc – that had been advised to adopt the model wholesale.As Ivan Krastev and Stephen Holmes put it in their compelling polemic The Light that Failed, “confidence that the political economy of the west was a model for the future of mankind had been linked to the belief that western elites knew what they were doing. Suddenly it was obvious that they didn’t.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hisfirst-term China tariffswere, with hindsight, a relatively modest stab at, as he saw it, tilting the playing field back towards the US.Joe Biden did not unwind those tariffs, which went with the grain of geopolitics, as any hopes that economic liberalisation would bring China into the fold of democracies were sadly dashed, and President Xi’s regime took on an increasingly authoritarian bent.Biden also took a muscular approach to the state’s role in the economy, with the billions in grants and loans distributed under the Inflation Reduction Act linked to national priorities of cutting carbon emissions and creating jobs.So the idea that before Trump arrived on the scene, free market US capitalism was motoring along unchallenged is misleading, but the pace at which he is crushing its remaining norms is extraordinary.There is ample ground for legitimate disagreement here: taxpayer stakes in strategic companies are much more common in European economies, for example. Trump may be laying down tracks that future US governments with different priorities could follow.Given that it is so unclear even what kind of economy he is groping towards, the overriding sense for the moment is of radical uncertainty. Friday’sweak US payrolls data, with the unemployment rate close to a four-year high, suggested companies may be responding with caution.Investors appear to have decided to avert their eyes for now, buoyed up by the prospect of Fed rate cuts, and the mega returns of the tech companies. However, with every chaotic week that passes, the risks must increase – and as the UK has learned in the wake of the Liz Truss debacle, economic credibility is quicker to lose than to rebuild.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEconomics viewpointUS economyTrump tariffsTrump administrationEconomicsUS politicsTariffscommentShareReuse this content",

It will tout another record-setting Open: more than a million fans through the gates, unprecedented social-media engagement, double-digit growth in food and beverage sales, and hundreds of celebrities packed into suites from Rolex to Ralph Lauren. It will beam about growing the game, championing diversity andturning Flushing Meadows into a pop-culture destination.But for all the milestones the USTA is teeing up to celebrate, this year’s tournament will be remembered for a different kind of first: the governing body’s lamentable decisionto ask broadcasters not to show dissentagainst Donald Trump. In making that pre-emptive concession, the USTA has committed an unforced error that can’t be undone: sacrificing credibility in order to shield a politician –anypolitician, regardless of party, ideology or affiliation – from the sound of public disapproval.Broadcasters told not to air any booing of Donald Trump at US Open men’s finalRead moreAccording to internal emails obtained by outletsincluding PAandBounces, the USTA instructed its television partners to “refrain from showcasing any disruptions or reactions” when Trump appears on screen during Sunday’s final. A separate note reminded staff he would be seated in Rolex’s suite as a client guest. The 11-word statement to the Guardian on Saturday night from a USTA spokesperson – “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions” – is so weak it could buckle under the weight of its own hypocrisy. (Rolex did not respond to a request for comment.)This is, after all, the same tournament that happily televised a climate protestergluing himself to a seatfor nearly an hour during Coco Gauff’s semi-final win over Karolina Muchova two years ago, along with countless other fan disturbances. The same tournament that shrugs at the drunken buffoonery behind itsUS Bro-pen reputation. The Open practically invented televising distractions. Chaos is its brand. For the USTA to draw the line at showing boos for a sitting president is not “policy consistency” but capitulation.And to what end? Because of the fear that Trump –once a fixture at the US Openbutloudly booed on his last visitin 2015, three months after announcing his first presidential campaign – may once again be exposed as unpopular before a global audience? Because of the fear that a chorus of jeers could overshadow the match itself? But that fear misunderstands both sport and democracy.Crowd dissent on broadcasts is not a breakdown of civic order. It is its expression. Then UK home secretary Theresa Maywas booed at the 2012 London Paralympics. French president Emmanuel Macronwas whistledduring the 2023 Rugby World Cup opening ceremony in Paris. In the US, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell isall but guaranteed a chorus of boosduring public appearances, and that’s practically a standing ovation next tothe venom reservedfor NHL commissioner Gary Bettman from fans. And Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, have beengiven hostile receptionsby sports crowds. Somehow the United Kingdom, France and the United States survived those incidents intact.That the USTA thinks Trump must be insulated from reality hints at something darker. It is reminiscent of regimes where the leader’s image must be protected from public ridicule. It shows how much Trump’s first term – and his bullying of cultural institutions – still shapes behavior. In his first presidency, he was broadly reviled by athletes and sports bodies. Now, as Tom Dartwrote before this year’s Super Bowl, he is increasingly accommodated or treated with silence.View image in fullscreenThe US Open is supposed to be New York’s tournament, brash and democratic, rowdy and unfiltered.Photograph: Ishika Samant/Getty ImagesThe Open is supposed to be New York’s tournament, brash and democratic, rowdy and unfiltered, vibrant and exuberantly multicultural, where the crowd is as much a presence as the players on the court. By sanitizing its reaction, the USTA isn’t just shielding Trump. It is stripping the event of its unique character, authenticity and integrity.That irony cuts even deeper because the Open has always been at the forefront of progress. It was the first of the majors to award equal prize money to women and men, long before other sports caught up. It platformed, embraced and celebrated LGBTQ+ athletes decades before it was fashionable to do so, from Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova in the 1970s to Renée Richards breaking ground as one of the first transgender athletes in professional tennis, to Open Pride nights today. And this year’s theme, “75 years of breaking barriers”, honors Althea Gibson, who in 1950 became the first Black player to compete at the tournament’s predecessor, the US nationals, and went on to clear a path for generations of Black players who followed. Her story is literally built into the grounds this fortnight, from the banners and installations designed by Melissa Koby – the first Black artist to create the Open’s theme art – to the constant reminders that the sport has prided itself on inclusion.From a Maga vantage point, of course, it probably looks like the Woke Super Bowl: King’s name on the gates, Gibson’s silhouette over Ashe Stadium, Serena and Venus Williams lionized, rainbow-tinged Pride nights, and a governing body trumpeting diversity at every turn. Which, if we’re being honest, may be one reason Trump is showing up in the first place: a 4D chess move with the intent of turning a tennis match into another battleground of grievance. Getting booed by thousands of fans drinking $23 vodka-lemonades won’t exactly be a bad look for his base, especially in a corrupt, disgusting hellhole like New York.Fans will still do what fans do. If they want to boo, they will boo. But millions at home may never see it, thanks to a governing body that has chosen to act less like a guardian of sport and more like a nervous producer of campaign stagecraft. For a sport that prides itself on honesty and clarity – the ball is in or out – it is a shameful retreat.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025TennisUS Open tennisUS sportsDonald TrumpCarlos AlcarazJannik SinnercommentShareReuse this content",

Will he take Macron with him?Sun 7 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 7 Sep 2025 12.52 EDTShareFrançois Bayrou may have thought it was a smart pre-emptive move tocall a parliamentary vote of confidencein his minority government ahead of a planned national protest day on 10 September and the start of a fraught parliamentary budget season.Determined not to meet the same fate as hispredecessor who was toppledby parliament last December, the French prime minister appears to have chosen political hara-kiri instead. His near-certain ejection by a hung parliament on Monday(8 September) is set to turn a smouldering political deadlock into a blazingcrise de régime.France’s Fifth Republic constitution, framed by Gen Charles de Gaulle in 1958 to create a strong executive and a pliant legislature, has ceased to deliver stable governments. Without a change in the system, France faces extended political paralysis. In the meantime, it seems incapable of resolving a chronic fiscal crisis that is starting to worry financial markets. The finance minister, Éric Lombard, last weekdeclined to rule out having to seek an IMF bailoutbefore abruptly back-pedalling when investors took fright.If, as expected, the veteran centrist prime minister is ousted, PresidentEmmanuel Macronhas no easy option to steady the ship of state, pass a budget to curb the swollen deficit, and preserve his liberal legacy of supply-side economics and pension reform.View image in fullscreenFrance’s prime minister, François Bayrou, at the Hotel de Matignon in Paris, 3 September 2025.Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty ImagesMacron could appoint a new prime minister – his fourth in two years – but there is no sign that France’s political parties are willing to compromise on a workable budget. He could dissolve parliament again and call a general election – the third in three years – but that would probably produce no more decisive an outcome than the snap poll he called last year in an impetuous blunder.The president had sought “clarification” from voters after far-right populistsmade big gains in the European parliament elections. Instead of clarification, the legislative ballot cast the country into greater confusion, producing athree-way split between roughly equal blocs– a leftwing alliance dominated by Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s radical France Unbowed (LFI), Macron’s own centrist and centre-right supporters, and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN).Macron, who cannot run again after his second five-year presidential term, which could last until spring 2027, has ruled out another option – resigning from office and precipitating an early presidential election. How on earth did the charismatic, still only 47-year-old president get himself into such a mess?He and Bayrou seem to have misjudged both the public mood and the parliamentary arithmetic. They calculated that either the RN or the centre-left Socialist party would keep the government in office since each had good reason to avoid another election – the former because Le Pen would be disqualified from standing due to a fraud conviction, the latter because it risked losing many seats. But neither wants to act as a life raft for an unpopular prime minister who proposed axing two public holidays and freezing public spending next year to narrow the fiscal gap.Bayrou gambled that by dramatising France’s soaring debt, he could persuade the public and the political class of the need for drastic measures. Capitalising on public anger over those proposals, an anonymous collective called Bloquons tout (Let’s Block Everything) has called for strikes and demonstrations to bring the country to a standstill next Wednesday, seeking to revive the spirit of the leaderless gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement that staged months of guerrilla protests against a planned carbon tax in 2018.Although some of those calls appear to have originated onfar-right social media accounts,Mélenchon has piled in behind the blockade campaign in the hope of forcing Macron’s removal. So far, the mood seems sullen and distrustful rather than insurrectionary. It’s not clear that unionised public sector workers have the stamina to sustain a campaign of strikes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So why is it spending billions a year subsidising business? | Alexander HurstRead moreThe Socialists are trying to project themselves as a constructive alternative to either Bayrou or snap elections. The party’s leader, Olivier Faure, says the president should appoint a Socialist premier to implement a “counter-budget” featuring a wealth tax on large fortunes, a suspension of the raising of the retirement age enacted in 2023, a cut in welfare taxes and smaller public spending cuts than Bayrou envisaged. Macron is determined not to do that, but he has urged his centrists to reach out to the Socialists to try to draw them into joining or supporting a government.Centrist leaders are urging the president to avoid a fresh election, in which the RN would probably further increase its score at their expense. But French parties have neither the German and Dutch political culture of painstakingly negotiating a compromise programme for a legislature, nor the Italian tradition of backing a government of technocrats for a limited time to carry out unpopular but necessary reforms.A prolonged political crisis will only fuel support for the nationalist, anti-immigrant right and further discredit the jaded mainstream parties. With toxic social media echo chambers and a growing US-style far-right media railing against crime, immigration and Islam, Le Pen and her young protege Jordan Bardella seem ever closer to winning power.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsFranceOpinionEmmanuel MacronMarine Le PenEuropecommentShareReuse this content",

The drugs won. NowDonald Trumpis turning a failed metaphor into a worse reality.On Tuesday the US presidentclaimedthat the military had killed 11 drug traffickers from Venezuela, posting footage of the strike that US officials said took place on a speedboat in international waters in the Caribbean. The administrationsupplied no evidencefor its claim that the boat contained Tren de Aragua members, or drugs, and gave varying accounts of its destination. It also warned that there was more to come, with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, arguing that intercepting boats had not curbed the drugs problem: “What will stop them is when you blow them up.” Earlier this year, Mr Trumpsecretly orderedthe use of military force against cartels internationally.With US warships patrolling the coast of Venezuela – and F35 fighter jets reportedlydispatched to Puerto Rico– some fear that this could be pretext for adisastrous intervention, as its president, Nicolás Maduro, has suggested. Alternatively, Washington may hope it unnerves other regime members into unseating him, or prompts Mr Maduro himself to flee – two longstanding dreams. The US hasalready offered a $50m bountyfor his arrest. At best, this may bepolitical theatre, with both Mr Maduro and Mr Trump posturing for their bases.If this campaign truly targets the drugs trade, it is dangerous and misguided. Likerebranding the Department of Defenseas the “Department of War”, it speaks to Mr Trump’s love of macho spectacle. But it sets a precedent for launching military strikes on whomever the US authorities wish, without congressional approval or a UN mandate,simply by declaring that they are “at war”.The Obama administrationstretched the boundaries of executive power, and any plausible definition of self-defence and imminent threat, with its campaign of drone assassinations, includingthose of American citizensfar from battlefields, under the hazy label of the “war on terror”. Despite thehigh civilian tollandminimal transparency, it met lamentably little political pushback.The Trump administration has gone even further. Cartelsare spreadingand entrenching themselves in Latin America, devastating communities. But arbitrarily designating them as terrorists is plainly a nonsense. Extrajudicial killings of this kind are always wrong. Offenders who would not face the death penalty if charged are executed without due process. Innocents inevitably fall victim too. Many children were among the thousands killed inRodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs”in the Philippines. The former president is now awaiting trial for crimes against humanity at the international criminal court.Summary executions are also counterproductive. They make it harder to gather information, and strikes on foreign soil would make governments less likely to cooperate with US efforts, due to the domestic backlash – especially inMexico. That would not only hamper the fight against drugs, but also Mr Trump’s efforts to curb migration.To tackle its devastating fentanyl epidemic, the US must ultimately tackle demand:an immense task, since it means addressing the conditions that birthed this crisis, as well as entrenched addictions. In the meantime,carefully targeted action and financial disruptionwould be more effective than killing cartel members. Above all, the administration shouldstem the flow of US arms, which have supercharged violence in Mexico and elsewhere.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This scabrous riff on the slipperiness of cultural value in the international art scene asks: is a copy so good that even experts mistake it for the original painting still a fake?Questions of authenticity and attribution are behinda new display by English Heritage at Kenwood Housein London to mark the 350th anniversary of the death of Johannes Vermeer. For the first time in 300 years, two nearly identical paintings ofthe Guitar Player, one signed by the Dutch master, the other on loan from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and until recently believed to be a 17th- or 18th-century copy, will hang side by side. Experts have puzzled over the relationship between the two paintings for 100 years. Now visitors are being invited take part in a game of spot the difference (there are five, apparently), comparing a recognised masterpiece and its “twin”.A 2022 exhibition at Washington DC’s National Gallery of Art similarly set out to examine “what makes a Vermeer a Vermeer”. The long-contested Girl With a Flute was subsequentlydowngradedto the work of an associate, because “the quality falls short of Vermeer’s standards”.Earlier this summer,a rumbling disputeabout the authenticity of Rubens’ Samson and Delilah,bought for a record sum by the National Gallery in London in 1980, was reignited, with apetition launchedcalling for a public debate to resolve the issue. The National has been accused of covering up a duff acquisition by applying a modern blockboard to the painting’s back – claims the gallery hasrigorously refuted.Art-world controversies are often the stuff of detective fiction. The Kenwood masterpiece has fingerprints on its surface, presumably those of the artist himself; the Philadelphia painting still has the wax seal of a long-ago owner on the back. No wonder such stories appeal to writers.Along with Carey’s Theft, other fictional art capers include Michael Frayn’s 1999 Booker-prize shortlistedHeadlong,about an art historian who believes he has uncovered a lost Bruegel; Donna Tartt’s 2013 Pulitzer prize-winningThe Goldfinch, which takes its title from a 17th-century painting by theDutch artist Carel Fabritius; and most recently Nell Stevens’ tale of Victorian love and fakery,The Original. There’s even a Simpsons episode,The War of Art, in which Homer and Marge think they have discovered a valuable Dutch painting in a yard sale. Doh! “You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous,” the forger tells a disappointed Lisa.He has a point. But the provenance of a painting is vital, not just to scholars. In a world of fake news,manipulated imagesanddigital art theft, authenticity matters more than ever. Artists arecampaigningto protect their intellectual property from AI crawling because authorship is the hallmark of human creativity.English Heritage hopes to have a final verdict on the two paintings at Kenwood House by year’s end. The display encourages visitors to really study them, to become amateur art historians. This is part of a growing trend in museums and galleries, such as the newV&A East Storehouse, to involve the public as co-curators. The real winner of this contest is the viewer, who gets to bask in the quiet luminosity of Vermeer while taking part in an important moment in art history.Explore more on these topicsArt and designOpinionJohannes VermeerEnglish HeritagePeter CareyMichael FraynDonna TarttThe SimpsonseditorialsShareReuse this content",

I was born in the 1950s and often heard appalling racist, homophobic and misogynistic language from my father and his family. I too believed that we had thankfully progressed as a society, at least to a point where such language and the entitled attitude to its accompanying cruelty where no longer considered socially acceptable. Although hateful social undercurrents have never been completely eradicated, the worst were viewed as abhorrent anomalies that provoked utter outrage from government, media and, generally, the public.I worked as a teacher in schools in a deprived area of the north, now targeted by Reform UK, where children would openly challenge even a hint of such hate from their peers. They recognised it as dehumanising. It is therefore horrifying that Farage et al have not faced such challenge from the media or government, which have failed to address the societal consequences of a return to overt normalisation of racist language and attitudes. What is concerning is just how quickly some members of the wider public feel they have been given “permission” to shed any pretence of tolerance. Unchecked, Farage has raised the possibility of the unthinkable in a certain sector of the public psyche and has been enabled in building normalising frameworks around disgusting ideologies.Even my year 10s knew that was unacceptable, although, sadly, they too now live in a country being led backwards.Diann HansonRuncorn, CheshireReading Natalie Morris’s excellent article highlights the utter despair felt by most people of minority ethnic origin, not felt since the 1970s.

But ending the horror in Gaza still relies on the worst people in the world, 29 August) is puzzling. On the one hand Marina, quite rightly, went to town on the 222 days of Trump’s presidency, castigating him for failing to fulfil his 53 promises to stop the Ukraine war. Yet when an MP, Davey, who is in a position to make an impact, decides to make a stand, albeit on his lonesome, she says the gesture “feels one rung above a tweet”. Clever and witty for sure, but I believe that Davey’s intentions are sincere and well-intentioned.I suspect that this “gesture” would be supported by the majority of his constituents, the Lib Dem voters (including the35% who wouldn’t recognise him) and, indeed, a high proportion of the general public. I wonder, if more of his parliamentary colleagues (from all political shades) had joined him in the boycott, would his efforts have been dismissed?We’re in a dangerous and hopeless place if we stop believing that we can effect change, however small and seemingly insignificant our efforts are. Voters are frustrated that very few of our elected members are voicing the views of the electorate, particularly with regard to the current parlous state of world affairs.If we are to believe Jonathan Freedland’s convincing thesis (Step back and take it in: the US is entering full authoritarian mode, 29 August), then boycotting Trump at every possible opportunity seems a good way to send a clear message that, here in the UK, we neither support nor wish to be complicit in Trump’s relentless march towards global domination.Tom BradleyRaynes Park, LondonOn the matter of the effectiveness ofEd Daveyjunking his banquet invitation to the Windsor Trumpfest, as gestures go, it’s much better than a tweet. It’s much more pointed than even a newspaper column.Why would he want to go? The best-fed of our society are getting together to honour the man who has failed to stop the starvation in Gaza – by holding a banquet. It’s an obscene, integrity-free event. Those who do attend will have something to live down for the rest of their lives.Of course, Priti Patel was among the unprincipled to complain about him “disrespecting the king” by not accepting. The only person disrespecting the king is Keir Starmer, for putting Charles through it for a second time.Still, it’s a transactional world we live in today. If President Trump manages to impose a halt on the Israeli venture into Gaza and a full complement of aid is flowing by the time of the banquet, I’m sure that Ed would be happy to turn up, have dinner and even offer praise. Trump likes that; we’ve all seen the video of his latest cabinet meeting.Will HainesHook, HampshireThank God for Ed Davey. If only our other politicians had the same courage to stand up to Trump – a vain man who puts business deals with dictators such as Putin and Netanyahu above the suffering of thousands of people. Instead of feeling pride in the actions of Starmer and his government, we are condemned to witness the continual, sickening, fawning of Trump by those who are incapable of doing the right thing. I shall, however, be going to the banquet: to protest against Trump, but outside.Alice TomlinsonHastings, East SussexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The government’s ambition to build an “NHS fit for the future” through prevention, neighbourhood services and digital tools is welcome, but this vision risks treating symptoms rather than causes if social care is left out of the equation.Unless there is sufficient capacity in community-based social care to support people recovering at home, the logjam will persist, and “corridor care” will remain a reality.The evidence is clear: timely investment in community services such as reablement and intermediate care prevents unnecessary admissions, speeds up safe discharges, and delivers strong returns on investment for theNHS.Reform is overdue. The government has set out a roadmap for NHS transformation, but, with the Casey commission not reporting until 2028, social care reform is still pending. By then, the NHS reform agenda will already be years ahead, and the disconnection between the two systems will have deepened. If ministers are serious about relieving pressure on hospitals, they must treat health and social care as equal partners.Social careis not optional to NHS recovery; it is central to it.Kathryn MarsdenChief executive, Social Care Institute for ExcellenceHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It cites a study that proposes replacing aspirin, the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy for individuals at high risk of heart attacks and strokes, with clopidogrel. We must point out, however, that clopidogrel does not work uniformly across individuals. Although mentioned in theLancet publication, it was only lightly considered in the Guardian article.Clopidogrel is a prodrug. To work, it needs to be metabolised by a liver enzyme that varies in the population because of variations in the CYP2C19 gene. Most individuals have “normal” or “supra-normal” levels of the enzyme and clopidogrel works as expected. However, “intermediate metabolisers” activate clopidogrel less efficiently and “poor metabolisers” struggle to activate clopidogrel at all. For these people, clopidogrel may not provide enough protection against heart attacks or strokes.This issue is not academic: 20%-30% of white individuals in the UK are intermediate or poor metabolisers and in Asian populations this can be as high as50%-60%. Ignoring individual genetic differences may also have legal implications. In 2024, Hawaii won alandmark lawsuit against clopidogrel manufacturersfor failing to disclose the efficacy and safety profile of the drug considering that a large percentage of the Hawaiian population are intermediate or poor metabolisers.In summary, clopidogrel’s effectiveness is not universal and a “one-drug-fits-all” approach may expose patients to preventable harm. Individuals can be tested for genetic variation in the CYP2C19 gene, enabling a personalised approach. Patients with normal or supra-normal levels of the enzyme can be treated with clopidogrel as standard for the long term, while those with lower enzyme levels can continue with aspirin, the current standard. Such a personalised approach may even provide better outcomes than those reported in the Lancet paper.Dr Ronnie Ramlogan,Dr Dimitri Gagliardi,Dr Luigi Venetucci,Dr Abisope AkintolaUniversity of Manchester,Dr Cinzia Dello Russo,Prof Sir Munir PirmohamedUniversity of LiverpoolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As he has spent the early years of his career collecting major titles at a breathless pace, this has been clear for a long time. On the biggest stage in tennis, he reinforced the sentiment with a ­stupendous ­performance against his greatest rival, completely outplaying ­Jannik Sinner, the No 1 and defending ­champion, to lift his second US Open title with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 win.At the end of his most ­spectacular summer, Alcaraz will replace ­Sinner as world No 1, returning to the top ranking for the first time in two years. The 22-year-old also continues to mark himself as one of the greatest ever young players: he is the second-youngest man in the Open era to earn six grand slam titles, trailing only Björn Borg. He is also already the fourth man to win multiple grand slam titles on all three surfaces.Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner to win US Open men’s singles title – liveRead moreThis match-up marked the first time the same men have competed in three major finals in the Open era in the same calendar year, with Alcaraz finishing the trilogy with a 2-1 lead. He now holds a 10-5 record over Sinner, winning seven of their past eight meetings.On this occasion, Alcaraz could do anything he wanted with the tennis ball for the best part of three hours. He served brilliantly and struck his devastating forehand with total ­precision, but he also showcased his variation in full, constantly varying the pace, spin and trajectory of his shots. He kept Sinner completely off balance and unable to gain any rhythm with his destructive groundstrokes.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner greet each other at the net at the conclusion of their match.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesThis was one of the most ­significant days of the tennis year, and yet the narrative was hijacked by the presence of Donald Trump, the US president. Overnight, Arthur Ashe Stadium was tightly encircled by airport-style security barriers and as fans began to queue up in order to enter the stadium, they were watched over by Secret Service agents. The men’s trophy was placed in the Rolex suite alongside Trump, which is not the usual protocol. When the US president was finally shown on the big screen at the end of the first set, most of the audience booed.As 2pm approached, the embarrassment continued for the United StatesTennisAssociation. Due to the dramatically heightened security, the queues to enter the ­stadium spanned across the ­tournament grounds and the start was delayed until 2.30pm. The final began with thousands of fans still waiting to take their seats. ­Hundreds were still outside during the second set.Nobody, it turns out, was as excited for arematch of the French Openand Wimbledon finals as Alcaraz himself. He was spellbinding from the beginning, every part of his prodigious game flowing. He continued the excellent serving form that has guided him through the tournament and he struck his destructive forehand with total freedom, completely dominating the baseline.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz plays a forehand return to Jannik Sinner during his four-set victory.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesAt the core of his performance, though, was the way he unfurled the various layers of his impossibly complete game, forcing Sinner to deal with skidding low slices, forays to the net, constant changes to the trajectory of the ball and drop shots. With the roof closed due to rain, the sterile indoor conditions were widely considered a positive for Sinner, but Alcaraz set the tone with a flawless opening set.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After hitting just two unforced errors in set one, Alcaraz’s growing error count allowed Sinner to grow into the match. Suddenly, Sinner was hitting his spots with his first serve and controlling many more of the exchanges with his destructive, ­metronomic ball striking as he ­efficiently levelled the match.Less than two months ago at Wimbledon, Sinner trailed Alcaraz by a set beforebulldozing through the final three sets. There would be no repeat here. Alcaraz recovered, re-establishing his dominant serving, his variation and his control of the baseline. After snatching the opening break, he flitted through the third set to establish a two sets to one lead before immediately generating break points on Sinner’s serve.With his back to the wall, Sinner fought desperately until the end. He won many of the frenetic, scattered cat-and-mouse points typical of this rivalry, including a stunning combination of volleys down break point at 0-1 in the fourth set that drew a finally full stadium to its feet. ­However, when he is in this mood, and everything is flowing so effortlessly, Alcaraz’s game can scale to heights that nobody else, including Sinner, can reach. Even now, six majors in, it feels as if he has only just begun.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Carlos AlcarazJannik SinnerUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content",

Norris, who was booed on the podium, was forthright in his belief that McLaren had made the right call.“I don’t want to win this way, and the same with Oscar,” he said. “But we do what we think is correct as a team no matter what people say and what their opinions are and we will stick with that.“We are not idiots and we have plans for different things. If there were four cars between me and Oscar, of course he is not going to let me back past and that is correct. But if there is a situation where we are racing and you can be fair, you would expect to be fair as a team.“Today was not my fault. If I came flat out into my box and I hit all my mechanics I would not expect to get the position back. This was out of my control.”Piastri could have put three more points on his title rival by refusing to move over but agreed with Norris that he felt he had done the right thing according to the culture and racing ethos engendered at McLaren.When asked if he may have cause to regret the decision if he lost the title by three points, he was unequivocal.View image in fullscreenLando Norris leads McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri during the Italian Grand Prix.Photograph: Joe Portlock/Getty Images“I wouldn’t regret it, no,” he said. “It was a fair decision.

The England manager, whose team face Serbia in Belgrade on Tuesday in their toughest assignment of qualification, talked last week of wanting to streamline and simplify his approach. Tuchel is coming to terms with the realities of international football and the limited amount of time he has with the players. He has worked to instil short-passing patterns but, as he reflected on how some old‑fashioned qualities were making a comeback, he declared being open to adding a more unreconstructed dimension.England got both of their goals from lofted crosses on Saturday in the2-0 victory against Andorraat Villa Park. The first cross was ­deli­vered from an inside-right ­position by Noni Madueke and led to an own goal from Christian Garcia. The ­second was from a much wider ­position on the same flank. It was sent over by Reece James and headed home by Declan Rice.Watching Andorra: like a month made up entirely of Tuesday afternoons | Barney RonayRead more“The last one was more classic than the first one,” Tuchel said. “The last one was from the sideline, with the right foot to the second post and our No 10 arrived – Declan. I tell you the long throw-in is back, as well.“Once we arrive at the World Cup, all these things matter so we will also talk about long throw-ins, we will talk about long kicks from the goalkeeper and not only playing short. We cannot put everything into four days of training but these things will matter. Let’s see. I need to reflect with my assistant coaches. All these patterns are back and crosses are back, as well.”Tuchel anticipates a heated atmosphere againstSerbiaat the Rajko Mitic Stadium and said his players must be prepared for anything and everything – including a dodgy pitch and sending-offs. “We will have to adapt to the adversity and overcome adversity and let’s see what the pitch is like … how the game plays out,” Tuchel said.“You never know. You can have red cards, yellow cards, whatever. We need to be ready for everything. We will face the same formation as againstAndorra– the defensive block of 5-4-1 with individual quality up front with tall physical strikers.”Tuchel was asked specifically about the playing surface. Had it been flagged as a possible concern? “Not yet,” he said with a knowing smile. “We expect … we are ready for everything. We feel that we are ready to step up to the atmosphere, the physicality, and it will be an emotional, very important game in the group.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel said after England’s win against Andorra: ‘Once we arrive at the World Cup, we will talk about long throw-ins, long kicks and not only playing short.’Photograph: Nick Potts/PA“The main thing is that I trust the players because I felt them very strong this week. We’ve had an excellent camp. I felt the energy right, the attitude right, and that’s why I have full trust that we will have a good game in Serbia. We will prove ourselves to be ready to win there.”Tuchel’s players have been warned by the Football Association to be aware of hostility from the stands that crosses a line and also the reactive protocols open to them, which include walking off the pitch. In 2012, England’s black players were subjected to racist abuse in an under-21s game in Serbia, and last year Serbia were hit with partial ground closures by Uefa over supporter behaviour in the Nations League.The stadium will again be partially closed on Tuesday, this time on Fifa orders after racist behaviour by some Serbia fans during the 3-0 home win against Andorra in June. At least 15% of the capacity behind the goals will be empty. Since 2021, the Serbia Football Federation has been fined €703,375 for offences of their fans, including acts of discrimination.“I’d say we’re very aware of maybe some of the challenges that we may face out there,” the midfielder ­Eberechi Eze said. “It’s something that internally we’ll decide and have conversations about.”The Serbian federation has reite­rated a plea for good behaviour. “Because we are under Uefa and Fifa scrutiny and because of the history of various incidents that have made us the subject of disciplinary measures, we appeal to supporters to send out an image to the world that will make us all proud,” it said in a statementTuchel has a potential selection issue in central defence after Marc Guéhi reported discomfort in his groin at half-time against Andorra. The Crystal Palace captain carried on until the 76th minute before he was replaced with Aston Villa’s Ezri Konsa, the fourth substitution of the permitted five. Tuchel said he wanted to introduce another Villa player, Ollie Watkins, for Harry Kane up front but the Guéhi situation altered his thinking. Kane stayed on for 90 minutes.“I wanted to put Ollie on as it’s Villa Park and for sure his family was there. I was a bit unhappy with that,” Tuchel said. “We lost already John Stones [who withdrew from the squad with an injury] and I was not ready to take the risk. Ezri is also a Villa player so we had that. It turned out that Harry stayed on; it’s never a problem. He will be ready for Tuesday.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersThomas TuchelSerbiaAndorraShareReuse this content",

Germany came into the contest reeling from Thursday’s shock2-0 defeat in Slovakia, their third consecutive defeat leading to stinging criticism of Nagelsmann in the German press.They quickly set about dominating the ball in the early stages and took a seventh-minute lead through Gnabry, Northern Ireland’s nemesis six years ago when he scored a hat-trick in a 6-1 win in Frankfurt. After Eoin Toal lost the ball, Nick Woltemade quickly played in Gnabry, who barged his way past Justin Devenny before lifting the ball over the goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell.Newcastle’snew striker Woltemadehad a couple of opportunities himself as the one-way traffic continued, with Northern Ireland in danger of getting overrun. Instead the response was excellent.Price’s quick feet forced Antonio Rüdiger into a cynical block which earned the Real Madrid man a yellow card. It also shifted the dynamic. Paddy McNair headed over from Devenny’s corner before Price nicked the ball away from Rüdiger to spark another attack.That one ended with a second corner, again sent in by Devenny and met superbly on the volley by Price at the far post, levelling the scores with his eighth Northern Ireland goal in his past nine appearances, and 10th overall at the age of just 21.Germanysuddenly looked nervous as Northern Ireland found fresh energy, and half-time was greeted with shrill whistles from the frustrated home support.Germany did not look any more settled to start the second half. Goalkeeper Oliver Baumann flapped at another Devenny corner and it took a good 10 minutes before the hosts started to exert any control, with Jamie Leweling firing wide from distance.Peacock-Farrell then made a double save, keeping out David Raum’s shot from the edge of the area, then kicking clear Pascal Gross’s strike on the rebound. Moments later, Waldemar Anton headed over from a free-kick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Raum swept the ball forward from deep both Peacock-Farrell and Toal followed the run of Maximilian Beier and waited for the other to deal with it, but instead the ball ran for fellow substitute Amiri to tap into an empty net.All of Northern Ireland’s hard work was coming undone, and just four minutes later Wirtz – largely anonymous for much of the night – thumped in an excellent free-kick to put the game out of Northern Ireland’s reach.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersGermanyNorthern Irelandmatch reportsShareReuse this content",

We felt pressure we hadn’t felt in the start of the tournament so far and it was really good for us to get that under our belt. Also to work out that rugby contest and come out with a scoreline like that is a ­testament to the girls.”The host side were happy with their defensive performance, something the centre Meg Jones expressed by paraphrasing an Alex Ferguson adage. “We know defence is going to win championships and it’s going to win games for us,” the 28-year-old said. “We have got full strength and belief in the fact that our defence is solid. We trust it massively. Kicking the ball away, we are happy to do that. We are happy to show we have a defensive set and be comfortable without the ball.“Sunts [Sarah Hunter, the ­England defence coach] is passionate about it, she is passionate about the game and she has been a leader for so many years. She has built that into the ­leadership group but particularly myself; I have worked closely with her and we want to take a bit of pride in that. When Sunts speaks, we ­listen. She is really clear with the ­com­munication she has and we trust her massively.”Alex Matthews captained the ­England side against Australia and was also pleased with the nature of the victory. “I think it was how the girls came together,” the No 8 said.“How we had problems to solve, how we were still calm, composed at half-time. We stuck to the game plan and had confidence in each other. We stuck by each other which is what you need in these big tournaments.”View image in fullscreenAlex Matthews captained the England side against Australia.Photograph: Rob Newell/CameraSport/Getty ImagesWhile England are expected to ­welcome back the captain Zoe­Aldcroft from injury for the match against Scotland,they will be ­without Ellie Kildunne.

The Red Roses have options in regards to stand‑ins at No 15 with Helena ­Rowland and Emma Sing among those in contention.Hunt, who plays with Sing at Gloucester-Hartpury, said: “We have an incredible squad, Emma Sing can step in and is the person who has beaten the most defenders in the PWR [Premiership Women’s Rugby]. We are really blessed with the squad that we have got. We want Els to be OK. I am sure she will be and we will look after her.”Quick GuideWomen's Rugby World Cup knockoutsShowQuarter-finalsSaturday1New Zealand v South Africa, 1pm2Canada v Australia, 4pmSunday3France v Ireland, 1pm4England v Scotland, 4pmSemi-finals19 Sep1Winner QF1 v Winner QF220 Sep2Winner QF3 v Winner QF4Bronze final27 SepLoser SF1 v Loser SF2Final27 SepWinner SF1 v Winner SF2Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Hunt is also excited about facing Scotland, a side England have not lost against since 1999. “We know so many of the girls, playing with them or against them in the PWR for so many years,” the scrum-half said. “Some are good friends. It’ll be a good battle.”The other three quarter-finals have also been confirmed, with Australia facing the world No 2 side Canada, who topped their pool with three bonus‑point wins.

She believed she had done all the work necessary, harnessing successfully her once uncontrollable power into consistent excellence. After overcoming so many hurdles en route to becoming the best player in the world, she felt ready for anything. Sabalenka was convinced she could handle any challenge that came her way.It was not until herexcruciating French Open final defeatagainst Coco Gauff that Sabalenka understood this was not true. As she struggled with her nerves under such significant pressure and punishing windy conditions, the 27-year-old was outplayed by a tireless, gutsier opponent in Gauff who broke her down by forcing her to work hard for every single point.In the days after that defeat, as the discourse continued over her subsequent unsporting remarks during her press conference, Sabalenka travelled to Mykonos, Greece with her boyfriend, Georgios. She used the brief break to drink tequila, disconnect from tennis and let off steam, but Sabalenka dedicated much of her time to pondering her next steps. After her Australian Open final defeat by Madison Keys, Sabalenka had believed it was important to just move on from that match. Her performance in Paris, however, meant alarm bells were ringing in her head.Sorry, purists: the Coachella-fication of the US Open is here to stay | Bryan Armen GrahamRead more“I was in Mykonos, reading my book, enjoying the view,” she said, laughing. “And I was just thinking: ‘Why would I let my emotions take control over me in those two finals?’ It felt like: ‘OK, if I made it to the final, it means that I’m going to win it.’ And I sort of didn’t expect players to come out there and to fight. I thought that everything was going to go my way easily, which was completely the wrong mindset.”This season has been a lesson in humility, showing Sabalenka there is always room for improvement and the work is never finished. She had unlocked so much from her game and achieved so much already, performing at the highest level week in, week out with few significant dips, but that did not mean everything would come easily for her.Those lessons were all on show on Saturday as Sabalenka held off one of the few players capable of overpowering her from the baseline. She kept her nerve in the tense final moments,defeating Amanda Anisimova6-3, 7-6 (3) to defend her US Open title and win her fourth grand slam title.“Going into this final I decided for myself that I’m going to control my emotions,” Sabalenka said. “I’m not going to let them take control over me, and it doesn’t matter what happens in the match. If she breaks me back or if she plays incredible tennis – of course, it’s a final, and she’s going to be fighting.”View image in fullscreenThis season has been a lesson in humility for Aryna Sabalenka, who lost to Coco Gauff at the French Open.Photograph: Adam Hunger/APWith every new triumph, it is hard not to think of what Sabalenka’s game looked like when she arrived on the tour. She started her career bashing every ball as hard as possible with barely a thought in her mind. She has since worked herself into one of the most consistent big tournament players of the past decade apart from Serena Williams. Sabalenka has now reached the semi-final or better in 11 of her past 12 grand slam tournaments, the only anomaly being a quarter-final defeat at the French Open last year when she was visibly struggling with food poisoning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her next challenge is toproduce similar results at Wimbledonand the French Open. Although Sabalenka has shown herself to be an all-court player, and her impressive improvements on clay were underscored by her run to the French Open final this year, she has won all four of her major titles on hard courts; 18 of her 21 titles overall have also come on hard courts.At 27 years old, Sabalenka is at her physical peak and she continues to give herself title-winning opportunities at nearly every grand slam she enters. If she continues to approach them as she did in New York, having the humility to accept the talents of her opponents while calmly searching for solutions, there will be more victories to come.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Aryna SabalenkaUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content",

The world No 2 completed the career grand slam with his triumph at Augusta in April, and on Sunday he added to that by winning his home open for the second time with a thrilling playoff victory against Joakim Lagergren.McIlroy had to eagle the 72nd hole just to take it to a playoff after Lagergren’s own stunning eagle at the 16th. After the first two extra holes were tied in birdie fours, Lagergren found the water hazard third time around to allow McIlroy to win it with two putts.Ryder Cup team should copy Djokovic when dealing with American hostility, says McIlroyRead moreMcIlroy, who also triumphed in this event at the same venue in 2016, said: “I just feel so lucky that I get to do this in front of these people. The support has been amazing all week. So happy I could play the way I did this week and get the win.“I had a putt last year at [Royal County Down] to force a playoff with Rasmus [Højgaard] and it just missed on the high side, so it felt like [the eagle at the 18th] was a little bit of redemption. I wanted to be aggressive with it – such a cool feeling, cool moment for that to go in, and that gave me a chance in the playoff.“It just felt like it was who was going to blink first. Joakim hit a poor second shot on that playoff hole and that opened the door for me, and I’m just so happy to win my second Irish Open.”With the Ryder Cup to come at Bethpage this month, McIlroy said: “To do what I did earlier in the year and then to come home and win my national open, no matter what happens for the rest of the year, that’s a pretty cool year – 2025’s going to be one of the best, if not the best, of my career.“But we’re not finished yet, I’ve got a big week next week at Wentworth [the BMW PGA Championship] and then obviously everybody’s looking forward to the Ryder Cup.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What does any of it mean? A game that might anyway have been considered meaningless by many, the final encounter of an already settled series, was rendered almost absurd by England’s towering margin of victory and the extraordinary, borderline nonsensical fashion in which it was decided.As Jacob Bethell, who marked it with the first century of his professional career, put it: “Very good fun, yeah. Not much else to say.”England, having already lost the series, romped to their fifth-highest total of all time; South Africa, having already won the series, were dismissed for their second lowest score, and the result was the single most one‑sided match in the history of the format, the teams divided in the end by 342 runs.Hundreds from Bethell and Joe Root helped England to post 414 for five, after which a magnificent display with the ball fromJofra Archerbewitched South Africa as all nine wickets – their captain, Temba Bavuma, unable to bat because of a calf strain – fell for just 72. Harry Brook called it “the ultimate performance”; Bavuma surmised that “things went terribly wrong”.England beat South Africa by 342 runs for biggest winning margin in men’s ODI history – as it happenedRead moreEngland scored at least two runs in each of their 50 overs; Archer’s first five overs included three wicket maidens, and by the end of them he had four wickets and had conceded just five. He stayed on for a sixth and a seventh, not wanting to snip the magic thread, returning later for a couple more and those perhaps included his best single delivery of all – to Corbin Bosch, who was a complete irrelevance as the ball whispered sweet nothings to his off-stump on its way past at 93mph – there would be no more breakthroughs.“There are some spells you hardly bowl a bad ball, where every ball you release you’re happy with how it’s landed,” Archer said. “For the most part today was one of those.”Most England players ended the day equally content. In addition to their two centurions Jamie Smith (off 48 balls) and Jos Buttler (32) stood out in scoring precisely 62, and only Ben Duckett – playing his final innings of an intense summer and apparently in need of the rest he has finally been granted – and Brook, who ran himself out for the second time in the series and is probably due some time off as well, looked in anything less than fine touch.As pleased as England would have been with their total, Bethell’s contribution was particularly sweet. They have gone all in on the 21‑year‑old’s talent: just over six weeks before he turns 22 this was his 33rd international innings, his 141st as a senior professional, and if his promise across all formats has always been evident he had clearly been desperate for this affirmation.View image in fullscreenJacob Bethell thrashes the ball away en route to his first century for England.Photograph: Harry Trump/ECB/Getty ImagesAs the ball sped through the covers to carry him to triple figures he ran down the pitch, arms outstretched, and aeroplaned into the arms of Root, celebrating his very first century with someone on route to his 73rd.“I think he’ll score a few more, there’s no doubt about that,” Shukri Conrad, South Africa’s head coach, said. “I first saw Jacob at the Under-19 World Cup [in 2022, when he scored 88 runs off 42 and England won by six wickets]. He put us to the sword in that as well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They had lost five wickets by the time they had scored as many runs as the 19 they gave away in wides.Theirrun of wins against Englandin this format thereby ends on four, England beating them here for the first time since the teams last played a dead-rubber final game in a three‑match series the Proteas had already wrapped up, in Kimberley in February 2023. In that regard there is something of a theme, and South Africa have now lost the last game of their past four one-day international series, in Ireland, Pakistan, Australia and now England. It is just a couple of weeks since they last found themselves 2-0 up with one to play, and on that occasion Australia scored 431 and won by 276.“We were definitely off today and against a top side when you’re not on top of your game you do get exposed,” Conrad said. “A similar thing happened in Australia, a complete aberration. If we’re going to be poor at something we’d rather be poor at games that aren’t clutch games. Not making light of today’s game, it was an embarrassing performance in the field and the batting just followed.”The day started with South Africa dropping Senuran Muthusamy and Lungi Ngidi – Codi Yusuf coming in for a chastening ODI debut – and then they also dropped the quality of their fielding, as well as Smith (inexplicably, by Matthew Breetzke, on 23) and Bethell (puzzlingly, by Nandre Burger, on 44). It was a performance they will want to forget, but a result so bad they may not be allowed to do so.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamJoe RootJofra ArchernewsShareReuse this content",

That’s also key to why I’ve had such a long career.”“G”-fest aside, there was a real race going on, with the Olympic road andtime trial championRemco Evenepoel, winner of the hilltop finish on the Tumble on Saturday, hoping to make up his two-second deficit in the overall standings to the French race leader, Romain Grégoire.View image in fullscreenRomain Grégoire sprays the champagne as he savours his overall victory in the Tour of Britain.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesThose hopes were thwarted, though, first by a herd of cows crossing the road on the moorland climb of Myndd Bedwellte, and later by his status as the most marked rider in the peloton, with the 22-year-old Grégoire hanging on to take the overall win and Olav Kooij sprinting to his third stage win of the race.But, really, the day was about Thomas. In a sport characterised by increasing insularity, he has always encapsulated the air of a club cyclist, selfless teammate, and genial bloke in the pub. Stoic and resilient, there were also some genuine lows during Thomas’s career. With a little more luck, there could have been several more highs.The summer after winning the yellow jersey in Paris, he finishedsecond in the 2019 Tour de Franceto his teammate Egan Bernal, after a winter of celebratory excess. As Bernal took the yellow jersey to Paris, Thomas was asked when he’d realised back‑to-back Tour wins might prove beyond him. “Last November, to be honest,” he deadpanned.In 2023 he led the Giro d’Italia into the final time-trial and was favourite to win but came undone on the climb to Monte Lussari, wherePrimoz Roglic overhauled the Welshmanto win thecorsa rosaby only 14 seconds. “That’s life,” Thomas said. “You don’t always get what you deserve. It’s ups and downs, but it’s how you come back from those downs.”Thomas was distraught but forgot his woes quickly enough to revert to playing the role of loyal friend, offering former BritishCyclingacademy teammate Mark Cavendish an expert lead-out the next afternoon in the Giro’s final stage in Rome.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But to come back from the downs is just as important as those wins.”Looking back, Thomas said he felt that he had been “lucky my whole career, really, with how things have panned out”, adding: “Being able to be in my prime for the home Olympics, finishing here, the fact that the Tour of Britain is in September and I can do it as my last race. It’s all aligned.View image in fullscreenRomain Grégoire (centre, green) shadows challenger Remco Evenepoel (left) up Caerphilly mountain.Photograph: Huw Fairclough/Getty Images“It’s strange it’s finishing, because it’s been my life since I was a junior. You’re always thinking of the next race, you’re always working towards something. So not having that tomorrow morning will be strange, but it’s the right time [to stop], for sure.”After a first skiing holiday this winter, Thomas is expected to step into a management role at Ineos Grenadiers before the 2026 season. He said his new job description, in a role for which he is expected to be mentored by Dave Brailsford, is “pretty much done”.“As a rider, I have definitely got a lot of knowledge and feel like I can help out the boys, but then there’s also a lot of other stuff behind the scenes that as riders you don’t really see,” Thomas said. “I feel like I’ve got a lot to give.”Explore more on these topicsTour of BritainGeraint ThomasTeam IneosCyclingnewsShareReuse this content",

Those who refused to provide their details, or were found to have been arrested while already on bail, were taken to custody suites.The 857 people arrested under the Terrorism Act will be investigated by the Met’s counter-terrorism command.An estimated 1,500 people took part in the protest in Parliament Square in Westminster on Saturday. The Met condemned as “intolerable” the abuse it said its officers had suffered, saying they had “been punched, kicked, spat on and had objects thrown at them by protesters”.The deputy assistant commissioner Claire Smart, who led the policing operation, said on Sunday: “I’d like to thank all officers involved in yesterday’s operation for their professionalism and tireless work despite the level of abuse that they faced.“The violence we encountered during the operation was coordinated and carried out by a group of people, many wearing masks to conceal their identity, intent on creating as much disorder as possible. Many of those individuals have now been arrested and we have begun securing charges.“The contrast between this demonstration and the other protests we policed yesterday, including the Palestine Coalition march attended by around 20,000 people, was stark. You can express your support for a cause without committing an offence under the Terrorism Act or descending into violence and disorder, and many thousands of people do that in London every week.“We have a duty to enforce the law without fear or favour. If you advertise that you are intending to commit a crime, we have no option but to respond accordingly.”The protest’s organisers, the campaign group Defend Our Juries (DOJ), said the rally was peaceful and called on the new home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, to drop the “unenforceable” ban.A spokesperson said: “Fifteen hundred people entirely peacefully defying the ban, holding cardboard signs in quiet dignity, sends a clear and powerful message to the new home secretary as she takes up her position: such an unjust law which the public will not accept will inevitably have to be abandoned. These mass acts of defiance will continue until the ban is lifted.”On Sunday, the defence secretary, John Healey, said Mahmood would be “just as tough” on Palestine Action as her predecessor, Yvette Cooper, who moved to the Foreign Office as part of Keir Starmer’s cabinet reshuffle on Friday.“If we want to avoid a two-tier policing and justice system in this country, when people break the law, there have to be consequences,” Healey told Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips. “That’s what was happening yesterday, and I, we, almost everybody shares the agony when we see the images from Gaza, the anguish when we see the man-made starvation, and for people who want to voice their concern and protest, I applaud them. But that does not require them to link it to support for Palestine Action, a proscribed group.”Palestine Action was proscribed as a terrorist organisation in July after the group claimed responsibility for an action in which two Voyager planes were damaged at RAF Brize Norton on 20 June.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content",

However, conflicting signals are emerging from within Iran.Araghchi said he had made progress in recent talks with the UN weapons inspectors on their terms for their return toIran’s bombed nuclear sites, one of the preconditions set by Europe before it would defer the snapback.But the conservative-dominated Iranian parliament is still discussing a bill that would require Iran to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if UN sanctions were restored, a move that would free Iran from all requirements to allow UN weapons inspectors into Iran and so shut off all independent access to its nuclear sites.Araghchi’s Guardian article is a reproach to the traditional European powers on Iran – France, Germany and the UK – challenging them to explain why it is in their self-interest to have shifted away from being mediators for an multilateral agreement between Iran and the US, and instead “become a facilitator of America’s excesses”. Araghchi met with the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, in Doha last Thursday.He claims European leaders have made a huge mistake if they think that by being tough with Iran, the US president, Donald Trump, will stop viewing them as secondary actors and give them a place on the world stage.The return of UN sanctions “will only exclude the three countries from future diplomatic processes, with widespread negative consequences for the whole of Europe in terms of its credibility and global standing,” he wrote.“President Trump has made it clear that he views the three European countries as secondary players, and this is evident in the exclusion of Europe from issues that are vital to its future, including the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Washington’s message is clear: to gain a foothold, the three countries must demonstrate unwavering loyalty.”He also claims that if Israel tries to relaunch the12-day war on Iranit fought in June, it will have to run back to the US for help, a reference to Israel’s dependence on US military hardware.“Israel may present itself as capable of fighting on behalf of the west, but as we saw in June, the truth is that Iran’s powerful armed forces are once again ready and capable of defeating Israel to the point where it will be forced to turn to ‘Grandpa’ for salvation.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaNuclear weaponsUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content",

The main features of the condition include irregular periods; excess of the hormone androgen, which is linked to excess facial or body hair; and polycystic ovaries, which are when the ovaries are enlarged and contain many fluid-filled sacs.Published by the all-party parliamentary group on PCOS, the report consists of oral evidence sessions, a survey of more than 2,000 patients on their experiences, as well as freedom of information requests to all 42 Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) in England.I was diagnosed with PCOS – and was soon drowning in misinformationRead moreThe survey also revealed that only 3% of patients with the condition felt supported by healthcare providers, with almost a third (28%) feeling dismissed or not taken seriously.“PCOS affects one in eight women and those assigned female at birth, yet for too long it has been sidelined in policy, overlooked in funding, and misunderstood in practice,” said Michelle Welsh, Labour MP for Sherwood Forest and chair of the APPG on PCOS. “This report sets out a clear and urgent case for reform. If we are serious about improving women’s health, we must act now to break the cycle,” she said.Stark inequalities were also highlighted by the report, with women from Black and Asian backgrounds being up to 2.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with the condition, and those from ethnic minority backgrounds more likely to present with more severe symptoms such as insulin resistance.Dr Itunu Johnson-Sogbetun, GP and founder of the Royal College of GPs’ Women’sHealthSpecial Interest Group, said the report reflected “what many of us with PCOS already know from lived experience: care is fragmented, diagnosis is delayed, and long-term risks are too often ignored.”She said: “PCOS is a multisystem condition, yet the NHS frequently treats it narrowly as a fertility or gynaecological issue. The report rightly highlights the postcode lottery of care, the lack of national pathways, and the absence of coordinated support for the metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychological complications that come with PCOS.”The study also highlighted that the absence of Nice primary care guidance for PCOS had created a postcode lottery for patients, with variations in care across regions of the UK. And as a result, diagnosis often depends on individual clinician judgment, which can result in inconsistent and uncertain care.Rachel Morman, chair of the PCOS charity Verity, said: “While this inquiry is about PCOS, it really is a barometer for how we value and prioritise women’s health across the entire system.For a condition affecting millions across the UK, with a significant cost burden to the NHS when not managed proactively in integrated care settings, this level of neglect is unacceptable. We welcome the report and its recommendations, and stand ready to work with the government to deliver the change that is so urgently needed.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said:“Women suffering with gynaecological conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), have been failed for far too long.“That’s why we are turning the commitments in the Women’s Health Strategy into tangible action, already delivering 4.9 million extra appointments, tackling gynaecology waiting lists using the private sector, improving training for doctors on women’s health, and updating guidance to improve the treatment and management of PCOS.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's healthHealthnewsShareReuse this content",

Knowing who to approach and when in this context is key to this problem and that is where the CCRC fails.“Despite being the only body with the power to request documents and exhibits for further testing, they frequently refuse to do this, arguing that it would be pure speculation.“Far too frequently they shelter behind the proposition that since these steps might have been taken by the defence at or before the trial, it is no longer appropriate for access to be afforded, even though objectively there appears to have been a flagrant misunderstanding of this evidence at trial.”The CCRC has faced criticism over its handling of cases including those ofAndrew Malkinson, who spent 17 years in jail for a rape he did not commit; andPeter Sullivan, whose murder conviction was overturnedin May after 38 years.In June,a parliamentary inquiry criticised “complacency”with respect to scientific understanding within the CCRC and recommended recruitment of permanent staff members with scientific backgrounds.Priston said it would be impossible for the CCRC to have all the different fields of science covered but it was essential that it took advice “from people who know better than them”.Tracy Alexander, a former president of the British Academy of Forensic Sciences, said that external experts could help the CCRC but Inside Justice’s offers to help had been rebuffed.She said: “We’ve said to them on countless occasions: ‘We have experts in pretty much every field, we are free, why don’t you let us have a look? We’ll advise you.’ And they say: ‘No, because you’re obviously on the side of the guilty party, and you’ll be biased.’ The whole point of forensic investigation is that you’re not biased one way or the other. You’re supposed to interpret the evidence and then come up with an answer, and if a test will prove it one way or the other, you get the test done.”She said that the CCRC had hired retired police officers “who also know bugger all about forensic opportunities” and failed to understand that DNA “is not a barcode of guilt”, given how readily it was transferred.Alexander claimed the watchdog was “not fit for purpose” and yet police forceswill not release evidential material directly to prisonersand their lawyers.More miscarriages of justice ‘inevitable’, says CCRC review lawyer after Peter Sullivan freedRead more“Put some responsibility on police forces to hang on to their exhibits and then hand them over,” she said. “Because if somebody can get a decent barrister and a team of experts to support them with further testing, then why are we spending money on the CCRC?”A CCRC spokesperson said: “We regularly engage with external scientific experts during our case reviews. We also use our special legal powers to obtain forensic evidence held by the police.“We have recently supplemented our existing in-house expertise by appointing a full-time forensic science and expert evidence adviser to provide support reviewing forensic aspects of cases, assist in devising forensic strategies and engaging with the most appropriate experts to carry out further work on individual cases.”They said casework staff receive up-to-date training on forensic science.Explore more on these topicsCriminal Cases Review CommissionUK criminal justicePrisons and probationnewsShareReuse this content",

A moratorium on logging within its boundaries begins on Monday.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe announcement was widely welcomed by forest advocates. The Wilderness Society called it a “once-in-a-generation decision” that would give the state’s koalas “a real chance of survival”.Gary Dunnett, from the National Parks Association, said the “park will ensure future generations will be able to see koalas, greater gliders and other threatened species in the wild for many years to come”.The environment minister, Penny Sharpe, said the park was “incredibly important” for the future of the species – which has been on a trajectory to become extinct in NSW by 2050. The government hoped it would become an “iconic” destination for tourists.Speakman said that while habitat protection was an important part of protecting koalas, it was not the full answer. He called the news “a significant announcement, but not as significant as what the Coalition did”.View image in fullscreenChris Minns at Bongil Bongil national park, Bundagen, Coffs Harbour, where he announced details of the government’s great koala national park.Photograph: David Wigley/AAP“We had a $193m koala strategy, which included funds for scientific research dealing with road strikes and disease,” he said.“That $193m package was better. It aimed to not just stop the decline but increase numbers,” he said. Speakman said there was a lack of detail in the announcement and it appeared contingent on getting funds from the federal government carbon credits scheme.When last in government,the issue of koala protections on private landcaused friction between NSW Liberals and Nationals and briefly split the NSW Coalition in 2021.Then NSW planning minister, Rob Stokes, eventually came up witha compromise, which exempted most rural sitesfrom the State Environmental Planning Policy (Sepp) and the Nationals continued in the Coalition.Timber harvesting within the proposed park’s boundaries will pause on Monday and affected mills – said to be six of over 20 in the region – will be offered transition packages.The Nationals hold many of the north coast seats.Saunders claimed the decision would “wipe out 40% of the state’s future hardwood supply” and force up construction costs.“This decision is almost unbelievable but sadly true to form for a government that has shown a complete disregard for this important industry and what it contributes to our state,” he said.The NSW premier, Chris Minns, told a media conference in Coffs Harbour on Sunday that 90% of the timber used in housing construction was soft woods, rather than the hardwoods that come from native forest logging.He said the reduction in wood supply that would occur as a result of ending logging within the great koala national park accounted for about 15-20% of the state’s hardwood supply but only 1.2% nationally. He said establishment of the park would depend on the government being able to win support for the legislation in the state parliament.The Minns government has so far directed $140m to the park as well as additional funding for tourism and support for workers at affected mills in the region.The opposition north coast spokesperson, Gurmesh Singh, said the timber industry had suggested a “more manageable” 37,000-hectare option for the park.Loss of koala habitat shows ‘total failure’ of nature laws, conservationists sayRead more“This decision will hurt our communities in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, ripping out valuable jobs that allow people to put food on the table,” Singh said.Timber NSW accused the government of valuing “politics above science and people”.Its chief executive, Maree McCaskill, said the decision showed disregard for the “livelihoods of people in country areas”.Support for affected timber mills and workersThe park was subject to a lengthy scientific assessment before the announcement, and the decision comes with a broad support package for workers at affected timber mills as well as financial assistance for businesses.The government is offering priority placement for affected Forestry Corporation workers if they wish to transfer into the NSW national parks and wildlife service.The government estimates the park’s value as a tourism destination will generate an extra $163m for the state’s economy over two decades. The native logging division of NSW Forestry Corporation hasrun at a loss for several years.Sharpe acknowledged there were people who wouldn’t like the decision, but it was incredibly important to preserve one of the state’s most iconic species.“This area is home to over 100 threatened species. It’s a very important conservation outcome, but it’s also a really exciting opportunity for the mid-north coast in New South Wales,” she said“We want it to be when people come to Australia, you know, they go and see the Great Barrier Reef, they go and see Uluru and they come and see the great koala national park,” she said.Sharpe said the government was planning to formally legislate the park next year but issues related to wood supply needed to be worked through with industry first as did a proposal to establish a carbon credit project within the park that is being considered by the Albanese government.The NSW Greens environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, who is based in the state’s north, said the long-awaited announcement was a victory for the communities, First Nations leaders, scientists and forest defenders who never gave up.“Now the government must keep going and protect the Richmond River koala stronghold, commit to the Great Southern Forest national park on the south coast, and end native forest logging across NSW,” she said.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesNew South Wales politicsWildlifeTrees and forestsConservationnewsShareReuse this content",

Brown-ish yellow and bumpy in texture, it had been made – or rather, grown – entirely from mushrooms. His journey, if successful, would mark the world’s longest open-water journey in a kayak built from this unique material.View image in fullscreen‘Shoemaker’s kayak was no ordinary kayak. Brown-ish yellow and bumpy in texture, it had been made – or rather, grown – entirely from mushrooms.’Photograph: Jordan Freeman/Courtesy of Sam ShoemakerWith his phone, GoPro camera, walkie talkie, and a compass affixed to his life vest, Shoemaker left shortly before 6am in order to avoid the worst of the swells in the forecast. But three hours in and powering through his ninth mile, the coastline still out of sight, Shoemaker began feeling seasick.Suddenly, he heard the sound of a large animal breaching the waters. To his left, a fin whale flashed its glistening tail, then trailed slowly behind him. As the 50-ft creature followed him for three more miles, Shoemaker found the strength to finish out the maiden voyage.“It was just like a psychedelic experience,” he says of the crossing, which took him 12 hours.As he stumbled onto shore with his mushroom kayak still intact, the artist and mycologist embraced his friends and family. All of them hoped this voyage would usher in a new wave of curiosity about the unconventional fungus material, which Shoemaker and others argue is a more environmentally-friendly option than the plastics that are used extensively in boats and other aquatic recreation.From gallery walls to open seaShoemaker began his career as an artist creating sculptures with propagated mushrooms. Upon returning to Los Angeles after graduating from Yale with an MFA in 2020, he began exhibiting artwork that captured the unique behavior of mushrooms as they grew out ofhand-built ceramic vessels and blown glass.Eventually, his interests grew beyond the gallery walls. Shoemaker now belongs to a small community of scientists and artists exploring the potentiality of fungal innovation as an alternative material that could be used in everything from kayaks and buoys to surfboards.Their focus is on mycelium – the network of threads that support the growth of fungi and mushrooms. Though it tends to do the brunt of its work underground or in a substrate, it is a pivotal connective tissue in the animal kingdom. Mycelium-based materials in an aquatic context are known as AquaFung, a term coined by Shoemaker’s mentor Phil Ross, an artist and the co-founder of a biotechnology company called MycoWorks that engineers mycelium-based materials including amushroom “leather”that can be used in furniture, handbags and biomedical equipment. After cofounding MyCoWorks, Ross also opened an open source mycology research lab at Stanford University called Open Fung.View image in fullscreenGymnopilus ventricosus, commonly known as “jumbo gym”, were used to stain the paddle for Shoemaker’s kayak.Photograph: Courtesy of Sam ShoemakerRoss argues that AquaFung has many of the appealing properties as plastic – such as being lightweight and buoyant – but without the harmful footprint. “People hate Styrofoam plastics in the water washing onto shore,” says Ross. “[AquaFung] is biodegradable. It acts a lot like the material that everyone seems to hate.”Shoemaker began working on his first mycelium boat in 2024 with harvested wildGanoderma polychromum myceliumoutside his Los Angeles studio. He modified a used fishing kayak to serve as his fiberglass mold, then grew the mycelium network inside the mold, which held over 300lbs of inoculated hemp substrate to support the cultivation. After propagating the mycelium for almost four weeks, Shoemaker meticulously dried the resulting kayak compositestructure using fans over the course of several months.After incubation, the dried mycelium exhibits a strong, hydrophobic material. To the touch, it feels rough and durable, like cork. And it doesn’t keep the same consistency in color and texture throughout – a testament to the mushroom’s wildness.Confident in his prototype, Shoemaker began searching for appropriate support.Shoemaker met Patrick Reed, the lead curator of the Pasadena-based arts organizationFulcrum Arts, in December 2023 through mutual friends. After a studio visit, Reed was blown away by everything that the artist had to show him, fondly remembering their conversation to be “incredibly exciting and stimulating”. It aligned with Fulcrum Arts’ mission to support artists pursuing social change at the intersection of art and science, and the pair entered into an official collaboration in early 2024.Shoemaker completed his second mushroom boat in June; grown from the same wildGanoderma polychromummycelium, the kayak was propagated on over 520lbs of a hemp hard substrate packed inside a new fiberglass mold. Shoemaker allowed the boat to grow over six weeks, then took another three months to dry it. At 107lbs, the new kayak is three feet shorter, but 50% larger by volume for more buoyancy and stability. It also featured a keel to improve tracking and rigidity.View image in fullscreenSam Shoemaker works on a mushroom kayak in his studio.Photograph: Jordan Freeman/Courtesy of Sam ShoemakerThe community of AquaFung enthusiasts, spanning mycologists, artists, fisherman, farmers and hobbyists alike, is vigorous but nascent. The completion of Shoemaker’s boat marks the second ever water-tested mushroom boat to be made after Katy Ayers, who holdsthe Guinness World Recordfor growing, then testing, what was then the world’s longest fungal mycelium boat on a Nebraska lake in 2019.“A lot of people really didn’t think it was possible,” says Ayers, who grew her boat after being inspired by a documentary called Super Fungi. “I had reached out to companies who actually make the biomaterials, and their spokespeople weren’t confident in it working, but I was confident and naive enough to give it a shot and figure out what the shortcomings were.”The future is … mushroom?Ayers and Shoemaker credits mycology pioneers like Ross for making the technology more accessible. And mushroom-based materials are slowly beginning to pop up in the mainstream: In 2021, Stella McCartney made headlines with its launch of the world’s first-ever garments made from lab-grown mushroom leather, in consultation with Ross.Ross calls Sam’s voyage “remarkable”, and hopes it inspires other scientific institutions to take this work more seriously. “[Sam] did it before Stanford and Caltech, and it happened in his backyard. This whole field is led by designers and artists, and it’s not because they’re the best scientists, but they are aware of the future before everybody else.”But Shoemaker is wary of promising that mushrooms will revolutionise the industry just yet. He points out that it required a year’s worth of time and resources to produce just one kayak, one that still remains slower and heavier than a store-bought ocean kayak.“People talk about mushrooms being this utopian future where plastic problems go away, [but] this is not the silver bullet where boats are easier to make,” he says. “I’m pleased with how far this project has gone, but there’s a long way to go.”View image in fullscreenSam Shoemaker in the waters off Catalina Island.Photograph: Jordan Freeman/Courtesy of Sam ShoemakerFor now, he plans to continue the dialogue with other artists, mycologists and hobbyists, and make his open-source compendium, with over 70 pages of research, methodology and diagrams, available to the public. A full exhibition of his materials and kayak will take place at the Fulcrum Arts’ space in Pasadena in October.“There’s probably some 19-year-old kid out there who thinks ‘I could do that,’ and they can,” says Shoemaker. “The biggest compliment that they could pay me is to go and build a better boat and attempt a crossing even more ambitious than mine.”After Shoemaker’s success, Ayers also sees hope for a more fungal future.“I’ve been waiting for somebody else to do this for years now. The first thing I thought when my boat went out was, ‘Please somebody try and beat this record because that gives me a reason to try again,’” she says. “If we can continue to inspire each other and make better things, who knows, maybe we’ll see a floating colony of mushroom houses.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsSustainable developmentfeaturesShareReuse this content",

It is an account of a study by a Cambridge expert who works at something ominously called the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk; he concludes that “we can’t put a date on Doomsday, but by looking at the 5,000 years of [civilisation], we can understand the trajectories we face today – and self-termination is most likely”.I can’t claim to have done a study, though I have been at work on climate change for almost 40 years and I gotta say: seems about right. So it’s maybe not the worst moment for a bit of worry about how you would fare in the case of a temporary breakdown of our civilization. Perhaps you have noticed that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and violent. Or you read the stories that Donald Trump was shutting down the Federal Emergency Management Agency and surmised you’ll have to take care of yourself going forward. Or hey, maybe you think a cabal of pedophiles might try and use black helicopters to herd you into a15-minute citywhere a communist mayor will make you spend the rest of your life riding a scary subway.If you look at it one way, [solar power] is energy for hyper-individualistsWhatever. I am not telling you what to prep for – I’m just here to talk about the energy supply for your bunker. And in the process, make the case that maybe it’s time for rightwing nutjobs to join us leftwing nutjobs in embracing solar energy. Not because it’s nice for the environment – heaven forbid. But because it works. Including under adverse conditions when everything goes to hell.It’s not the obvious choice, perhaps. At least in the US, conservatism is heavily identified with fossil fuel; the Trump administration has spent the last months doing everything it can think of to stymiesolar and wind powerand to boost hydrocarbons, going so far as toshut downan 80% finished windfarm off the coast of Rhode Island. So, it’s understandable that in a lot of cases, your diehard prepper will be inclined to use what he knows and trusts. It’s not just Trump, of course – there’s also the work that big oil has done to pitch itself as manly, the idea that the climate change is a hobbyhorse of those scientific “elites”, and so on.View image in fullscreenWind turbine components at the Revolution Wind construction hub in Providence, Rhode Island, last year.Photograph: Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThat is why you can go on Reddit and find long exchanges about, say, how to keep jerrycans of diesel fuel fresh over the years. (It turns out that diesel can grow algae – the consensus on the forum is that if you store it in metal cans in the dark you are probably good for a couple of years, though you may want to buy some “diesel biocide” just in case.Here’ssome available online, just $185 a gallon.)But say you imagine the emergency might last a little longer – then things just keep getting harder. Here’s how one prepper on the forum outlined his dilemma:I currently have three 275 gallon fuel oil tanks. 2 are in my basement and filled with diesel. One will be put somewhere outside with gasoline. I just picked up 3 70s-80’s vintage gas pumps that are supposedly in working order. What is everyone doing for home refueling? Concrete pads for the pumps and tanks? What are you doing to protect the pumps from getting run into or damaged from snowplows? How are you ensuring 250+ gallons of gas gets turned over and refilled before it goes bad? I was thinking of selling to close friends and neighbors either at cost or at a slight loss to make sure the fuel is always fresh.I guess that might be workable – running your own gas station for your neighbors, albeit at a slight loss. (If they’re old like me, you could lure them in with free drinking glasses.)But say the emergency goes on longer than that, and you have torefillyour tanks. At some point you are likely to realize what an incredibly complicated system you have tied yourself into, with multiple failure points everywhere. To get oil these days you basically need a company sophisticated enough to drill a couple of miles below the ocean; to get natural gas you need drillers able to detonate explosives miles beneath the Earth’s surface to “frack” the deposits into flowing. And then you need to be able to pipe your crude to a massive refinery where it can be separated into various components, and then a fleet of trucks to carry it to gas stations and so on. Once you have it, the engine that it goes in has to be properly maintained – there’s a lot of engineering involved in making a flammable liquid burn at a steady pace and, say, move power to wheels, which is why there are about 2,000 parts in the drivetrain of an internal combustion vehicle. Any of them can and do break, at which point you would better have a pretty good stock in your bunker unless you are absolutely sure your local Pep Boys is going to be up and running.Or – and bear with me here a minute – you could go solar. Again, I understand that Trump hates it. “It’s all steel and glass and wires,” hetolda California gathering shortly before the last election. “It looks like hell. And you see rabbits get caught in it … It’s just terrible.” But maybe aesthetics is not your primary concern and maybe you hunt rabbits, anyway – in that case, solar has a lot to recommend it for us average paranoiacs. In fact, I think you could go so far as to say that it is the one form of power that matches up almost perfectly with a rational conservative outlook: if you look at it one way, it is energy for hyper-individualists.View image in fullscreenThe government in Victoria, Australia, announced last year it will spend $370m to build a huge solar and battery farm, which it said will be able to power more than 50,000 homes.Illustration: Rended image courtesy VIC governmentFor one thing, it works – for a really, really long time. My oldest solar panels have been up on the roof for a quarter century and they are still going strong; the oldest solar array in France wasjust testedand 30 years later it was still at 80% of its original output. And you can now easily connect solar panels to batteries – some even come from that Nazi-adjacent billionaire Elon Musk (though there are alsoplenty of competitorsnow, in case you want non-fascist electron storage). Once you have got a battery in the basement, the afternoon’s sunshine can last all day. Indeed, if you have thought ahead and bought, say, a Ford F-150 Lightning, the electric version of America’s most popular vehicle, you have battery enough to keep your house running for days and days.But best of all there is no complicated system to plug into. It’s just you and the sun, and the sun is currently predicted to go on burning for 5bn years (after which, admittedly, you’re on your own).We cannot stop climate change, but maybe we can stop it short of the place where it cuts civilization off at the kneesSimilarly, the stuff you can get to use all that electricity to is super-duper simple. Take that Ford Lightning, or indeed any electric vehicle: it has about 20 moving parts in the drivetrain. I know that good red-hatted Americans are supposed to be a little suspicious of EVs – our president has explained that they “only drive for 15 minutes before you have to get a charge”. (You would think he would have more respect, the golf carts at his courses are electric and carry his considerable bulk for 18 holes). But in fact EVs are now high-performance vehicles (if you must, you can actually get anelectric Hummer), and they are incredibly self-supporting. When I was buying mine – again, early on – the salesman offered me six free oil changes. I looked at him for a little while, and then he blushed and offered me free floor mats instead. Tires need changing, but that’s about it.And here’s the thing: you just plug your EV into the solar panels and the batteries in your house. You never need to worry about the gas station running out of gas, or running out power. And you know, just in case, I would get an e-bike too; the manual backup (they’re called pedals) is already in place.I think back often to the first couple of Mad Max movies, especially the ever popular Mad Max 2, which came out in 1981. Mel Gibson is wandering a post-apocalyptic Australian outback (energy crisis, environmental collapse, never really specified) and his main quest is for oil. In a major plot point, he helps defend a besieged refinery in return for some petrol (gyrocopters, deadly steel boomerang). Even in this desperate future, it is all about the oil.View image in fullscreen‘Mad Max was good entertainment but bad prepping’ … A still from Mad Max (1979) by George Miller.Photograph: AlamyThat made sense at the time, because when the movie was made, solar panels were still basically a toy – they were most likely to be found in calculators and wrist watches; a roof full of panels would have been prohibitively expensive. You had no choice in a 1980s-era apocalypse to try to live off whatever oil still remained (especially if you wanted to drive around the desert in a souped-up dune buggy). But since 1981, the price of a solar panel has dropped about 99% and so has the price of a battery. In Australia, as a result, about 40% of homes now have solar panels on the roof. It is so easy and cheap it is almost incredible. As the electrification guru Saul Griffithwrote recently:Our rooftops generateover 10% of total energy supply. For an individual household with a large rooftop, it pays to install more than you need. My friend Fred’s house produces 141% of the electricity it needs in a year to run an entirely electric life including 2 cars and a heated pool. This is true abundance.An Australian system costs a third of what it will currently run you in America. That’s largely because we raise the price with a lot of unnecessary permitting, which is another place where left and right could easily meet. Why should the government be keeping you from harvesting the electrons that fall on your roof? It’s a conspiracy! Actually, it kind of is: it suits the utilities to keep us hooked to the current ways of doing business.That is why we are stagingSun Daylater this month: a big nationwide celebration of clean energy with some pretty pointed efforts to make local governments change their ways. If we can’t move Washington right now, we can at least pressure blue city halls and state legislatures, and maybe some red ones too: earlier this spring deep-red Utah became the first state to allow European-style “balcony solar”, those apartment-scale solar panels you just hang from your veranda and plug into your wall.What I’m saying is, Mad Max was good entertainment but bad prepping. Even if you find an oil tanker to hijack, you’re still going to run out of fuel pretty fast; it seems likely there is a finite number of old oil tankers. Whereas the sun, the sun just keeps rising. Why not just kick back and enjoy the easy life with your solar panels? No need to be Mad Max - you can be Chill Max, running your fridge and your piña colada machine and every other appliance you can imagine.There were never any climate havens: floods in the midwest, hurricanes in AppalachiaRead moreDo I think prepping for a disaster is the best reason to put up solar panels? I do not. I think avoiding a disaster is the best reason: the rapid buildout of solar and wind and batteries is the first scalable solution to the climate crisis that has emerged in all these decades I have been at work. If we put up enough of it quickly enough (say, at the pace China is currently going), then we would take some of the sting out of global heating. We cannot stop climate change, but maybe we can stop it short of the place where it cuts civilization off at the knees.But I know plenty of people who think more individually than societally, whose main concern is the fate of themselves and their families. So it pleases me that for them the answer is the same: a solar panel makes your home truly your castle. If you want to defend it with an AR-15 – well, now you have got something worth defending.That is why, I think, that Sun Day seems to be drawing in all types, from unreconstructed hippies to entrepreneurs to evangelical pastors who are setting up hundreds of events across the country. In a moment when our incredibly polarized society makes it hard to do much of anything, that is worth at least a modest celebration. Socome outon 21 September to celebrate the rise of clean energy, to make it easier to put up panels – and to meet your neighbors. And by the way, knowing your neighbors is a pretty good survival technology too.Bill McKibben is the author of the forthcoming Here Comes the Sun, and the founder of Sun Day",

They are the reason China has already won the battle for the energy of the 21st century.‘Keeping us hooked on fossil fuels’: how can we negotiate with autocracies on the climate crisis?Read moreIf history is any guide, the country that dominates energy usually dominates economics and politics, which is why it is not just old war allies that are cosying up to Beijing. Narendra Modi, the president of longtime rival India, also visited China last week for the biggest ever meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation along with dozens of other regional leaders. The European Commission president, Ursulavon der Leyen,led a delegation to Beijing this summer to coordinate climate policy. The Brazilian executive secretary of Cop30 will visit next week with a similar mission, knowing the success or failure of the annual climate summit now depends on China more than any other nation.Expectations for Chinese climate leadership are rising in tandem with dismay at the US, which will attend Cop30 as an observer and disrupter that, under Donald Trump, appears to be trying to lurch backwards towards a 20th century comfort zone of oil, gas and coal.China’s fossil fuel emissionsThe contrast could become even more striking once China confirms it has reached apositive tipping pointafter which it will irreversibly shift away from fossil fuels. Last year, the world’s biggest carbon emitter registered a very slight decline in greenhouse gas output. Many analystsbelieve this meansthe country’s carbon use will peak this year or very soon. If that is confirmed, it would be a moment of considerably greater significance than Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from UN climate negotiations.The timing will be clearer when China unveils its revised nationally determined contribution (NDC), the climate actions plans countries promised to provide under the Paris agreement. This announcement, expected before next month’s UN general assembly, will be one of this year’s most eagerly watched declarations because no other country has been able to match China’s power to make or break the Paris targets to hold global heating between 1.5C and 2C.View image in fullscreenMiners stand in a locker room at a coal mine and processing facility in Liulin, Shanxi province, China.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesBut how real are the hopes China will step up and show greater leadership on finance and emission cuts, as well as renewable manufacturing?There have been false dawns in the past. Coal – the most polluting of fossil fuels – drove China’s supercharged economic growth for most of the past three decades, though production declined for a few years in the wake of the global financial crisis and plateaued briefly during the Covid lockdown. Whether predictions of peak carbon prove more substantial this time will depend on the Beijing leadership’s next five-year plan, a domestic policy document for 2026-2030 being drawn up by the leadership in Beijing.Trump’s $1tn for Pentagon to add huge planet-heating emissions, study showsRead moreSpeculation about the priorities continues to swirl. On one side is caution and a sense of justice that China should not try to step into the void left by the US because that would allow the latter to escape its responsibility as the world’s biggest historic emitter. On the other is geopolitical ambition and the momentum of an economy increasingly reliant on renewable energy investment for growth.While China’s overall GDP expansion is slowing, the speed of cleantech investment remains breathtakingly fast. Last year, the amount of wind and solar under construction was double the rest of the world combined, helping Chinato reach aninstalled capacity of 1,200GW six years ahead of the government’s schedule.The country is similarly ascendant in supplying overseas markets with renewable technology. Last year for the first time, the top four wind turbine makers in the world were all Chinese. It is asimilar storyof majority market share for the manufacture and export of photovoltaic cells and electric vehicles.When it comes to clean energy, it no longer makes sense to talk about competition, says Li Shuo, the director of China Climate Hub atthe Asia Society.“There is only one player. The US is not even in the room. I have full confidence that dynamic will continue.”In the run-up to Belém, the contrast with the US looks ever more stark and is likely to shape geopolitics for decades to come. Under Trump, the US has shut down climate research centres, promised to drill for more gas and declared this to be “the moment” for coal. Meanwhile, $22bn in clean energy projects have been cancelled and wind powerinvestment has shrunkto its lowest level in a decade.View image in fullscreenWind turbines above photovoltaic panels operate at the tidal flat industry demonstration base in Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesChina may not be in favour of multiparty democracy at home, but on the global stage its officials have made clear it will be a champion of multilateral decision making.Xi has not tried to fill the void left by Trump, but he has presented himself – and China – as a reliable and constructive partner, particularly on the climate issue: “However the world may change, China will not slow down its climate actions, will not reduce its support for international cooperation, and will not cease its efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind,” hesaid thisyear.Before previous Cops, senior US and Chinese negotiations often held a bilateral meeting to ensure the world’s two biggest emitters were on the same page. This year, China held separate climate talks with the EU and affirmed they wouldwork together toachieve a successful Cop30 with “ambitious and equitable” outcomes.Von der Leyen calledthe joint declaration a big step forward. “Together, the European Union and China must uphold the Paris agreement. Now more than ever,” she said.China’s renewable energy capacityThe text did not mention the main areas of friction between the signatories: China’s fast-growing share of sales of electric cars, batteries and solar panels, its stranglehold on critical minerals needed for wind turbine magnets, and its continued heavy investment in coal.Scientists and campaigners say the climate will not be stabilised solely by selling more photovoltaic cells or windmill blades; it is also necessary to phase out fossil fuels. On this half of the balance sheet, China’s record remains “highly insufficient” and its current policies would, if continued, push the planet towards 4C of heating, according toClimate Action Tracker, an independent initiative assessing countries’ compliance with the Paris agreement. It points out that China is off course from the commitments it previously made to “strictly limit” coal use and to reduce energy and carbon intensity by 2025.Lauri Myllyvirta of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said Xi had compromised. “He does favour cleaning up the energy system and moving to a cleaner economy more broadly – this is a consistent and longstanding feature in his speeches – but clearly it’s not an overriding priority for him when there is pushback.”The pushback has been most evident in the coal sector, where there has been a surge of investment in the past two years to the highest level in a decade. Major domestic coal companies, such as CHN Energy, Jinneng and Shaanxi Coal and Chemical, have considerable political influence. Although they don’t actively campaign against climate science like Exxon in the US, China analyst Qi Qin said they often pushed the energy security narrative by positioning coal as essential for reliability and independence, adding: “A lot of it comes down to concerns about energy security. During 2021–2022, droughts hit hydropower hard, and the system didn’t have the flexibility to handle that well. That led to some power shortages, and since then, there’s been more focus, especially from local governments, on securing local power supply, which partly explains the new wave of coal project approvals and construction.”Even so, renewables has moved faster. The share of fossil fuels inChina’s installed generation capacity has now fallen below half, down from two-thirds a decade ago. Whether this trend continues will depend on a recent change in energy pricing and the level of ambition in the NDC and five-year plan.View image in fullscreenChina's President Xi Jinping (C) and other Chinese leaders attend the closing meeting of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress in 2023.Photograph: XINHUA/Huang Jingwen/EPAIf the government wanted to send a strong signal, it could commit to no new coal power, sectorial targets for electric vehicles, electric steelmaking and building efficiency, and – most importantly – a sizeable cut in overall emissions over a clearly defined period.Li dampened expectations the headline figure would fully align with the Paris targets. “If China were to set a course for a 1.5C world, it would need to cut emissions by 30% by 2035. A 2C world would mean reductions of 20% by the same year. Neither is likely. He said: “We understand the Chinese side is most likely to provide 8-15%. There will be a gap. If that landing zone is where they end up, then there could be the usual story of ‘under promise, over deliver.’”Heexpects specific sectoral targets on how much renewable capacity China will install over the coming decade. “They will be very very big numbers,” Li predicts.The economy may drive ambition more than politics. Belinda Schäpe, a policy analyst at CREA, said existing trends suggested it was still possible for China to reduce emissions by 30% over the coming decade, which would bring huge economic benefits, especially if combined with a continued global energy transition. “This would also strengthen China’s clean energy industries, which could double in value by 2035, adding CNY 15tn ($2.1tn) to the economy.”At Belém, China will also seek to boost sales of renewables and possibly announce deals to build and finance a solar panel manufacturing plant in Brazil, in addition to the BYD electric car factory that is already there. This may have the feel of a trade fair, but the conference organisers said this was in line with the primary goal of Cop30, which is to accelerate action on global heating.Brazilian diplomats also expect their Brics partner to invest in the Tropical Forests Forever Fund, which is the flagship initiative of the summit host. Chinese government sources told the Guardian this proposal was viewed positively in Beijing. Support for this effort to protect standing forests would be a sign of how China is steadilyincreasing climate financeoutside the UN framework as it grows in wealth and responsibility. European diplomats express hope that China will lean in much further during Cop30.Conservation NGOs hope Beijing will do more to crack down on imports of wood products from areas of illegal deforestation. China’s revised forest law theoretically prohibits these items, but it does not demand transparency or due diligence from traders so little has changed. China remains the biggest importer of illegally felled timber.At previous Cop meetings, China has often cut an understated figure relative to its size. But its role is often decisive. At Cop26, it aligned with India to water down the language to fossil fuel “phase down” rather than “phase out” and at the 2009 Cop in Copenhagen, it was criticised for sabotaging the conference. More positively, it was widely credited for helping to get the Paris agreement over the line and last year played a crucial role together with the EU to set a climate finance target, the new quantified collective goal, that most countries could sign up to.China sees itself as a leader of the developing world, but as it has grown richer from renewable technology and is increasingly to blame for the climate crisis (it is now the second biggest emitter), it is under more pressure to cut emissions and pay more to help others do the same. Brazilian diplomats expect their Brics partner to be a quiet but strong supporter of their agenda.How far it goes is still to be seen, but the direction of travel is at least clear – and it is the opposite of the US.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe big emittersGreenhouse gas emissionsChinaAsia PacificXi JinpingCop30featuresShareReuse this content",

In a real emergency, follow the instructions in the alert to keep yourself and others safe.“Find simple and effective advice on how to prepare for emergencies atgov.uk/prepare. Visitgov.uk/alertsfor more information or to view this message in Welsh. Ewch i gov.uk/alerts am ragor o wybodaeth neu i weld y neges hon yn y Gymraeg.”The piercing alarm was designed to override normal volume settings so it could be heard even in noisy environments. The alert system is intended for use in situations where lives are at immediate risk, such as during extreme weather events, terrorist attacks and other major emergencies.Millions of devices sounded, but the alert not activate universally. Older models, phones not connected to 4G or 5G networks and those switched off or set to flight mode were excluded.People could also opt out of receiving emergency alerts. The government stressed that this may be particularly important for domestic abuse survivors who keep a concealed phone.The government said testing “ensures the system continues to work correctly and reaches as many people as possible when it’s needed most”. There are about 87m mobile phones in the UK, but no figure has been given for how many received Sunday’s message.Ministers say such drills are vital. The work and pensions secretary, Pat McFadden, called the alerts a “national fire alarm” that required regular testing. The timing on Sunday also forced adjustments across sport, with kick-offs in football and rugby delayed and England’s cricket match at the Utilita Bowl briefly paused.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The crown dependency – through which Abramovich pumped some of his cash into the west – froze more than $7bn (£5.2bn) of assetssuspected of being linked to himsoon after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.According to the Swiss rulings, Jersey investigators are looking into the very origins of the oligarch’s wealth, acquired during the chaotic, freewheeling rise of capitalism inRussiain the 1990s and 2000s.Abramovich, through his lawyers, denied the allegations and said any suggestion he was involved in criminal activity was false.Lawyers acting for the companies had been seeking to block the release of documents relating to Swiss bank accounts they held. Their appeal was rejected in May, with Swiss judges saying thatJerseyhad presented enough evidence to justify handing over the documents.View image in fullscreenThe sale of Sibneft to the Russian government in 2005 netted Abramovich $13bn.Photograph: Alexander Natruskin/ReutersCopies of the judgments set out how Jersey made its request to Switzerland in connection with two distinct matters.The first concerned suspected money laundering in connection to the proceeds of the sale by Abramovich of his oil and gas company Sibneft, which the Russian government acquired for $13bn in 2005. The rulings state that the former Chelsea proprietor “is alleged to have made corruption payments in the 1990s” while he was building Sibneft into a major fossil fuels group.The second related to potential sanctions breaches involving the transfer of assets suspected of being connected to the oligarch just after he was placed on the Jersey sanctions list following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Jersey is one of the tax havens from which Abramovich managed his fortune, using a network of offshore companies and trusts, that in turn controlled companies with bank accounts in Switzerland.Public information about the case has been limited. In 2023, a court ruling revealed that Jersey’s economic crime and confiscation unit was investigating suspected sanctions breaches, but made no mention of any investigation related to Sibneft.Although the Swiss rulings anonymise names, they disclose other details about the parties and circumstances.The judges decided that these details could be disclosed because the existence of proceedings against Abramovich was already known to the public.An orphan from the Komi republic in Russia’s frozen north, Abramovich made his way up from mechanic to oil and gas trader to the proprietor of a company with licences to exploit some of Russia’s most valuable gas reserves.He sold his controlling stake in Sibneft to the Russian government in 2005. The deal propelled him into the ranks of the global super-rich. The proceeds formed the basis of his fortune, and he went on toinvest his cash in Chelsea FC, new business ventures, hedge funds, luxury properties and acollection of modern European art.The Sibneft billions were the subject of a widely reported dispute with his former associate,Boris Berezovsky, which culminated in a high-stakes legal battle in London’s high court in 2012.View image in fullscreenBoris Berezovsky, a former associate of Abramovich, who died in 2013.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyBerezovskysued Abramovich, claiming the men had a partnership agreement to share the enormous fortunes generated by the formation of Sibneft. Abramovich claimed, among other things, that there was no formal agreement.During the trial, Abramovich also claimed that in order to obtain political influence and protection for his business interests, he had paid Berezovsky, a well-connected businessman, hundreds of millions of dollars in return forkrysha. The word literally means “roof” and is used to refer to protection or patronage in Russia. The judge found for Abramovich.The Swiss rulings set out the arguments made by the Jersey attorney general in a series of requests for mutual legal assistance to obtain banking documents from Switzerland. The requests were made between June 2022 and May 2023.The anonymised rulings state: “G is alleged to have made corruption payments (so-calledKrysha) to H in the 1990s in order to maintain control over the Russian company I or to ensure the survival of the businesses of G and I In 2003 and 2005, G sold its shares in I for $3bn and $13bn, respectively.”The details indicate that “G” is a reference to Abramovich, H to Berezovsky, and I to Sibneft. The Jersey authorities believe the money found its way into various bank accounts, of which the oligarch was the beneficiary. “The Jersey authorities accuse G of money laundering in this context,” the rulings states.They are also investigating financial transactions made at about the time Abramovich was placed on the sanctions list by Jersey on 10 March 2022, specifically whether companies indirectly under his control traded assets and continued to provide financial services, in violation of sanctions law. Sanctions violations are acriminal offence in Jersey, punishable by a prison sentence or fines.After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Abramovich was placed under sanctions by a number of European countries.The UK, whose sanctions on Russia are automatically applied by Jersey, justified its decision by describing him as one of a number of oligarchs“closely associated”to Putin’s regime.Lawyers for the companies in the dispute have argued that Jersey’s investigation was “politically motivated”, according to the Swiss rulings. Their appeal, lodged in 2024, requested explanations from the Jersey authorities as to “why they waited until 2022 to open an investigation into alleged money-laundering allegations in connection with an alleged act of corruption that occurred in the 1990s and which the Jersey authorities must have been aware of since 2012 at the latest”, the rulings state. The judges rejected their appeals.The Swiss judges decided Jersey had presented enough evidence “to substantiate the allegation of money laundering with bribery as a predicate offence”.They concluded: “Billions of dollars in assets were transferred transnationally via various offshore companies, trusts, and banks, including to Switzerland, without any discernible economic reason.“Such actions are likely to thwart the identification, discovery, or confiscation of assets. Whether the assets are of legal origin, as the complainant appears to claim, cannot be assessed at this point; this will be the subject of the criminal proceedings in Jersey.”A spokesperson for the Jersey attorney general’s office said that they could not comment on live investigations. The Swiss law firm that brought the appeal on behalf of the companies was approached for comment.In a statement, lawyers for Abramovich denied the allegations and said their client had not been charged with any crime.“Any suggestion that Mr Abramovich has been involved in criminal activity is false,” they said. “No charges have been brought against our client and there are no criminal proceedings in Jersey involving our client; the Jersey court has in fact confirmed that there are no criminal proceedings against our client pending before the Jersey courts.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Four people were hospitalised at the time.About 16,000 households and businesses in the Brixham area were told by the water companynot to use their tap waterfor drinking without boiling it first.A water tank at Hillhead reservoir had been found to contain the parasite, the company said at the time. The contamination caused mass disruption in the area, with holidaymakers cancelling their guesthouse bookings and a school having to shut.The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) said the summons had been issued to the company for prosecution for potential offences under section 70(1) of the Water Industry Act 1991. This makes it a criminal offence for a water company to supply water that is unfit for human consumption.Marcus Rink, the chief inspector of the DWI, said: “The Brixham incident was serious with significant impact on the public and the wider community. Accordingly, I consider it appropriate to pass the matter to the court to consider the evidence in the public interest.”Caroline Voaden, the Liberal Democrat MP for South Devon, applauded the DWI’s decision, saying: “I am pleased to hear that the Drinking Water Inspectorate has decided to take South West Water to court over the cryptosporidium outbreak in Brixham last year. It’s important we find out exactly what South West Water knew, and when, and why they told people the water was safe to drink when it wasn’t.View image in fullscreenAbout 16,000 households and businesses in the Brixham area were told by the water company not to use their tap water for drinking without boiling and cooling it first.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images“Many of my constituents still don’t trust the drinking water and are paying for bottled water more than a year on from the outbreak. This incident affected the whole community, damaged businesses, hurt the local economy and, most importantly, made many people severely ill. It’s taken a long time to get to this point, but finally, we are seeing South West Water brought to account.”A spokesperson for South West Water said: “We will reflect on this summons. South West Water has cooperated fully with the Drinking Water Inspectorate from the outset of this incident to help in its investigations.“We take this incident extremely seriously, and we will continue to engage fully in response to these legal proceedings.

But they have been described by experts as misleading and medically unnecessary.“There are lots of private healthcare and telehealth clinics offering tests and increasing numbers of medically untrained, self-proclaimed ‘experts’ giving advice on social media and podcasts to get these tests done,” said Dr Stephanie Sterry, who recently co-wrote aneditorialfor the BMJ titled Menopause Misinformation is Harming Care.“Unfortunately, these tests are not evidence-based,” she added. “They’re not giving us any new information or making treatment more effective. All they are doing is encouraging women to spend hundreds of pounds on tests that don’t make any difference to the treatment they should be given.”‘Ignoring hot flushes is wrong’: study challenges assumptions about perimenopause symptomsRead moreThere are two types of menopause hormone kits in the UK: rapid urine-based tests – some of which claim to give results in just two minutes – and finger-prick blood tests, which are sent for laboratory analysis with results guaranteed in one to two days.Urine tests are available in high street shops including Asda and Superdrug for about £8. Blood tests range from £32 at Asda Online to £189 at Bluecrest Wellness.Guidelines from Nice, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the BritishMenopauseSociety agree that for women over 45, menopause should be diagnosed based on symptoms alone. Hormone levels fluctuate daily and, experts agree, offer no reliable diagnostic value.“These tests are marketed to patients and clinicians as necessary for ‘individualising’ hormone therapy,” Sterry said. “Yet in reality, these tests are of limited clinical use because there is no clearly defined therapeutic window for menopausal hormone therapy, and some testing techniques do not offer accurate or precise assessment of hormone levels.”For perimenopause and menopause, she added, hormone testing offers no reliable way to determine who will benefit from treatment, when the final menstrual period will occur or whether it is safe to discontinue contraception.Dr Paula Briggs, chair of the British Menopause Society, agreed. “Things have gone very wrong,” she said. “The growing popularity of these tests has led to women having unrealistic expectations about what HRT can offer – particularly around mental illness and the existence of a ‘quick fix’. That, in turn, leads to the rise of unregulated treatments like expensive bioidentical hormones.”Briggs emphasised the need for collaborative, NHS-led care. She said that she is so concerned about the commercialisation of women’s health that she no longer practises privately.Dr Susanna Unsworth, a menopause and women’s health specialist, agreed that hormone tests were “absolutely” harming care and are a “significant” problem.“I am definitely seeing this more,” she said. “Women often ask me before their appointment if they need blood tests done first. My answer is almost always no but increasingly, they turn up with pages of results they have organised themselves.“The trouble is, most of these results cannot be interpreted meaningfully and that puts us both in a difficult position: the companies often advise women to take these results to their menopause doctor, so when I explain that they do not add value, it undermines their trust in me,” she added.Teach boys and girls together about menstruation, UCL study arguesRead moreDr Martin Thornton, medical director at the private clinic Bluecrest, defended his use of the tests.Pointing out that they offer a GP consultation with the data results, he said: “A lot of this is about empowering women by providing them with data to correlate to their symptoms, because a lot of the symptoms are not straightforward.“Testing allows people to open up a dialogue with their doctor and can help you understand if it’s the menopause or something else,” he said.But Sterry rebutted that: “There is no evidence that the symptoms a women experiences in perimenopause or the severity of those symptoms, correlates to data received from blood tests.“If a women has symptoms and her tests show no signs of menopause, then that can be very confusing,” she added. “This leads to underdiagnosis and undertreatment.“The principle of evidence-based practice is that a test should be done only if its result will directly guide patient care,” she said. “Hormone testing in menopause treatment is not supported by evidence and does not improve care. Treatment should be guided by a patient’s individual symptoms and not by treating the numbers.”Asda has been approached for comment. A Superdrug spokesperson said: “Following customer feedback we launched the FSH [follicle stimulating hormone] test as women told us that they would like the choice to be able to measure their FSH levels.“Your result comes with tailored medical advice from our doctors based on a combination of the assessment answers, and the test result.”Explore more on these topicsMenopauseHealthWomen's healthNHSnewsShareReuse this content",

Explosions were also reported in the cities of Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kryvyi Rih. Authorities triggered a countrywide air-raid warning at 6.06am local time and later accusedRussiaof deliberately striking civilian targets.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called the attack “a deliberate crime and prolongation of the war” when “real diplomacy could have already begun long ago”. He later said he was counting on a “strong response” from the US.The US president, Donald Trump, who met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for a summit in Alaska last month, said without elaboration in response to questioning on Sunday that he was ready to move to a second stage of sanctions against Russia over the conflict. Trump has threatened to penalise countries that buy Russia’s oil, but has so far only hit India with so-called secondary sanctions and stepped back from previous warnings of tougher financial action against Moscow.The Ukrainian air force said 805 combat drones were deployed by Moscow, as well as nine Iskander-K cruise missiles and four Iskander-M ballistic missiles. Of these, four cruise missiles and 747 drones were intercepted by Ukrainian forces, authorities said.Smoke was seen billowing from the roof of the Kyiv building that houses the offices of Ukraine’s cabinet ministers, as firefighters fought flames pouring out of an upper storey,although it was not immediately clear whether the fire was the result of debris or a direct hit, which would mark an escalation in Russia’s air campaign. Government buildings in the city centre have previously not been targeted by Russia.Map showing location of Ukrainian cabinet building in Kyiv“For the first time, the government building was damaged by an enemy attack, including the roof and upper floors,” said Ukraine’s prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko. “We will restore the buildings, but lost lives cannot be returned.”‘It is a war of drones now’: the ever-evolving tech dominating the frontline in UkraineRead moreShe urged the world to react to the destruction and said the pressure of sanctions must be increased, especially against Russian oil and gas.Zelenskyy said he had spoken to his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, after the strike. “We coordinated our diplomatic efforts, next steps, and contacts with partners to ensure an appropriate response,” Zelenskyy said on the Telegram app.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, condemned Russia’s onslaught. He called the attacks “cowardly” and said they proved that Putin was “not serious about peace”.The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said before Trump’s comments on sanctions that Washington was prepared to “increase pressure” on Russia, but thatEuropemust also act. “If the US and the EU can come in to more sanctions, secondary tariffs on the countries that buy Russian oil, the Russian economy will be in full collapse,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press.View image in fullscreenResidents move towards a shelter amid Russia’s attack in Kyiv.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersSunday’s attack was the largest Russian drone strike since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with nine missile hits and 56 drone strikes in 37 locations across Ukraine. Debris from shot-down drones and missiles fell on eight locations.Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said early on Sunday the drone attacks had killed an infant and a young woman, while a pregnant woman was among the five injured who were admitted to hospital.Later in the day, it emerged that the mother and her baby had been killed after they were thrown on to the street by a pressure wave caused by a drone explosion in Kyiv, according to the Kyiv Independent.Klitschko said an elderly woman had died in a bomb shelter in the Darnytskyi district to the east of the Dnipro River.Locals were left stunned by the attacks, emerging from their homes on to the streets in the early hours of Sunday to watch as firefighters fought the blazes and searched buildings for victims with thermal cameras. They reported a large amount of falling debris from damaged buildings, including glass and window blinds.In the western district of Sviatoshynskyi, several floors of a nine-storey residential building were partly destroyed, Klitschko and emergency officials said.Falling drone debris set off fires in a 16-storey apartment building and two other buildings, the mayor added.View image in fullscreenEmergency workers extinguish a fire in an apartment building on Sunday after Russia’s attack on Kyiv.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersSmoke billowed out of apartment buildings, some with floors partly collapsed and facades crumbled, in social media photographs posted by emergency officials.Russia was “deliberately and consciously striking civilian targets”, the head of the capital’s military administration, Timur Tkachenko, said on Telegram.Dozens of explosions also shook Ukraine’s central city of Kremenchuk, cutting power to some areas, its mayor, Vitalii Maletskyi, said on Telegram. Russian strikes on Kryvyi Rih in the same region targeted transport and urban infrastructure, Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the military administration, said on Telegram, but with no injuries reported.In the southern city of Odesa, civilian infrastructure and residential buildings were damaged, with fires breaking out in several apartment blocks, the regional governor, Oleh Kiper, said on Telegram.One person was killed in an attack on the north-eastern region of Sumy, according to local authorities. An attack on Saturday on the outskirts of the village of Putyvl also resulted in injuries including of a nine-year-old child, the region’s military governor, Oleh Hryhorov, said on Telegram.In Zaporizhzhia in south-eastern Ukraine, at least 15 people were injured in a drone strike, some of whom had to be hospitalised, said Ivan Fedorov, the head of the region’s military administration. He published photos of residential buildings that had been destroyed.According to Russian sources, a Ukrainian drone strike led to a fire at the Ilsky oil refinery in the Krasnodar region, in the south, which was quickly extinguished, according to a regional administrator. The reports could not be independently verified.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content",

He was canonised byPope Leo XIValongside Pier Giorgio Frassati, another young Catholic activist, who died a century ago.A hour before the mass, St Peter’s Square had filled with tens of thousands of pilgrims from around the world, many of them millennial Italians and Americans, as Acutis’s family looked on.A crowd numbering an estimated 80,000 braved sweltering heat, and many were forced to spill out into the boulevards next to the square, with witnesses describing the atmosphere as joyous and party-like.“The greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God’s plan,” Leo said in his homily, saying Acutis and Frassati had made “masterpieces” of their lives by dedicating them to God. The new saints “are an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards”, he said.Both ceremonies had been scheduled for earlier this year, but were postponed after the death of Pope Francis, who had fervently pushed Acutis’s sainthood case forward to attract young Catholics to the faith.Tapestries depicting images of Saints Pier Giorgio and Carlo were hung on the facade of St Peter’s Basilica as the two men were celebrated like pop stars. Devotion to Acutis, in particular, extended to a wide range of merchandise on sale bearing his image, including action figures, T-shirts, mobile phone stickers and handheld fans. Leo, dressed in golden vestments, said before the Mass: “I’m happy to see so many young people.”Over the past year, more than 1 million people have flocked to the central Italian town of Assisi, where Acutis’s body – covered in a wax mould of his likeness and dressed in his blue tracksuit top, jeans and trainers – is on view behind a glass-panelled case in Santa Maria Maggiore church. His heart is in a gold casket in the town’s San Rufino Cathedral, while pieces of tissue from his pericardium – the membrane enclosing the heart – have toured the world in the lead-up to his canonisation. A bronze lifesize statue of him is also on display in the town.View image in fullscreenThe body of Carlo Acutis in Santa Maria Maggiore church in Assisi.Photograph: Gianluigi Basilietti/EPAHis mother, Antonia Salzano, has also travelled across the globe, delivering speeches to Catholic communities about her son’s life, bringing strands of her son’s hair as gifts.She was present at the canonisation Mass with her family, including Carlo’s two teenage siblings who were born after his death. His brother Michele did a reading.Salzano told the Guardian the family was not particularly religious, but her son showed a deep devotion to the Catholic faith from a young age. “He would go to mass and do the rosary each day,” she said, adding that he was a child who “could not be indifferent to sorrow”. “We lived in the centre of Milan in a building surrounded by beggars. He wanted to help them, speak to them, bring them food and blankets.”She added that Acutis was otherwise an average child, hanging out with friends or playing sports. “Carlo was an internet geek, but he had the temperance to use technology for good, and was not exploited by it,” she said.Acutis was born on 3 May 1991 in London to a wealthy but not particularly observant Catholic family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born.Acutis was particularly interested in computer science and devoured college-level books on programming even as a youngster. A skilful coder, his whiz-kid reputation started to grow when he created websites for Catholic organisations, includingone that listed miracles, earning him the moniker “cyber apostle”. He also enjoyed playing on his PlayStation, although limited its use to an hour a week – a discipline that has proved appealing to a Catholic hierarchy that has often warned about the dangers of a technology-steered world.In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukaemia. Within days, he was dead. He was entombed in Assisi, known for its association with another popular saint, St Francis.The movement that had built up around Acutis was evident from the day he died, as seriously ill people began praying to him for cures. His funeral was attended by a host of people he had helped, among them immigrants and bullied children.His mother claims it was around the time of his funeral that he started to work miracles, and last year Francis credited Acutis with two.The first involved the recovery of a boy in Brazil from a rare congenital disease affecting his pancreas; the second was the healing of a student in Florence with bleeding on the brain from a head trauma, and whose mother had prayed at Acutis’s tomb in Assisi.The speed at which Acutis has been canonised, especially compared with Frassati, shows how keen the church is to attract more young people.Canonisation usually follows a long and detailed process, involving a meticulous investigation by theVaticanand outside specialists who determine the veracity of miracles attributed to the individual. Acutis’s beatification, the stage before canonisation, was carried out by Pope Francis in 2020.Explore more on these topicsCatholicismVaticanReligionItalyChristianityEuropePope Leo XIVnewsShareReuse this content",

As the country prepares to go to the polls on Monday,Norwayis in the grip of a ferocious national argument that is likely to rumble on whichever party wins.In an economy less then a seventh the size of Britain’s, theformuesskattraises about 32bn kroner (£2.4bn). Multiply that by the difference in GDP, and the same rules applied in the UK could raise more than £17bn – serious money in tax terms. Defenders say the wealth tax has another benefit. They see it as the cornerstone of a progressive tax system that has helped to create one of Europe’s most equal societies.But entrepreneurs are pushing back, financing lobbying campaigns and pouring money into politics and online advertising. There is even a protest song. “Don’t come to Norway, we will tax you till you’re poor, and when you have nothing left, we will tax you a little more,” laments a business consultant in avideo posted on LinkedIn. On the other side of the divide, the leader of the Socialist Left party has a“wall of shame”in her office displaying the names of those who oppose or avoid the tax.More disturbingly, the experts are under attack. Economists and statisticians have flagged a wave of disinformation, while being subjected to hate mail and targeted by newspapers.Annette Alstadsæter, director of theSkatterforsk Centre for Tax Researchat the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, has spoken in favour of the tax and authored a series of papers on avoidance and offshore wealth. She now weighs her public statements carefully, and has withdrawn from social media because of the risk of online abuse. “People are so angry. Either you are very against or very for,” she says.“I’ve been working on this for 15 years and it’s always an issue but this time it has exploded,” says the economist Mathilde Fasting, a member of the right of centre thinktankCivitaand one of those calling for abolition. “Each time you talk about economic issues this tax will come up. It’s like a symbol of all other things happening.”In a country where politics still gravitates to the centre, the wealth tax creates a clear dividing line between left and right. The row has evolved into a full culture war, with Trumpian appeals to aspirational young men who may not yet be rich enough to pay the levy, but oppose it on principle. On the YouTube showGutta(Guys), four muscle-bound presenters filmed themselvespouring champagne over their wrist watcheswhile discussing “tax refugees”.View image in fullscreenJens Stoltenberg has promised to set up a cross-party commission to review all taxes if Labour is returned to power.Photograph: Fredrik Varfjell/ReutersJens Stoltenberg, the former Nato secretary general and ex-Norwegian premier who returned to frontline politics in February as finance minister, has promised to set up a cross-party commission to review all taxes if Labour is returned to power. Thanks to his wide appeal, his party has risen in the polls, and is now ahead of the populist Progress party, which has promised to do away with theformuesskatt. In third place is the more moderate centre-rightHøyre, which wants to slash the amount raised.During his decade at the helm of Nato, Stoltenberg was dubbed “the Trump whisperer” after convincing the US president not to pull out of the security alliance during his first term. It seems settling the wealth tax dispute will take all of the diplomatic skills he deployed in that role. The trick will be to retain the tax without triggering an exodus of billionaires.“If a ton of people leave Norway that would be a problem,” says the entrepreneur Karl Munthe-Kaas, who supports the tax. “But if we let these groups that have all this money hold the rest of the country hostage, I have an issue with that.”Cut through the noise, and the underlying conversation is nuanced. Norwegians discuss tax with confidence, because they have access to all the right data. Almost uniquely among democratic nations, the tax returns of named individuals are public,in a databasethat all citizens can access. Likewise, information on companies is detailed and reliable.Norway has levied a tax on wealth above a certain value since 1892, some years before securing full independence from Sweden. Along with Spain and Switzerland, it is one of only three European nations to still tax capital in this way. The current rate stands at 1% for those with assets of more than 1.7m kroner (£125,000) and 1.1% for those with more than 20.7m kroner. The tax is collected annually, and is calculated by adding up the value of properties, savings, investments and shares, and deducting any debt. Private companies count as part of their owners’ wealth. There are discounts – for example, only 25% of the value of a primary residence is taxable.View image in fullscreenNorway is one of only three European nations to levy a tax on wealth above a certain value.Photograph: Drazen_/Getty ImagesAlthough 720,000 citizens pay wealth tax, for most the annual contribution is small. Fasting says about 3,000 have taxable wealth of more than 100m kroner.Among the biggest contributors is Gustav Magnar Witzøe, the heir to the SalMar fish farms business. In 2023, his wealth tax was330m kroner. It was the only personal tax he paid as he had no income, according to reports based on his filings. Under the plans put forward byHøyre,it has been reported his bill would fall to zero. This is because the party is proposing to exclude what it calls “working capital” – essentially assets that are part of trading businesses.Thanks to changes made by Labour the total wealth tax collected has risen from 18bn kroner in 2021, the year of the last election, to 32bn kroner last year. Estimates for 2025 are even higher.graphIn 2022, the changes prompted departures. More than 30 billionaires and multimillionairesleft the country, according to research by the newspaper Dagens Næringsliv. They included the industrial tycoon Kjell Inge Røkke, the fourth richest Norwegian, with a fortune of about £1.5bn, who relocated to Switzerland. There were warnings of lost tax revenues and damage to the economy, but three years later, it is clear that the exodus had limited impact.In Norway, as elsewhere, the billionaires are getting richer. In 2024, the 400 wealthiest were worth 2.139tn kroner,up 14% in a year, according to the business magazine Kapital. But it also reported half of this wealth was controlled by families relocated abroad.Fasting believes more will leave. “People are not investing here, not listing their companies, and finally moving out, which is serious. And I am sure that if the Labour party continues after the elections now you will see a boost of people moving,” she says.Her main argument for scrapping the tax is that it puts Norwegians at a disadvantage compared with foreign company owners. She says they have to take dividends out of their companies to pay the tax authorities, which means less money for growing businesses or starting new ones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its backers include the salmon exporter Roger Hofseth. “If the left wins this time, a lot of people will flee to Switzerland,” Hofseth told a gathering last month.“There is this mentality that people who are self-made, they forget they are a product of the system,” says Alstadsæter at the Centre for Tax Research. “For me it’s about justice. Everyone should pay a little bit. The rich get all these public goods. A stable political system, social security, and a highly educated population with access to free healthcare.”She believes some reforms are needed, saying the threshold of 1.7m kroner is too low.With a sovereign wealth fund that collects the profits from Norway’s abundant stocks of oil and gas able to contribute 25% of public spending each year, there is arguably no need for theformuesskatt.“To me, it’s more about fairness,” says Simen Markussen, the director of the Ragnar Frisch Centre for Economic Research in Oslo. “It ensures that capital owners who don’t have labour income are paying a reasonable amount of tax. It redistributes from the richest to everyone.”For the very rich, it is particularly effective, as it accounts for most of the personal taxes they pay.graphWhile the sums collected are not huge, they are meaningful. “Compared with all taxes on personal income it’s maybe 4.5%,” says Markussen. “It’s big enough that if a politician says ‘I want to abolish it’ they should be challenged on how this should be financed. Do you want to maintain those tax revenues, or what do you want to cut?”Munthe-Kaas founded the Oda grocery delivery business, which became Norway’s first “unicorn”, a term used for startups valued at more than $1bn. He exited the company last year and no longer pays the wealth tax, but has done previously. He believes it works well, and would prefer a cut to corporation tax.“The wealth tax is not a choice between value creation versus distribution, it gives us both,” he says. “Any tax you bring in will reduce the ability to either invest or consume, whoever pays it. Taxing the rich isn’t different in that sense to taxing a middle-class worker. So when rich people are upset they get less to invest, the same argument goes for anyone.”View image in fullscreenKarl Munthe-Kaas, who founded the Oda delivery grocery delivery business, believes the wealth tax works well.Photograph: Millionaires for HumanityAndré Nilsen, a neuroscientist and kroner millionaire thanks to family money and his own investments, pays a small sum in wealth tax each year. He believes theformuesskattshould stay because it helps pay for social security. “It is easier to get rich in Norway compared with other countries. You are free to go on wild explorations of ideas because you have a safety net that will catch you if it doesn’t work out,” he says.Although the wealthy often give generously to charity, it cannot replace tax, he believes. “There must be some kind of system above everyone that says at least do this.”There are other ways to target wealth. The UK – in common with many other countries – taxes dividends, capital gains and inherited money. But the rates can be much lower than those for wage-based income, and there are many loopholes and discounts.Alstadsæter says the wealth tax is harder to dodge: “It’s the only tax that cannot be avoided through restructuring while living in Norway, hence the opposition.”Explore more on these topicsNorwayEuropeEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content",

They will continue to be paid as usual and “bank” their hours to be picked up later on.JLR will update workers on Monday on plans for later in the week. It is thought likely that thousands will be kept on pause until at least Thursday and probably beyond at JLR’s own operations in the UK and in Slovakia, Brazil and India as well as at dozens of suppliers.Evtec, WHS Plastics, SurTec and OPmobility, who employ more than 6,000 in the UK between them, are among the suppliers who have told their workforces to stay at home, according to a report in the Sunday Times.There is speculation that operations at JLR will be disrupted for “most of September” or worse, the paper said.A recent cyber-attack on Marks & Spencerstopped its online orders for more than six weeks, with wider disruption continuing beyond that point. Similar attacks on the Co-op and Harrods, which were detected more swiftly, had less of an impact.Those attacks led to personal details for thousands of their customers being accessed. JLR is understood to have informed the Information Commissioner’s Office last week about the incident, flagging the risk of data being infiltrated, but there is no evidence of any such breach at this stage.However, JLR is having to operate without dozens of digital systems, with access cut off to databases, including those for spare parts. Sources said car dealerships and garages were able to continue operating but with severe disruption as they turned to phone calls and manual systems – in some cases pen and paper – to register vehicles and secure spare parts.How ‘native English’ Scattered Spider group linked to M&S attack operateRead moreA spokesperson for JLR said: “We continue to work around the clock to restart our global applications in a controlled and safe manner following the recent cyber incident.

We are very sorry for the disruption this incident has caused. Our retail partners remain open and we will continue to provide further updates.”On Wednesday, a group of English-speaking hackers linked to the retail hacksclaimed responsibilityfor the JLR attack.

Instead, it was his status as a disabled person that caused him difficulty.Millar tells the anecdote with a sarcastic world-weariness. A music venue refused to sell him a ticket for an accessible seat unless he could provide “proof of disability.”Millar, who was registered blind as a teenager before losing his sight entirely in his 30s, said: “I told them: ‘Oh, OK, I’ll get my neighbour to photograph me walking down the corridor and smashing straight into the wall at the end. Will that do?’”At 73, Millar has spent a lifetime confronting societal ignorance about disability and confounding assumptions about the limits of his usefulness, all the while carving out a stellar career in the music business, as a producer and label owner.My two-year-old’s hearing loss diagnosis shocked me; her doctor’s words saved me | Helene RosenthalRead moreThe starry career, the model girlfriends, parties with the Rolling Stones, the country houses and Ferraris are a compelling part of his story, but Millar, who is chair of the charity Scope, also wants to talk about disability rights, welfare cuts and culture war debates around diversity, equity and inclusion.His disability rights evangelism – whether it’s opportunity in the workplace or an accessible concert hall seat – in part reflects his own extraordinary life experience. “I never had the option of a conventional career. All doors were shut to me,” he says. He’s a slightly reluctant disability activist who fights for what he calls “the right for disabled people to live the same life as everyone else”.“I can’t think of a disability so complex and profound that that person cannot make a positive contribution to the work, their environment, their friends and the world of work, given the right possibilities and options,” he says.Millar grew up in north London in the 1950s and 60s, “a frightened little skinny boy with Mr Magoo glasses”, hetold the BBC’sDesert Islands Discs. He had an inherited genetic condition that meant his eyesight was chronically poor and deteriorating. “I couldn’t see in the dark and I had tunnel vision and little spots in the middle of my eyes,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe young Robin Millar played in bands, and had dreams of becoming as songwriter before trying to get into record production.Photograph: Robert Millar/Home & Studio RecordingBoyhood was an endless round of tests and treatments, his Irish GP father deploying medical science – daily vitamin A injections, stinging eye drops – and his Guyanese nurse mother trying faith healers and psychics, “people putting their fingers on me and poking me and putting stuff on me and saying: ‘You’ll be cured.’”None of the cures worked. He was having to sit ever further forward in the classroom to see the blackboard at his north London grammar school. He was clever, but “blundering through life”. “Nobody taught me any useful skills like braille or, like learning to touch type. I had to do all that as an adult. Because they were all obsessed with curing me. Rather than equipping me.”As a teenager he was taken to the Royal National Institute for the Blind (now known as the Royal National Institute of Blind People) for career advice. “They said: ‘Do you want to be a physiotherapist or a piano tuner?’ I said: ‘Neither.’ And they said: ‘Well, we can’t help you.’”At 16 he was told bluntly by doctors he would be totally blind in a few years. Raging, miserable, determined, he got himself to Cambridge University to study law.He subsequently played in bands, and had dreams of becoming as songwriter before trying to get into record production. His big break came when he wangled an apprentice job in a Paris recording studio in the mid-1970s, making coffee and doing microphone checks for the likes of Elton John and David Bowie.Getting the studio job was an “incredibly random” thing, he admits. The owner wasn’t ticking an inclusion box (“they weren’t woke in 1976”) but he was prepared to take a risk. “I think I just charmed him … I’d been a male model and I was a very striking young man. I think he liked the idea of having someone who hung out with the Rolling Stones and was a bit kind of cool in that way.”“The owner said: ‘Do you want the job?’ I just mumbled something like: ‘I’m a bit worried about knocking over microphones.’ And he said: ‘Don’t worry, we can work around that.’” Millar pauses. “We should have that phrase hung across Trafalgar Square. At every school: ‘We can work around that.’”That kind of lucky break won’t happen to 99% of young disabled people, he admits. But he believes his experience is a lesson for institutions, companies and entrepreneurs to make themselves open to spotting, nurturing and investing in talented employees who also happen to have a disability.View image in fullscreenDiamond Life by Sade.Photograph: Publicity imageThe studio owner’s’ instinct was right. The many gold discs on the walls of his south London home attest to Millar’s massive success, not least a golden streak in the mid-1980s when produced a string of bestselling albums, notablySade’s acclaimed Diamond Life. He was involved in 44 No 1 hits and has sold millions of records.Life was not happy ever after. He became totally blind while producing Sade’s second album in the south of France, prompting a breakdown and a patient rebuilding of his life and career. Outdated attitudes about disability from the past that had been in some ways masked by his success, resurfaced, often in unexpected ways.He recalls how his 40th birthday he hosted his parents for the weekend. “Country house, everything I’d aspired to. Gravel drive. Bentley parked outside. Swimming pool, tennis court, two lovely children. My mother says to me: ‘If we had known about your eyesight, your father and I would have had you aborted.’” He is clearly still hurt, adding: “She was so blighted by the negative side.”The world has moved along way since then, he says. There have been incredible improvements in accessibility. There are disability discrimination laws. On a visit to the BBC he was thrilled to be met by a visually impaired trainee. “I went: ‘Blimey, that wouldn’t have happened in my day. They’ve taken you [on] not just knowing you are blind but hopefully actually realising that disabled people are pretty amazing.’”That said, he’s not complacent. He and Scope have spent years campaigning to persuade employers to do more to recruit and retain disabled people, and yet the disability employment gap remains stubbornly wide. He’s scathing about the “arc of progress” argument that says “of course it was terrible in the 70s, but now, let’s face it, things are all right for disabled people”.View image in fullscreenCompanies who employ disabled people are more profitable and understand their markets better, Millar says.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianOf the post-Trump pushback against “woke”,equal access and affirmative action – “all the stuff that worries Telegraph readers” – he says: “I’m sorry guys and girls, but sexual harassment at work, sexism, gender pay gap, worse prospects for people with disabilities, worse prospects for black and Asian communities – I’m afraid it is all true. It may not be as true everywhere, but it is true.”This is nothing to do with being woke, he says. Companies who employ disabled people are more profitable. They understand their markets better. He reckons employer negativity stems less from prejudice and more from misplaced fears about the costs of making “reasonable adjustments” that allow disabled people to do the job.Labour MP suspended for opposing disability cuts will keep speaking for ‘invisible in society’Read moreMillar would overhaul the 35-year-old legal principle ofreasonable adjustment, because it implies there is an “unreasonable” adjustment, allowing companies to feel they have done enough if they stick strictly to the interpretation of the law. At Scope he asked for the word “reasonable’” to be removed from job ads and replaced with “we will make any adjustments to allow you to apply”.It’s a government ambition to get more long-term ill and disabled people into work. Theindependent reportby the former John Lewis boss Sir Charlie Mayfie on how to do this is due to be published next month. Millar wants to see it recommend financial and other incentives to persuade employers to take “the big step on inclusion”.Millar opposed the government’snow abandoned plansto cut £5bn from disability benefits. But he believes attitudes and intentions around disability rights are generally “pretty good”. He starts to say there are pockets of discrimination, and then pauses. “It’s not pockets of disability discrimination, actually, it’s just pockets of wankers.”Explore more on these topicsDisabilityBlindness and visual impairmentCharitiesBoy GeorgeSadefeaturesShareReuse this content",

It’s also reminiscent of a film that would have been released then too, a brief glimpse of a Blockbuster Video store making it easy to imagine picking this one up for a rainy afternoon rental.Good Fortune review – Aziz Ansari’s big comeback comedy struggles to find big laughsRead moreOn those terms, it’s perfectly watchable, engaging enough to keep us from pressing stop, if not quite enough to make us want to press rewind once it’s over. It’s based on the stranger-than-fiction tale of Jeffrey Manchester, played by Channing Tatum, an ex-military father-of-three who just can’t quite find his place in the civilian world. His old army buddy Steve (Lakeith Stanfield) reminds him of his particular skill for observation, urging him to put it to good use. Instead, after disappointing his daughter once again with an underwhelming birthday present, he decides to use it for something less well-advised, robbing not one but 45 McDonald’s, going in through the roof and making enough to give his family the life they deserve.Writer-director Derek Cianfrance, and co-writer Kirt Gunn, speed through his descent into crime a little too fast, giving him a hard-to-grasp direct line from letting his daughter down to mass robbery. What kept him convinced of his new career was his cordial manner during the hold-ups, politely treating employees and ensuring a strict avoidance of violence. He was captured and given 45 years in prison, a term that finally pushed his understandably fatigued wife away.His knack for observing the small details sees him hatch an ambitious escape plan, fooling the guards and landing back on the outside. Determined not to go back, he finds the perfect place to hide until Steve can help him with a fake passport: a Toys R Us store. He first hides in the roof, of course, before making his way down and holing up in an unseen section of the store, snacking on M&Ms and baby food and spying on the staff (managed by a convincingly mean and officious Peter Dinklage). One of them is Leigh (Kirsten Dunst), a single mother he can’t stop himself from helping, a slippery slope that sees him craft a fake identity, getting himself into deeper and deeper trouble.It might be hard to believe – a wanted felon going unnoticed while he romances a single mother and charms a local church (led by Uzo Aduba and an unusually uncreepy Ben Mendelsohn) – but most of the facts of Roofman are bizarrely true. It sometimes feels like Cianfrance, whose background errs darker from his emotionally ruinous divorce tale Blue Valentine to crime drama The Place Beyond the Pines, could have turned this into more of a thriller, an almost sociopathic liar hiding a criminal background while spinning an unstoppable web of fibs. But Roofman is a warmer, softer film, as polite and eager to please as Jeffrey himself. Cianfrance even brings back his Blue Valentine composer Christopher Bear (of Grizzly Bear) to add a gentler jaunt to his often sadder sound (his score is also wonderfully reminiscent of a robust studio film from the 2000s).It works mostly because of Tatum and Dunst, a rare on-screen pairing of single parents in their 40s, both trying to navigate a stressful situation, hard enough even without the criminality. There’s real chemistry there, initially of an amusingly confused nature as she mistakes his disarmingly unthreatening manner as him being gay. The by-the-numbers build of their relationship, as he tries to win over her surly teenage daughter, could do with something that felt a little more specific and lived-in but they work hard to sell it, especially Dunst who disappears into it all without the merest sign of effort, one of her better performances in a deservedly bountiful new career period. I found myself rooting for her but maybe less so for the roofman himself, a character whose crimes and lies and bad decisions are never as charming or understandable as the film tries to make them and as the authorities close in, it’s made even harder to care if he makes it, a force of chaos making life harder for those around him.Another, more textured film might have tried to paint him as more than just lovable rogue but Roofman is too focused on making us feel good rather than bad. I would have settled for conflicted.Roofman is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released in cinemas on 10 OctoberExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalChanning TatumFestivalsKirsten DunstLakeith StanfieldJuno TemplereviewsShareReuse this content",

But it got the top prize, the Golden Lion, from Alexander Payne’s jury.Benny Safdie’sThe Smashing Machine(15 minutes), with Dwayne Johnson as a troubled MMA fighter, got best director. Paolo Sorrentino’sLa Grazia(six minutes) got Toni Servillo the best actor prize, for his elegant fictional Italian president.

People were sobbing in the auditorium, and predicting the surely inevitable Golden Lion would be a tipping point for international political opinion. The Venice jurors had it in their power to make history. Didn’t they?That isn’t how it works. The Voice of Hind Rajab only earned the grand jury prize, the second prize, to online fury from those who thought this decision was a copout and a blandly pro-American copout at that.But every jury decision is a copout. All juries are horse-trading and compromising and collectively accepting second-choice movies that no one objects to from film-makers whose prestige they all endorse. Unanimous choices are vanishingly rare. I wonder what Venice juror Mohammad Rasoulof felt this year. His filmThe Seed of the Sacred Fig, challenging the Iranian regime, was widely tipped to win the top prize at Cannes last year and, of course, make history in the same way. But it had to be content with the special jury prize.At the lively post-decision press conference, Payne was confronted with questions about another juror, actor Fernanda Torres, who had threatened to quit over the Hind Rajab snub. The reporters had to decide if Payne’s reply was a clear denial: “One of my jurors threatened to quit? … I did … no. Did someone threaten to quit? I think we know … not to believe everything we read online.” (The loneliness and weariness of jury-presidential command is certainly detectable in the first part of that musing response.)View image in fullscreenJury members Cristian Mungiu, Maura Delpero, Stéphane Brizé, Fernanda Torres, Mohammad Rasoulof, Alexander Payne, Zhao Tao and festival director Alberto Barbera at the closing ceremony.Photograph: Stefania D’Alessandro/WireImageBetween Jarmusch’s Father Mother Sister Brother and Ben Hania’s The Voice of Hind Rajab, I personally would have given it to Hind Rajab. But overall, my choice would have been Francesco Rosi’s climate-change meditationBelow the Clouds, or maybe Park Chan-wook’s excellent black comedyNo Other Choice(whose omission from the prize list also infuriated Venice delegates, and which had to be content with the special jury prize) or even Kathryn Bigelow’s barnstorming anti-nuclear shockerA House of Dynamitewhich I suspect may have been too vulgar, too popcorny, to register with the jury.As for The Voice of Hind Rajab, it is brilliant and pertinent, though myfeelingsabout its docufictional approach were nuanced – and I wasn’t the only one.‘Humanity is facing a reckoning’: Venice shrugs off the glamour to take aim at politicsRead moreEveryone I have ever met agrees that prizes and ribbons and cups and medals for movies are, in the end, an absurdity, so perhaps we shouldn’t be too hot under the collar when a jury does something to annoy us.

She’d been part of the enviableMike Leightroupe (her first nomination should have been for Another Year) and a permanent small-screen fixture, even if the size of her roles hadn’t correlated to the size of her talent. But after Phantom Thread, Paul Thomas Anderson’s singular magnum opus, Manville has enjoyed a spectacular boom, a long-deserved reward for her and an even bigger one for those of us watching.The role came as she was entering her 60s, a period that can often leave female actors with grimly limited options, but she’s bucked the trend, not just through the sheer amount of work she’s found but also the unusual variety. She’s avoided the post-Book Club subgenre of mostly patronising comedies that squander older actors on pained pratfalls and found herself in far more interesting, and challenging, territory. She was a wife experiencing later stage sexual dissatisfaction in I Am Maria, a vicious Ma Barker type reigning over a North Dakota family of criminals inLet Him Go, a gun-toting ayahuasca-farming jungle doctor inQueer, the devious antagonist of the spy seriesCitadel, a cleaner turned fashionista inMrs Harris Goes to Parisand an OnlyFans stripper in Ryan Murphy’s Grotesquerie. It’s hard to think of many post-Oscar recognition careers that have been quite so uniquely rewarding.Erupcja review – Charli xcx gives acting a trial run in shallow friendship dramaRead moreShe was last at the Toronto film festival with a cruelly small role in Patrick Marber’s cruelly underwhelming trifleThe Criticbut returns with a welcome lead, switching it up again with the tense cold war thriller Winter of the Crow. She plays Joan, a British professor of psychiatry heading to Poland to speak at a conference, hoping to share her provocative thoughts on treating mental illness. But while she was steeling herself for backlash from academia, she wasn’t expecting a student uprising, her big moment stolen by those wishing to speak out against the government. Her annoyance at both the protesters and her treatment (lost bag, no hotel, a night on the couch) soon dissipates when she starts to realise something bigger is going down around her. She’s landed near the end of 1981 as the country prepares to enter martial law …The unfolding awfulness of her situation, as a language disconnect and increasingly barbaric forces shrink her from slightly haughty academic to panicked woman on the run, makes for a nervy and immediately involving thriller. Director Kasia Adamik (daughter of Agnieszka Holland and storyboard artist for Catwoman and Battlefield Earth!) blurs the line between the stark reality of her predicament and the horror of a recurring nightmare, an inescapable maze of brutalist greyness, danger at every corner. It’s all very dank and murky but there’s a real jolt to the initial cat-and-mouse chase as we watch a woman of proud competence realise she’s unable to rely on her usual armory. Adamik’s decision to provide subtitles to characters she can’t understand is initially alienating, taking us out of our heroine’s head, but it’s a decision that grew on me, a smart way of increasing tension and reminding Joan of the narrowness of her world.Her journey is first physically exhausting and then morally challenging as she must figure out what she believes in and how far she’s willing to go for the greater good, an inner conflict that lands her at the feet of Tom Burke’s shady British ambassador. An earlier scene of her in England, letting down a frustrated student, is a little rushed and confusing but eventually feeds into a through-line of Joan realising she needs to respect and connect to the political desires of those younger than her. It doesn’t quite fall into place as I think the makers intended – the pace sags in the middle, there’s some limply mechanical delivery of backstory and there’s the use of a Polaroid camera to conveniently capture evidence that starts to stretch credulity – but it all builds to a quietly rousing plane set piece, a far more muted version of the Argo finale. Since 1981, the story of an intrepid rebellion fighting back against an authoritarian government hasn’t ever lacked relevancy but it’s obviously an easy story to get behind at this particular moment.Adamik, working from a short story by Olga Tokarczuk, isn’t always able to keep us in her grip, but Manville, driven and determined as ever, never lets us go.Winter of the Crow is screening at theToronto film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewLesley ManvilleThrillersToronto film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content",

Orchestra, the trailblazing British ensemble made up of a majority of Black and ethnically diverse musicians. In the event, Charleston-born Jonathon Heyward put his own indelible stamp on a varied yet satisfying program.Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s La Bamboula, a kaleidoscopic dance with roots in the West Indies, played to Chineke!’s strengths. They performed it with vigour and spirit, while Heyward kept its likable blend of late-Victorian tunefulness and proto-Hollywood glitz gossamer-light. You could see why Henry Wood programmed it at theProms16 times, making its subsequent 91-year absence inexplicable.Brass and percussion took centre stage for Valerie Coleman’s Fanfare for Uncommon Times, a determined call to action written during the pandemic and in the wake of the death of George Floyd. Baleful horns, steely trumpets and a great wodge of trombones and tuba – the last of these standouts throughout – introduced pealing fanfares and a toe-tapping stomp glinting with vibraphone and xylophone.Heyward himself programmed James Lee III’s Visions of Cahokia, a multihued triptych conjuring images of an ancient Native American settlement near modern-day St Louis. Sleigh bells and drumbeats lent momentum to all three movements, from the rhythmic arrival of the tribes in Cahokia’s Dream to the concluding Chukoskomo – a Chickasaw word meaning game or frolic. Peppered with a dash of Stravinsky, Lee’s vivid, pictorial music combined directness with complexity, all of which Chineke! seized upon with relish.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Paradise/BBCThe evening ended with Shostakovich’s caustic yet colourful 10th Symphony. Heyward’s adroit reading was full of subtle shadows, from the deftly crafted ruminative opening to the tensile third movement, in which encoded motifs associated with the composer and his extramarital muse intertwined in ominous waltz time.Chineke! responded with discipline and energy, impressively detailed in the fast and furious second movement in which viciously clipped phrasing painted an especially scabrous portrait of Stalin. Not every instrumental solo was as characterful as it might have been but there was no doubting their commitment as they plunged headlong into the troubled waters of the finale, emerging victorious for a final enigmatic flourish.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 13 October.

But tonight, he warns the crowd he is feeling too overwhelmed to perform his usual funnyman routine. “I probably won’t say lots this evening because I don’t know what to say,” he says. “I’m just genuinely thrilled that this is still a possibility for me.”The 28-year-old being lost for words tonight is understandable. In 2023, Capaldi announced he was taking a hiatus from touring, after sharing his struggles with his mental health and his diagnosis in 2022 of Tourette syndrome. Having disappeared from the spotlight for the better part of two years, he madea triumphant returnat Glastonbury earlier this summer for an unannounced and emotional set on the Pyramid stage. Tonight’s Sheffield show, however, marks the Scottish singer’s first headline performance since his extended break. “We’re back baby,” he tells the crowd at one point.The show begins withSurvive, with Capaldi singing “I still got something to give / Though it hurts sometimes / I’m gonna get up and live” over thunderous drums and lashings of guitar. As he hurtles through Grace and Heavenly Kind of State of Mind, he seems incredulous, nervously giggling as he gazes out at the audience. But by the time he performs Forever – complete with mass audience singalong – he has relaxed into it and shaken off any disbelief at being back.View image in fullscreenLewis Capaldi Performs At Utilita ArenaPhotograph: Shirlaine Forrest/Getty ImagesCapaldi’s music has never been especially adventurous: it’s his voice – raspy and emotive – that’s the appeal. But absent his usual onstage banter, the back-to-back balladry and heartbreak anthems do begin to merge. The homogeny is thankfully broken up by the schmaltzy 80s stylings of Leave Me Slowly, with its pillowy electric pianos and guitar solo, and the poppier melodies of Forget Me also offer a little variation.The most striking moment comes during The Day That I Die, a new song Capaldi says was written “at a time I didn’t know I would be around”. Sat at the piano following a raging final chorus, his voice stormy with emotion, Capaldi lowers his head and cries. It’s a performance that clearly takes a toll. However, judging by his face during the encore of Someone You Loved, the price was worth paying. “It means everything that we’re back doing this,” he says with a grin. “Excuse the pun, but I’ll be doing it till the day I die.”At Utilita Arena, Sheffield, 7 September, andtouring the UKuntil 27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsLewis CapaldiPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content",

His 1928 trench tragedy Journey’s End, a drama for doomed youth, became a school play staple and has beenfilmedor televised, with degrees of looseness, six times, as well as explicitly being a model for Blackadder Goes Forth.As can happen to authors of a classic, Sherriff suffered from his other output being overlooked, but the punchy above-pub Tabard theatre in west London has revived Home at Seven, a now forgotten 1950 success. In a curious parallel to the Blackadder link, Home at Seven’s main cultural prominence has been in Dad’s Army studies, as the play in which the Captain Mainwaring actor Arthur Lowe was touring the UK when he died in 1982.Whereas Journey’s End takes place mid-battle, Home at Seven is set five years into peace – though everything is still inflected by the second world war. Assistant bank manager David Preston (Sam Ellis) was an air raid warden and serves on the committee of a social club with a Major (Karl Moffat) struggling to reproduce his significance during the hostilities.At the titular time on a Tuesday evening, Preston returns to his Bromley house after an apparently routine commute. But he is convinced it’s Monday, and finds that his distraught wife – called on the cast list, in a dating detail, only Mrs Preston (Bridget Lambert) – has believed him missing for 24 hours.View image in fullscreenA tribe of professionals … Greg Fitch as Inspector Hemingway and Andrew Williams as Dr Sparling, with Ellis as David Preston.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHome at Seven premiered in London four years after JB Priestley’s An Inspector Calls and two years beforeThe Mousetrapby Agatha Christie, whose murder mysteries were already a West End fixture. Sherriff seems to shadow both dramatists. One of numerous solutions of the plot – the audience is finally left to decide – is a Priestley-like time-slip. But, after a murder is reported, this may also be a whodunnit, with a cop interrogating shifty suspects including Preston.Mysterious people are hard to play because, while the writer requires the audience to be unsure, an actor must decide at every moment what the character knows or is withholding. The superb Ellis facially and physically offers clues to when Preston might be confused or deliberately confusing others. Modern theatre dramaturgs and accountants would baulk at a brief last-minute appearance. But, taking advantage of mid-20th century largesse, Sherriff penultimately surrenders the stage to a barmaid, Peggy (impressive 2025 drama school graduate Maddie Crofts), whose clarification of events enjoyably further muddies them.A sign of the play’s time is that the other professionals drawn by Preston’s mystery – a GP, detective and solicitor – are all white men of similar age, but Claire Evans’ production neatly treats them as a tribe, in which Andrew Williams, Greg Fitch and Jeremy Todd find individual lives. This welcome rediscovery suitably marks the 50th anniversary of Sherriff’s death and the 40th birthday of the enterprising Tabard.AtTabard theatre, London, until 20 September, then touringExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content",

Unlikely. This summer’s glossy TV treatment of their story, Outrageous, is the latest proof of the aristo-family’s inexhaustible appeal. Amy Rosenthal’s new play may be lucky, or not, to pitch up so soon after.The sisters are so well established by the vast repository of existing content they barely need introduction: the waspish novelist (Nancy), the society beauty (Diana), the Hitler obsessive (Unity), the socialist revolutionary (Decca), and the country-living one who just wants to marry a duke (Debo). Pamela, who spent her life happily married and tending a farm, remains staunchly off stage.The Kardashians of history: why are we so obsessed with the Mitford sisters?Read moreRosenthal’s play explores how their political passions affected the sibling dynamic. The action foregrounds and favours “dauntless” Decca who, at 25, found herself a working single mother in the US, after her husband Esmond’s disappearance during the second world war. But it flits back and forth through the sisters’ lives as they each carve out their own escape from familial and societal expectations: elopement, divorce, writing.View image in fullscreenHitler obsessive …  Potter as Unity.Photograph: Mark SeniorRichard Beecham’s direction feels determinedly period, although he is unafraid to mine the absurd and sometimes dangerous humour of the teenage Decca and Unity sharing a bedroom, carving swastikas and hammer-and-sickles into their respective windows. The sight of young people fascinated by fascism and family members estranged by their polarised viewpoints hints at plenty in the Mitfords’ story that might speak acutely to today, not least the fear that we’re living the 1930s all over again.But this drawing-room drama never really gets us there. Elisabeth Dermot Walsh finds the chill factor as the older Diana, still spouting holocaust denial, and Ell Potter is a convincingly unstable Unity. There’s no sense, however, of the younger Diana as the beguiling influence she is claimed to be.More convincing than the sororal bonds is the chemistry between Emma Noakes’s Decca and her colleague in the American rationing department,Bob Treuhaft(an engaging performance from Joe Coen). It’s a romance that helps to ground the play – but not to shed new light on this well-worn tale.Touring until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreThe Mitford sistersreviewsShareReuse this content",

He made it in the Cornish harbour town of Hayle, near St Ives, having left London to pursue a man he later likens to Bluebeard, and a relationship that created a lot of tears and panic attacks. It is a beautiful record: folk and piano-led reveries, troubled by staticky electronics, sharing a sense of gothic romance with both Tori Amos and Daphne Du Maurier.It made Wolf a star of NME and MTV2, and led to a new record deal and a poppier turn for 2007’s The Magic Position, whose title track became an indie hit. Then Wolf’s career faltered. Made to feel “clownified” by a music press that was still thoroughly ignorant about queerness, he detached from his music. After what seemed as if it might be his last album in 2012, he struggled with addiction and bankruptcy, and also survived a hit and run. It took him until 2023 to return to music, and this year’s great Crying the Neck is his first full-length in 13 years. In retrospect, he is an unsung forebear to Perfume Genius; Zola Jesus’s presence on the latest album felt like a deserved affirmation of his goth bona fides.View image in fullscreenThe setting does its bit … Patrick Wolf at the Minack.Photograph: Charles MacDonald-Jones/The GuardianBut Wind in the Wires has retained a cult allure, clear from the international audience pouring into a sold-out Minack tonight: I hear Scandinavian, eastern European, German and Spanish voices in my immediate vicinity alone. (To consider the improbability of this: the Minack is 30 minutes west of Penzance, the end of the train line, down a slalom of country lanes.) Growing up near Falmouth, I was immediately taken by Wolf, having never heard anyone sing about Cornwall before, or felt that where I was from was culturally significant beyond the 1999 solar eclipse and the 2004 Boscastle flood. Wolf romanticised a place that was starting to feel boring and limited to a rural teenager fixated on grottier goings on in London. Wind in the Wires was a whole world in a record, a beacon that drew in far-flung listeners and cast new light on the familiar.Hearing Wolf say “Hello, Porthcurno!” is a trip that doesn’t get old. The idea to celebrate the album here came from the Patreon community that has sustained him in recent years, he tells us, and he executes the assignment perfectly. The first half of the set is B-sides, rarities and a few tracks from other albums, performed by his small ensemble: Wolf on various stringed instruments and keys, Charlie Stock on viola and Sophie Crawford on accordion. The sound is resonant but refined – a feat of acoustics at the most exposed venue in the country – and Wolf’s voice brims and vaults with precision.The brilliant locally-basedfolk singer Angeline Morrisoncomes on to perform Marianne Faithfull’s parts on Magpie, their duet from The Magic Position, and her deep, wise voice perfectly embodies the role of wise counsel to a lost boy. Wolf tells us he’s obsessed with her voice; they’re true kin, both centring sorely underrepresented perspectives in folk songwriting. As for collaborators, the setting more than does its bit: dry ice flows from the gap between the stage and the sea, which looks convincingly like sea spray, and the ensemble’s flowing white clothes ripple in the breeze as seagulls glide overhead.‘I got up, covered in blood’: Patrick Wolf on surviving addiction, bankruptcy and a hit and runRead moreWhen the band return for part two – Wind in the Wires in full – Wolf is newly clad in black and the sun has fully set, with the moon glinting behind streaming clouds. The sound of the album – droning accordion, off-kilter synths, quite metal-sounding guitar – feels totally contemporary and of a piece with Lankum’s acclaimed innovations, and Wolf’s compositional accomplishment is unmistakable. He pares back the storminess of Tristan for a stripped-back piano version. By the time he sings Eulogy – “now the lightships are guiding you over the sea” – the clouds have passed and the moon is blazing a bright path down the sea to the stage. It’s ludicrously wonderful.He ends Land’s End a capella, accompanied by the rushing of the sea as he sings about this “wild stretch of land”. That song is about fleeing London, a fickle music industry and “sweating in the spotlight” to pursue a romantic view of art in Cornwall, but is also a gentle admonishment of the idea that the “grass is always greener”. It takes on new poignancy 20 years after he first sang it, given all he’s been through to make it back here. The moment offers a much more fitting metaphor for Wolf’s career: a true one-off, spotlit by the moon.Explore more on these topicsPatrick WolfFolk musicIndiereviewsShareReuse this content",

Firstly, she’s the Mother Teresa of Aussie supermarkets. Secondly, I don’t know anything about her personally because this savvy queen doesn’t market herself like your average influencer. She lets her work speak for itself.The work in question? Weekly uploads of POV-style videos where Tennille meticulously goes through major supermarkets to show you what’s on special that week. Her soothing voice and steady hand shepherds you through a sea of yellow price tags. It’s detailed work, considerate and necessary.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

Wednesday was even more special – that’s Aldi catalogue day, and nothing can rival the feeling of a niche European snack or a new power-cleaning tool with a 75% discount.For me, looking through a supermarket catalogue produces a frisson I’ve only ever experienced while scouring the Royal Easter Show showbag booklet as a child of the early 2000s. The excitement I would feel running my finger over each lolly listed in the $15 (slightly offensively named) Mega Sumo Bag. The burden picking between Wonka or Wizz Fizz because I knew my mum wouldn’t let me get both. A supermarket catalogue offers the same thrill: an anticipation of what could soon be yours.AI has created a new breed of cat video: addictive, disturbing and nauseatingly quick soap operasRead moreBut the days of flipping through paper catalogues are well and truly over. That’s why Tennilles_deals is so important, giving us tight, three-minute videos that provide us with a 360-degree view of each product: a walking, talking catalogue. We’re in the combat zone of the Woolies andColesduopoly with her and she is protecting us, guiding us through each aisle. She is our mum. We are her children.And I’m not alone in the admiration I have for this woman. There’s a reason Tennilles_deals has amassed almost 100,000 followers. She offers the people something the mega-chain supermarkets could never: a personable touch; a space where cash-strapped Aussies can vent about price-gouging.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenA selection of the comments on Tennilles_deals’ TikToks: a space for both adoration and solidarity.Photograph: TikTokOne of her videos about the price of extra virgin olive oil starts a debate in the comments. Kerry from Tamworth says she remembers when it was only $7; we love-react Kerry’s comment in solidarity. She is not alone. We are not alone. Barry from Wagga Wagga voices outrage on the Cadbury chocolate block deal. We agree that two for $10 is ridiculous and we remember the simpler $3 block days. Barry then says something out of the blue about his hot cousin, but we ignore it because we agreed about the chocolate thing and we don’t need to go any further.The effect of cozzie livs gives the average Australian fear when entering a supermarket. Gone are the days when I would enter a store without a list and a finite plan of what to purchase. Having the opportunity to see that I can get five Chobani pots for $10 soothes me. As do the gently encouraging words of Carol from Broken Hill: “Do not pass up that Chobani deal.” It means I can enter a Woolies free from the anxiety that I’ll go over budget in pursuit of protecting my gut microbiome.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

As she releases a follow-up, she talks about growing up as an outsider – and the best advice she received from Margaret AtwoodSun 7 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTShareMona Awad was trying on a forest-green, deer-patterned dress when she realised that the psychotically twee characters from her 2019 novel, Bunny, had burrowed back into her psyche.“I looked in the mirror and thought: This isn’t a dress for me, this is a dress for Cupcake,” she says, referencing one of the antagonists from her breakout book. “I started thinking about her, and the other bunnies,” says the Canadian author, “and I was like: I have to go back.”For the uninitiated, Bunny is a surreal, hallucinogenic novel set on a prestigious creative writing master of fine arts (MFA) programme. Narrated by Samantha, an acerbic writer of dark fiction, it centres on a clique of saccharine students whose corny obsessions – internet hair-braiding tutorials, vintage typewriters, tiny baked goods – belie their true demonic natures. Behind the scenes, the bunnies are magically creating hunky man-bunny hybrids they call “drafts”. These darlings eventually have to be killed – literally, with axes.A satire about creativity and class, Bunny was chosen as a best book of the year by Time and Vogue, and hailed as “genius” by Margaret Atwood (Atwood later named Awad her “literary heir apparent” in a magazine feature). It became a bestseller in 2021, selling more than a million copies worldwide, after being embraced by fans of weird girl lit and so-calledfemgoreon Booktok; in 2023 it was optioned for film by Bad Robot.Awad has published two subsequent novels: 2021’s All’s Well, a trippy tale about a theatre professor who finds an unconventional cure for chronic pain, and 2023’s Rouge, about a grieving woman who is drawn into a skincare cult. All the while, the buzz around Bunny has never faded. Its most ardent fans frequently send Awad tributes via Instagram DMs. A band, the Greys, wrote aBunny-inspired song; one reader was inked with the line‘Unsmiling, but soul happy’, and Awad mentions “an incredible tattoo of a decapitated bunny that I love”. The reaction, she says, has been “unreal. I’m so moved by it.”This month Awad, 47, goes back down the rabbit hole with We Love You, Bunny, a follow-up novel voiced by the bunnies themselves, and one of their hybrid creations, Aerius. Expanding the Bunnyverse was a risk. “I knew that readers who did connect with Bunny had a very strong relationship with the text that had nothing to do with me,” Awad says. “I was afraid of meddling with that.” At the same time, it felt “inevitable” that she would return one day, in part because writing the book was such a transformative experience. It was her first foray into surrealism and fantasy; her 2016 debut, 13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl, was realist. Bunny was“where I first discovered a way of telling stories that was exciting to me”.Awad is in San Diego, California, when we speak over Zoom. She looks like a glamorous goth in a black dress, her hair a dark curtain occasionally falling over one eye. This is not her own house but a place she found a few years ago when searching for a writing retreat: she spends the rest of the year between upstate New York, where she is an assistant professor on the creative writing programme at Syracuse University, and Boston, where her partner lives. But having had a “particularly vivid and exciting” experience writing Rouge at the house in La Jolla, she keeps coming back. “I think I became superstitious.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She was interested in exploring “the ethics around creation”, she says, particularly when writing from Aerius’s perspective, in chapters that make playful reference to Frankenstein, Jane Eyre and the Velveteen Rabbit. “The bunnies are writers – and they’re psychotic,” she says. “They’re grabby, they’re greedy. There is something about making art that’s beautiful, but it’s also a bit of a violence. I was interested in capturing that hunger that we have to make. What’s that about? And what’s the cost of that?” Aerius is “disgusted by writers and all of their typing and scribbling and trying to take down the moon. Sometimes, I feel that way too!” she says, laughing.Awad was born in Montreal. She describes herself as “a very shy kid” who frequently felt like an outsider. For example, her mother, who was French Canadian andCatholic, raised her to speak English, which left her feeling “estranged” from the language spoken by the maternal half of her family, even though it was her mother tongue. “And the same thing happened with religion,” she says. Her father is Egyptian and Muslim; her parents decided that she would not take on either of their religions, which left her feeling marginalised at her strict Catholic school. Also, being half Egyptian, growing up in Montreal “I always felt not quite welcome, not quite at home. It was never direct. It was just kind of a feeling,” she says. Later, she struggled to adjust when she moved from Quebec to English-speaking Ontario. School was sometimes tough. “I dropped out a few times, and I even dropped out of college once,” she says, but she always loved to read. She was an only child whose parents worked in hotels. “My mother and father both always had to work Christmas and New Year’s. So usually, they would get access to a room, and that’s where I would be, reading.”At college, Awad wrote a poem about body image in a creative writing class. Though her professor praised it effusively, she ended up dropping out. “I got so scared of failing that I just kind of stopped trying for quite a while, didn’t come back to [writing] seriously until my late 20s or early 30s.” Instead, she worked as a magazine editorial assistant in Montreal; wrote a spoof food column as Veronica Tartley, a writer with “a number of eating disorders, whose reviews are all filtered through her neuroses”; and studied a lot, including completing a masters in English at the University of Edinburgh, where she wrote her thesis on fairytales. It was during her MFA at Brown University – which inspired the similarly cloistered environment of Warren University in Bunny – then during a PhD at Denver, that she finally found a way to turn that early poem into a novel.Awad’s influences include Oscar Wilde, Jean Rhys and Atwood, particularly her “early, stranger gothic novels” – Lady Oracle, The Edible Woman, Surfacing, The Robber Bride – which she loved as a teenager. Her favourite aspect of Atwood’s work, she says, is its “wryness. There is always a sense of humour about it. No matter how deep she goes.” Awad describes herself as “a very dark-minded soul, and humour is definitely a way to survive”. Atwood’s endorsement has, of course, been major: the pair co-hosted a Zoom event for the release of Bunny in paperback and met in person at a photoshoot in 2023 at which the novelist advised Awad “to say ‘fuck it’ more, which I think is good advice for everyone”.It feels relevant to the preoccupations of We Love You, Bunny that Awad and author Paul Tremblay are currently jointly suing Open AI for “ingesting” their books, though Awad says she cannot talk about the case. She will say that she worries about AI “all the time”; that she cares passionately about the “very human endeavour” of getting a voice down on the page. She is in the midst of creating another such voice as we speak. “I am working on a novel, and it is a monster,” she says – a term which one hopes and imagines, in Awad’s world, carries a twisted double meaning.We Love You, Bunny is published by Scribner on 23 September.

But they could very easily have been a sight visible in centralLondon.Shelved 172-year-old architectural drawings by Perceval Parsons show how he envisioned a new London railway connecting the growing number of lines coming into the city to a huge main terminal by the Thames.The drawings of London’s own Grand Central Station, which are being put on open sale for the first time to mark the 200th anniversary of the first public passenger railway, show a scheme that would have given the capital of the UK a very different look today.The station was to be located at Great Scotland Yard, close to the modern-day Embankment tube station, and would have boasted an ornamental frontage about 800ft (245 metres) in length.Multiple entrances would lead to a “spacious hall about 300ft long and facing them would be a range of pay offices with the names of each railway above”, Parsons wrote in his plans in 1853. There would have been eight arrival platforms and eight for departure.He described the cost of the project as a “comparatively small expense”.The seven-hectare (18-acre) site of the proposed station contained “only a few sheds and outhouses of inconsiderable value” and was “covered with mud sending forth anything but agreeable or wholesome odours”.View image in fullscreenParsons’ plan for the proposed terminal.Photograph: Jarndyce“The great desideratum of a connecting link to unite the termini of the various metropolitan railways, and at the same time afford them access to the heart of London, has long been admitted,” Parsons wrote, “and a line that would effect this, and at the same time give a like accommodation to the principal suburbs, would be of still greater importance”.The proposal was supported by Robert Stephenson, chief engineer of the London and Birmingham Railway and son of George Stephenson, the so-called “father of railways”, but the Crimean war sapped appetite for expensive projects and it was quietly forgotten.The prospectus, including two large folded maps, has a price of £1,450,and is one of 200 items featuring in a new railway catalogue compiled by Joshua Clayton atJarndyce antiquarian booksellersthat will be on sale at the York book fair this week.Other items on sale in the catalogue include a letter from George Stephenson to his son in 1834 and another from Isambard Kingdom Brunel dated 1838, as well as travellers’ guides, timetables, original manuscripts and documents dating from the early years of steam locomotives.The 1840s saw an explosion in the construction of railways, known as the British railway “mania”, but various tentative plans to connect central London were ditched after the banking crisis of 1847.View image in fullscreenThe new catalogue compiled by Jarndyce antiquarian booksellers.Photograph: JarndyceIn 1846, a royal commission also recommended that the construction of terminals in central London should be avoided, a warning that ultimately led to the start of the construction of the underground system in 1860.Parsons proposed a London railway that would follow a route from Brentford in west London to Hammersmith and through Kensington and Chelsea.From there, he wrote, it would run across Victoria Street and “through a low part of Westminster” before “passing close against the inside of the first pier of Hungerford Bridge and under the first arch of Waterloo Bridge, enclosing all that immense flat comprised in the end of the river between its north bank and the nearest pier of Hungerford Bridge which may now be seen at low water, covered with mud, and sending forth anything but agreeable or wholesome odours”.“It is on this spot that I propose to place the grand Central Station, the site for it being formed by making a solid embankment of as much of this large area as may be necessary,” he added.Christian Wolmar, the author of Cathedrals of Steam, a book about London’s great railway stations, said: “In the 1840s, there weren’t many stations that near the centre.“They were all in places like Bishopsgate or Nine Elms or outside the centre, precisely because building into the centre was too expensive.”The Stockton and Darlington railway was officially opened on 27 September 1825, making it the world’s first public steam-powered passenger railway.An estimated 40,000 people witnessed the steam locomotive Locomotion No 1 pull the inaugural train.The new railway connected coalmines to the port at Stockton and proved the practicality of steam trains for long-distance transport.Explore more on these topicsHeritageRail transportLondonYorkEnglandnewsShareReuse this content",

Photograph: Chris de Bode/Panos PicturesSome of the most disadvantaged communities in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia are taking part in Plan International’s Safe Schools projectByChris de BodeSun 7 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShare“When can I go back to school?” That’s the first question many children across Latin America start their day with. For millions in the region, there’s often no guarantee that their school will be open, accessible or safe that day.Classrooms caught in crossfire, hours-long walks and buildings destroyed by natural disasters are just some of the obstacles children face. On top of that, extreme poverty and displacement force many to drop out.Even when school is out of reach, children have an innate desire to learn. They turn bedrooms into study spaces, long walks into daily routines and ruins into classrooms. Whether it is sharing textbooks with friends, scraping together coins for a school uniform or leaving their homes to stay in remote boarding schools, their determination propels them on to find ways to keep learning.In these portraits, Chris de Bode captures how children and their communities, even in the face of conflict, disaster or poverty, hold on to education. The series highlights children’s unwavering drive to learn.Plan International’sSafe Schoolsproject includes catch-up classes to bridge learning gaps, financial support for children at risk of dropping out, awareness sessions for parents and physical changes to make schools safer, such as reinforced construction, evacuation drills and training for teachers. The project is supported by the EU.Abri, 9, EcuadorView image in fullscreenNine-year-old Abri uses her unicorn, Caba, to express her feelings. “He knows all my secrets,” she says. Moreover, during the recent gang violence inEcuador, she continues, “Caba was scared when the criminals escaped.”Abri mostly stays inside the house, due to insecurity and the risk of mugging or robbery. She and her mother left Cuba in hopes of improving their life circumstances in Ecuador. Her mother works long hours to afford the school bus and other educational materials, leaving Abri by herself, and says loneliness has begun to affect her. At school, Abri finds it difficult to focus and interact with her new classmates. “In Cuba, I played in the park all the time. Here, I don’t have many friends,” she says. “That is why I play with Caba.”Erika and her parents, Quito, EcuadorView image in fullscreenIn a country where sexual harassment at schools is widespread and sex education is limited, Erika’s parents fear that a teenage pregnancy could derail her dreams of going to university.Sexual and gender-based violence is a longstanding, pervasive problem in Ecuador’s schools. Reports indicate that over the last decade, thousands of cases of sexual violence have been documented, involving teachers, school staff and even students. Walking to school as a girl comes with its own set of risks too. Every day, 12-year-old Erika is accompanied by her father. “There was one day when I had to go by myself, and a motorcycle followed me,” she recalls. “The driver cut me off and tried to grab me. It was really scary.”Erika’s father is worried about his daughter’s future, not only because of the risk of violence but also the lack of sex education. “It’s like schools here are afraid to teach children about their bodies. But it would prevent many teenage pregnancies,” he says. “My biggest concern is that this could happen to Erika too. She knows what she wants: to study and to succeed. We hope she can go to a university.”Saray, 11, Quito, EcuadorView image in fullscreenDisplaced from Venezuela, 11-year-old Saray and her family struggle to make ends meet. While Saray, her parents and siblings have found safety in Ecuador, generating income is a constant battle, as her father relies on an informal job.Saray is the only one of her siblings who goes to school and her entire family works to support her education. Paying for the textbooks and uniforms remains a burden, Saray explains: “We need a new notebook for each subject but we can only afford one.” Without the proper materials, she risks failing courses.In addition to textbooks, the school requires three different uniforms: “A formal one for Mondays, a sports uniform and a regular one,” she says. Ultimately, the school psychologist eased some of the family’s financial strain by helping them obtain secondhand uniforms.Her family hopes that she will become a lawyer and break the cycle of poverty. “It’s a long shot,” her mother admits. “But I am motivated,” Saray says.Yulitza, 16, Piura region, PeruView image in fullscreenDespite daily struggles with a failing motorbike and financial hardship, Yulitza, 16, travels hours to attend a better school.An old, barely functioning motorbike with a flimsy sidecar is the only chance Yulitza has for a quality education. Every day, she and her brother make a journey of an hour and a half to school on the motorcycle that once belonged to their uncle. “I didn’t want to go to the schools near my village,” Yulitza says. “There are too few teachers. And even when they’re present, they often don’t teach. Sometimes they send the students home early, like at 1pm, while school is supposed to go until three.”The family depends on the motorbike, which consumes about 30 soles (£6.30) worth of fuel each week. There’s not enough money for maintenance, partly because the little income the family has goes towards school supplies.To help her stay in school, Yulitza receives financial support from Plan International. The organisation also works to raise awareness about the importance of education through sessions with parents. She also takes part in awareness sessions, helping her stay focused on her education. “I want to be so many things,” she says. “Right now, I’m thinking about becoming a psychologist, a doctor or a teacher. Or maybe an accountant.”Greysi, 13, Piura region, PeruView image in fullscreenGrowing up in a community that grapples with extreme poverty and lacks basic services, Greysi’s family struggled to afford food and rent, let alone school materials. “That’s why I decided I should take matters into my own hands”, says the now 13-year-old, with a maturity far beyond her years. Greysi started selling glasses of wobbly gelatine and crushed ice at village meetings two years ago. “From what I sold, I invested in new products, like cookies and soda. My sales got better and better, so I decided to open my own shop.” Standing in front of her little store in an informal settlement in one of the most marginal neighbourhoods in northernPeru, she proudly talks about the growth of her small business.“With the money that’s left, I buy school supplies for me and my little sisters. And I try to save up for university.” Higher education is out of reach for most students in Peru, Greysi realises, and that motivates her to expand her shop. “I want to be a lawyer, but university is extremely expensive. That’s why I save as much as possible. And I teach my little sisters to do the same.”Stalin, 14, Piura Region, PeruView image in fullscreenStalin, 14, lives in a sandy, remote village in the northern region of Peru. Every day, he rolls up his trousers and wades through the river on his way to school. During the rainy season, which normally runs from March to April, high water levels force him to stay at home. “The current of the water is strong, and sometimes people die after being pulled away by the current,” he says. “It’s too risky.” When it rains, Stalin misses weeks of school. In recent years, the rainy season has lasted longer and the storms have become more intense. “I fall behind my classmates,” he admits. “I’m the only one who has to cross the river. I feel like I’m missing too many classes. It sucks.”The months of rain not only affect Stalin’s route to school but also the school’s infrastructure.“Sometimes the rain comes through the school roofs. Then we get classes via WhatsApp. But at home, we don’t have any connection when it rains.”Supported by Plan International’s project, which includes extra classes, Stalin is catching up on part of his learning gap. “I need more help in class, especially in math, to keep up with my classmates. I hope to be at the same level as them again.”Samuel, 14, Chocó, ColombiaView image in fullscreenIn Colombia’s Chocó region, where continuing conflict often confines students to their homes, Samuel struggles to keep up. While relying on his father’s phone and limited electricity to study, he longs to return to school.“I really want to go to school every day,” says Samuel. Sometimes, he has no other option than to stay at home because it is too unsafe outside for children. When forced to stay at home, Samuel receives his lessons via WhatsApp on his dad’s mobile phone. However, when his dad goes to work, Samuel is unable to study. This is just one of the many reasons he is eager to be in school. “I want my teacher to explain things and to have someone to review and correct my exercises,” Samuel says.Yili, 16, Chocó, ColombiaView image in fullscreenIn Colombia, gender inequality continues to push girls like 16-year-old Yili out of school, as the burden of domestic work and caregiving often falls on them.Yili describes how girls in Colombia often do domestic work to pay for an education. “For the past few years, I worked in people’s homes to earn money for school supplies,” she says. Balancing work, school, housework and caring for her younger siblings eventually caused Yili to drop out: “I failed two subjects and was not allowed to go back to school.”Yili notes that it is often girls who drop out. “I have more boys than girls in my class. Another challenge is girls getting pregnant. It happened to one of my best friends. She dropped out of school and couldn’t find a job. Now she stays home with her baby.”With support from Plan International’s back-to-school programme, Yili was able to resume her education. She still does homework while helping her mother at home, but the financial support allows her to devote more time to her studies. “If I had to do housework all my life, I would be so bored. That’s why I want to go to school. Physics and chemistry, and learning new things, that’s what I love.”Brayan, Chocó, ColombiaView image in fullscreenIt takes Brayan two hours to get to school each day. His route is not without risks. “The road I take is long and muddy, especially when it rains. Sometimes there are dangerous snakes on the road,” he says.These issues contribute to school dropouts in Indigenous communities in the Colombian region of Chocó, as families often live far from regular schools.Brayan explains: “I need to walk a long way to the terminal and then take the bus to school. I often go without breakfast. When I am late, I often cannot enter the class any more.”Because bus tickets are too expensive for Brayan’s family to afford every day, he sometimes stays at home.His journey to school is further complicated by the need to take care of his school uniform. “My father had to sell our chickens to purchase it. That’s why I cannot damage or stain it. When boys in my class play football at school, I don’t play along because I am afraid to rip my pants,” he says.Leandro, Tarija Department, BoliviaView image in fullscreenEvery day, Leandro, who is 11 years old, walks along the side of the Pan-American Highway to school. “Cars drive really fast and there are no speed bumps. The path I walk is very narrow in some places,” he says. Not too long ago, there was a fatal accident on the road. “Especially when I am by myself, I feel like I could get hit easily.”Sometimes Leandro takes the bus to school. “But only if the bus comes. It doesn’t come often,” he says. “Next year, no one knows if the school bus will still run.” Despite the risks, Leandro goes to school each day. “At least I can still go to school. It takes me about 30 minutes. But if the bus stops running, some of my classmates won’t come to class any more.”Leandro and his family migrated from Argentina and now live inBolivia, close to the southern border. He notices differences in the education system. “In Argentina, the school supplies and classrooms were better,” he says.The road to school is not only dangerous because of traffic, it also runs alongside steep cliffs. “Sometimes there are landslides and hail storms around here,” Leandro says.Carla, 14, and Janet, 12, Tarija department, BoliviaView image in fullscreenSisters Carla and Janet attend a distant boarding school because there are no high schools near their home town. The school’s poor living conditions, and feelings of loneliness and isolation make life difficult for the sisters.Carla says: “Only kids from distant places come here. I really miss my father and brother. My dad struggles to pay for our school costs. Because meals are included here and we don’t have to travel to school, going to a boarding school is more affordable.”After their mother unexpectedly died, Carla had to leave school. “I didn’t go to school for two years to help my dad with chores and take care of the family,” she says. “After a while, he saved up enough money so I could go back to school.”Carla and Janet still struggle to afford the clothing for school. Luckily people in the village organised a fair to raise money, Carla says: “We used that money to buy uniforms. Without a uniform, you can’t go to school.”Violeta, 11, Tarija Department, BoliviaView image in fullscreenFor Violeta, who is 11, school is a vital refuge: a place where she feels safe and inspired to dream of becoming a ballerina, in contrast with the risks she faces on her daily journey. She pictures herself performing on a stage. “I hope to be in a ballet,” she says. “When we dance at school, I wear this hat. I feel relaxed when dancing.” School is a place where Violeta feels secure and happy.However, travelling to school is a different story. Violeta travels along a path through the woods to get to school. Many children in her community walk this path but for girls, it can represent an additional risk. “Sometimes there are drunk people on the road,” she says. “When I don’t walk with my brother, they try to harass girls like me. It is less safe for a girl.”Aylin, 11, Alely, 15, and Anthony, two, with mother DalitaView image in fullscreenIn Bolivia’s southernmost region of Tarija, single mother Dalita, 37, works long hours selling goods to ensure her children can stay in school, despite mounting medical bills and the high cost of education.With only a small income from her shop, she is afraid she cannot afford schooling. Still, she keeps her chin up for her children. Like many women in Bolivia, Dalita is raising her children by herself. This is a reality for many families across the country. “I am like a mother and father to them,” she says.“The school asks for a lot of books, supplies and uniforms,” Dalita says. “I try to manage but I have to do it step by step. I can’t buy everything at once.”To ensure her children can stay in school, Dalita works long hours. She sells her shop goods in the streets from six in the morning until eight at night, hoping to sell enough to take care of her children. “I’m not the kind of mom who gives up,” she says. “I would sacrifice anything for them, just to make sure they can stay in school.”Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayAmericasEcuadorPeruColombiaBoliviafeaturesShareReuse this content",

But the problem with that is training people isn’t about cost, it’s that the doctor jobs that need to be filled don’t have much career progression, so people don’t apply for them. You can’t force people to take those jobs, so we offer them to applicants from abroad.MaimunaI based it on people I knew at medical school saying they wanted to leave for somewhere with better pay.ThakshayiniMy dad had almost 20 years of experience when we moved here, and he had to take an entry-level doctor job. I was five and my sister was three, and we’re now both doctors. So that’s two homegrown doctors who are only here because an immigrant was given one of those jobs.View image in fullscreenSharing plateMaimunaI’m really into fitness, and I think the food industry is massively predatory, but we agreed that size doesn’t always correlate with health. I asked if people from other ethnic groups, such as Asian or Black, present with health issues at lower BMIs compared with white people. She said yes, but that genetics is also a factor.ThakshayiniI talked about the differences across populations; there’s a correlation between diabetes and weight, but also between diabetes and race, and obesity and race – we don’t know enough to unpick it. But doctors still tell patients like me, “You’ve got pain because you’re fat, lose weight”, then it turns out it was something else.View image in fullscreenFor aftersMaimunaAssisted dying is against my religion, but I worry there would be instances where people would do it because they feel they are a burden.

Asurvey from the British Medical Associationfound that doctors were in favour of assisted dying, apart from those working in palliative and geriatric care. Thakshayini said she’s not in those areas of medicine herself, but wondered if some had concerns that assisted dying might move resources away from palliative care.ThakshayiniAs a patient, I’d want that option if it came down to it. As a doctor, it would be really difficult to be involved as a cause of a patient’s death, even if that was something they wanted.View image in fullscreenTakeawaysMaimunaI really enjoyed speaking to Thakshayini.

However, we’ve become awarethat there is a consistent pattern of control from this girl: demands about whenand where they meet,or what our daughter can and can’t wear. If our daughter goes against her, she risks being shunned and ignored or spoken to aggressively.This girl does not let our daughter interact with others without her. There is abarrage ofdemandingmessages and callsat homeabout arrangements, and we see our daughter being vigilant and tense, having to respond immediately. Sometimes there is unkindness, for example saying our daughter’s clothes are babyish. Aroundthe controlling behaviour, theyseem to interact more normally,having fun,playingand chatting – it is this Jekyll and Hyde patternthat makes it so difficult to knowhow to support our daughter.We knowthis girl hasproblemswith anxiety, and haven’tspoken withher parents,but feel we will have to. Our daughter hasbecome more openabout what is going on, and we are trying to support her to be more assertive and to recognise that thiscontrolling behaviouris not OK.She seems to understand and feel this to a degree, but so far is not ableto say anything. Sometimes she gets angry with us if we talk about it. We see her feeling powerless and want her to move on from this situation. Thegirls are about to start secondary schooland are in the same class.What a lot for your daughter to deal with. This is a horrible situation. A word with her new teacher is definitely in order. It’s a shame they are in the same class, because this is a perfect opportunity for your daughter to split from this friend and start anew.UKCP-registered child and adolescent psychotherapist Ross Cormack was “struck by the feelings of powerlessness you see in your daughter, and these feelings seem to have been replicated in your responses. You’ve grown in awareness in terms of the negative behaviours put on your daughter, yet remain uncertain in how best to respond. Powerlessness can freeze families, which can exacerbate stressful situations as it feels there’s no way out.”You’ve identified that this girl has anxiety problems (fear makes people want to control situations), but it isn’t your job, nor your daughter’s, to fix that.It’s great your daughter is speaking to you, but “there is a need for more ‘action’ from you to support and protect your daughter”, said Cormack. “This kind of behaviour needs clear boundaries and expectations. It would be a difficult situation for an adult to manage, so your daughter needs help.”Inform the teacher, try to build your child’s self-esteem, and encourage her to invite other friends round and to join clubs her friend doesn’t belong toWhat’s important is that your daughter doesn’t become more anxious. Also, he said, “talking to her about being assertive locates the solution solely in her, when she doesn’t have the capacity or the confidence to be assertive. I would encourage instead that you think about helping her set clearer boundaries. For example, where is the ‘line’ with phone calls and texts over what’s acceptable?”I would do this: inform the teacher; try to build my child’s self-esteem; tell her that “no” is a complete sentence, and let her practise saying it in environments she feels safer in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Ultimately, your child will learn that no one can or should control her behaviour (not even you) and that controlling isn’t about love or friendship, but about power. And anyone who needs to get power over another person is actually displaying weakness. These are big things for anyone to learn, let alone an 11-year-old, and they may take time.

To be fair, my use of the word “precinct” to describe this lovingly titivated landmark feels a bit shabby, as does “retail experience”. And plain old “mall” definitely won’t do, because Battersea’s collection of 150-odd shops is very much in the la-di-da, aspirational, lululemon, Mulberry and Malin+Goetz range of money-frittering, all set over multiple floors with dramatic mezzanines. This is a sumptuous paean to industrial chic, with pleasing air-conditioning and polished floors, and there is currently no more jocund and luxurious a place in London to spend money you don’t have on things you don’t need.View image in fullscreen‘Plump, voluptuous, wobbly’: the Duck & Rice’shar gauprawn dumplings.In keeping with all this luxury, Battersea’s flagship restaurant right now is the new Duck & Rice, created 10 years ago by the renowned Hong Kong-born British restaurateurAlan Yau OBE, who also founded the likes ofWagamama,YauatchaandHakkasan. The original Duck & Rice’s claim was that it was a Chinese gastropub, which, to my mind, confused it as a brand. Yes, it is indeed housed in a former pub on Berwick Street, but at the time it felt more like a very modern Cantonese restaurant that served roast duck, dim sum, “small chow” and wok dishes, most of them around the £10-£15 mark, as well as so-called “hero dishes” such as lobster laksa for £72. Yes, they sell Pilsner Urquell, which in 2015 was very gastropub-ish, but they also offer an array of lychee, chilli and blue curaçao cocktails, which is, well, a bit Ritzy’s nightclub.At the new Duck & Rice Battersea, however, they have £415 bottles of Vega Sicilia, which isn’t at all gastropub, and much more quaffing an oligarch’s cellar with George Osborne while celebrating the glorious 12th. This is made all the more peculiar by the fact that you’re indulging in such pompery at a restaurant that has the dystopian address of “Unit L1-003, Level 1, Phase 2”, and that’s next door to a champagne bar calledControl Room B.Even so, I find the Duck & Rice Battersea fascinating, not least because the great British public are, in 2025, still yet to fully submit to spending big money on important dinners inside shopping centres. The food courts of Westfield, theTrafford Centreand so on are swamped with all manner of casual dining options, but for important anniversaries and birthday dinners, we still lean towards bricks and mortar down the high street or, even better, in some bucolic setting or other.View image in fullscreenThe house special at the Duck & Rice in Battersea: ‘£25 for a glossy, crispy, medium-rare fillet of duck laid across white rice with a bit of cucumber.’Yet here is a restaurant in Battersea power station, just along the way from a pilates studio and a luxury gilet shop, that isn’t really your typical bowl-of-noodles stopgap joint. When we arrived on a Tuesday lunchtime, we were to start with the only guests, but there were 22 cooks in the kitchen, three bartenders and four floor staff. This is a gargantuan space with little about it to love. Still, a round of plump, voluptuous, wobbly freshhar gau, stuffed to nigh bursting with shrimp, were delicious, as was a plate of venison puffs where crisp, warm, buttery pastry meets rich, long-stewed meat. A “Duck old fashioned” with Volcán de mi Tierra tequila and Mozart dark chocolate liqueur was punchy, even if it rather ripped up the rulebook of what an old fashioned should be.For mains, we ordered the classic duck and rice house special, a vegan option of glass noodles with tofu mince and a wildcard Indonesian dish of Assam chilli prawns. After they appeared, however, we entered what I call the “service Siberia” stage of a meal, when no server speaks to or looks at us ever again. Those main courses were filling, but largely unmemorable: £25 for a glossy, crispy, medium-rare fillet of duck laid across white rice with a bit of cucumber, and tofu noodles that could really have done with more oomph, heat and spark; the whopping great chilli king prawns, on the other hand, were possibly the highlight of the meal: fiery as heck, and in a fragrant pool of bright red, tamarind-heavy sauce.View image in fullscreenThe Duck & Rice’s vegan glass noodles and minced soya claypot ‘could really have done with more oomph’.I might even have lingered over ashoumeiwhite tea or imperialpu erinfusion and leafed through the dessert menu, but the moment we finished the prawns, the bill was plonked on the table. By this stage, there were still only eight other guests, so you might think they’d have liked me to stay and spend more money, even if only to make the place look just a bit busier. After all, if there’s one thing for sure at Battersea power station, it’s that there are plenty of other places where I can spend my cash.The Duck & RiceUnit L1-003, Level 1, Phase 2, Battersea power station, London SW11, 020-3327 7881.

Get the ratio of this three-tier national treasure wrong,as the New York Times stood accusedof doing in 2021, when its Instagram account posted a picture of squares that one user described as “an insult to Canadians everywhere”, and you’ll discover you can push them only so far.The Times is not alone in attracting ire. So popular are nanaimo (pronounced nuh-NYE-mo) bars, named after the British Columbian logging and mining town where they are said to have originated, that Canada Post put them on a stamp in 2019 … only to face similarhowls of outrage, albeit in Canadian: “One hesitates to be critical,” Nanaimo’s mayor explained carefully, “but it’s not a very accurate depiction.”View image in fullscreenFelicity’s perfect nanaimo bars – cue ‘howls of outrage’. Thumbnail pics by Felicity.In short, Canadians, who in 2006 voted the nanaimo bar the “nation’s favourite confection”, feel very strongly about these sugary little treats, a mainstay of kids’ birthday parties, wedding buffets and funeral teas from Nanaimo to Nova Scotia, though if Justin Trudeau had any problem withthe version served upby White House chefs during his state dinner with Barack Obama in 2016, he was too polite to say so. Please don’t hold back in the comments below – I’m British, I can take it.The baseBefore I tasted a nanaimo bar, I had assumed that the base, whose principal ingredients are biscuit and desiccated coconut, was the kind of crunchy affair usually found on the bottom of cheesecakes. I was wrong. With the exception of the Canadian Living recipe, which sticks it in the oven for 10 minutes to dry it out, the nanaimo relies on the coagulating power of refrigeration, rather than on heat.View image in fullscreenCanadian Living’s nanaimo bars swear by ‘moist, sweet coconut’ for texture.Revelation two: instead of the large lumps of biscuit suspended in chocolate that one might expect in a British fridge cake, this base is made from fine crumbs soaked in sweet, cocoa-flavoured butter, giving it a soft, almost squidgy texture. Once I’ve come to terms with this fact (I do love a crunchy base), I need to decide the best replacement for the graham cracker crumbs demanded by Canadian recipes. Graham (pronounced “gram”) crackers, are a peculiarly North American phenomenon named after whatthe Encyclopedia Britannica describesas the “eccentric … clergyman and health reformer” Sylvester Graham, who travelled around early 19th-century New England warning against the dangers of lust, as incited by, among other things, refined sugars and grains. His unsweetened, fatless crackers were made from coarsely ground wholemeal wheat flour. Modern equivalents, Britannica explains, “would likely be unrecognisable to Graham, as they are typically made with refined white flour, sugar and trans fats, and are flavoured with honey or cinnamon; chocolate varieties are also common”.They are also £18 a box online, excluding delivery, which means they will not feature in my recipe, though I do buy a bag of graham cracker crumbs to try to work out the nearest equivalent. To my surprise, they’re a fine, if slightly gritty powder, rather than a crumb, with a flavour somewhere between a British digestive and a rich tea biscuit. The original texture feels somewhat irrelevant, so, having given rich tea, digestives and Hobnobs (a suggestionfrom the Cupcake Jemma team here in the UK) a try, I conclude that you should go with whichever takes your fancy. Personally, I enjoy the more restrained sweetness of a rich tea, but you might yearn for the oaty nubbliness of a Hobnob or the more malty flavour of a digestive. That said, I’ve deliberately left in a few larger chunks to give the base a more interesting texture, which may be offensive to nanaimo purists – in which case, keep whizzing.(I do try baking my own graham crackers usinga recipefrom Deb at Smitten Kitchen, which, for some reason, possibly relating to metric conversions, end up sticky, chewy and hard to grind – they taste good, but as far as I’m concerned they add an unnecessary layer of complexity to proceedings; the nanaimo bar was designed to use processed ingredients, and I’m happy to let that spirit live on in mine.)View image in fullscreenSusan Mendelson nanaimo bars feature the most popular base.The biscuits are bulked out by that typically British Columbian ingredient, coconut – the Zingerman’s Bakehouse Celebrate Every Daybookcalls for fresh,chef Susan Mendelson, whose recipe Margaret Atwood included in her 1987 Canlit Foodbook, unsweetened shredded stuff, and Serious Eats and Canadian Living magazine advise the more moist, sweetened kind. The last is not readily available in the UK, butnigella.comsays you can readily substitute it by stirring sugar and hot water into the desiccated stuff. Fresh coconut leaves the biscuit layer too wet, and almost like trifle, while the sweetened sort only adds to the sugar content, so straightforward desiccated feels the best and easiest choice.Nuts also feature. Atwood, the New York Times confides, favours walnuts, but Joyce Hardcastle, whoserecipe won a nanaimo contestto nail down an official version back in 1986, specifies finely chopped almonds, while Mendelson offers a choice of “finely chopped walnuts, almonds or pecans (or a mixture)”. Like the great novelist, I have a strong preference for the bitterness of walnuts, which echo and enhance those in the cocoa, making for a pleasingly rich, almost fruity contrast with the sweetness of the other layers. Toast them, as Zingerman’s suggests, to really bring out their flavour and, while you’re at it, why not do the same with the coconut?On binding and thicknessThe crumbs, coconut and nuts are suspended in a kind of ganache made from melted butter stirred over heat with sugar and egg, and flavoured with cocoa powder. The most popular base is Mendelson’s from the New York Times, which contains the lowest ratio of butter and sugar to nuts and crumbs, though I will be increasing the cocoa content slightly to ramp up those bitter notes. I don’t see any benefit in baking it, though; that just makes it crumbly and hard to cut.View image in fullscreenOnly Molly Allen’s nanaimo bars include some salt to balance the sweetness.At the risk of provoking Canadian ire – I’m desperate to come and visit, so this is a risky business – the base absolutely should be thicker than the custard or chocolate, because these are, in truth, mere icings, gilding the lily with sweetness and fat. Too much of a good thing is still too much, unless you spend all day working outside in sub-zero temperatures. Then you get a pass.The custardSpoiler alert: this isn’t actually custard, it’s custard-flavoured buttercream – and, in my opinion, and the considered opinion of my testers, the main cause of the common complaint that nanaimo bars are, as the New York Times put it delicately, “tremendously sweet” (this from the country that invented marshmallow fluff). That’s because most of the recipes I try cram icing (powdered) sugar into butter at a ratio of 8:1 – for context,Mary Berry’s buttercreamuses two parts icing sugar to one part butter. Only Hardcastle andthe Serious Eats version, by Canadian writer and former bakery owner Molly Allen, suggest a more restrained 4:1, though I’ve reduced the sugar content even further to suit my own taste. If you feel it’s lacking, feel free to adjust it as you go. Bonus: a lower sugar content makes for a lighter consistency, particularly if, as in those same two recipes, you loosen it with milk rather than double cream.View image in fullscreenJoyce Hardcastle ‘specifies’ finely chopped almonds in her nanaimo bars. So take note.Note that almost every recipe I try, with the exception ofCanadian Living, specifies unsalted butter, with Hardcastle going as far as to call for “European-style cultured” butter, which has been allowed to ferment before churning, giving it a slightly tangier, more complex flavour. This, I have no hesitation in telling you, is a complete waste of money, because no one is able to detect anything about the butter once it’s been drowned in sugar. Only Allen recommends including some salt to balance all the sweetness – personally, I’d just use salted butter to begin with anyway, not least because that’s what I keep on hand, but, however you include it, salt is a must.The unusual part about the nanaimo bar is the use of custard powder as a flavouring; traditionally,our very own Bird’s, which suits me just fine. American recipes often propose “vanilla pudding mix” as a substitute, but for once I have just the thing on the shelf already. As a cornflour custard devotee, I’d recommend dissolving it, along with some sugar, in milk before whipping it in, to avoid that slightly powdery finish common to all those I try.Allen and Canadian Living are also unusual in using vanilla extract to ramp up the custard powder’s “flavouring”. For me, one of the charms of Bird’s custard is this nostalgic artificial vanilla flavour, but if you avoid ultra-processed foods, then by all means use cornflour and genuine vanilla extract instead, but otherwise I see no reason to spoil things with the real, highly perfumed deal.The chocolateChocolate is chocolate – for me, 70% cocoa and butter makes a fine topping. You could experiment with adding flavourings such as orange zest or the New York Times’ sea salt, though I don’t think the combination of nutmeg and custard can be improved upon.The construction and slicingView image in fullscreenZingerman’s bakehouse toasts its nuts –andits coconuts, which then go into these nanaimo bars.The single most important thing I learn in this whole process is patience. Chill each layer thoroughly before adding the next, and everything will be much easier, a detail tactfully omitted from many of the recipes I try. (If you’re Canadian, no doubt you justknow.) The crumb layer needs to be solid enough for the buttercream to spread easily on top, and the buttercream should be firm enough to take the warm chocolate afterwards without melting into it. Oh, and line that tin, unless you want to end up with scratches.As Allen notes, nanaimo bars are best served cold from the fridge, rather than at room temperature, whatever some recipes claim. “You can also let them come to room temperature for several minutes, if you prefer, you’ll just have to be prepared for very soft chocolate and custard layers,” she allows, though perhaps my fridge is Canadian room temperature.

Tip out and leave to cool slightly. In the same pan, toast the coconut until it’s apricot-coloured, then tip out likewise. Use a food processor (or the end of rolling pin and a plastic bag) to smash the biscuits into uneven crumbs; a few larger chunks are fine. Roughly grind the nuts in a food processor or mortar, again leaving several large chunks and being careful not to overprocess and turn them into butter.View image in fullscreenPut the butter and sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter melts. Meanwhile, put the biscuit crumbs, nuts and coconut in a large bowl, and line a roughly 20cm x 20cm baking tin with baking paper (scrunch it up first to help ease it into the corners and sides).Stir the cocoa and a pinch of salt into the butter and sugar bowl, then add the egg and stir until the mix thickens slightly (you may need to whisk it). Off the heat, combine with the biscuit, nut and coconut mixture and, once that’s all coated, tip it into the lined tin and pat down firmly into an even, flat layer. Cover and freeze for 10 minutes (or chill for 30), until firm.View image in fullscreenMeanwhile, put the butter for the custard layer in a large bowl or stand mixer and beat until soft. Sift over the icing sugar, then beat in until the mixture is really soft and airy. In a small bowl, stir the custard powder and milk until the powder dissolves, then beat this, and a pinch of salt, if necessary, into the custard mixture. Using a spatula or similar, spread this on top of the now chilled and firm biscuit base, taking care not to get too many crumbs into the custard, then cover and chill again for at least an hour, until really firm.View image in fullscreenMelt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, and grate in the nutmeg, if using. Take off the heat, leave to cool slightly, then tip on top of the butter layer and tilt the tin so the chocolate spreads evenly. Bang the tin against a counter to settle the chocolate layer, then cover and return to the fridge. After about 20 minutes, once the chocolate has begun to set, but is still tacky, score into bars or squares, then return to the fridge to set solid.View image in fullscreenTo cut, lift out of the tin (use the paper lining to help you), then slice – to make life easier, use a knife dipped into hot water and quickly wiped dry. Covered, the nanaimo bars will keep well in the fridge for up to five days, and can also be wrapped and frozen.View image in fullscreenNanaimo bars: Canadian icon, or a poor third to poutine and butter pies?

I was 34. I had no symptoms (none!) and it came at the worst possible time, although there is never a good time.I am a musician and was one week away from flying to New Zealand to be in a show. I was extremely excited about the show and, to be organised, I thought I’d get a blood test to check my iron levels before I left the country for five weeks.Six hours after the blood test, I got a call from my doctor telling me that something was wrong. I was what’s called neutropenic. In layman’s terms it meant I had no immune system and I needed to go to hospital immediately.The kindness of strangers: I pulled over in hysterics – then a passing driver saved me from the spiderRead moreIt made no sense. I had been in Savers, at my nieces’ school fete and the pub the day before. The doctor said to wear two masks and stand outside or I might not survive an infection – which sounded like a ridiculous overreaction for what I was sure was a mixed-up test. It wasn’t. After entering that hospital I wouldn’t leave it again for six weeks.At around 7pm I was told I had cancer (who knew they have haematologists in emergency?). The diagnosis was utterly overwhelming. Although my family is amazing, they weren’t close by that night. A friend had come for a few hours to help translate what the doctors were saying while I was in a state of shock. But I was alone in my hospital bed when I woke up around 3am and it all suddenly hit me. All I could think about was that not only was I not going to New Zealand, but I also had cancer, and it was going to kill me. It always seems to kill people in the movies – writers, I beg you to stop doing that. Lots of us live.As I was death-spiralling, a nurse walked past and asked if I was OK. I wasn’t. I just dissolved and, through tears, explained what was happening. He asked if I wanted a hug. I did, and I have never needed one more in my life. His name was Ben.That night was probably the scariest part of my whole time with cancer – I’m now in remission. I never saw Ben again but his name stuck with me through the six weeks in hospital and eight months of chemo. His kind act meant the world to me then, and still means the world to me now.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceFrom making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But once we met, I wanted to spend all my time with herWhen I slid into Maria’s DMs, saying something like, “You seem intriguing – sending love and light,” I wasn’t expecting anything to come from it. I’d had an ongoing illness since my early 20s, had lost a lot of weight and become reclusive. But something in me was changing; I’d decided to come off the medication I’d been on for years, hoping to improve my health so I had the energy to push myself out of my isolated state.I put off meeting Maria because of my insecurities about how I looked, after my illness. But once we met, I wanted to spend all my time with her. I hadn’t had sex in 15 years and had almost forgotten what it felt like. But sex with Maria – slow and sensual, with lots of kissing and touching – was completely different to the sex I’d had in my 20s. It was the kind of sex I’d always wanted but never had.Still, there was an imbalance; Maria was a working mum, while I wasn’t working, which caused tension. She would push me away, wanting to be with someone who could relate to what was going on in her life and support her. To become that, I needed to be in a position, physically and mentally, where I could work again. Not long after meeting Maria, my health rebounded almost miraculously. Stopping medication helped me gain 23kg, my strength returned, and I got a job, which made our relationship more equal.It felt so good to be having sex again after such a long time, and with a beautiful woman I felt passionately aboutIt felt so good to be having sex again after such a long time, and with a beautiful woman I felt passionately about, that I wanted to have it almost every time we saw each other. As a working mother, Maria didn’t have the energy for that, and resented not being able to be present for her daughter in the way she wanted to be.Sexwas off the table when her daughter was around, and Maria’s interest in a slower, non-goal-oriented Tantric approach, where we just breathe and touch each other, sometimes with our clothes on, didn’t seem the best use of the time we had. I became frustrated that my needs weren’t being met.Maria suggested we take a three-month break. I used the time to focus on my career and work on myself, and our relationship is stronger since we got back together a month ago. Although I’d love to build a life together, and hope one day we will, I’m realising that Maria’s need for us to have our own lives is healthy, especially when I’m still rebuilding mine.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

But Scott makes me feel valued, appreciated and sexyAround the time Scott DM’d me, I was sharing a bedroom with my five-year-old daughter and hadn’t had sex in five years. After I suggested we move the conversation to WhatsApp, we started messaging constantly. I craved being with him, and felt as if I missed his body, even though we hadn’t met yet.When we eventually met three months later, I felt a disconnect between the person in front of me and who I’d got to know over the phone. He was like a ghost in the world, and it scared me – as a mother, I couldn’t risk getting into a relationship with the wrong person. Online he was great company, but in reality, he couldn’t walk properly and was in pain. Everything seemed much more real and complicated. But when I pulled back, he pushed forward.I asked Scott to check in before initiating, to see if it’s truly what I want, and that mindful consent makes me feel more connected to himThis is how we do it: ‘Some people can just be doing the washing up and want to have sex – that’s my boyfriend’Read moreThe first time we had sex, it felt so natural. Scott was what I’d always dreamed of: attentive, caring, open‑minded, curious. I’d had sexual relationships since I was 16, but I never felt satisfied the way I do with Scott. In my relationship with my daughter’s father, I felt neglected, rejected and invisible. But Scott makes me feel valued, appreciated and sexy.I wished we could spend hours in bed together, but I had to get up for work and make my daughter breakfast. When she was at her dad’s, Scott and I would explore Tantra and kink. But when that kind of sex left me feeling drained, I started to set boundaries.When I suggested three months without sex, I wanted space to re-energise. The break gave us the reset we needed. We’re both more present, and there’s more communication before, during and after sex. I’ve asked Scott to check in before initiating, so I can pause to see if it’s truly what I want, and that mindful consent makes me feel more connected to him. So now, instead of feeling drained after sex, I feel nourished.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content",

It is a parking scam that is gaining traction, prompting councils across the country to warn motorists.Last week,Cheshire West and Chester Councilalerted residents to the scam texts, some of which threaten the risk of having your licence suspended, court action or credit score damage if you don’t pay up.‘Pay here’: the QR code ‘quishing’ scam targeting driversRead moreMaria Byrne, the council’s director of environment and communities, said: “Our parking team has recently been made aware of these scams. They may appear urgent or official, but they are not and include a link to a fake payment page.”Parking tickets can be confusing as the two main types are both abbreviated to PCN. A “penalty charge notice” is usually issued by a council and is for a parking infringement on public land such as a high street or council car park.Meanwhile, a private parking company or landowner will give you a “parking charge notice”. You might get one, for example, if you parked for too long in a supermarket car park.The rise in app- and phone-based parking payments – as well as therecord numbersof tickets being issued – has opened a new frontier for fraudsters with scams taking multiple forms. These range from fake texts toquishing scams– so called because they are phishing attacks that start with a QR code.The BBC also recently reported that criminals are targeting people paying for parking at machines withhidden skimming devicesattached to the contactless payment reader.The messages appear to be phishing texts, so even if you have not used a QR code or parking machine, you could still receive one.What the scam looks likeThe texts tend to be written in an official way, mentioning the “issuing authority” and “notice number”. The payment link may ask for your card details and car registration.Some mention the risk of legal proceedings if you don’t pay. They say this could lead to a county court judgment, the threat being it would have a negative impact on your credit rating.View image in fullscreenExample of a fake PCN text.Photograph: British Parking AssociationIn common with other councils who have put out statements warning residents, Cheshire West and Chester Council says it would never send out PCNs for a parking contravention by text. It says genuine PCNs are issued as physical tickets attached to your vehicle windscreen or sent by post.There have also been reports of scam texts being sent to drivers that purport to be from theDriver and Vehicle Standards Agency(DVSA). The DVSA does not deal with parking fines.View image in fullscreenExample of a fake PCN text.Photograph: Norwich City CouncilWhat to doFor starters always check the sender: official messages from a parking provider or local authority will come from verified sources.Look closely at the link you have been sent. Scam giveaways include weird URLs and bad spelling. Check that the URL includes HTTPS, rather than HTTP, before handing over details.Genuine parking notices will always include your vehicle registration, the time of the offence and the location of the infringement. If it doesn’t have these three things then it is a scam.If you receive a text that looks suspicious, do not click on any links or input any personal or financial information. TheBritish Parking Association(BPA) advises that you log into the parking app account if you have one, or contact the local authority directly to verify the claim.If you have clicked on a suspicious link, restart you device as a lot of the links allow a scammer to gain remote access to it. If you restart your phone it will kill the connection.If you’ve filled in your bank details on the link make sure you change your account password. If you handed over money you should inform your bank’s fraud department about the message, the link and what information you gave.It is also worth forwarding the text to 7726 which is a free spam-reporting service. Then delete it.The BPA adds: “Real PCNs are on physical paper and always include instructions onhow to pay or appeal it!”Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchConsumer affairsMotoringLocal governmentfeaturesShareReuse this content",

Guests can stay in a former sheepfold, stable or barn, or one of five rooms in the main house. Three of the smaller properties have private pools, all rooms have terraces and there is a big shared pool. The buildings have been refurbished by Corsican craftspeople in a minimalist Mediterranean style, using local materials.The neighbouring farm has also been revived around a model of subsistence farming: raising livestock, market gardening and growing traditional crops. The restaurant serves Sardinian-influenced food made with the ingredients grown on the estate and sourced from other local farms. There are just 30 seats, some on a terrace with a fire pit under olive and orange trees.The hamlet is part of the wider Domaine de Murtoli, which has three other places to eat – a traditional Corsican restaurant, a beachfront spot and the Michelin-starred La Table de la Ferme – and offers wine-tasting. It is about 9 miles north to Sartène, an ancient hill town, a few miles south to Erbaju beach, and a little further to the fortress town of Bonifacio.Doubles from £229 B&B,amandriadimurtoli.comRastrello, Umbria, ItalyView image in fullscreenA meal at Rastrello in Umbria, a boutique hotel in a 500-year-old palazzoThis boutique hotel is set in the renovated remains of a 500-year-old palazzo, surrounded by its own olive groves (which are hand-raked at harvest time;rastrellomeans rake in Italian). The palazzo is in the medieval village of Panicale, above Lake Trasimeno. This summer, the hotel opened a new garden annex, increasing the rooms from nine to 16, plus a dipping pool and wellness area. Rooms have wooden floors, stone walls and beams; some have lake views and balconies.The restaurant, Cucina & Giardino, serves the farm’s award-winning extra-virgin olive oil, ingredients from its organic vegetable gardens and surrounding producers, and Umbrian wines. It has a terrace overlooking the lake and its own cookbook, also featuring villagers’ recipes. Guests can take olive oil-tasting workshops and cooking classes, and go on truffle-hunting walks and wine-tasting tours. The homegrown produce is also used in the spa treatments, with scrubs made from olive oil and crushed olive stones mixed with herbs and citrus, and in herbal teas such as lavender, lemon balm and wildflowers.Panicale has a grape festival in September. There is a 40-mile walking and cycling path around the lake, which is the fourth biggest in Italy, with cafe stops at waterfront towns such as Passignano.

Two of the kittens had eye infections and one was blind. The couple later named them Benny, Bjorn, Agnetha and Frida.Mulcahy-Stephenson, 34, and her husband, Adam, 39, contacted a local rescuer who said she could take the kittens in temporarily, but they would have to find homes for them.“It was a life or death decision,” said Mulcahy-Stephenson. “No doubt at least the blind one and probably one of the other ones would be dead by now. So we were a bit like, OK, well, it’s a no-brainer.”After having the cats treated by a vet and vaccinated, they arranged for them to be flown to Paris, where they would then drive down from their home in Barrowford inLancashireto collect them from Calais.The cats were flown with Aegean airlines; only two cats were allowed in the cabin and three of the kittens were placed in a crate in the hold.Mulcahy-Stephenson said: “When we arrived at the Eurotunnel shuttle terminal, we got a text from Lida, our rescuer in Greece, saying: ‘Bethany, the airline has lost three of the kittens,’ and it was absolute panic.“I immediately went into complete shock panic, just absolute bedlam,” she said. “We didn’t know what was going on. We didn’t even know where they were, if they [had] left Greece, if they were in France or if they had been left on the tarmac.”Eventually, they were told the kittens had been located, having been flown from Thessaloniki to Paris, but had not been unloaded in France.Mulcahy-Stephenson said: “They were somehow forgotten in the hold, or not seen. They didn’t come off the plane at all, and the plane got sent straight back to Thessaloniki, which is another three-hour flight.”When the kittens did not arrive in France, the couple immediately feared the worst. “I thought they were going to be dead, never found again, to be honest,” said Mulcahy-Stephenson. “I thought even if they weren’t lost, the shock of being in the noisy hold, [where] it’s cold, they’ve had no food, water … There was a lot of stuff going through my mind, but I didn’t think we were going to see them again.”After initially telling the couple, via their rescuer who spoke Greek and acted as a go-between, it was a two-day wait for another plane back to Paris, the airline agreed to send the cats back via Athens, in the cabin, with a dedicated handler.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was so relieved to see them and have them in the car, safe.”She added: “When they arrived, they were absolutely traumatised, they wouldn’t eat, we had them in the emergency vet.”The couple said they had still not had a proper explanation as to why the cats had been left behind in the hold, or an apology from Aegean.Adam Mulcahy-Stephenson said: “We’d like the airline to acknowledge what the problem is here, and in an ideal world we’d love to force some kind of change … to not have animals in the hold.”Aegean airlines said: “With regard to the three kittens you mentioned, we would like to clarify that they were never lost at any time. Upon the arrival of the flight in Paris, they were not immediately disembarked due to operational reasons. As soon as this was identified, a coordinated response was promptly activated among all involved stations and our customer service department, in order to safeguard their care and security until their reunion with their guardians.“The kittens continued their journey the same day under the direct care of the Aegean crew, which provided them with food and water during the flight, ensuring constant supervision. The same evening, they were safely reunited with their guardians in Paris.”Explore more on these topicsCatsPetsAnimalsAir transportLancashireGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content",

See also rich people’s jewellery.TopGyreThey have a clear function.DaveeedYes. To tell people how rich the wearers are.Gizmo10I was talking about the trophies.DaveeedBut their form is mostly irrelevant to their function. In order to signify your tournament as more important than other tournaments, the trophy needs to be more spectacular in some way. So the tendency is to make them either bigger or more garish. They need to look valuable without actually being valuable, or the winners wouldn’t want to give it to the next winners.ReidMalenfantThey’re supposed to be big. Otherwise they just look unsubstantial, like the oldWorld Cup trophy, the Jules Rimet, or, even smaller, the Ashes urn. Maybe the size of the cup denotes how big a prize it is and how difficult it is to win, like the old European Cup. “Ol’ Big Ears”, as Cloughie called it.PeteTheBeatMaybe because the designers got it so right so quickly, with the classic trophy design. Like the FA Cup. So any attempt to diverge ends up looking trashy, gimmicky and a bit needy. As someone else mentioned, the Ashes is a standout. It’s special to have a symbol that also stands in for the history of a sport and creates an impression of legacy. But it’s hopeless for waving over your head.StevefromNottinghamCompletely agree. Each new trophy tries to do something unique to stand out from the crowd with little thought for design aesthetics. The perfect case in point is the awful trophies for the newer Formula One races.GlobalGazI like the Formula One racing trophies, usually. I think their uniqueness and relationship to the races’ locales make them special. Plus, they are kept by the winning team. The main Formula One world championship trophy has the winners’ names engraved on the rings, each ring encompassing a decade. Thus, creating a legacy trophy that is kept by Formula One.DallasWilliamsI was fortunate to know the legendary designer Kenneth Grange, and he mentioned working on a commission for a lawn bowls championship. He wanted to do something different and elegant, and set about photographing the act of bowling a ball from various angles. He developed a trophy that was a layered sequence of silhouettes showing the way the bowler moved. Naturally, the organisers said “thanks but no thanks” and bought a standard shiny pot instead!Nico Beastie BoyceMy favourite trophy is the cobble awarded to winners of the Paris-Roubaix one-day classic cycle race. It’s also fun to watch skinny-armed pro cyclists hoisting a 12kg+ rock above their heads. Since they’ve just had their bodies battered for 260km (55km of which are on cobbles), it seems a cruel additional punishment!Caledon35It’s pretty cool, and I also like the bike wheel trophy for the Giro di Lombardia. I suppose the ultimate cycling trophies are jerseys, though: yellow, pink, rainbow, that sort of thing.CorkerryThe trophy for the Giro d’Italia is beautiful and practical – a never-ending spiral of gold listing the winners’ names.MaggieMcPView image in fullscreenBritish cyclist Simon Yates celebrates winning the Giro d’Italia in June.Photograph: Jennifer Lorenzini/ReutersWhen the trophies were mostly silver cups, size meant expense and importance. When the trophies became merely “shiny”, rather than silver, the largest trophies became much cheaper; good design remains as expensive as it ever was. The increasing number of big and hideous trophies,attractive only to certain individuals with a good taste bypass, is the direct result.leadballoonThe trophies at Henley Royal Regatta are very nice, especially the newer ones (mostly for the women’s events), which are stunning and modern. Of course, the winners only get to hold them briefly, take photos, and then they get whisked away. But then amateur rowing is a different sort of event from professional football.EledhwenThe Stanley Cup is one of the best-looking trophies there is! Its enormous base is because every winner is inscribed. If you can’t drink out of it, what’s even the point? A trophy should be sturdy enough to survive a drunken mob.rbortolonThe Stanley Cup has survivednumerousincidents involving drunken mobs. It’s had quite a colourful life and, after some touching-up, it still looks grand and stately. Not ugly.TravelinJonesI have to feel sorry for those other sports, then, if this abomination is better-looking than their trophies.marchino61The Welsh Football League trophy is a thing of outstanding beauty.steffanjohnAs a Villa fan, what is this trophy thing you speak of?

Now he leads the campaign for assisted dying and palliative care, as president of the Association for the Right to die with dignity. It is a sign of France’s troubled and patchy health service that 20départementsacross France don’t even have a dedicated palliative care unit. This has come to symbolise how Macron, despite his diplomatic efforts on the world stage, is facing political deadlock at home.On Monday, the centrist French prime ministerFrançois Bayrou, a 74-year-old tractor-driving southwestern politician who calls himself a consensus-builder, is expected to be ousted in a confidence vote, which will bring down his minority government after only nine months. The previous prime minister, the rightwing former Brexit negotiatior,Michel Barnier,lasted only three months before he too was brought down by parliament last December.View image in fullscreenFrançois Bayrou poses on the TV set before an interview with French journalist Lea Salame on 4 September.Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty ImagesOn the surface, the reason for Bayrou’s fall is thebudget. His unpopular €44bn (£38bn) debt-reduction plan, including scrapping two public holidays and freezing most welfare spending, was widely rejected across the political class. He knew parliament would impose a sanction on him over it this autumn, so he chose to jump first.But the French political crisis goes much deeper. It is about the damaged relationship between the people and their politicians, which looks likely to sour the country’s politics until the 2027 presidential election and beyond as the far right remains a potent force. “There is a broad anger towards political leaders who are seen as not bringing any benefit to the people … who are seen as playing more for their political future than the country’s,” said Mathieu Gallard, research director at Ipsos pollsters.A majority of Assembly members will vote against the government, according to their party leaders288RN 123France Insoumise 71Socialists 66Green alliance 38Communists 17Source: Assemblée Nationale and press reportsAVerian poll for Le Figaro magazinethis weekend found only 15% of French people trust Macron to resolve the political crisis. The president, as head of state with authority on foreign policy and national security, directly appoints a prime minister to run domestic affairs. But there is no obvious, consensual figure to replace Bayrou. Any new pick from Macron’s centre or the centre-left could face a similar ousting. The president could instead call a snap parliamentary election but this is less likely, and any vote could be inconclusive. “Nothing shows that in an election there would spontaneously be a majority of left or right which would fix the problem,” said Luc Rouban, of the Cevipof political research centre at Sciences Po university.Meanwhile, the far-right the National Rally is using the time to build support among France’s business community, which is increasingly open to it amid worries over the country’s instability. Edwige Diaz, a National Rally MP in Gironde in the west of France, had been meeting business leaders in Bordeaux and canvassing voters. She said: “Bayrou’s confidence vote is seen by our supporters as a source of hope.” The party was preparing in case of a new election, she said: “And this time, we have the firm intention of winning it, which would mean that potentially, four weeks from now we could be in power.”In his Yvelines constituency west of Paris, Benjamin Lucas, a leftwing MP for the small party, Génération.s, which is linked to the Greens, was canvassing at markets and preparing election leaflets in case a snap election was called. In last year’s parliamentary election, he beat a far-right candidate in his constituency when the left formed an alliance to block the far-right across France, but that left alliance is under strain.“This crisis, and the anger French people are feeling, is feeding the far right,” -Lucas said. “So we’re in a very risky situation … Either the left is united and it can stop the advance of the far right and also win an election, or we’re divided … and there’s a fear of France having a far-right government one day, which would shake all of Europe.” He said it was wrong to think a far-right win in France would be shortlived. “Look at [Italy’s] Giorgia Meloni, who is strongly installed in power, and [the US president] Donald Trump, who was re-elected,” he said.The root of the French political crisis goes back to Macron’s much misunderstood decision to call a snap election last June. When he was elected president in 2017 he had a large parliament majority for his pro-business, pro-Europe stance, but on re-election in 2022 he fell short of an absolute majority, limiting his ability to pass legislation. So he decided to make a sudden gamble on trying to win back the national assembly in a snap legislative election last year. But he called the vote at a very risky time when his largest opponents, Marine Le Pen’s far-right the National Rally – who he had called racist, xenophobic and dangerous to France – were at their highest ever point afterwinning European elections.View image in fullscreenMarine Le Pen, stood next to Jordan Bardella, delivers a victory speech on the night of the 2024 European election results.Photograph: Chang Martin/Sipa/Rex/ShutterstockThe campaign was divisive and the results were inconclusive: a hung parliament split between three groups. A left alliance won the most seats, but fell far short of a majority. The far-right National Rally won the most votes and became a force to be reckoned with, but did not have a majority. Macron’s centrist grouping lost seats but were still present.What resulted was came to be known as the “coalition of the losers” and has badly damaged trust in politics in France. Macron did not choose a prime minister from the left, which had the largest number of seats, or the far right, which had the largest number of votes, but instead chose Michel Barnier, from the traditional right, Les Républicains, whose party had a tiny showing. A government was formed from a mix of Macron’s diminished and unpopular centrists and the small traditional right, and continued under Bayrou. It came to symbolise power being given to those who came last. The voter turnout last year was the highest for decades, but people felt the result was ignored.The price is still being be paid for this, not just with Bayrou’s predicted fall, but with a protest movement next week known as Block Everything, which could mean roads and businesses barricaded amid street demonstrations, which will be followed by union-led hospital and rail strikes in coming weeks. The government fears a re-awakening of thegilets jaunes(yellow vest)anti-government protest movement in 2018 and the 2023demonstrationsagainst Macron’s increase to the pension age.View image in fullscreenA protester wearing a French Revolution era-themed costume during a 2023 protest against pushing pensions reform through parliament without a vote.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesSofia Tizaoui, 17, who heads the USL lycée students’ union said high schoolers would also be out blockading schools. She said young people were worried about their education and making ends meet but also democracy: “Emmanuel Macron did not respect last year’s parliament vote, and so the feeling of resentment had been growing long before the budget became an issue,” she said.Many of the protesters organising online have spoken of economic injustice. While France’s strong social security safety net had traditionally counterbalanced the gaping inequality in some of its European neighbours, research has shown poverty in France is increasing, while the growing concentration of inherited wealth has sparked comparisons to 19th-century France.Marion Carrel, sociology professor at the University of Lille, said there was a feeling in France of “the little people versus the big”, which gave a “pre-revolutionary” atmosphere to the preparations for protests, even if she felt not everyone struggling to make ends meet would take to the streets. “There’s a strong anger at not being listened to, and a feeling that politics is going nowhere,” she said.Macron has ruled out resigning – there is too much at stake on the international stage with Ukraine and the Middle East. But calls for him to go have come not just from the left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon, but also from some on the more traditional right.Politicians on all sides feel their only hope is to harness the anger. Béatrice Bellay, a Socialist MP on the island of Martinique, where there have been protests overthe high cost of living,with prices far greater than in mainland France, said: “There is something in the general atmosphere, which is not just French, but almost global: a kind of cold anger because people see an ultra-free-market capitalist system crushing people and making their life all about survival. There’s a sense of injustice and that something is wrong with the system.”",

Republicans: actually let’s protect our people from the scum of the earth.”Donald Trumphas vowed additional military action against purported traffickers, who are not military targets, after the boat strike, saying “there’s more where that came from”.The controversial attack inflamed already-high tensions between the US and Venezuela. In August Trump dispatched war ships and marines to the Caribbean, which his supporters say is in aid of efforts to oust Venezuelan’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. On Friday, reports revealed that Trump wassending10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico to support US military action against drug traffickers.Some fear the developmentspresagefull military conflict between Venezuelan and US service members. Last month, the US offereda $50m bounty for Maduro, twice what it offered for Osama bin Laden, and in July signeda secret mandateapproving military action against Latin American cartels deemed terrorist organizations, such as the Venezuelan group Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns), which Trump officials have claimed Maduro leads.Trump also framed the boat attack as military activity against “terrorists” in subsequent statements on his social media platform, Truth Social.“The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in international waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United ​States,” he said. “The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action.

Republicans in red states havesought measuresthat target same-sex marriage, while in May, Utahbecame the first stateto explicitly bar the flying of LGBTQ+ flags at government buildings and schools. More than a dozen states soon followed with similar bans.‘I would not feel safe’: Americans on the sorrow – and relief – of leaving Trump’s US for EuropeRead moreAt Rainbow Railroad, about 61% of callers from the US identify as trans, said Nugent, reflecting the administration’s constant and relentless targeting of trans individuals.Others told the organisation that they were nervously watching the attacks play out. “If you are aware of what’s happening globally, you know that this is the beginning of the worst that is to come,” she said. “In the US, trans-identified people have become the first line of attack against the entire LGBTQI+ community, and there’s this growing fear that it will not stop there.”Despite the growing fears, the current Canadian options for those who feel persecuted in the US remain slim. Those who call Rainbow Railroad are told that the most likely options for relocation are via economic pathways or via family reunification.Hope, however, has been sparked by two recent immigration cases.In July, a Canadian judgehalted plansto deport a non-binary artist from Minnesota, arguing that the decision had failed to take into account the “current conditions for LGBTQ, non-binary and transgender persons” in the US. Since then, debate has swirled over the extent to which the precedent will force immigration officials in Canada to consider the current climate for people in the US.Another case that is being closely watched is that of a 22-year-old transgender woman from Arizona. After crossing intoCanadaearlier this year, Hannah Kreager filed an asylum claim in June, on the grounds that Trump’s anti-trans policies have left her fearing persecution.Her lawyer, Yameena Ansari, described the case as potentially precedent-setting, in that it could recognise how theTrump administrationhas specifically targeted the LGBTQ+ community in the US. With these claims, “historically we’re talking about people from east Africa, west Africa, we’re talking about people from Russia or from Islamic countries, we are not talking about America,” she said. “But with each day that goes by, I feel more and more convinced that she has a legitimate claim.”The claim, which Ansari said could be heard as early as next summer, has sparked debate across the country, with many pointing to fact that refugees in Canada must demonstrate that they cannot obtain protection from their home state and that they are unable to relocate to a safe place anywhere within their own country.The last point, in particular, has left Ansari preparing to show that there is no other US state in which her client could be safe. “If she goes into a federal building, she cannot pee in the right bathroom,” she said. “If she’s locked up in a federal institution, where are they going to lock her up? Are they going to lock her up in the male institution? Are they going to provide her with gender-affirming care?”From the start, her client had understood that this route was far from guaranteed. But she had seized on it, seeing it as a singular chance to carve out a safe exit path for herself and the many others reeling from the Trump administration’s constant and relentless attacks, said Ansari. “She’s not just doing this for herself. For her, this is very much a cause.”The glimmer of hope had led to a raft of calls from others in similar situations, she added. “Already just her courage in bringing this forward has inspired a lot of people in her community,” she said. “Right now I have so many more clients coming to me. Why? Because they read about Hannah’s case and they know there’s some lawyer who sees their pain and doesn’t dismiss it. Who says this is real and I think it’s so real that the courts should recognise your fear.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasLGBTQ+ rightsTransgenderTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content",

He will then fly directly to Beijing, the UK government said.Jetco summits were paused by Boris Johnson in response to Beijing’s crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019, with Covid stalling dialogue in subsequent years.Kyle is the latest in a long line of senior cabinet ministers to visit China since Labour came to power last year, including the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,in Januaryand the new deputy prime minister,David Lammy,last October, who visited in his previous role as foreign secretary.However, because of the short notice and the decision to fly to Washington on Sunday, Kyle is expected to miss out on a visit to an international trade conference in the eastern city of Xiamen, pencilled in by Reynolds’ team.About 200 British businesses will be represented at the China International Fair for Investment and Trade (Cifit) in a delegation led by James Sassoon, a former businessman and adviser to David Cameron.A report published by the British Chamber of Commerce in China in May said that high-level dialogues such as Jetco were “much needed” forums for spurring bilateral trade and investment.“We had a period of seven or eight years with very little traction, where I think the UK government didn’t really have a clear view on how to approach the relationship with China. There was a lot of stopping and starting and obviously all the changes in leadership didn’t help,” said Beijing-based Tom Simpson, the managing director, China, at the China-Britain Business Council, which is participating in Cifit.“But since the general election last year, there’s been steady improvement in the engagement we are seeing, in the quality of engagement as well as the parts of the relationship that often don’t get picked up on … [they] are now being restored,” Simpson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Once these are completed, a chartered flight will depart to bring our citizens home,” he said.LG executive Kim Ki-soo flew toGeorgiain an apparent effort to slow the fallout. “The immediate priority now is the swift release of both our LG Energy Solution employees and those of our partner firms,” Ki-soo reportedly said before boarding a plane.LG Energy Solution said 47 of its workers had been detained, of whom 46 are South Koreans and one Indonesian. Approximately 250 of those detained are thought to be employed by LG Energy Solution’s contractor, the majority of which are South Koreans.South Korean officials said that US officials’ dissemination of images from the raid was unfortunate, given that both countries’ leaders recently met to discuss trade.Park Yoon-joo, South Korea’s first vice foreign minister, reportedly told US secretary of state for political affairs, Allison Hooker, that it was lamentable the raid unfolded “at a critical time, when the momentum of trust and cooperation between the two leaders, forged through their first summit, must be maintained”.“The economic activities of our companies that have invested in the US and the rights and interests of our citizens should not be unfairly infringed upon during the course of US law enforcement,” Park also said, according to a foreign ministry statement.Trump’s comments on the raid risked further stoking of tensions between the US and South Korea. “I would say that they were illegal aliens and Ice was just doing its job,” Trump commented when questioned about the raid.The immigration raid also appears to fly in the face of officials’ recent push for South Korean investment in the US. South Korea and the US recently brokered a trade agreement, part of which is a $250bn fund to assist South Korean companies come into American markets.Trump might also travel to South Korea in October for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, per CNN.South Korea said it would try to streamline visa access for its nationals to work in the US to “prevent a similar incident.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationSouth KoreaAsia PacificIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)GeorgianewsShareReuse this content",

In October, the party and its junior coalition partner Komeito lost their majority in the lower house and met thesame fatein upper house elections this July.Speaking to the media on Sunday evening – a day before his opponents inside the party were expected to attempt to force him out – Ishiba said he would resign to take responsibility for the election debacles, saying he wanted to avoid opening up a “decisive” split in the LDP.He announced the decision at a time of uncertainty for the world’s fourth-biggest economy as it wrestles with the impact on exports of Donald Trump’s tariffs. Last week the US president announced he would lower tariffs imposed on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, in a rare moment of guarded optimism for the embattled Ishiba.“Now that negotiations on US tariff measures have reached a conclusion, I believe this is the appropriate moment [to resign],” Ishiba told reporters. “I have decided to step aside and make way for the next generation.”Opposition to Ishiba, 68, has mounted in recent weeks, with media reporting that disaffected MPs would attempt to force him out by voting on Monday to bring forward a party presidential election not due until 2027.Ishiba had reportedly generated even more anger, particularly among those on the right of the LDP, by resisting the move, and threatening instead to call a “put up or shut up” snap election.Ishiba conceded that he could no longer lead the LDP – a position that automatically makes the holder of that office prime minister as it is the largest single party in the lower house – after talks with senior colleagues on Saturday, the Kyodo news agency reported.Now that Ishiba has vowed not to seek re-election in the party contest, attention will turn to hispotential successors, with a leadership vote among lawmakers and rank-and-file party members expected to take place in early October.Sanae Takaichi, the ultra-conservative former economic security minister, who lost to Ishiba in last October’s leadership election, is expected to make another attempt to become Japan’s first female prime minister.Some analysts believe the LDP will turn to its youthful and photogenic agriculture minister, Shinji Koizumi, who has led attempts to reducesoaring rice pricessince he was appointed in May. As the environment minister, Koizumi, the son of the former prime ministerJunichiro Koizumi, once insisted the fight against theclimate crisiscould be “sexy” and “fun”.Much will depend on how lawmakers who have led the charge against Ishiba cast their votes. They include the former prime minister Taro Aso, who remains an influential figure in the LDP, and other MPs who were close to the former prime minister Shinzo Abe, who was assassinated in July 2022.Ishiba won the LDP presidency at his fifth attempt last October, but was quickly brought back down to earth when his coalition governmentlost their majorityin the powerful lower house later the same month.Stripped of their majorities in both houses, the coalition must work with opposition parties to pass legislation or face the constant threat of no-confidence motions. Japan’s perennially splintered opposition parties have been unable to exploit the LDP’s predicament to form a grand coalition, however.Japan is confronting rising regional tensions, a cost of living crisis and growing public unease over migration that has fuelled a rise in support for the populist Sanseitō party.Ishiba’s successor will also face the task of restoring public trust in the LDP – which has governed Japan almost without interruption since the mid-1950s – after it was rocked by amajor funding scandal.A Kyodo poll released on Sunday showed the approval rating for Ishiba’s cabinet had slumped to 32.7% – down 2.7 percentage points from last month.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content",

As the security threats we all face become more complex and span continents, we are stronger and safer together,” she said.Mahmood’s biggest challenge in the role will be dealing with the issue of small boats crossing the Channel facilitated by people-smugglers, with 1,097 on her first day in office.The crossings brought the total to 30,100 people, according to Home Office figures, at earliest point in a calendar year since data on Channel crossings was first reported in 2018.The issue has caused public frustration, with successive prime ministers promising to “stop the boats” but having little success.Mahmood said on Sunday that the first returns would begin “imminently” under a deal with France in response to the latest figures.“These small boats crossings are utterly unacceptable and the vile people smugglers behind them are wreaking havoc on our borders,” she said.“Thanks to our deal with France, people crossing in small boats can now be detained and removed to France and I expect the first returns to take place imminently.“Protecting the UK border is my priority as home secretary and I will explore all options to restore order to our immigration system.”John Healey, the defence secretary, confirmed on Sunday that military sites may be used temporarily as Keir Starmer was “absolutely determined” to end the use of hotels earlier than planned.He said military planners were looking atpossible sites for accommodation on defence bases, as the prime minister wanted to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers sooner than the promised date of 2029.Healey told Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: “With the Home Office, I have been putting military planners into their border command and into their planning for the future.“We are looking at the potential use of military and non-military sites for temporary accommodation for the people who come across on these small boats that may not have a right to be here or need to be processed rapidly before we can decide whether or not they should stay or whether or not we deport them, like we have done in record numbers over the last year.”Speaking later on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Healey was pressed on whether the military could play a bigger role in patrolling the border. He did not give a clear answer but suggested that military bases and help with planning were the extent of the army’s work at the moment.Starmer has moved to toughen up his policy on the issue of small boats, as Reform UK has a double-digit poll lead and continues to attack the government on its failure to meet its pledge of “smashing the gangs”. There have also been protests outside hotels, including in Epping in Essex, where discontent erupted after the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl by a man seeking asylum.What are the priorities for the new home secretary, Shabana Mahmood?Read moreThis week, Starmer has changed direction bybringing in Mahmoodas home secretary, replacing Yvette Cooper. The government is also looking at the idea of trying to change the application of the European convention on human rights’s right to family life in order to enable more deportations of those it believes have no right to be in the UK.Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “The answer to failed asylum hotels is not failed asylum camps. The government had rightly begun to move away from using more former military camps after its own spending watchdog found they cost more to run than using hotels and were an expensive failure.“It’s time for a more pragmatic approach if the broken asylum system is going to be fixed. The solution is faster, fairer decisions and safe housing in communities, so refugees can work, study and rebuild their lives.”Reform UK said over the weekend at its conference it would stop small boat crossings of people seeking asylum within two weeks of taking office. Nigel Farage clarified on Sunday that he meant he would pass legislation within two weeks to stop judges preventing deportations of those who entered the UK by illegal means.Zia Yusuf, Reform UK’s head of policy, denied claims that asylum seekers would be housed in shipping containers, saying the party would use “purpose-built modular steel structures”.Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, Yusuf defended proposals for rapid-build detention facilities, citing international examples. “We can look around the world at where things have worked and worked well,” he said. “President Trump stood up 3,000 detention beds in eight days. That was this year in the state of Florida – using steel modular structures.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

A moratorium on logging within its boundaries begins on Monday.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe announcement was widely welcomed by forest advocates. The Wilderness Society called it a “once-in-a-generation decision” that would give the state’s koalas “a real chance of survival”.Gary Dunnett, from the National Parks Association, said the “park will ensure future generations will be able to see koalas, greater gliders and other threatened species in the wild for many years to come”.The environment minister, Penny Sharpe, said the park was “incredibly important” for the future of the species – which has been on a trajectory to become extinct in NSW by 2050. The government hoped it would become an “iconic” destination for tourists.Speakman said that while habitat protection was an important part of protecting koalas, it was not the full answer. He called the news “a significant announcement, but not as significant as what the Coalition did”.View image in fullscreenChris Minns at Bongil Bongil national park, Bundagen, Coffs Harbour, where he announced details of the government’s great koala national park.Photograph: David Wigley/AAP“We had a $193m koala strategy, which included funds for scientific research dealing with road strikes and disease,” he said.“That $193m package was better. It aimed to not just stop the decline but increase numbers,” he said. Speakman said there was a lack of detail in the announcement and it appeared contingent on getting funds from the federal government carbon credits scheme.When last in government,the issue of koala protections on private landcaused friction between NSW Liberals and Nationals and briefly split the NSW Coalition in 2021.Then NSW planning minister, Rob Stokes, eventually came up witha compromise, which exempted most rural sitesfrom the State Environmental Planning Policy (Sepp) and the Nationals continued in the Coalition.Timber harvesting within the proposed park’s boundaries will pause on Monday and affected mills – said to be six of over 20 in the region – will be offered transition packages.The Nationals hold many of the north coast seats.Saunders claimed the decision would “wipe out 40% of the state’s future hardwood supply” and force up construction costs.“This decision is almost unbelievable but sadly true to form for a government that has shown a complete disregard for this important industry and what it contributes to our state,” he said.The NSW premier, Chris Minns, told a media conference in Coffs Harbour on Sunday that 90% of the timber used in housing construction was soft woods, rather than the hardwoods that come from native forest logging.He said the reduction in wood supply that would occur as a result of ending logging within the great koala national park accounted for about 15-20% of the state’s hardwood supply but only 1.2% nationally. He said establishment of the park would depend on the government being able to win support for the legislation in the state parliament.The Minns government has so far directed $140m to the park as well as additional funding for tourism and support for workers at affected mills in the region.The opposition north coast spokesperson, Gurmesh Singh, said the timber industry had suggested a “more manageable” 37,000-hectare option for the park.Loss of koala habitat shows ‘total failure’ of nature laws, conservationists sayRead more“This decision will hurt our communities in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, ripping out valuable jobs that allow people to put food on the table,” Singh said.Timber NSW accused the government of valuing “politics above science and people”.Its chief executive, Maree McCaskill, said the decision showed disregard for the “livelihoods of people in country areas”.Support for affected timber mills and workersThe park was subject to a lengthy scientific assessment before the announcement, and the decision comes with a broad support package for workers at affected timber mills as well as financial assistance for businesses.The government is offering priority placement for affected Forestry Corporation workers if they wish to transfer into the NSW national parks and wildlife service.The government estimates the park’s value as a tourism destination will generate an extra $163m for the state’s economy over two decades. The native logging division of NSW Forestry Corporation hasrun at a loss for several years.Sharpe acknowledged there were people who wouldn’t like the decision, but it was incredibly important to preserve one of the state’s most iconic species.“This area is home to over 100 threatened species. It’s a very important conservation outcome, but it’s also a really exciting opportunity for the mid-north coast in New South Wales,” she said“We want it to be when people come to Australia, you know, they go and see the Great Barrier Reef, they go and see Uluru and they come and see the great koala national park,” she said.Sharpe said the government was planning to formally legislate the park next year but issues related to wood supply needed to be worked through with industry first as did a proposal to establish a carbon credit project within the park that is being considered by the Albanese government.The NSW Greens environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, who is based in the state’s north, said the long-awaited announcement was a victory for the communities, First Nations leaders, scientists and forest defenders who never gave up.“Now the government must keep going and protect the Richmond River koala stronghold, commit to the Great Southern Forest national park on the south coast, and end native forest logging across NSW,” she said.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesNew South Wales politicsWildlifeTrees and forestsConservationnewsShareReuse this content",

Justice Christopher Beale will deliver her sentence from 9.30am in a hearing expected to last about 30 minutes.In July, after an 11-week trial, ajury found Patterson guiltyof murdering Don and Gail Patterson, the parents of her estranged husband, Simon, and his aunt, Heather Wilkinson. The jury also convicted Patterson of attempting to murder Heather’s husband, Ian Wilkinson.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailPatterson hosted the guests at a lunch in July 2023, deliberately feeding them beef wellingtons laced with death cap mushrooms.Delivering an emotional victim impact statement in a pre-sentencing hearing last month, Wilkinson, a pastor,offered Patterson forgivenessfor trying to murder him.“Now I am no longer Erin Patterson’s victim, and she has become the victim of my kindness,” he said.But Wilkinson said he was “compelled to seek justice” for the three murder victims. He said he bore Patterson no ill will and his prayer for her was that she would use her time in custody to reform.Simon Patterson said his estranged wife’s crimes had robbed their two children, a son born in 2009 and a daughter born in 2014, of “the kind of relationship with their mother that every child yearns for”.The prosecution and defence agreed Patterson should receive a life sentence for her crimes, which Beale said were “horrendous”. Prosecutors called for no prospect of parole for Patterson, while the defence said she should be given a chance to be released.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said his client’s isolation made the “burden of imprisonment” much greater for her than other prisoners.Jane Warren, for the prosecution, agreed that Beale could consider these conditions.Beale said the fact that Patterson had spent most of her days isolated in her cell for at least 14 months since her arrest in November 2023 “doesn’t sound very humane”.While it is typically illegal for media outlets to record inside a courtroom, the court has granted permission for a television camera to film Beale handing down his sentencing remarks. The footage, which media outlets can re-broadcast, will go live with a 10-second delay.Patterson will have until 6 October to lodge an appeal against her conviction, sentence or both.She pleaded not guilty to all charges and claimed the deaths were a tragic accident.In Victoria, the maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment without parole.The standard sentence is 25 years’ imprisonment, according to aguide for judicial officersproduced by the Sentencing Advisory Council of Victoria. Standard sentences apply to a range of serious offences and must be considered as a guidepost by the court when making a sentencing decision.The last triple-murderer to be sentenced in Victoria was Robert Farquharson, who was convicted ofmurdering his childrenin 2007 and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 33 years.Explore more on these topicsErin Patterson mushroom trialCrime - AustraliaVictoriaLaw (Australia)Australian medianewsShareReuse this content",

He called the package the boldest tax reform enforced inGreecein more than 50 years.The policies build on other initiatives by the centre-right government to tackle the issue.With fertility rates in Greece among the lowest in Europe – at 1.4 children a woman, the reproduction rate is well below the replacement level of 2.1 – Mitsotakis has called the problem a “national threat”.The Greek population is on course to fall from the current 10.2 million to well under 8 million by 2050, when 36% will be above the age of 65, according to Eurostat.Acknowledging the decline had assumed existential proportions, finance minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis said fertility rates had halved since the start of the country’s economic crisis 15 years ago.“Our taxation reform will give great emphasis to this problem … as head of the economic team, I’d say our top priority is the demographic issue,” he said.Greece’s near decade-long crisis has been widely blamed for the alarming drop. This is partly because younger people were among those hardest hit by austerity measures required in return for international rescue funds that kept bankruptcy at bay and debt-stricken Athens in the EU.More than 500,000 Greeks left the country in search of work during the crisis, an exodus of mostly young and talented citizens the government is trying to reverse.The latest measures, which include dropping tax obligations for those living in rural settlements with fewer than 1,500 residents, will be funded with money from the fiscal surplus as the economy has recovered.Officials say falling fertility rates are putting the pension and health systems, as well as labour markets and national security, at unprecedented risk at a time of geopolitical uncertainty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The subsidy has since risen from €1,700 for a first child to €3,500 for a fourth in addition to a monthly stipend of up to €140 per child.But as the cost of living also soars in a country with some of the lowest wages in the EU, the policies appear to have had little effect. Greece’s education ministry announced this month that it had closed more than 700 schools nationwide citing a lack of pupils.With his government’s popularity dented by corruption claims and cost of living concerns, Mitsotakis vowed to increase pensions and affordable housing by constructing properties on abandoned military facilities.A real estate tax in remote areas will also be scrapped to encourage young people to move to the countryside, where prices are often a far cry from those in cities. Unaffordable housing is such that younger Greeks frequently complain they are forced to live with their parents into their 30s – another reason raised for the lack of interest in having children.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropeKyriakos MitsotakisTax and spendingPopulationnewsShareReuse this content",

He later said he was counting on a “strong response” from the US.The US president, Donald Trump, who met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for a summit in Alaska last month, said without elaboration in response to questioning on Sunday that he was ready to move to a second stage of sanctions against Russia over the conflict. Trump has threatened to penalise countries that buy Russia’s oil, but has so far only hit India with so-called secondary sanctions and stepped back from previous warnings of tougher financial action against Moscow.The Ukrainian air force said 805 combat drones were deployed by Moscow, as well as nine Iskander-K cruise missiles and four Iskander-M ballistic missiles. Of these, four cruise missiles and 747 drones were intercepted by Ukrainian forces, authorities said.Smoke was seen billowing from the roof of the Kyiv building that houses the offices of Ukraine’s cabinet ministers, as firefighters fought flames pouring out of an upper storey,although it was not immediately clear whether the fire was the result of debris or a direct hit, which would mark an escalation in Russia’s air campaign. Government buildings in the city centre have previously not been targeted by Russia.Map showing location of Ukrainian cabinet building in Kyiv“For the first time, the government building was damaged by an enemy attack, including the roof and upper floors,” said Ukraine’s prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko. “We will restore the buildings, but lost lives cannot be returned.”‘It is a war of drones now’: the ever-evolving tech dominating the frontline in UkraineRead moreShe urged the world to react to the destruction and said the pressure of sanctions must be increased, especially against Russian oil and gas.Zelenskyy said he had spoken to his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, after the strike. “We coordinated our diplomatic efforts, next steps, and contacts with partners to ensure an appropriate response,” Zelenskyy said on the Telegram app.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, condemned Russia’s onslaught. He called the attacks “cowardly” and said they proved that Putin was “not serious about peace”.The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said before Trump’s comments on sanctions that Washington was prepared to “increase pressure” on Russia, but thatEuropemust also act. “If the US and the EU can come in to more sanctions, secondary tariffs on the countries that buy Russian oil, the Russian economy will be in full collapse,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press.View image in fullscreenResidents move towards a shelter amid Russia’s attack in Kyiv.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersSunday’s attack was the largest Russian drone strike since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with nine missile hits and 56 drone strikes in 37 locations across Ukraine. Debris from shot-down drones and missiles fell on eight locations.Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said early on Sunday the drone attacks had killed an infant and a young woman, while a pregnant woman was among the five injured who were admitted to hospital.Later in the day, it emerged that the mother and her baby had been killed after they were thrown on to the street by a pressure wave caused by a drone explosion in Kyiv, according to the Kyiv Independent.Klitschko said an elderly woman had died in a bomb shelter in the Darnytskyi district to the east of the Dnipro River.Locals were left stunned by the attacks, emerging from their homes on to the streets in the early hours of Sunday to watch as firefighters fought the blazes and searched buildings for victims with thermal cameras. They reported a large amount of falling debris from damaged buildings, including glass and window blinds.In the western district of Sviatoshynskyi, several floors of a nine-storey residential building were partly destroyed, Klitschko and emergency officials said.Falling drone debris set off fires in a 16-storey apartment building and two other buildings, the mayor added.View image in fullscreenEmergency workers extinguish a fire in an apartment building on Sunday after Russia’s attack on Kyiv.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersSmoke billowed out of apartment buildings, some with floors partly collapsed and facades crumbled, in social media photographs posted by emergency officials.Russia was “deliberately and consciously striking civilian targets”, the head of the capital’s military administration, Timur Tkachenko, said on Telegram.Dozens of explosions also shook Ukraine’s central city of Kremenchuk, cutting power to some areas, its mayor, Vitalii Maletskyi, said on Telegram. Russian strikes on Kryvyi Rih in the same region targeted transport and urban infrastructure, Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the military administration, said on Telegram, but with no injuries reported.In the southern city of Odesa, civilian infrastructure and residential buildings were damaged, with fires breaking out in several apartment blocks, the regional governor, Oleh Kiper, said on Telegram.One person was killed in an attack on the north-eastern region of Sumy, according to local authorities. An attack on Saturday on the outskirts of the village of Putyvl also resulted in injuries including of a nine-year-old child, the region’s military governor, Oleh Hryhorov, said on Telegram.In Zaporizhzhia in south-eastern Ukraine, at least 15 people were injured in a drone strike, some of whom had to be hospitalised, said Ivan Fedorov, the head of the region’s military administration. He published photos of residential buildings that had been destroyed.According to Russian sources, a Ukrainian drone strike led to a fire at the Ilsky oil refinery in the Krasnodar region, in the south, which was quickly extinguished, according to a regional administrator. The reports could not be independently verified.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content",

He was canonised byPope Leo XIValongside Pier Giorgio Frassati, another young Catholic activist, who died a century ago.A hour before the mass, St Peter’s Square had filled with tens of thousands of pilgrims from around the world, many of them millennial Italians and Americans, as Acutis’s family looked on.A crowd numbering an estimated 80,000 braved sweltering heat, and many were forced to spill out into the boulevards next to the square, with witnesses describing the atmosphere as joyous and party-like.“The greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God’s plan,” Leo said in his homily, saying Acutis and Frassati had made “masterpieces” of their lives by dedicating them to God. The new saints “are an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards”, he said.Both ceremonies had been scheduled for earlier this year, but were postponed after the death of Pope Francis, who had fervently pushed Acutis’s sainthood case forward to attract young Catholics to the faith.Tapestries depicting images of Saints Pier Giorgio and Carlo were hung on the facade of St Peter’s Basilica as the two men were celebrated like pop stars. Devotion to Acutis, in particular, extended to a wide range of merchandise on sale bearing his image, including action figures, T-shirts, mobile phone stickers and handheld fans. Leo, dressed in golden vestments, said before the Mass: “I’m happy to see so many young people.”Over the past year, more than 1 million people have flocked to the central Italian town of Assisi, where Acutis’s body – covered in a wax mould of his likeness and dressed in his blue tracksuit top, jeans and trainers – is on view behind a glass-panelled case in Santa Maria Maggiore church. His heart is in a gold casket in the town’s San Rufino Cathedral, while pieces of tissue from his pericardium – the membrane enclosing the heart – have toured the world in the lead-up to his canonisation. A bronze lifesize statue of him is also on display in the town.View image in fullscreenThe body of Carlo Acutis in Santa Maria Maggiore church in Assisi.Photograph: Gianluigi Basilietti/EPAHis mother, Antonia Salzano, has also travelled across the globe, delivering speeches to Catholic communities about her son’s life, bringing strands of her son’s hair as gifts.She was present at the canonisation Mass with her family, including Carlo’s two teenage siblings who were born after his death. His brother Michele did a reading.Salzano told the Guardian the family was not particularly religious, but her son showed a deep devotion to the Catholic faith from a young age. “He would go to mass and do the rosary each day,” she said, adding that he was a child who “could not be indifferent to sorrow”. “We lived in the centre of Milan in a building surrounded by beggars. He wanted to help them, speak to them, bring them food and blankets.”She added that Acutis was otherwise an average child, hanging out with friends or playing sports. “Carlo was an internet geek, but he had the temperance to use technology for good, and was not exploited by it,” she said.Acutis was born on 3 May 1991 in London to a wealthy but not particularly observant Catholic family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born.Acutis was particularly interested in computer science and devoured college-level books on programming even as a youngster. A skilful coder, his whiz-kid reputation started to grow when he created websites for Catholic organisations, includingone that listed miracles, earning him the moniker “cyber apostle”. He also enjoyed playing on his PlayStation, although limited its use to an hour a week – a discipline that has proved appealing to a Catholic hierarchy that has often warned about the dangers of a technology-steered world.In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukaemia. Within days, he was dead. He was entombed in Assisi, known for its association with another popular saint, St Francis.The movement that had built up around Acutis was evident from the day he died, as seriously ill people began praying to him for cures. His funeral was attended by a host of people he had helped, among them immigrants and bullied children.His mother claims it was around the time of his funeral that he started to work miracles, and last year Francis credited Acutis with two.The first involved the recovery of a boy in Brazil from a rare congenital disease affecting his pancreas; the second was the healing of a student in Florence with bleeding on the brain from a head trauma, and whose mother had prayed at Acutis’s tomb in Assisi.The speed at which Acutis has been canonised, especially compared with Frassati, shows how keen the church is to attract more young people.Canonisation usually follows a long and detailed process, involving a meticulous investigation by theVaticanand outside specialists who determine the veracity of miracles attributed to the individual. Acutis’s beatification, the stage before canonisation, was carried out by Pope Francis in 2020.Explore more on these topicsCatholicismVaticanReligionItalyChristianityEuropePope Leo XIVnewsShareReuse this content",

Two of the kittens had eye infections and one was blind. The couple later named them Benny, Bjorn, Agnetha and Frida.Mulcahy-Stephenson, 34, and her husband, Adam, 39, contacted a local rescuer who said she could take the kittens in temporarily, but they would have to find homes for them.“It was a life or death decision,” said Mulcahy-Stephenson. “No doubt at least the blind one and probably one of the other ones would be dead by now. So we were a bit like, OK, well, it’s a no-brainer.”After having the cats treated by a vet and vaccinated, they arranged for them to be flown to Paris, where they would then drive down from their home in Barrowford inLancashireto collect them from Calais.The cats were flown with Aegean airlines; only two cats were allowed in the cabin and three of the kittens were placed in a crate in the hold.Mulcahy-Stephenson said: “When we arrived at the Eurotunnel shuttle terminal, we got a text from Lida, our rescuer in Greece, saying: ‘Bethany, the airline has lost three of the kittens,’ and it was absolute panic.“I immediately went into complete shock panic, just absolute bedlam,” she said. “We didn’t know what was going on. We didn’t even know where they were, if they [had] left Greece, if they were in France or if they had been left on the tarmac.”Eventually, they were told the kittens had been located, having been flown from Thessaloniki to Paris, but had not been unloaded in France.Mulcahy-Stephenson said: “They were somehow forgotten in the hold, or not seen. They didn’t come off the plane at all, and the plane got sent straight back to Thessaloniki, which is another three-hour flight.”When the kittens did not arrive in France, the couple immediately feared the worst. “I thought they were going to be dead, never found again, to be honest,” said Mulcahy-Stephenson. “I thought even if they weren’t lost, the shock of being in the noisy hold, [where] it’s cold, they’ve had no food, water … There was a lot of stuff going through my mind, but I didn’t think we were going to see them again.”After initially telling the couple, via their rescuer who spoke Greek and acted as a go-between, it was a two-day wait for another plane back to Paris, the airline agreed to send the cats back via Athens, in the cabin, with a dedicated handler.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was so relieved to see them and have them in the car, safe.”She added: “When they arrived, they were absolutely traumatised, they wouldn’t eat, we had them in the emergency vet.”The couple said they had still not had a proper explanation as to why the cats had been left behind in the hold, or an apology from Aegean.Adam Mulcahy-Stephenson said: “We’d like the airline to acknowledge what the problem is here, and in an ideal world we’d love to force some kind of change … to not have animals in the hold.”Aegean airlines said: “With regard to the three kittens you mentioned, we would like to clarify that they were never lost at any time. Upon the arrival of the flight in Paris, they were not immediately disembarked due to operational reasons. As soon as this was identified, a coordinated response was promptly activated among all involved stations and our customer service department, in order to safeguard their care and security until their reunion with their guardians.“The kittens continued their journey the same day under the direct care of the Aegean crew, which provided them with food and water during the flight, ensuring constant supervision. The same evening, they were safely reunited with their guardians in Paris.”Explore more on these topicsCatsPetsAnimalsAir transportLancashireGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content",

If you’re a PMC and you don’t have a drone or possibly an electronic warfare capability, you are antiquated.”The days of “former gunslingers” as private military contractors “are over”, he said, referring to when Blackwater was at its height during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Back then, millions of dollars in contracts were doled out to Prince for the hiring of his cadres of former infantrymen and commandos as guards and operators for the CIA, state department and Pentagon. But a 2007 massacre in Baghdad at the hands of some of his contractors led to prison sentences,congressional inquiriesand blacklistings of the firm.Prince’s interest in Ukraine comes after he served as an adviser fora controversial drone assassination program in Haitithis year and also reportedlysending hundreds of fightersto the embattled country – home towestern mining interest– under the banner of his new venture,Vectus Global.Similarly, making what would be an unsuccessful sales pitch in another vulnerable country with natural resources wealth in 2018, Prince proposed financing a mercenary force to take over the war in Afghanistan by using local mining projects.“He’s doing it in Haiti, so why not?” said Morgan Lerrette, a formerBlackwater contractor in Iraqwho later went on to become an author andcriticof the wider private military contracting industry. “From a strategic look, [Prince] is going places where there are minerals and the US wants to create jointsovereign wealth funds.“Ukraine fits that,” said Lerette.Indeed, Prince has long seen Ukraine, which recently signed a rare-earth minerals deal with the Trump administration, as a potential cash cow: In 2020he pitched a multibillion-dollar planto Zelenskyy, then then newly elected president, to help settle what was a frozen war in the eastern Donbas region, using his private army.

He backed, like, outgoing corrupt [leaders], so he burned his first pitch,” said an executive at a multinational drone company, about Prince’s first foray into Ukraine after the election of Zelenskyy. “Prince has a bad reputation generally in the industry. No clean person will hire him.”The same person said Prince’s work founding aChinese mercenary company,which hired ex-members of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, soiled his reputation and made him an intelligence liability that is “universally untouchable by most people”.A separate cache of business documents and proposals shared with the Guardian shows how the Pentagon and its special forces sections are interested in partnerships with US drone manufacturers that have a presence in Ukraine, all with the aim of understanding how the next major conflict will be fought and what their soldiers will need.In a splashy announcement in July on the grounds of the Pentagon, the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, announced he was “Unleashing US Military Drone Dominance” in a memorandum calling for the mass production and adoption of all unmanned aerial vehicle platforms.“Drones are the biggest battlefield innovation in a generation, accounting for most of this year’s casualties in Ukraine,” he said. “Emergent technologies require new funding lines.”Hegseth made clear the Pentagon would need corporate partners for the accelerated program and, so far, there is no shortage of takers. All future and current wars, with the nearly four-year full-scale invasion of Ukraine being no exception, attracts business interests and its requisite leaders.The former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt openly touted that the war in Ukraine hadturned him into an arms dealer, founding his ventureWhite Stork, which isproducing drones. Gen David Petraeus, the former director of the CIA and a chief warfighter for the Pentagon in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, hasan eye on Ukraineand hasadvisedthe burgeoning Americandrone and security contractorVector.Prince, through Vectus Global and his encrypted cellphone company, Unplugged, did not reply to multiple requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsUkraineTrump administrationUS militaryUS politicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content",

Thousands have also been released without charge, often after months of detention.Rights groups have documented widespread abuse in prisons and detention facilities, including insufficient food and health care, as well as poor sanitary conditions and beatings. In March, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy died at an Israeli prison and doctors said starvation was likely the main cause of death.The ruling came in response to a petition brought last year by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) and the Israeli rights group Gisha. The groups alleged that a change in the food policy enacted after the war in Gaza began has caused prisoners to suffer malnutrition and starvation.Last year, the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the prison system, boasted that he had reduced the conditions of security prisoners to what he described as the bare minimum required by Israeli law.In Sunday’s ruling, the panel of three justices ruled unanimously that the state is legally obliged to provide prisoners with enough food to ensure “a basic level of existence”.In the 2-1 ruling, the justices said they found “indications that the current food supply to prisoners does not sufficiently guarantee compliance with the legal standard”. They said they had found “real doubts” that prisoners were eating properly, and ordered the prison service to “take steps to ensure the supply of food that allows for basic subsistence conditions in accordance with the law”.Ben-Gvir, who leads a small far-right ultranationalist party, lashed out at the ruling, saying that while Israeli hostages in Gaza have no one to help them, Israel’s supreme court “to our disgrace” is defending Hamas militants. He said the policy of providing prisoners with “the most minimal conditions stipulated by the law” would continue unchanged.ACRI called for the verdict to be implemented immediately. In a post on X, it said the prison service has “turned Israeli prisons into torture camps”.“A state does not starve people,” it said. “People do not starve people – no matter what they have done.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content",

If the government does not respond it could lead to judicial review proceedings at the high court in London.Al-Masri, a Nablus-born businessman, who was a close friend of the late Palestinian political leaderYasser Arafat, said: “The current crisis in Palestine was ‘made in Britain’ through a catalogue of neglect and abuse of the Palestinian people. Together we have suffered more than a century of oppression.“Britain can only play its part in building a just peace in the region today if it acknowledges its defining role in the horrors of the past. An apology would be a just start to what Palestinians expect from the British government.”His written statement, accompanying the petition, recalls British troops rounding up large numbers of men, escorting them through towns with their hands and feet bound with rope, and later holding them in cages prior to execution.There is precedent for the UK government making concessions of the kind the petition calls for. On 31 March,it apologised for the Batang Kali massacrein colonial Malaya in December 1948, which was the latest of five such apologies.Why is UK preparing to recognise Palestinian statehood?Read moreThe petition, which has been years in the making, says that Britain unlawfully failed to recognise an Arab nation in Palestine even though it had pledged to do so in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence, a contested series of letters exchanged during the first world war.Britain is said to have unlawfully repressed the population of Palestine, particularly during the suppression of the Arab revolt from 1936 to 1939, by adopting a form of statutory martial law that subjected Palestinians to a pattern of murder, torture, persecution, arbitrary detention and other inhumane acts, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.Britain is also said to bear responsibility for the destruction of the single unitary territory of Palestine and for failing to protect and promote the rights of the indigenous Palestinian Arab people in its withdrawal. The petition is not concerned with contesting the post-1948 recognition ofIsraelin international law.Ben Emmerson, a former UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism and one of two KCs – the other being Danny Friedman – working on the case, said: “This petition demonstrates, by reference to a comprehensive analysis of contemporary evidence, the extent of British responsibility for the terrible suffering in Palestine, which can be traced back to Britain’s violations of international law during its occupation and subsequent withdrawal.“These historic injustices continue to shape the realities on the ground today. Britain owes a debt to the Palestinian people. Today’s petition is based upon the international obligations of the United Kingdom to make amends.”All 14 of the petitioners have been affected by Britain’s alleged violations and the dispersal of Palestinians, and several lived through them.As a 14-year-old, Saeed Husain Ahmad Haj witnessed Israeli paramilitary Haganah forces entering his village of Tireh Dandan in what is now the district of Lod in July 1948.The incursion was part of Operation Dani, which led to his family’s expulsion to the Balata refugee camp in Nablus where Haj still lives.The action seeks accountability based on the standards of international law that applied at the time of the British occupation and the Balfour declaration, in which the British government pledged to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBritish armyHuman rightsIsraelnewsShareReuse this content",

However, conflicting signals are emerging from within Iran.Araghchi said he had made progress in recent talks with the UN weapons inspectors on their terms for their return toIran’s bombed nuclear sites, one of the preconditions set by Europe before it would defer the snapback.But the conservative-dominated Iranian parliament is still discussing a bill that would require Iran to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if UN sanctions were restored, a move that would free Iran from all requirements to allow UN weapons inspectors into Iran and so shut off all independent access to its nuclear sites.Araghchi’s Guardian article is a reproach to the traditional European powers on Iran – France, Germany and the UK – challenging them to explain why it is in their self-interest to have shifted away from being mediators for an multilateral agreement between Iran and the US, and instead “become a facilitator of America’s excesses”. Araghchi met with the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, in Doha last Thursday.He claims European leaders have made a huge mistake if they think that by being tough with Iran, the US president, Donald Trump, will stop viewing them as secondary actors and give them a place on the world stage.The return of UN sanctions “will only exclude the three countries from future diplomatic processes, with widespread negative consequences for the whole of Europe in terms of its credibility and global standing,” he wrote.“President Trump has made it clear that he views the three European countries as secondary players, and this is evident in the exclusion of Europe from issues that are vital to its future, including the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Washington’s message is clear: to gain a foothold, the three countries must demonstrate unwavering loyalty.”He also claims that if Israel tries to relaunch the12-day war on Iranit fought in June, it will have to run back to the US for help, a reference to Israel’s dependence on US military hardware.“Israel may present itself as capable of fighting on behalf of the west, but as we saw in June, the truth is that Iran’s powerful armed forces are once again ready and capable of defeating Israel to the point where it will be forced to turn to ‘Grandpa’ for salvation.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaNuclear weaponsUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content",

We are seeing what they’re doing to Palestinians.“But the question should be, why should we fear for our life while we are carrying nothing but humanitarian aid to a population that is being starved, a manmade starvation supported by so many governments and states around the world?”1:04Greta Thunberg: aid flotilla 'even stronger' as dozens of boats to head for Gaza – videoThunberg agreed there was a possibility they might be killed, saying Israel had been empowered to act illegally by the lack of repercussions from the international community.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But again, we have seen that Israel sees themselves as an exemption from international law, and the world to a large extent allows them to act however they want without any major consequences.”Thiago Ávila, a Brazilian activist who was also onboard the Madleen and is part of the current flotilla, said the missions were not getting safer but that the eyes of the international community were what was keeping them from being killed. “The reason why we ask people to share the mission [on social media], it’s because this brings us visibility, not because Israel does not want to kill us – because they want to do with us the same thing that they do to Palestinians – but because they cannot afford to pay the political cost of that,” he said.“We right now see that the world is paying attention to this mission because we know the sense of urgency that they are facing in Gaza, but also the world is sick of seeing children being starved to death, sick of seeing hospitals being bombed, shelters being bombed, schools being bombed, homes being bombed.”Thunberg, who in 2019 became the youngest Time Person of the Year and has been nominated five times for the Nobel Peace prize for her climate activism, said: “I think it’s been very clear in the words and actions of people all over the world that there is worldwide support for this [movement].View image in fullscreenThe UN warned last month that Palestinians were facing ‘starvation, pure and simple’.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/AP“We know that the world does not stand with war criminals. And we know that by every day when we see more footage coming out of Gaza, we see the incredibly brave journalists who are risking their lives to report the atrocities happening. People are waking up.”Numerous accusations of war crimes have been made against Israel, such as the starvation and wilful killing of civilians, including aid workers and medics. In addition, at least 248 journalists have been killed in Gaza in the last 22 months.Thunberg said some people had not known what was happening in Gaza previously but that “we no longer have the privilege to say that we weren’t aware because we are seeing this coming out of Gaza every single day of children being starved, parents looking for missed body parts of their children under the rubble”.“Anyone who has any sense of humanity and common sense can see that there is absolutely, absolutely no justification for any of this, no matter what absurdly fabricated arguments Israel is using,” she said.“But as they are escalating the genocide, we are also escalating the resistance. We are not able to just sit and watch a livestream genocide take place.”Israel does not accept accusations of genocide and says its deadly actions against civilians in Gaza are an attempt to destroy Hamas and rescue Israeli hostages.Explore more on these topicsGazaGreta ThunbergMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content",

Because every little helps.”Campaigning groups the New Weather Institute, Badvertising and Adfree Cities, which havesuccessfully pursuednumerous bans on ads by asking the ASA to investigate, have lodged a complaint claiming that the watchdog’s own marketing is misleading and inaccurate.The ASA’s campaign, which has run in different iterations over the past few years and was most recently renewed in July, features claims that it regulates ads “across all media” and “wherever you see or hear them”.However, the campaigning groups argue this is inaccurate and misleading as the ASA’s remit does not cover the regulation of ads in some media where mass audiences can see them.The complaint says exceptions include ads in shop windows and at point of sale, parts of airports, flyposters, on pitch-side hoardings of sports events on TV and some social media content.Andrew Simms, a co-director of the NWI thinktank and a co-founder of the campaign group Badvertising, said: “The ASA wants us to think they will protect the public from all toxic adverts, but they are in fact powerless to prevent multiple ads that misinform from going on show every day in the UK.“It matters all the more that the body responsible for maintaining standards in advertising lives up to them itself. If a regulator publishes its own misleading ads you have a problem.”The ASA was set up in 1962 as an independent bodyto self-regulate the UK advertising codeand is funded through a levy collected from ad agencies based on media spend.Last year the ASA secured theamendment or withdrawal of 33,309 ads. Overall, it received 37,284 complaints about 24,015 ads and has introduced artificial intelligence monitoring that led to the ASA processing 28m ads.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAn ASA spokesperson said: “As the independent frontline regulator of UK ads, our ad campaign is clear that we regulate ads in ‘all media’ as opposed to ‘all ads’. As with any other regulator, there is a start and end point to our remit. For obvious reasons, it would not be appropriate for the ASA to investigate complaints about its own ad.”While the ASA is independent of the ad industry, the ASA Council – which makes decisions on whether an ad has broken the UK rules – is not, as it effectively acts as the regulator’s board. There is no body or organisation to investigate the ASA’s own ads.Media owners have the option of declining the use of their ad space for ASA campaigns if they feel the content or claims breach the advertising code. The ASA also theoretically has the option of pulling its own campaign, which has been put together using experts at its disposal in the UK advertising code.The ASA has received complaints about the various ad campaigns it has run in the past. The groups that have lodged the latest complaint are campaigners for total category and sector bans in areas including the climate crisis, gambling, alcohol and junk food and would prefer the ASA to be replaced with a statutory regulator.Robbie Gillett, a co-director at Adfree Cities, said: “We urge the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to review the ASA’s limited remit and consult with a broader range of groups about how the marketing industries should be properly regulated.”Explore more on these topicsAdvertising Standards AuthorityAdvertisingRegulatorsThinktanksnewsShareReuse this content",

The pandemic pushed buyers into leafier, more lifestyle-driven locations, but today’s movers are more pragmatic,” Beveridge said.As growth in prices in the capital has slowed, or even gone into reverse in some areas, someone leaving inner London can afford a 32% smaller home than in 2016, Hamptons found, losing them on average the equivalent of 553 sq feet or two double bedrooms.Prices have risen 26% outside the capital over the last five years, triple the 8% pace recorded in London.Separate data published on Monday by the estate agents Knight Frank showed that average house prices in prime central London – which stretches from Chelsea to Camden and Notting Hill to Westminster – fell 3.2% in the year to August. Prices in prime outer London – defined as Barnes, Battersea, Canary Wharf, Chiswick, Clapham, Fulham, Hampstead, Richmond, Riverside, Wandsworth, Clapham, Wapping and Wimbledon – were up 0.5% on average but the number of transactions across London as a whole was down 6%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said on Sunday it “would be really, really foolish for the government to row back on key manifesto commitments that are popular with the public and will show what a positive difference aLabourgovernment can make”.Downing Street and Labour sources insisted the legislation would proceed despite pressure from businesses to water down some of the protections against unfair dismissal. One senior government source said: “This reshuffle is about boosting growth, productivity and making people better off. Higher pay and stronger rights for working people is a key part of the government’s programme.”Nevertheless, there was still a high degree of nervousness among unions, with Peter Kyle, the new business secretary, phoning general secretaries this weekend to reassure them that the bill would go ahead.Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, urged the prime minister to commit to implementing the legislation “in full”; while the Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “If they don’t become a workers’ government, the workers will seek other answers. The stark warnings are already there.”It is understood Starmer’s first meeting of his reshuffled cabinet on Tuesday will focus solely on growing the economy.No 10 is braced for a deputy leadership contest in which candidates publicly criticise Starmer’s first year in government, and during which Nigel Farage’s Reform party has risen in the polls.They have attempted to head off the criticism with a decisive reshuffle of ministers and change of senior aides in No 10, acknowledging that they want to speed up the pace of policies.However, there is already deep anxiety among Labour MPs about the direction of the reshuffle, which promoted a number of ministers seen as being favoured by the right of the party, includingShabana Mahmood, Pat McFadden, and Peter Kyle.One senior Labour source said the reshuffle was an example of “groupthink”, adding that whether “they win or lose in May, it’s all on them as there’s no one now who isn’t signed up to this way of working. It’s clear from this reshuffle they aren’t interested in listening.“This is going to reinforce rather than solve their problems - the deputy contest then takes on the form of an intervention and not just filling a vacancy.”Thornberry told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “Domestically, things just don’t seem to be working … People hear about the mistakes.

And the last thing we want is to go from a position where it was thought we would be in for two terms, to hand our country over to Farage.”Speaking to the Guardian, Burnham issued a similar message on the need for greater listening across the party. “Labour’s got to be less factional and more inclusive, more pluralistic. If he’s going to rise to the challenge ahead of us, all parts of the Labour family need to be involved and engaged in adding what they can. And certainly the Labour governments I was in worked more like that.”The Guardian can also reveal that Burnham is backing a new political network on called Mainstream, which is drawn largely from the soft left and aims to influence the direction of the party.Steered by the thinktank Compass, it is planning to mobilise a grassroots motion at party conference demanding the abolition of the two-child benefit cap, as well as aiming to campaign in constituency Labour parties and across the country for what they describe as bold but practical reforms.Burnham said he was concerned about the balance of the cabinet after the reshuffle and the deputy leadership contest was a moment to try to shift the party away from being London-centric. One of his preferred candidates, Haigh, who resigned last year over a scandal about a conviction for fraud over a missing mobile phone, is understood not to have made up her mind whether to run.However, there is likely to be a huge array of candidates battling for nominations as soon as the terms of the contest are decided by the national executive committee on Monday.These could include David Lammy, Lisa Nandy and Shabana Mahmood in the cabinet; Haigh, Powell, Jess Phillips, Stella Creasy, Thornberry, Sarah Owen, Anneliese Dodds, Dawn Butler and Meg Hillier on the backbenches; plus Richard Burgon, Nadia Whittome and others more on the left of the party.MPs and their supporters are already frantically sounding out colleagues to see if their bids are viable. One MP tipped Phillips as gaining support, saying she was “an ideal successor to Angela [Rayner]. Brave, strong, principled, clear values, great communicator, sounds like a normal person.”The party’s ruling national executive committee is scheduled to meet on Monday to outline a timetable for the deputy leadership election. Burgon, a former shadow cabinet minister under Jeremy Corbyn, called on the committee “not to skew the process to deliver the outcome the current leadership wants but ensure this is a fully democratic process”. Butler also urged the party not to “shy away from a fair process when selecting our next deputy leader”.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourAndy BurnhamAngela RaynerGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content",

That is right anyway, but it’s really right for the times we’re in now.“We’ve got to get beyond this culture where everything’s a threat. If people are speaking out, it can actually be an opportunity to make changes.“Labour’s always been factional but it’s become more so in recent times than I can remember in almost 40 years in the party. You don’t win through a factional approach. You win through a broader approach.”Its founders say it is designed to be the “home for Labour’s radical realists”, promising to provide a space for members to discuss vision, policy and electoral strategy. They also aim to campaign in constituency Labour parties (CLPs) and across the country for what they describe as bold but practical reforms.At the same time its Labour members are preparing to put a child poverty motion on the conference floor calling on the prime minister to scrap the two-child benefit limit, a policy blamed for pushing hundreds of thousands of children into poverty.The conference motion, backed by Momentum, Open Labour and Compass, floats raising £6bn through levies on banks and the online gambling industry to pay for its abolition, an idea that has been supported by the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown.Compass’s decision to re-engage within Labour follows polling that has showed broad support for members who back wealth taxes, democratic reform and stronger action against child poverty.View image in fullscreenAndy Burnham has thrown his weight behind former cabinet minister Louise Haigh for the Labour deputy leadership.Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/ShutterstockMainstream’s supporters believe the Labour government is struggling to communicate the coherent vision, policy and strategy needed to change the country. They acknowledge the huge electoral threat from the populist right in Reform UK and believe Starmer and his top team “seem lost and unprepared to develop and champion a popular left alternative”.The network vows to become openly campaigning, unlike other networks such as the Labour-aligned Fabian thinktank, seeking to get the support of members who feel the government has been too cautious.With Angela Rayner forced to resign after being found in breach of the ministerial code, Labour faces a deputy leadership contest. Burnham said it should not be “a running commentary on the government” but a debate about “the running of the party”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farage is on their tail’Read moreBurnham has long been viewed as a possible successor to Starmer. Asked if Mainstream could become a vehicle for him to return to Westminster, he replied: “It’s about culture rather than people … it’s bigger than any one personality.”Pressed again, he said: “I’m really happy where I am. I think what we’ve done through devolution is connect people with politics in a different way. This is intended to help the government … it’s tough being in government and Mainstream is here to help them.”Organisers say its not a faction or a caucus, but a broad church of the party’s progressive left, stretching from the soft left through to non-aligned activists who would class themselves as centrists.Labour figures say it would not be surprising for an organisation set up in this way to seek to propose its own candidate for the party’s upcoming deputy leadership contest, and even shape the ground for a future leadership contest.While Starmer’s reshuffle indicated his plans to tighten his grip on his ministerial team with a focus on tackling immigration and taking on the fight to Reform UK, his party management will be tested at conference.Mainstream organisers believe supporters are looking for a bolder offer from the government, to also avoid being outflanked by the Greens led by their new eco-populist leader Zack Polanski or theCorbyn-Sultana alliance.Neal Lawson, chair of Compass, said: “At this moment of peril for the party, Mainstream launches as a historic alliance in Labour. Never before have the centre, soft left and hard left come together to save its heart and soul.”Explore more on these topicsLabourAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerLouise HaighLucy PowellnewsShareReuse this content",

He was 92.Burton died in San Francisco of natural causes, his family said in a statement.Tributes poured in from California’s top politicians, who recalled Burton as a fierce and tireless advocate for laborers, foster children and the environment. Over the years, Burton mentored Pelosi, former US senator Barbara Boxer, current US senator Alex Padilla and countless otherCaliforniaofficials.“There was no greater champion for the poor, the bullied, the disabled, and forgotten Californians than John Burton. He was a towering figure – a legendary force whose decades of service shaped our state and our politics for the better,” said Governor Gavin Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco, in a statement.Another former San Francisco mayor, Willie Brown, said that death had managed to separate him from a dear friend who was by his side for decades – as college students where they first met, as fellow newbies in the state Assembly and as influential members of California’s Democratic political machine.“John Burton may have been the best person with whom I served as a member of the legislature,” said Brown.Burton believed that government was at its best when it served those who needed it the most, and he never backed down from a fight, said state Democratic party chair Rusty Hicks.“The greatest way to honor John Burton is to keep fighting with the same grit, tenacity, and heart that defined his life,” Hicks said in a statement.“He cared a lot,” said Burton’s daughter, Kimiko Burton. “He always instilled in me that we fight for the underdog. There are literally millions of people whose lives he helped over the years who have no idea who he is.”John Lowell Burton was born on 15 December 1932, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in San Francisco with plans to teach history and coach high school basketball.But he followed his older brother, Phillip Burton, into politics and in 1964 was elected to the state assembly. A decade later, he moved on to the US House of Representatives, where he pushed legislation protecting wilderness areas in the Golden Gate national recreation area and condemning apartheid in South Africa.Burton stepped down in 1982 to address a cocaine addiction, but he didn’t stay gone for long.In 1988, he returned to the California assembly and in 1996 he won a state Senate seat, rising to become the chamber’s president. He retired from elected politics in 2004 – only to head up the California Democratic party from 2009 to 2017.After retiring, he founded a nonprofit dedicated to foster youth. A remembrance posted Sunday by John Burton Advocates for Youth quoted his exasperation with the lack of resources available for foster youth who aged out of the foster care system.“Emancipated from what? And into what?” he asked. “Into not being able to have a roof over their heads? Into being frozen out of a chance at higher education? Into unemployment? Into a life on the welfare rolls? Into homelessness? Into jail?”The organization has advocated successfully for more than 50 legislative reforms, including financial aid for college and extending foster care for some from age 18 to 21.Barbara Lee, a former US congresswoman and current Oakland mayor, said that in spite of his health challenges, Burton was determined to attend her public inauguration in June, and he did.“His life’s work reminds us that authentic leadership means having the courage to speak truth to power and never forgetting where you came from,” she said.In addition to his daughter, Kimiko, Burton is survived by two grandchildren, Juan and Mikala.Plans for a celebration of life are pending. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made in his memory to the John Burton Advocates for Youth.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsWest CoastCaliforniaSan FrancisconewsShareReuse this content",

Despite that evidence, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, has expressed deepskepticism about vaccines.Florida’s plan would lift mandates on school vaccines for hepatitis B, chickenpox, Hib influenza and pneumococcal diseases, such as meningitis, the health department said.“The department initiated the rule change on September 3 2025, and anticipates the rule change will not be effective for approximately 90 days,” the state told the Associated Press in an email. The public school year in Florida started in August.All other vaccinations required under Florida law to attend school “remain in place, unless updated through legislation” including vaccines for measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, mumps and tetanus, the department said.Lawmakers don’t meet again until January 2026, although committee meetings begin in October.Ladapo, appearing Sunday on CNN, repeated his message of free choice for childhood vaccines.“If you want them, God bless, you can have as many as you want,” he said. “And if you don’t want them, parents should have the ability and the power to decide what goes into their children’s bodies. It’s that simple.”Earlier this week, Ladapo garneredcriticismafter he compared vaccine mandates to “slavery”. Speaking at a press conference alongside Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis who has also expressed deep vaccine skepticism, Ladapo said of the vaccine requirements: “Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery.”His comments drew outrage from lawmakers and health experts alike, with Democratic Florida state representative Anna Eskamani saying: “Ending vaccine mandates is reckless and dangerous. It will drive down immunization rates and open the door to outbreaks of preventable diseases, putting children, seniors and vulnerable Floridians at risk.”Meanwhile, John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York,said:“Florida’s undertakers will now need to plan for the future by increasing their stocks of small coffins,” adding that all the preventable vaccines would increase in schools.Ladapo had previouslyaltered datain a 2022 study by the state’s health department to exaggerate the risks of cardiac death for young men. The study had initially disclaimed any significant risk associated with the vaccines for young men. However, Ladaporeplacedthe language to claim that men between 18 and 39 years old are at high risk of heart illness from two Covid vaccines that use mRNA technology.Ladapo had also falsely claimed in 2023 that booster shots were not tested on humans and had “red flags.” The same year, the US Food and Drug Administration, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called Ladapo’s vaccine stances as harmful to the public.“It is the job of public health officials around the country to protect the lives of the populations they serve, particularly the vulnerable,” the federal letter said,adding:“Fueling vaccine hesitancy undermines this effort.”Florida currently has areligious exemptionfor vaccine requirements. Vaccines have saved at least 154 million lives globally over the past 50 years, the World Health Organization reported in 2024. The majority of those were infants and children.Dr Rana Alissa, chair of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said making vaccines voluntary puts students and school staff at risk.This isthe worst year for measlesin the US in more than three decades, with more than 1,400 cases confirmed nationwide,most of them in Texas, and three deaths.Whooping cough has killed at least two babies in Louisiana anda five-year-old in Washington statesince winter, as it too spreads rapidly. There have been more than 19,000 cases as of 23 August, nearly 2,000 more than this time last year,according to preliminary CDC data.Maya Yang contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsFloridaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content",

There aren’t companies coming out and saying, ‘Oh, because of the tariffs, we’re doing this.’”He went on to add: “If things are so bad, why was the GDP 3.3%? Why is the stock market at a new high? Because, you know, with President Trump, we care both about big companies and small companies.”As concernscontinue to growover American companies trying to pass on the cost of US tariffs on to everyday Americans, Welker asked: “Do you acknowledge that these tariffs are attacks on American consumers?” To which Bessent replied: “No, I don’t.”Bessent’s latest interview follows a ruling by a federal appeals court whichfoundthat Trump had overstepped his presidential authority when he imposed sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries earlier this year that sent shockwaves across global markets.The tariffs established a 10% baseline for nearly all of the US’s trading partners. Trump also imposed so-called “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on countries that he accused of unfairly treating the US in trade. Lesotho, a south African nation of 2.3 million people faced a50% tariff,while Trump alsoimposeda 10% tariff on a group of uninhabited islands home to penguins near Antarctica.In response to the federal appeals court’s decision, the Trump administration has recentlyaskedthe US supreme court to overturn the ruling.Speaking on whether theTrump administrationwould be prepared to offer rebates if the supreme court rules against the administration, Bessent said: “We would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs which would be terrible for the treasury… There’s no ‘be prepared.’ If the court says it, we’d have to do it.”Nevertheless, Bessent remained confident that the conservative-majority supreme court would side with the Trump administration, saying: “I am confident that we will win at the supreme court. But there are numerous other avenues that we can take. They diminish president Trump’s negotiating position … This isn’t about the dollars. This is about balance. The dollars are an after amount.”Bessent’s comments also came on the heels of newly released data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics whichrevealedthat in August, 12,000 manufacturing jobs were lost, marking a total loss of 42,000 jobs since April when Trump made his tariff announcement.“Are these numbers proof that the tariffs are failing to produce the manufacturing jobs that President Trump promised?” Welker asked Bessent, to which he replied: “It’s been a couple of months. And with the manufacturing sector … we can’t snap our fingers and have factories built.”Bessent went on to add that he believes “by the fourth quarter, we’re going to see a substantial acceleration”.In addition to a decline in manufacturing employment since April, job openings and hires have fallen by 76,000 and 18,000, respectively,according tothe Center for American Progress.According to economists, Trump’s tariffs are expected to cost American households $2,400 annually while wage growth among manufacturing workers remain stagnant under the tariffs.In August, manufacturing workers earned an hourly average of $35.50, marking only a 10-cent increase from July, the center reported.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS politicsTrump administrationTariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content",

We’re not going to feel threatened. We’re not going to give up and give in to fascism and authoritarianism.”As Chicago braced for an immigration enforcement crackdown and a possible national guard deployment, churches across the city turned up their response from the pulpit. Some worked to quell fears about detention and deportation while others addressed the looming possibility of more law enforcement on the streets of the nation’s third-largest city.Donald Trump has threatened federal intervention in Democratic strongholds, most recently warning apocalyptic force could be used in Chicago to fight crime and step up deportations. He’s repeatedly cited the expected plans over fierce objections from local leaders and many residents who call it unnecessary and unwanted.While fears have been high in immigrant circles since Trump took office the second time, the threat of more federal agencies and troops has also inflamed tensions, particularly in Black and Latino communities where trust in police is fragile.Among the church attendees was Lester Burks, a 74-year-old US army veteran who said a military presence in Chicago would be threatening.“I don’t want soldiers here,” he said. “They are trained to fight.”Details on the expected intervention have been sparse, including its focus and when it’s expected to begin. Trump’s border czar Tom Homan said on CNN’s State of the Union that federal law enforcement action will come to Chicago this week. He also promised more worksite enforcement operations like the massive one at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.“You can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country,” he said.TheTrump administrationhas repeatedly targeted, and unsuccessfully sued, over Chicago’s sanctuary laws, which are among the strongest in the nation. His administration launched a nationwide immigration enforcement operation in the city in January.There is no official definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities. The terms generally describe limits on local cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ice enforces US immigration laws nationwide but sometimes seeks state and local help.This time, the Department of Homeland Security plans to use a military base north of the city and has alerted leaders of another suburb that they’ll use a federal immigration processing center there for an operation that’ll potentially last 45 days. Meanwhile, Trump has said he might send national guard troops to New Orleans before Chicago.Trump has already deployed the national guard into Los Angeles and Washington, where he’s also federalized the police force. A federal judge has ruled the Los Angeles deployment is illegal.“We don’t need another level of law enforcement and their presence to pretend they’re going to solve problems related to violence,” Danny Davis, a Democrat, said at a Sunday news conference with other Black elected leaders on the city’s West Side.Most of Chicago’s nearly 3 million people are Black or Latino. New Mount Pilgrim is located in the city’s West Garfield Park neighborhood, a largely Black neighborhood which has faced persistent crime and years of disinvestment, including five schools near the church that closed in 2013 as part of the largest mass public closure in US history.The church has often called for action against street violence even as Chicago’s rates of violent crime have dropped substantially in recent years as part of a national trend. Its large stained glass art installations depict the lives of slaves and memorialize Black people killed by violence. On Sunday, the church celebrated the groundbreaking of a nearby arts and activism center it said was part of the solution.“We’re not calling for military, we’re calling for resources,” Hatch told congregants. “We know that there is a correlation between resources and violence.”Elsewhere in the city, other churches worked to remind people of their rights when it comes to interactions with immigration agents, urging them to carry necessary documents.The feeling of being on edge was familiar to many in Chicago, and the expected operation put a damper on the city’s usually festive Mexican Independence Day celebrations. Church leaders said the January immigration operation in Chicago had a chilling effect on attendance at immigrant-heavy and Latino churches as people stayed home.Clergy said they were preparing for the same in the weeks ahead.“It feels like anything can happen at any moment,” said the Rev. Paco Amador of New Life Community Church in the predominantly Mexican Little Village neighborhood. “It would be irresponsible not to talk about this.”Explore more on these topicsChicagoTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content",

When stadium monitors showed him saluting as a member of West Point performed The Star-Spangled Banner, a burst of cheers sprang up and was quickly drowned out by boos, at which point the president offered a brief smirk. After the first changeover, he reappeared on the big screen and stayed up there for a while – causing fans to boo even longer until the camera cut away.The USTA’s censorship of Trump dissent at the US Open is cowardly, hypocritical and un-American | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreTrump’s return to the US Open marked his first time at the tournament since 2015, when he was booed after leaving a match between Serena and Venus Williams. Invited to this year’s tournament by Rolex, he sat in a suite next to a winner’s trophy among a welter of cabinet and family members. He arrived more than an hour before the scheduled start of the match and raised a triumphant fist for the cameras.Meanwhile, thousands of fans were left trickling into the match because of the heightened security around the president’s visit. The stadium was not yet at its expected capacity 45 minutes into the match, at which point Carlos Alcaraz already had a 6-2 lead over Jannik Sinner.In a statement, the Secret Service said that protecting the president “required a comprehensive effort” that “may have contributed to delays for attendees.”Trump’s return to the Open is somewhat of a homecoming. He was once a fixture at the tournament, styling himself as a celebrity to dwarf all others from New York or Hollywood. During that time, he was often shown on the big screen and booed.But after he kicked off his 2015 presidential campaign with a fiery announcement speech hitting out at immigrants and foreign allies, the prevailing attitude toward Trump in New York shifted negatively.The reception Trump received from the crowd on Sunday was in marked contrast to the enthusiasm that went up for the match’s other prominent attendees. During a changeover in the second set, the camera cut to Bruce Springsteen, who has been the target of a fusillade of Trump criticism. The crowd cheered deliriously.The US Tennis Association, which organizes the US Open, had emailed broadcastersrequesting reactions to Trump not be shown. Despite that, Trump’s appearance during the anthem was briefly shown on ESPN in the US.A scattering of protestors stood outside the grounds before the match. Among them was Emma Kaplan, a 33-year-old executive assistant from Brooklyn, distributing flyers that read “The Fall of the Trump Fascist Regime.” She was joined by three members of RefuseFascism.org, one hoisting a poster that declared “GAME, SET, MATCH! NOV 5, FLOOD DC. TRUMP MUST GO!”; another’s sign demanded the shutdown of “the whole Trump fascist regime.”Some fans nodded quietly in approval. Others made their opposition clear.“Oh my bad, I voted for him,” one man muttered.Kaplan brushed off the jeers. “Trump has historically been booed here,” she said. “He should be booed everywhere he goes. And on 5 November we’re calling for millions of people to come to Washington DC. They might try to silence our boos, but they can’t silence our rage.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisTennisUS sportsDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content",

The growth has come despite hundreds of allegations of union-busting, retaliation and unfair labor practices lodged against Starbucks by the union.Starbucks Workers United had made progress toward securing a first union contract with the company since bargaining sessionsbeganin early 2024. But that progress has largely stalled since Niccol took over the company.His first year on the job began with implementing a new strategy for the company, which he dubbed “Back to Starbucks”, which outlined an emphasis on customer service, decreasing wait times for orders and improving in-store experiences.Niccol haspraisedthe strategy, and the company had a record sales week on the release of its Fall menu this year aftersix consecutive quartersof same-store sales declines.But workers organizing at Starbucks have criticized the strategy, citing increased demands on workers, such ashaving to write personalized messageson customer drink orders, without improvements to staffing or pay.View image in fullscreenBrian Niccol speaks at the company’s leadership conference in Las Vegas on 10 June 2025.Photograph: Joshua Trujillo/Starbucks via ReutersAsurveyconducted by Starbucks Workers United and the Strategic Organizing Center of 737 Starbucks workers found 91% reported understaffing at their stores in the past three months, and93%said the policy changes under Niccol either had no impact or worsened the customer experience.“It’s clear that ‘Back to Starbucks’ isn’t working and won’t succeed until we finalize a fair union contract with the hours, take-home pay and protections baristas need to do our jobs,” said Michelle Eisen, a spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United and a barista for 15 years.“Brian has talked about like simplifying the menu to make things easier for partners, and wanting to get customers in and out of the stores faster, but these changes that he’s rolled out haven’t accomplished any of those things,” said Jasmine Leli, a Starbucks barista since December 2021 at a Starbucks store in Cheektowaga, New York, the second store to unionize in the US. “We really need him to get back to the table to finalize this contract so that we can start to turn things around.”Leli warned Starbucks can expect further actions from unionized workers to force the company to get back to the bargaining table. The union has frequently utilized strikes and protests to address specific issues at stores.“We are going to do whatever it takes to get them back to the table so that we can start to address the issues with the wages, scheduling and staffing,” Leli added. “We are the ones that are working in the stores and interacting with the customers day in and day out, and partners want to be a part of making change in the workplace. So that’s why stores are joining the fight.”graphic 1Niccol’s exorbitant compensation has been a point of criticism for workers and labor advocates; Niccol received$97.8min total compensation in 2024, 6,666 times more than the median annual salary of a Starbucks worker at $14,674, the biggest CEO-to-worker pay gap among the top 500 corporations in the US. Starbucks claimed its average compensation, including benefits for workers who work at least 20 hours a week, is $30 an hour.“If you’re the Starbucks CEO you get $96m for four months of work including a $5m bonus,” Senator Bernie Sanderswroteon social media in March. “If you’re a Starbucks union worker, the CEO is refusing to give you a decent raise to pay rent and buy groceries. Starbucks must end its greed & negotiate a fair union contract.”A spokesperson for Starbucks said in response to criticism of Niccol’s compensation: “Starbucks believes Brian has established himself as one of the most effective leaders in our industry, with a proven track record of delivering long-term value to employees, customers and shareholders. The majority of his reported first-year compensation reflects multi-year replacement equity grants, awarded to offset compensation forfeited upon his departure from Chipotle, which are now directly tied to Starbucks future performance.”The company alsopaid $3.8bnto shareholders in fiscal year 2024 through stock buybacks and dividends.Starbucks Workers United havecriticizedNiccol’s pay, his private jet use and the$81mspent by Starbucks on aJune conventionin Las Vegas for 14,000 store managers and other leaders.“It would take less than what Brian made in four months to settle fair contracts with our union,” stated the union in a recentvideoposted on Instagram.graphic 2In December 2024, thousands of baristas at Starbucks stores around the US went on strike, the largest strike in the company’s history, after the union claimed Starbucksbacktrackedon an agreement to finalize a deal.In April 2025, the union rejected a proposal from Starbucks for2%pay increases, with 81% of unionized stores voting it down due to its failure to adequately address other economic benefits and provide an immediate pay hike. A new proposal has yet to materialize.In the midst of stalled negotiations, Starbucks Workers United has continued growing to648 unionized stores, from500 storesin September 2024.Diego Franco, a barista at Starbucks for five years at a unionized store in Chicago, Illinois, criticized the personalized note change when he says his store is often understaffed, resulting in long waits for orders.“If I’m a customer, I don’t care to read a personalized note on my cup when I’m already waiting 20 minutes for my drink, and as a worker, I’m getting chastised for not having a Sharpie at all times,” Franco said. “It’s been a huge mishandling of so much money, but the company continues to lose, thinking that Brian or any of our previous CEOs have had the answers.”“I believe if the company truly wanted to fix the problems happening in their stores, it could have happened by now,” he added. “Where the company might see a bottom line, I see human experiences, human lives that are affected by the work that we do. So I hope to preserve that and to make it better, not just for me and my co-workers, but for people who come in the stores.”A spokesperson for Starbucks said: “Since last April 2024, Starbucks and Workers United have held more than nine bargaining sessions over 20 days and three mediation sessions over five days with a federal mediator. We’ve reached over thirty meaningful agreements on hundreds of topics Workers United delegates told us were important to them. We are ready to finalize a reasonable contract for represented partners, but we need the union to return to the bargaining table to finish the job.”Explore more on these topicsUS unionsStarbucksFood & drink industryWorkers' rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content",

As the country prepares to go to the polls on Monday,Norwayis in the grip of a ferocious national argument that is likely to rumble on whichever party wins.In an economy less then a seventh the size of Britain’s, theformuesskattraises about 32bn kroner (£2.4bn). Multiply that by the difference in GDP, and the same rules applied in the UK could raise more than £17bn – serious money in tax terms. Defenders say the wealth tax has another benefit. They see it as the cornerstone of a progressive tax system that has helped to create one of Europe’s most equal societies.But entrepreneurs are pushing back, financing lobbying campaigns and pouring money into politics and online advertising. There is even a protest song. “Don’t come to Norway, we will tax you till you’re poor, and when you have nothing left, we will tax you a little more,” laments a business consultant in avideo posted on LinkedIn. On the other side of the divide, the leader of the Socialist Left party has a“wall of shame”in her office displaying the names of those who oppose or avoid the tax.More disturbingly, the experts are under attack. Economists and statisticians have flagged a wave of disinformation, while being subjected to hate mail and targeted by newspapers.Annette Alstadsæter, director of theSkatterforsk Centre for Tax Researchat the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, has spoken in favour of the tax and authored a series of papers on avoidance and offshore wealth. She now weighs her public statements carefully, and has withdrawn from social media because of the risk of online abuse. “People are so angry. Either you are very against or very for,” she says.“I’ve been working on this for 15 years and it’s always an issue but this time it has exploded,” says the economist Mathilde Fasting, a member of the right of centre thinktankCivitaand one of those calling for abolition. “Each time you talk about economic issues this tax will come up. It’s like a symbol of all other things happening.”In a country where politics still gravitates to the centre, the wealth tax creates a clear dividing line between left and right. The row has evolved into a full culture war, with Trumpian appeals to aspirational young men who may not yet be rich enough to pay the levy, but oppose it on principle. On the YouTube showGutta(Guys), four muscle-bound presenters filmed themselvespouring champagne over their wrist watcheswhile discussing “tax refugees”.View image in fullscreenJens Stoltenberg has promised to set up a cross-party commission to review all taxes if Labour is returned to power.Photograph: Fredrik Varfjell/ReutersJens Stoltenberg, the former Nato secretary general and ex-Norwegian premier who returned to frontline politics in February as finance minister, has promised to set up a cross-party commission to review all taxes if Labour is returned to power. Thanks to his wide appeal, his party has risen in the polls, and is now ahead of the populist Progress party, which has promised to do away with theformuesskatt. In third place is the more moderate centre-rightHøyre, which wants to slash the amount raised.During his decade at the helm of Nato, Stoltenberg was dubbed “the Trump whisperer” after convincing the US president not to pull out of the security alliance during his first term. It seems settling the wealth tax dispute will take all of the diplomatic skills he deployed in that role. The trick will be to retain the tax without triggering an exodus of billionaires.“If a ton of people leave Norway that would be a problem,” says the entrepreneur Karl Munthe-Kaas, who supports the tax. “But if we let these groups that have all this money hold the rest of the country hostage, I have an issue with that.”Cut through the noise, and the underlying conversation is nuanced. Norwegians discuss tax with confidence, because they have access to all the right data. Almost uniquely among democratic nations, the tax returns of named individuals are public,in a databasethat all citizens can access. Likewise, information on companies is detailed and reliable.Norway has levied a tax on wealth above a certain value since 1892, some years before securing full independence from Sweden. Along with Spain and Switzerland, it is one of only three European nations to still tax capital in this way. The current rate stands at 1% for those with assets of more than 1.7m kroner (£125,000) and 1.1% for those with more than 20.7m kroner. The tax is collected annually, and is calculated by adding up the value of properties, savings, investments and shares, and deducting any debt. Private companies count as part of their owners’ wealth. There are discounts – for example, only 25% of the value of a primary residence is taxable.View image in fullscreenNorway is one of only three European nations to levy a tax on wealth above a certain value.Photograph: Drazen_/Getty ImagesAlthough 720,000 citizens pay wealth tax, for most the annual contribution is small. Fasting says about 3,000 have taxable wealth of more than 100m kroner.Among the biggest contributors is Gustav Magnar Witzøe, the heir to the SalMar fish farms business. In 2023, his wealth tax was330m kroner. It was the only personal tax he paid as he had no income, according to reports based on his filings. Under the plans put forward byHøyre,it has been reported his bill would fall to zero. This is because the party is proposing to exclude what it calls “working capital” – essentially assets that are part of trading businesses.Thanks to changes made by Labour the total wealth tax collected has risen from 18bn kroner in 2021, the year of the last election, to 32bn kroner last year. Estimates for 2025 are even higher.graphIn 2022, the changes prompted departures. More than 30 billionaires and multimillionairesleft the country, according to research by the newspaper Dagens Næringsliv. They included the industrial tycoon Kjell Inge Røkke, the fourth richest Norwegian, with a fortune of about £1.5bn, who relocated to Switzerland. There were warnings of lost tax revenues and damage to the economy, but three years later, it is clear that the exodus had limited impact.In Norway, as elsewhere, the billionaires are getting richer. In 2024, the 400 wealthiest were worth 2.139tn kroner,up 14% in a year, according to the business magazine Kapital. But it also reported half of this wealth was controlled by families relocated abroad.Fasting believes more will leave. “People are not investing here, not listing their companies, and finally moving out, which is serious. And I am sure that if the Labour party continues after the elections now you will see a boost of people moving,” she says.Her main argument for scrapping the tax is that it puts Norwegians at a disadvantage compared with foreign company owners. She says they have to take dividends out of their companies to pay the tax authorities, which means less money for growing businesses or starting new ones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its backers include the salmon exporter Roger Hofseth. “If the left wins this time, a lot of people will flee to Switzerland,” Hofseth told a gathering last month.“There is this mentality that people who are self-made, they forget they are a product of the system,” says Alstadsæter at the Centre for Tax Research. “For me it’s about justice. Everyone should pay a little bit. The rich get all these public goods. A stable political system, social security, and a highly educated population with access to free healthcare.”She believes some reforms are needed, saying the threshold of 1.7m kroner is too low.With a sovereign wealth fund that collects the profits from Norway’s abundant stocks of oil and gas able to contribute 25% of public spending each year, there is arguably no need for theformuesskatt.“To me, it’s more about fairness,” says Simen Markussen, the director of the Ragnar Frisch Centre for Economic Research in Oslo. “It ensures that capital owners who don’t have labour income are paying a reasonable amount of tax. It redistributes from the richest to everyone.”For the very rich, it is particularly effective, as it accounts for most of the personal taxes they pay.graphWhile the sums collected are not huge, they are meaningful. “Compared with all taxes on personal income it’s maybe 4.5%,” says Markussen. “It’s big enough that if a politician says ‘I want to abolish it’ they should be challenged on how this should be financed. Do you want to maintain those tax revenues, or what do you want to cut?”Munthe-Kaas founded the Oda grocery delivery business, which became Norway’s first “unicorn”, a term used for startups valued at more than $1bn. He exited the company last year and no longer pays the wealth tax, but has done previously. He believes it works well, and would prefer a cut to corporation tax.“The wealth tax is not a choice between value creation versus distribution, it gives us both,” he says. “Any tax you bring in will reduce the ability to either invest or consume, whoever pays it. Taxing the rich isn’t different in that sense to taxing a middle-class worker. So when rich people are upset they get less to invest, the same argument goes for anyone.”View image in fullscreenKarl Munthe-Kaas, who founded the Oda delivery grocery delivery business, believes the wealth tax works well.Photograph: Millionaires for HumanityAndré Nilsen, a neuroscientist and kroner millionaire thanks to family money and his own investments, pays a small sum in wealth tax each year. He believes theformuesskattshould stay because it helps pay for social security. “It is easier to get rich in Norway compared with other countries. You are free to go on wild explorations of ideas because you have a safety net that will catch you if it doesn’t work out,” he says.Although the wealthy often give generously to charity, it cannot replace tax, he believes. “There must be some kind of system above everyone that says at least do this.”There are other ways to target wealth. The UK – in common with many other countries – taxes dividends, capital gains and inherited money. But the rates can be much lower than those for wage-based income, and there are many loopholes and discounts.Alstadsæter says the wealth tax is harder to dodge: “It’s the only tax that cannot be avoided through restructuring while living in Norway, hence the opposition.”Explore more on these topicsNorwayEuropeEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content",

Some experts say that the“de minimis” exemptionwill hit “many, many” small businesses hard.“The de minimis suspension ending is yet another change that has forced every American small business owner to become an accidental trade policy expert overnight,” Jacob Bennett, CEO and co-founder of small business banking platform Crux Analytics, toldForbes. “There’s this whiplash effect that many, many small business owners are now feeling which is leading to growing uncertainty and concern about how they’re going to continue running their business.”Let’s not panic.Trump’s tariff adventures have been a major pain in the neck for any business that buys products – directly or indirectly – that originate from overseas. And I agree that this latest development is going to hurt some small businesses. In a nation of more than 33m small businesses, any regulation is going to affect some of them. But it actually only affects a tiny portion of small businesses.The vast majority of these 33m businesses – about70% of them– are service providers – accountants, contractors, freelancers, etc – who don’t buy international goods. And take a look around your neighborhood. Who are the small businesses there? Restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, fitness centers, gas stations, pizza parlors. These are not people who will see any difference in their lives because of this particular change.This panic over the expiration of the de minimis exemption – and tariffs in general – is misdirected. Yes, prices are going to rise. But as long as people can afford such items they’ll keep buying. That’s what we need to worry about.Thelatest jobsreport suggests that the long boom in the labor market is coming to an end. For now workers are – at least for the most part – keeping up. Current inflation is running at about2.7%annually, so most working people are still making more than what they have to spend. Net worth held by the 50th to 90th wealth percentiles (the middle class) remains athistorical highs. Both the bond and stock markets remain strong.This doesn’t mean we do nothing in the face of tariffs. My smartest clients are diversifying away from higher-priced foreign goods, finding alternate suppliers, targeting their price increases better and offering financing solutions like Buy Now Pay Later to make it easier for their customers to pay. Others are buying in bulk and storing inbonded warehouseswhere they pay no tariffs while they wait out the uncertain environment.Yes, Trump’s tariffs are creating uncertainty, headaches and angst. Yes, these tariffs are going to result in increased prices. But as long as income and wealth grow as they have, the economy will probably absorb this. That’s what we need to keep an eye on.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessSmall businessUS economyfeaturesShareReuse this content",

As he has spent the early years of his career collecting major titles at a breathless pace, this has been clear for a long time.

The 22-year-old also continues to mark himself as one of the greatest ever young players: he is the second-youngest man in the Open era to earn six grand slam titles, trailing only Björn Borg. He is also already the fourth man to win multiple grand slam titles on all three surfaces.Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner to win US Open men’s singles title – liveRead moreThis match-up marked the first time the same men have competed in three major finals in the Open era in the same calendar year, with Alcaraz finishing the trilogy with a 2-1 lead. He now holds a 10-5 record over Sinner, winning seven of their past eight meetings.On this occasion, Alcaraz could do anything he wanted with the tennis ball for the best part of three hours. He served brilliantly and struck his devastating forehand with total ­precision, but he also showcased his variation in full, constantly varying the pace, spin and trajectory of his shots. He kept Sinner completely off balance and unable to gain any rhythm with his destructive groundstrokes.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner greet each other at the net at the conclusion of their match.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesThis was one of the most ­significant days of the tennis year, and yet the narrative was hijacked by the presence of Donald Trump, the US president. Overnight, Arthur Ashe Stadium was tightly encircled by airport-style security barriers and as fans began to queue up in order to enter the stadium, they were watched over by Secret Service agents. The men’s trophy was placed in the Rolex suite alongside Trump, which is not the usual protocol. When the US president was finally shown on the big screen at the end of the first set, most of the audience booed.As 2pm approached, the embarrassment continued for the United StatesTennisAssociation. Due to the dramatically heightened security, the queues to enter the ­stadium spanned across the ­tournament grounds and the start was delayed until 2.30pm. The final began with thousands of fans still waiting to take their seats. ­Hundreds were still outside during the second set.Nobody, it turns out, was as excited for arematch of the French Openand Wimbledon finals as Alcaraz himself. He was spellbinding from the beginning, every part of his prodigious game flowing. He continued the excellent serving form that has guided him through the tournament and he struck his destructive forehand with total freedom, completely dominating the baseline.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz plays a forehand return to Jannik Sinner during his four-set victory.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesAt the core of his performance, though, was the way he unfurled the various layers of his impossibly complete game, forcing Sinner to deal with skidding low slices, forays to the net, constant changes to the trajectory of the ball and drop shots. With the roof closed due to rain, the sterile indoor conditions were widely considered a positive for Sinner, but Alcaraz set the tone with a flawless opening set.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There would be no repeat here. Alcaraz recovered, re-establishing his dominant serving, his variation and his control of the baseline. After snatching the opening break, he flitted through the third set to establish a two sets to one lead before immediately generating break points on Sinner’s serve.With his back to the wall, Sinner fought desperately until the end. He won many of the frenetic, scattered cat-and-mouse points typical of this rivalry, including a stunning combination of volleys down break point at 0-1 in the fourth set that drew a finally full stadium to its feet. ­However, when he is in this mood, and everything is flowing so effortlessly, Alcaraz’s game can scale to heights that nobody else, including Sinner, can reach. Even now, six majors in, it feels as if he has only just begun.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Carlos AlcarazJannik SinnerUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content",

The Packers won their 13th consecutive home opener. The Packers scored points on their first three drives to pull ahead for good. The Packers’ convincing win over the two-time defending NFC North champions represented a fresh start after they went 1-5 in divisional games last season.Pittsburgh Steelers 34-32 New York JetsAaron Rodgers threw four touchdown passes in his Steelers debut, leading Pittsburgh to an enthralling victory over theNew York Jets. Chris Boswell kicked a go-ahead 60-yard field goal with just over a minute remaining. The Jets, who lost in coach Aaron Glenn’s debut, had a chance to drive for a potential winning field goal when they got the ball back with 56 seconds remaining. On fourth-and-three, Justin Fields connected with Garrett Wilson for what could have been a first down – but Jalen Ramsey smacked into the Jets receiver, who couldn’t hold on to the ball. Fields, also playing against his former team, ran for two touchdowns and threw for another. Rodgers was 22 of 30 for 244 yards with four TD passes.Miami Dolphins 8–33 Indianapolis ColtsDaniel Jones threw one touchdown pass and ran for two more in his Indianapolis debut to lead the host Colts to a comfortable victory over the Miami Dolphins.Jones, who won the job over Anthony Richardson in preseason, completed 22 of 29 passes for 272 yards, and the Colts forced three early turnovers to score 30 unanswered points. The Colts scored on all seven of their possessions while the Dolphins turned the ball over on three of their first four possessions leading to 17 Indianapolis points. Tua Tagovailoa was responsible for all three of those giveaways, throwing two interceptions and losing a fumble on a strip sack by Kenny Moore II that was recovered by former Dolphins safety Xavien Howard.San Francisco 49ers 17–13 Seattle SeahawksThird-string tight end Jake Tonges caught a deflected pass for a touchdown with 1:34 remaining, and the San Francisco 49ers rallied for a narrow season-opening win. He finished with three catches in relief of injured All-Pro tight end George Kittle and came down with a 50-50 ball from a scrambling Brock Purdy for a four-yard TD. Seahawks cornerback Riq Woolen got a hand on the ball but it bounced off him and Tonges grabbed it. Sam Darnold moved the Seahawks into position to win his debut with the franchise but was strip-sacked by Nick Bosa on the San Francisco nine-yard line.New York Giants 6–21 Washington CommandersJayden Daniels threw for 233 yards and a touchdown, Deebo Samuel scored in his Washington debut, and the Commanders kept the New York Giants out of the end zone in a comfortable victory. Last seen allowing 55 points to Philadelphia in the NFC championship game, Washington’s defense had a much better time of it against the Giants. New York managed only 231 yards of offense and was particularly ineffective running the ball. Daron Payne had a sack and batted down a third-down pass, and the Commanders never let Russell Wilson look comfortable in his first start with New York. Wilson went 17 of 37 for 168 yards.How I became a Buffalo Bills fan – and learned what home meansRead moreCincinnati Bengals 17–16 Cleveland BrownsCincinnati’s defense secured a narrow win over the Cleveland Browns. The Bengals, under new coordinator Al Golden, forced two second-half turnovers, including DJ Turner’s interception with 1:24 left. Cincinnati won an opener for the first time since 2021. New Cleveland kicker Andre Szmyt missed two crucial kicks, including a potential game-winning field-goal attempt. Joe Burrow completed 14 of 23 passes for 113 yards and a touchdown. The Browns outgained the Bengals 327-141 but fell short on the day. Joe Flacco passed for 290 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions.Tennessee Titans 12–20 Denver BroncosBo Nix overcame three turnovers as the Denver Broncos spoiled Cam Ward’s debut with a win over the Tennessee Titans. Nix threw a touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton, and rookie RJ Harvey’s 50-yard run set up JK Dobbins’ 19-yard touchdown. Ward finished with no touchdowns or interceptions. Quarterbacks taken first overall are now 4-14-1 in season openers since the start of the common draft era. Tennessee had a chance to tie late but went three-and-out.Houston Texans 9–14 Los Angeles RamsMatthew Stafford threw for 245 yards and a touchdown while becoming the 10th quarterback inNFLhistory with 60,000 yards in the air, and Braden Fiske recovered a fumble forced by Nate Landman with 1:43 to play in the Los Angeles Rams’ victory over the Houston Texans. Puka Nacua had 10 catches for 130 yards for the Rams, who went ahead on Davis Allen’s TD catch on the opening drive of the third quarter. Neither team scored again in a choppy opener. CJ Stroud passed for 188 yards for the Texans with several sharp throws despite playing behind a struggling offensive line.Las Vegas Raiders 20–13 New England PatriotsGeno Smith threw for 362 yards and a touchdown, rookie Ashton Jeanty rushed for his first career touchdown and the Las Vegas Raiders rallied to beat the New England Patriots. Tight end Brock Bowers had five catches for 103 yards before leaving in the fourth quarter with a knee injury. Jakobi Meyers added eight catches for 97 yards. Maxx Crosby and Malcolm Koonce also added sacks to help give Pete Carroll his first victory as Raiders coach.Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23–20 Atlanta FalconsRookie Emeka Egbuka caught two touchdown passes, including a go-ahead 25-yarder with 59 seconds remaining, and Tampa Bay recovered after losing the lead on a marathon drive by Atlanta to beat the Falcons in a dramatic game. Following Baker Mayfield’s 25-yard pass to Egbuka, Chase McLaughlin’s missed extra point gave the Falcons an opening to force overtime with a field goal. Michael Penix Jr moved the Falcons into field goal position in the final minute. Younghoe Koo was wide right on the 44-yarder.Carolina Panthers 10–26 Jacksonville JaguarsTrevor Lawrence threw a touchdown pass, Travis Etienne ran for 143 yards and the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Carolina Panthers to give their new regime a debut victory. Brian Thomas Jr also ran for a score for Jacksonville, who controlled both lines of scrimmage and kept Lawrence upright all afternoon. The game was delayed for nearly 90 minutes because of nearby lightning strikes. Bryce Young turned in another season-opening stinker. He had a TD pass to Chuba Hubbard, two interceptions and a fumble. He also made a head-scratching throw out of the back of the end zone on a fourth-down play.Arizona Cardinals 20-13 New Orleans SaintsKyler Murray threw two touchdown passes and the visiting Arizona Cardinals spoiled Kellen Moore’s debut as an NFL head coach.Murray passed for just 163 yards while completing 21 of 29, but his scoring passes to Marvin Harrison Jr and James Conner made the difference for the Cardinals, who were 8-9 last season. Spencer Rattler completed 27 of 45 for 214 yards with no touchdowns for Moore, who was hired by New Orleans after being Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator during the Eagles’ Super Bowl title run last season. The Saints, who were 5-12 last season, were penalized 13 times for 89 yards as their NFL-leading streak of six consecutive wins in season openers came to an end.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York JetsPittsburgh SteelersUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content",

His teammateOscar Piastri, who ceded his place to the British driver, also maintained he had no regrets in agreeing to do so.The race was won by Max Verstappen for Red Bull, with the world champion enjoying enormous pace at Monza, while Norris and Piastri followed in second and third place. After Norris had held second almost the entire race, he dropped behind his teammate because of a slow pit stop caused by a wheel gun issue in the last laps andMcLarenordered the Australian to give the place back.Verstappen wins F1 Italian GP as Norris closes gap on Piastri amid pit-stop controversyRead morePiastri did so and Norris went on to take second and three points out of his teammate’s championship lead, reducing it to 31 points. Both drivers accepted the decision on track and afterwards. Norris, who was booed on the podium, was forthright in his belief that McLaren had made the right call.“I don’t want to win this way, and the same with Oscar,” he said. “But we do what we think is correct as a team no matter what people say and what their opinions are and we will stick with that.“We are not idiots and we have plans for different things. If there were four cars between me and Oscar, of course he is not going to let me back past and that is correct. But if there is a situation where we are racing and you can be fair, you would expect to be fair as a team.“Today was not my fault. If I came flat out into my box and I hit all my mechanics I would not expect to get the position back. This was out of my control.”Piastri could have put three more points on his title rival by refusing to move over but agreed with Norris that he felt he had done the right thing according to the culture and racing ethos engendered at McLaren.When asked if he may have cause to regret the decision if he lost the title by three points, he was unequivocal.View image in fullscreenLando Norris leads McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri during the Italian Grand Prix.Photograph: Joe Portlock/Getty Images“I wouldn’t regret it, no,” he said. “It was a fair decision. Lando was ahead the whole race. It wasn’t through any fault of his own. For me, that’s fine. Ultimately, whoever wins the championship wants to have won it as much as they can through their own performances and things that they can control and today that wasn’t one of those things.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will tout another record-setting Open: more than a million fans through the gates, unprecedented social-media engagement, double-digit growth in food and beverage sales, and hundreds of celebrities packed into suites from Rolex to Ralph Lauren. It will beam about growing the game, championing diversity andturning Flushing Meadows into a pop-culture destination.But for all the milestones the USTA is teeing up to celebrate, this year’s tournament will be remembered for a different kind of first: the governing body’s lamentable decisionto ask broadcasters not to show dissentagainst Donald Trump. In making that pre-emptive concession, the USTA has committed an unforced error that can’t be undone: sacrificing credibility in order to shield a politician –anypolitician, regardless of party, ideology or affiliation – from the sound of public disapproval.Broadcasters told not to air any booing of Donald Trump at US Open men’s finalRead moreAccording to internal emails obtained by outletsincluding PAandBounces, the USTA instructed its television partners to “refrain from showcasing any disruptions or reactions” when Trump appears on screen during Sunday’s final. A separate note reminded staff he would be seated in Rolex’s suite as a client guest. The 11-word statement to the Guardian on Saturday night from a USTA spokesperson – “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions” – is so weak it could buckle under the weight of its own hypocrisy. (Rolex did not respond to a request for comment.)This is, after all, the same tournament that happily televised a climate protestergluing himself to a seatfor nearly an hour during Coco Gauff’s semi-final win over Karolina Muchova two years ago, along with countless other fan disturbances. The same tournament that shrugs at the drunken buffoonery behind itsUS Bro-pen reputation. The Open practically invented televising distractions. Chaos is its brand. For the USTA to draw the line at showing boos for a sitting president is not “policy consistency” but capitulation.And to what end? Because of the fear that Trump –once a fixture at the US Openbutloudly booed on his last visitin 2015, three months after announcing his first presidential campaign – may once again be exposed as unpopular before a global audience? Because of the fear that a chorus of jeers could overshadow the match itself? But that fear misunderstands both sport and democracy.Crowd dissent on broadcasts is not a breakdown of civic order. It is its expression. Then UK home secretary Theresa Maywas booed at the 2012 London Paralympics. French president Emmanuel Macronwas whistledduring the 2023 Rugby World Cup opening ceremony in Paris. In the US, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell isall but guaranteed a chorus of boosduring public appearances, and that’s practically a standing ovation next tothe venom reservedfor NHL commissioner Gary Bettman from fans. And Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, have beengiven hostile receptionsby sports crowds. Somehow the United Kingdom, France and the United States survived those incidents intact.That the USTA thinks Trump must be insulated from reality hints at something darker. It is reminiscent of regimes where the leader’s image must be protected from public ridicule. It shows how much Trump’s first term – and his bullying of cultural institutions – still shapes behavior. In his first presidency, he was broadly reviled by athletes and sports bodies. Now, as Tom Dartwrote before this year’s Super Bowl, he is increasingly accommodated or treated with silence.View image in fullscreenThe US Open is supposed to be New York’s tournament, brash and democratic, rowdy and unfiltered.Photograph: Ishika Samant/Getty ImagesThe Open is supposed to be New York’s tournament, brash and democratic, rowdy and unfiltered, vibrant and exuberantly multicultural, where the crowd is as much a presence as the players on the court. By sanitizing its reaction, the USTA isn’t just shielding Trump. It is stripping the event of its unique character, authenticity and integrity.That irony cuts even deeper because the Open has always been at the forefront of progress. It was the first of the majors to award equal prize money to women and men, long before other sports caught up. It platformed, embraced and celebrated LGBTQ+ athletes decades before it was fashionable to do so, from Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova in the 1970s to Renée Richards breaking ground as one of the first transgender athletes in professional tennis, to Open Pride nights today. And this year’s theme, “75 years of breaking barriers”, honors Althea Gibson, who in 1950 became the first Black player to compete at the tournament’s predecessor, the US nationals, and went on to clear a path for generations of Black players who followed. Her story is literally built into the grounds this fortnight, from the banners and installations designed by Melissa Koby – the first Black artist to create the Open’s theme art – to the constant reminders that the sport has prided itself on inclusion.From a Maga vantage point, of course, it probably looks like the Woke Super Bowl: King’s name on the gates, Gibson’s silhouette over Ashe Stadium, Serena and Venus Williams lionized, rainbow-tinged Pride nights, and a governing body trumpeting diversity at every turn. Which, if we’re being honest, may be one reason Trump is showing up in the first place: a 4D chess move with the intent of turning a tennis match into another battleground of grievance. Getting booed by thousands of fans drinking $23 vodka-lemonades won’t exactly be a bad look for his base, especially in a corrupt, disgusting hellhole like New York.Fans will still do what fans do. If they want to boo, they will boo. But millions at home may never see it, thanks to a governing body that has chosen to act less like a guardian of sport and more like a nervous producer of campaign stagecraft. For a sport that prides itself on honesty and clarity – the ball is in or out – it is a shameful retreat.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025TennisUS Open tennisUS sportsDonald TrumpCarlos AlcarazJannik SinnercommentShareReuse this content",

Given that the last six teams to come up have conceded a total of 515 goals (85.8 each on average) on their way straight back down, it’s not a bad position to focus on. Burnley replaced James Trafford with Martin Dubravka, while Leeds saw Lucas Perri as a safer pair of hands than Illan Meslier. Sunderland’s recruitment of Roefs, a small part of their £150m summer outlay, might be the best decision of all. Standing 6ft 4in tall, the Dutchman has a presence and composure that belies the fact he is only 22. Roefs has quickly become a fan favourite and saved a penalty to helpSunderland beat Brentford, their second win in three Premier League games.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead more2Ferran Jutglà (Club Brugge to Celta Vigo, £4.7m)Celta’s decision toreplace Rafa Benítezwith B-team coach Claudio Giráldez last year was an inspired one. Giráldez transformed them from relegation candidates to European qualifiers in a single season and did so with minimal spending, building his team around a young, homegrown core of players. With a European campaign looming and winger Fer López sold to Wolves, reinforcements were needed this summer. Jutglà, a versatile attacker raised at Barcelona, could scarcely fit the Celta profile better – and with a year left on his contract, the 26-year-old was snapped up for less than £5m. If a three-year stint in Belgium was an unexpected step in his development, Jutglà still delivered: 31 goals in 105 games, including a fine strike toseal a surprise Champions League winover Atalanta. He may well cause more shockwaves in the Europa League this season.View image in fullscreenFerran Jutglà honed his skills at Barcelona before a stint at Club Brugge.Photograph: Aflo Co. Ltd./Alamy3Ernest Poku (AZ Alkmaar to Bayer Leverkusen, £8.7m)It has been a turbulent summer for Bayer Leverkusen, with an entire XI’s worth of players coming and going under the watch of Erik ten Hag, who was thendismissed after three gamesin charge. An uncertain few weeks lie ahead for Leverkusen’s new recruits, including a trio of promising youngsters. Playmaker Ibrahim Maza and centre-back Abdoulaye Faye – plucked from second-tier Hertha and Swedish side Häcken respectively – are intriguing prospects, but flying winger Poku could make the quickest impact. Discovered in amateur football, Poku wasquickly identified as a rising star, helping unfancied AZ Alkmaar win the Uefa Youth League in 2023. Able to play out wide, up front or behind a central striker, Poku claims to “leave defenders behind for breakfast” with his raw pace, but is also blessed with a delicate touch. Whoever replaces Ten Hag would be wise to give him a chance to shine.Quick GuideSarr to Scienza: how last season's picks faredShowFederico Chiesa (Juventus to Liverpool, £10m)Reduced to a bit-part role, Chiesa was one of the very few disappointments in Arne Slot's first season at Anfield – but the Italian stayed put and scored a big goal against Bournemouth (pictured) to open this season.Khéphren Thuram (Nice to Juventus, £17.1m)It was another underwhelming season for Juve, but Thuram slotted in as one of their most-used players, and has kept his place in the starting XI under Igor Tudor while providing enough magic to earn an official highlights reel.Alejandro Francés (Zaragoza to Girona, £3m)A promising start was stalled by an injury as Girona endured a tough campaign. Turning out at left, right and centre-back in the Champions League will at least have been a useful learning experience.Ismaïla Sarr (Marseille to Crystal Palace, £12.5m)The flying winger has proved to be a perfect addition to Oliver Glasner's squad, scoring 15 goals and nine assists so far. Played a big role in run to FA Cup glory and will be missed over the next month with an injury.Luka Sucic (Salzburg to Real Sociedad, £8.5m)In a disappointing season for La Real, Sucic still caught the eye and played down rumours he could emulate 'role model' Luka Modric with a move to Real Madrid.Samuel Dahl (Djurgarden to Roma, £3.4m)Swedish left-back's move to Italy did not work out – he played just an hour of football before being loaned out to Benfica. Things have gone much better in Lisbon, though, with Dahl making the move permanent this summer.Léo Scienza (Ulm to Heidenheim, £420k)Plucked from lower-league obscurity, the Brazilian excelled in the Bundesliga, scoring a last-gasp goal to keep his club up. That earned a £7m move to Southampton, a huge profit on FCH's original investment.Jorge Cuenca (Villarreal to Fulham, £5.7m)Found his chances limited in his first season, making just four Premier League starts, but Marco Silva shut down transfer talk and sees the Spaniard as one of his four regular centre-backs for this season.Leopold Querfeld (Rapid Vienna to Union Berlin, £2.5m)Defender made an unexpected impact by scoring the Bundesliga goal of the season against Stuttgart, capping a strong debut season where he became a regular starter.Theo Bair (Motherwell to Auxerre, £1.4m)The Canada striker could not continue his scoring form in Ligue 1, netting twice in 29 appearances. Has joined Lausanne on loan in bid to earn a place in co-hosts' 2026 World Cup squad.• Read last year's listherePhotograph: Shutterstock/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.4Adrian Truffert (Rennes to Bournemouth, £11.4m)Bournemouth sold four players this summer for fees in excess of £40m, three of whom were key cogs in Andoni Iraola’s defence last season. The Cherries may have been picked apart but they have responded in the summer market with a range of smart mid-price signings. Truffert could be the best of the bunch; the left-back brings a very different physical profile to thedeparted Milos Kerkez, but offers an attractive blend of youth and experience. Still only 23, Truffert racked up 150 Rennes appearances and captained the club for part of last season. He also brings big-game prowess to this ambitious corner of the south coast, having featured in all three current Uefa competitions and won asilver medal with Franceat the Paris Olympics.5Santiago Hidalgo (Independiente to Toulouse, £2.5m)Before he had signed his first professional contract, Hidalgowas already aiming high. Having switched position from left-winger to striker, his ambition was to emulate Sergio Agüero. It was another Argentina legend that slowed his progress at Independiente; Carlos Tevez came in as head coach and sent Hidalgo to the reserves. After opting against a free transfer away, he outlasted Tevez and began to attract interest from Europe – including Toulouse, who havebuilt an analytical modelunder Damien Comolli with scouts in 70 different countries. Comolli has left for Juventus this summer but the club’s approach continues, negotiating a cut-price fee for a player with a reported €20m release clause.

Seen as a rising star at Stuttgart, where he recorded a league-leading 24 assists across three seasons at left-back, Sosa’s career stalled when the former Stuttgart sporting director, Sven Mislintat, brought him to Ajax in 2023 – and was sacked three weeks later. Out of the picture in Amsterdam, Sosa struggled on loan at Torino but already looks a better fit on the left of Oliver Glasner’s 3-4-3 formation. Tyrick Mitchell remains first-choice in that position, but Sosa’s solid European experience will be hugely beneficial as Palace embark on their first continental campaign.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also bolstered Les Dogues’ reputation as one of Europe’s leading clubs in terms of talent development. Having banked £47.6m for academy product Chevalier, Lille spent less than 10% of that fee on their new No 1, who wasplaying first-team football at 18for Turkish side Altinordu. Özer joined Fenerbahce but found his path blocked by Altay Bayindir, and took loan moves to Belgium and Portugal in order to play before settling back in Turkey with Eyüpspor. It was Lille’s previous history with Turkish stars like Burak Yilmaz that swayed Özer to move and he has started well, making big saves against Monaco before saving a penalty and notching an assist as Lille dismantled Lorient 7-1.Transfer window and deadline day: Premier League club-by-club analysisRead more8Christian Ordoñez (Vélez Sarsfield to Parma, £6.7m)Another club with a hard-earned reputation for developing players are Parma, aiming to stabilise in Serie A after a turbulent decade. Undernew head coach Carlos Cuesta– previously an assistant to Mikel Arteta at Arsenal – the club have cast their net wide this summer in search of young talent. Ordoñez, a tough-tackling midfielder, and January recruit Mateo Pellegrino were both signed from Argentinian side Vélez. Pellegrino scored twice in Cuesta’s first game in charge, a Coppa Italia win over Pescara, while Ordoñez has the ball-winning skills to make a big impact on Serie A midfields. Having flashed up on Manchester United’s radar, Ordoñez is happy to join a club “where so many important Argentinian players made history”. He and Pellegrino could quickly join that list.View image in fullscreenParma’s Christian Ordoñez has the presence and ability to make an impact in Serie A.Photograph: Cristiano Barni/Alamy9Carlos Soler (PSG to Real Sociedad, £6.9m)Not every good-value transfer involves an unfamiliar name on an upward trajectory. Soler would once have fit those criteria, but his career stalled after leaving hometown club Valencia for PSG’s crowded midfield engine room. He made 50 league appearances in Paris, but only played the full 90 minutes six times, and a season atWest Ham on loansaw him fall into a similar bit-part role. Real Sociedad’s deadline-day move is therefore something of a gamble, but the Anoeta seems an ideal location for Soler to rediscover his best form. Back in La Liga, where he made 182 appearances in his first stint, his flexibility and work ethic will be useful to a team rebuilding under new manager Sergio Francisco. If so, fans can thank former midfield star Mikel Merino, who encouraged the move in a phone call with Soler last week.10Nikola Stulic (Charleroi to Lecce, £4.3m)When a key player is snapped up by a bigger club, some teams prefer a like-for-like replacement. That appears to be the case at Lecce, who have signed Serbian striker Nikola Stulic as the successor to Nikola Krstovic, the Montenegrin forward who has joined Atalanta. Krstovic (Red Star) and Stulic (Partizan) both developed at a Belgrade giant, and both took a sidestep on their way toSerie A. While Krstovic found his scoring touch at Slovakian side Dunajska Streda, Stulic bagged a goal every other game with Charleroi last season. There’s no guarantee that Stulic will keep following his predecessor’s path, but the bargain fee reduces any risk. If Krstovic is a hit in Bergamo, Lecce’s 10% sell-on fee might well cover the cost of signing Stulic entirely.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowPremier LeagueLigue 1Serie ABundesligaEuropean club footballLa LigafeaturesShareReuse this content",

You gotta do it better than your opponent, so we were fortunate to do that. So it’s, it’s good to be part of it. I tried to do what I could to help them, but look, I didn’t make any blocks, tackles, catches, runs or anything else out there.”UNC’s win wasn’t all that impressive against a huge underdog in Charlotte, and there is certainly plenty of room for improvement, particularly on offense where the Tar Heels scored on their first possession only to go into an offensive funk for the second time in six days.The only difference in Week 2 is they were able to get away it because Charlotte’s offense had nothing to threaten the Tar Heels. It was a win that helped heal some wounds from Belichick’s debut on Monday night, whichended in an embarrassing 48-14 loss to TCUin front of a who’s who or North Carolina sports alumni including Michael Jordan, Lawrence Taylor and Mia Hamm, as well as a curious national television audience.“It was clear in the locker room and as we got out on the practice field there was a ... higher level of determination and commitment,” Belichick said. “That was good to see us improve.”Belichick spent the short week in the headlines – first drawing criticism for the loss after the school gave him a five-year, $50m contract to turn the program around, and secondly for his decision to ban a Patriots scout from the team’s campus in Chapel Hill.Belichick spent 24 mostly highly successful seasons with the Patriots, where he teamed with Tom Brady to reach the Super Bowl nine times, winning it all six times.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballNew England PatriotsCollege sportsUS sportsNFLnewsShareReuse this content",

She believed she had done all the work necessary, harnessing successfully her once uncontrollable power into consistent excellence. After overcoming so many hurdles en route to becoming the best player in the world, she felt ready for anything. Sabalenka was convinced she could handle any challenge that came her way.It was not until herexcruciating French Open final defeatagainst Coco Gauff that Sabalenka understood this was not true. As she struggled with her nerves under such significant pressure and punishing windy conditions, the 27-year-old was outplayed by a tireless, gutsier opponent in Gauff who broke her down by forcing her to work hard for every single point.In the days after that defeat, as the discourse continued over her subsequent unsporting remarks during her press conference, Sabalenka travelled to Mykonos, Greece with her boyfriend, Georgios. She used the brief break to drink tequila, disconnect from tennis and let off steam, but Sabalenka dedicated much of her time to pondering her next steps. After her Australian Open final defeat by Madison Keys, Sabalenka had believed it was important to just move on from that match. Her performance in Paris, however, meant alarm bells were ringing in her head.Sorry, purists: the Coachella-fication of the US Open is here to stay | Bryan Armen GrahamRead more“I was in Mykonos, reading my book, enjoying the view,” she said, laughing. “And I was just thinking: ‘Why would I let my emotions take control over me in those two finals?’ It felt like: ‘OK, if I made it to the final, it means that I’m going to win it.’ And I sort of didn’t expect players to come out there and to fight. I thought that everything was going to go my way easily, which was completely the wrong mindset.”This season has been a lesson in humility, showing Sabalenka there is always room for improvement and the work is never finished. She had unlocked so much from her game and achieved so much already, performing at the highest level week in, week out with few significant dips, but that did not mean everything would come easily for her.Those lessons were all on show on Saturday as Sabalenka held off one of the few players capable of overpowering her from the baseline. She kept her nerve in the tense final moments,defeating Amanda Anisimova6-3, 7-6 (3) to defend her US Open title and win her fourth grand slam title.“Going into this final I decided for myself that I’m going to control my emotions,” Sabalenka said. “I’m not going to let them take control over me, and it doesn’t matter what happens in the match. If she breaks me back or if she plays incredible tennis – of course, it’s a final, and she’s going to be fighting.”View image in fullscreenThis season has been a lesson in humility for Aryna Sabalenka, who lost to Coco Gauff at the French Open.Photograph: Adam Hunger/APWith every new triumph, it is hard not to think of what Sabalenka’s game looked like when she arrived on the tour. She started her career bashing every ball as hard as possible with barely a thought in her mind. She has since worked herself into one of the most consistent big tournament players of the past decade apart from Serena Williams. Sabalenka has now reached the semi-final or better in 11 of her past 12 grand slam tournaments, the only anomaly being a quarter-final defeat at the French Open last year when she was visibly struggling with food poisoning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her next challenge is toproduce similar results at Wimbledonand the French Open. Although Sabalenka has shown herself to be an all-court player, and her impressive improvements on clay were underscored by her run to the French Open final this year, she has won all four of her major titles on hard courts; 18 of her 21 titles overall have also come on hard courts.At 27 years old, Sabalenka is at her physical peak and she continues to give herself title-winning opportunities at nearly every grand slam she enters. If she continues to approach them as she did in New York, having the humility to accept the talents of her opponents while calmly searching for solutions, there will be more victories to come.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Aryna SabalenkaUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content",

The world No 2 completed the career grand slam with his triumph at Augusta in April, and on Sunday he added to that by winning his home open for the second time with a thrilling playoff victory against Joakim Lagergren.McIlroy had to eagle the 72nd hole just to take it to a playoff after Lagergren’s own stunning eagle at the 16th. After the first two extra holes were tied in birdie fours, Lagergren found the water hazard third time around to allow McIlroy to win it with two putts.Ryder Cup team should copy Djokovic when dealing with American hostility, says McIlroyRead moreMcIlroy, who also triumphed in this event at the same venue in 2016, said: “I just feel so lucky that I get to do this in front of these people. The support has been amazing all week. So happy I could play the way I did this week and get the win.“I had a putt last year at [Royal County Down] to force a playoff with Rasmus [Højgaard] and it just missed on the high side, so it felt like [the eagle at the 18th] was a little bit of redemption. I wanted to be aggressive with it – such a cool feeling, cool moment for that to go in, and that gave me a chance in the playoff.“It just felt like it was who was going to blink first. Joakim hit a poor second shot on that playoff hole and that opened the door for me, and I’m just so happy to win my second Irish Open.”With the Ryder Cup to come at Bethpage this month, McIlroy said: “To do what I did earlier in the year and then to come home and win my national open, no matter what happens for the rest of the year, that’s a pretty cool year – 2025’s going to be one of the best, if not the best, of my career.“But we’re not finished yet, I’ve got a big week next week at Wentworth [the BMW PGA Championship] and then obviously everybody’s looking forward to the Ryder Cup.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the second and third games, better goal-kicking would have helped. But for five missed conversions, Samoa would have been beaten 70-0. As it turned out, that still would not have been enough, but missed kicks also cost the US victory against Australia in round two,a 31-31 tiethat will go down as a World Cup classic but also a missed chance for a historic American win.After the Samoa game Zackary, the USA captain, said: “We put our whole hearts on the line and that’s all I can ask for. So wherever the chips fall, they’ll fall how they will, and we’ll just pick up the pieces.”It was true that the Eagles put it all on the line – their own line, in Zackary’s case, theEalingTrailfinders flanker pulling off a fine last-ditch tackle to deny Samoa what would have been an immensely popular, and thoroughly deserved, first try of the tournament.The Eagles’ coach, Sione Fukofuka, said after the Samoa game: “We rise and fall as a team, so we’ll watch [England v Australia] together, and obviously, first time ever, I think, cheering on the English team and hoping for the best.”The best didn’t materialize but Fukofuka’s post-tournament review should include glowing words for a number of younger players who should be around for the next World Cup, in Australia four years from now.Chief among them isFreda Tafuna, a phenomenally pacey and powerful flanker who is not only just 22 but is still a student, at Lindenwood in Missouri.College player of the yeartwo years running, she now has six World Cup tries – two against Australia, four against Samoa – and two player-of-the-match awards.“All glory to God,” Tafuna said on Saturday. “Shout out to the girls, my family and my friends back home, and just thank you to the crowd. You guys are the best.”Before the game, the Guardianspoke to Erica Jarrell-Searcy, the dynamic Eagles lock who ended up scoring a try in each World Cup game – a stunning sprint from 40 meters against England, a short-range plunge against Australia, a 20m run-in against Samoa – to emerge as a tournament star.“Freda’s a mutant,” Jarrell-Searcy laughed, reaching for a term of highest-possible praise among rugby forwards everywhere. “Oh, she’s so cool.”After graduation, it would appear likely Tafuna will follow Jarrell-Searcy to England, where the lock plays for Sale Sharks. Herself not long out of Harvard – like thescrum-half Cass Bargell, another to shine in England – Jarrell-Searcy sees college as a source of future strength.View image in fullscreenErica Jarrell-Searcy made a big impression at this year’s World Cup.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images“The college game is some of the best-resourced rugby you can play as a young American athlete,” she said. “I don’t think you could possibly overstate the role of the college game as a feeder for American rugby right now, and then withWomen’s Elite Rugby[the new semi-professional domestic league] hopefully taking root, it’s all growing.“I think the future of this group, and the next cycle especially, is very bright. Watching Harvard every weekend, I never would have played on the team they’ve got now. The girls they can recruit, on their first day of college they are better than some senior players now. I mean, just look atSariah Ibarra.”From Southern California, partly shaped in New Zealand, the full-back in fact bypassed the college game to sign a contract with USA Sevens, to chase Olympic gold.“She’s 19, tearing it up,” Jarrell-Searcy said, of Ibarra’s excursion into 15s. “The second we saw her in camp, we knew she was special, and she’s part of a generation that are all special. So yeah, it’s going to be a really cool couple years.”It will be a less cool couple of days for the Eagles, as they pack and prepare to fly home. But there was consolation in full view immediately after the game on Saturday, as the Americans and Samoans gathered on the field to embrace, laugh, dance and sing – a hymn, led by the Samoans, addressed in gratitude to a grateful crowd.Such expressions of sheer joy in rugby and its traditions have been a prominent part of this World Cup, opponents showing delight in each other, in challenges posed and met, in hard play in front of unprecedented crowds and media attention for a game built on respect and support.“Joy has been a big theme for us,” Jarrell-Searcy said, of an Eagles squad containing Ilona Maher, theexuberant social media superstarwhose credo – “Beast, Beauty, Brains” – has been on full display.Jarrell-Searcy continued: “Charles Dudley, our strength and conditioning coach, he has this graph where it’s kind of for him to tell us how much the week is gonna suck. We got to this week, it was the peak of the peak on the graph.“We’re, like, dipping into this red zone where you might start to pick up little injuries, because we’re working so hard. We know that, and we’re prepared for that, but … I think also we were sort of like synced-up in our menstrual cycles in a way that was not helpful to also be at the peak of the peak.“So there’s tears and frustration, and just like the absolute pits. And I sat withMel Bosman, our forwards coach, at breakfast, and I pulled up this picture … when we were at a captain’s run making a TikTok with Lo [Maher] and the photographers were there, and they took a picture of us, like, huddling around Lo’s phone. And we’re tight, and we’re leaning in and we’re grinning, just trying to figure out how to get this TikTok done right.“And I was like, ‘Imagine if this huddle wasn’t about, you know, a silly, inconsequential TikTok. Imagine if that was a high-performance huddle, and we’re focusing on, you know, a dropped ball, a play that didn’t go right, and we’re gonna get it right, and we’re excited about getting it right, we’re not frustrated about getting it wrong.“And Mel was like, ‘That’s so important.’ You know, obviously from herexperiencewith the [New Zealand] Black Ferns, she knows about that sisterhood and how motivating it can be to express yourself and not necessarily be constantly trying to avoid failure, but actually seeking success. And we’ve brought joy, ever since then.“Our end-of-the-week units training has been, anybody who’s not in, because we have injuries here and there, dragging a speaker up and down the line-out, whatever disruptive music they can, like, absolute not-safe-for-work music. We had pool noodles one time, we were throwing tackle pads in the air. Would you believe some of our best attack and line-out drill has come out of those joyful experiences?“So yeah, joy, and especially feminine joy, I think it’s a non-zero part of this World Cup – as an athlete and as a fan.”Martin Pengelly writes on Substack atThe National Maul, on rugby in the USExplore more on these topicsUSA women's rugby union teamWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025Women's rugby unionUS sportsRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content",

The England manager, whose team face Serbia in Belgrade on Tuesday in their toughest assignment of qualification, talked last week of wanting to streamline and simplify his approach. Tuchel is coming to terms with the realities of international football and the limited amount of time he has with the players. He has worked to instil short-passing patterns but, as he reflected on how some old‑fashioned qualities were making a comeback, he declared being open to adding a more unreconstructed dimension.England got both of their goals from lofted crosses on Saturday in the2-0 victory against Andorraat Villa Park. The first cross was ­deli­vered from an inside-right ­position by Noni Madueke and led to an own goal from Christian Garcia. The ­second was from a much wider ­position on the same flank. It was sent over by Reece James and headed home by Declan Rice.Watching Andorra: like a month made up entirely of Tuesday afternoons | Barney RonayRead more“The last one was more classic than the first one,” Tuchel said. “The last one was from the sideline, with the right foot to the second post and our No 10 arrived – Declan. I tell you the long throw-in is back, as well.“Once we arrive at the World Cup, all these things matter so we will also talk about long throw-ins, we will talk about long kicks from the goalkeeper and not only playing short. We cannot put everything into four days of training but these things will matter. Let’s see. I need to reflect with my assistant coaches. All these patterns are back and crosses are back, as well.”Tuchel anticipates a heated atmosphere againstSerbiaat the Rajko Mitic Stadium and said his players must be prepared for anything and everything – including a dodgy pitch and sending-offs. “We will have to adapt to the adversity and overcome adversity and let’s see what the pitch is like … how the game plays out,” Tuchel said.“You never know. You can have red cards, yellow cards, whatever. We need to be ready for everything. We will face the same formation as againstAndorra– the defensive block of 5-4-1 with individual quality up front with tall physical strikers.”Tuchel was asked specifically about the playing surface. Had it been flagged as a possible concern? “Not yet,” he said with a knowing smile. “We expect … we are ready for everything. We feel that we are ready to step up to the atmosphere, the physicality, and it will be an emotional, very important game in the group.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel said after England’s win against Andorra: ‘Once we arrive at the World Cup, we will talk about long throw-ins, long kicks and not only playing short.’Photograph: Nick Potts/PA“The main thing is that I trust the players because I felt them very strong this week. We’ve had an excellent camp. I felt the energy right, the attitude right, and that’s why I have full trust that we will have a good game in Serbia. We will prove ourselves to be ready to win there.”Tuchel’s players have been warned by the Football Association to be aware of hostility from the stands that crosses a line and also the reactive protocols open to them, which include walking off the pitch. In 2012, England’s black players were subjected to racist abuse in an under-21s game in Serbia, and last year Serbia were hit with partial ground closures by Uefa over supporter behaviour in the Nations League.The stadium will again be partially closed on Tuesday, this time on Fifa orders after racist behaviour by some Serbia fans during the 3-0 home win against Andorra in June. At least 15% of the capacity behind the goals will be empty. Since 2021, the Serbia Football Federation has been fined €703,375 for offences of their fans, including acts of discrimination.“I’d say we’re very aware of maybe some of the challenges that we may face out there,” the midfielder ­Eberechi Eze said. “It’s something that internally we’ll decide and have conversations about.”The Serbian federation has reite­rated a plea for good behaviour. “Because we are under Uefa and Fifa scrutiny and because of the history of various incidents that have made us the subject of disciplinary measures, we appeal to supporters to send out an image to the world that will make us all proud,” it said in a statementTuchel has a potential selection issue in central defence after Marc Guéhi reported discomfort in his groin at half-time against Andorra. The Crystal Palace captain carried on until the 76th minute before he was replaced with Aston Villa’s Ezri Konsa, the fourth substitution of the permitted five. Tuchel said he wanted to introduce another Villa player, Ollie Watkins, for Harry Kane up front but the Guéhi situation altered his thinking. Kane stayed on for 90 minutes.“I wanted to put Ollie on as it’s Villa Park and for sure his family was there. I was a bit unhappy with that,” Tuchel said. “We lost already John Stones [who withdrew from the squad with an injury] and I was not ready to take the risk. Ezri is also a Villa player so we had that. It turned out that Harry stayed on; it’s never a problem. He will be ready for Tuesday.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersThomas TuchelSerbiaAndorraShareReuse this content",

Germany came into the contest reeling from Thursday’s shock2-0 defeat in Slovakia, their third consecutive defeat leading to stinging criticism of Nagelsmann in the German press.They quickly set about dominating the ball in the early stages and took a seventh-minute lead through Gnabry, Northern Ireland’s nemesis six years ago when he scored a hat-trick in a 6-1 win in Frankfurt. After Eoin Toal lost the ball, Nick Woltemade quickly played in Gnabry, who barged his way past Justin Devenny before lifting the ball over the goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell.Newcastle’snew striker Woltemadehad a couple of opportunities himself as the one-way traffic continued, with Northern Ireland in danger of getting overrun. Instead the response was excellent.Price’s quick feet forced Antonio Rüdiger into a cynical block which earned the Real Madrid man a yellow card. It also shifted the dynamic. Paddy McNair headed over from Devenny’s corner before Price nicked the ball away from Rüdiger to spark another attack.That one ended with a second corner, again sent in by Devenny and met superbly on the volley by Price at the far post, levelling the scores with his eighth Northern Ireland goal in his past nine appearances, and 10th overall at the age of just 21.Germanysuddenly looked nervous as Northern Ireland found fresh energy, and half-time was greeted with shrill whistles from the frustrated home support.Germany did not look any more settled to start the second half. Goalkeeper Oliver Baumann flapped at another Devenny corner and it took a good 10 minutes before the hosts started to exert any control, with Jamie Leweling firing wide from distance.Peacock-Farrell then made a double save, keeping out David Raum’s shot from the edge of the area, then kicking clear Pascal Gross’s strike on the rebound. Moments later, Waldemar Anton headed over from a free-kick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Raum swept the ball forward from deep both Peacock-Farrell and Toal followed the run of Maximilian Beier and waited for the other to deal with it, but instead the ball ran for fellow substitute Amiri to tap into an empty net.All of Northern Ireland’s hard work was coming undone, and just four minutes later Wirtz – largely anonymous for much of the night – thumped in an excellent free-kick to put the game out of Northern Ireland’s reach.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersGermanyNorthern Irelandmatch reportsShareReuse this content",

But Lithuania then scored twice in the space of seven minutes to level the score by half-time. First a mazy run from inside his own half by the home captain, Justas Lasickas, drew the Dutch defence and set up Gvidas Gineitis for a 36th-minute goal.

Her player of the match performance guided the Toffees to a 4-1 victory as Brian Sørensen’s side made it six wins from six at Anfield.It was an unforgettable afternoon for the young Spanish forward who arrived at Goodison Park this summer from Granada. With her three goals she became the first Everton player, men’s or women’s, to score a hat-trick against Liverpool since Dixie Dean in 1931.Ho’s Tottenham up and running as England penalty sinks West HamRead more“Maybe not three,” Sørensen said with a laugh when asked if he had been expecting that performance from his new recruit. “I expected her to score; that’s why I started her. She was superb … I said to her that this is the benchmark for what I want to see.”It was a difficult afternoon for Liver­pool and their manager, Gareth Taylor, who was taking charge of the side for the first time. They would have hoped a new face in the dugout could help to change their fortunes in this historic fixture,with a winless run now extended to eight games.The weather reflected the mood on what turned out to be a miserable opening afternoon for the hosts. In torrential rain, Liverpool failed to capitalise on their first-half dominance against a team that added depth and quality over the summer.While Sørensen has been able to profit from an increase in funds from The Friedkin Group, there has been little investment for Liverpool despite the high-profile sale of theirCanadian star Olivia Smith. There may have been a few rueful glances towards the Emirates Stadium on Saturday as their former winger illustrated exactly why ­Arsenal had splashed the cash for the 21-year-old, with Smith scoring on debut in the4-1 win against London City Lionesses.Quick GuideWSL roundupShowWSL roundupManchester United 4-0 LeicesterElla Toone wasted little time getting her season up and running, scoring after 13 minutes as Manchester United eased to a routine 4-0 win over Leicester.

The full-back Lily Woodham was handed her debut, while Sam Kerr featured in midfield having made her move to the club permanent after a successful loan spell from Bayern.In contrast, Sørensen named six of his new players in his lineup. The central defender Rion Ishikawa added significant presence to the backline.

Breaking on to Marie Höbinger’s pass, Kapocs cut in from the left before sending a fierce effort in off the underside of the crossbar.A brilliant fingertip save from Courtney Brosnan to deny Gemma Bonner kept Everton in touch and, despite their inability to control the ball, they turned the game around.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In contrast, Everton proved clinical once again on the stroke of half-time. Maz Pacheco produced a pinpoint delivery from the left that sat perfectly on Katja Snoeijs’s head. Kirby got fingers to it but was unable to keep the ball from nestling in the net.Everton rang the changes at the break with Sørensen turning to his tried and tested personnel Karen ­Holmgaard and Clare Wheeler, while also handing Ruby Mace her debut. They began to find more joy in possession, controlling the ball and pressing Liverpool back.Vignola scored two goals in two minutes: the first was a thumping header off another Pacheco cross before the Spaniard then fired home with a deflected low finish.The manner of their comeback after falling behind to an early Kapocs goal was pleasing for the Everton mana­ger. “I thought we were terrible the first 30, almost 40 minutes,” he told Sky Sports. “Everything was just off. I don’t know why. Then in the final 10 minutes [of the first half], we started to look more like ourselves. We made the three subs [at half‑time] … and it paid off.

They were a shadow of themselves. Seeing them today now, it’s a totally different team in terms of the confidence, the belief, the energy and the enthusiasm.”Ho’s new side had controlled more of the possession and had plenty of the ball in the final third, offering them some cause for optimism long‑term, but what they were initially lacking on Sunday was that spark of creativity and a decisive ball inside the West Ham penalty area.In terms of generating opportunities to test the goalkeeper, similar could be said of West Ham, although they missed a big chance when Seraina Piubel volleyed out at the back post, just moments into the second half.There was a blow for West Ham when their starting goalkeeper Kinga Szemik, who played for Poland at Euro 2025 this summer, had to be withdrawn with what looked like an ankle injury, after landing awkwardly when she did well to keep out a deep cross from Drew Spence that had looked destined to drop inside the far post.Szemik hobbled off with help from two members of West Ham’s physio team, and she was replaced by Megan Walsh, who got a hand to England’s penalty kick half an hour later but could not quite keep it out.View image in fullscreenMartin Ho congratulates Lize Kop after the final whistle.Photograph: Maja Hitij/WSL/WSL Football/Getty Images“Overall, I thought we played really well, stuck to the gameplan and exploited their right-hand side,” the West Ham manager, Rehanne Skinner, said. “We created good opportunities. I don’t think our final ball was as good as it could have been in the first half, but we’ve limited them [Spurs] to one shot on target, which comes from the penalty spot, so by the nature of it, it’s disappointing to not get something out of the game on that basis.”A winning start for Tottenham will feel priceless, after a disappointing campaign last season in which they finished 11th. Their key summer decision was to choose Ho to try to start a new era. It is understoodSpurs were blown awayby the passion he showed in his interview presentation, which one source said was so detailed and thorough that Ho had to be asked politely to stop because time was up. The club wanted a coach who is obsessive and they believe they have found one. They are understood also to have received very strong personal recommendations for the former Manchester United assistant coach, including a glowing character reference from the former United manager Casey Stoney.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the match he praised his team’s character, saying: “The grit, the determination, the willingness; you could see how hard they wanted that result.“That’s what got us over the line, that little bit of edge we had over them. The conviction in how we defended, and how aggressive we wanted to be. I thought they were trying to do the right things.

Thomas Tuchel had decided to take the players away for a week of warm-weather training and in the background for Eze was the drumbeat of speculation.Tuchel prepares to change tactics in pursuit of England World Cup gloryRead moreHe had finished the season as arguably the most in-form player in the English game, the cherry on top of a free-scoring run being his winner in the FA Cup final against Manchester City. It helped Palace to secure the first major trophy in the club’s history and cemented his status as a legend at Selhurst Park.Everybody knew what the months ahead promised – a starring role for Eze in the soap opera that is the transfer window but he had his coping strategy at hand. “For me, it’s fairly easy,” he told a small group of newspaper reporters. “Just spend a lot less time on social media looking at what people are talking about and focus on what is going on now.View image in fullscreenEze takes on Dominik Szoboszlai during his Arsenal debut at Anfield.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPA“I speak to my family and the people around me and I try to keep a tight bubble around me because I also know how exposure to those types of things can affect you. They will take care of themselves later on.”Live in the moment. Stay firmly within it. Eze sees it as his maxim. Never was it more apparent than when the Arsenal move was sealed andhe was presented on the Emirates Stadium pitchbefore the club’s Premier League game against Leeds on 23 August.It was genuinely beautiful, so emotional; the connection between the crowd and Eze electric because everyone knows the story – how he supportedArsenalas a boy and signed for their academy only to be released as a 13-year-old, a decision that devastated him. Now he was back and he looked determined to savour every second of the little stroll, not to rush it as he held the badge on his Arsenal shirt and blew kisses to the fans.“I was trying to [savour it] because as you know, you have that moment and then that it’s – gone,” Eze says. Did everything flash before his eyes? “Honestly, not really. I was just there, looking at the crowd and watching everything happen. It was a cool moment – more for my family, seeing what it meant to them. I think that’s the special thing for me. For me now, I’m just excited to play. There’s been a lot of noise off the pitch. I just want to get down and play.”The strange thing for Eze was that he was only used as a 70th-minute substitute inArsenal’s next match at Liverpool; he was unable to get anything going. And the same was true of his performance from the start inEngland’s 2-0 win against Andorraat Villa Park on Saturday.With Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and Phil Foden unavailable because of injury, it was an opportunity for Eze in a central attacking midfield role; the brief, in his words, to play “as high and as close to the last line as possible.” Tuchel started him ahead of Morgan Rogers and Morgan Gibbs-White; the options in the department are extensive.Eze sent an early half-chance straight at the goalkeeper and another one was cleared from in front of the line by a defender. In the second half, when teed up by Noni Madueke, it was noticeable that he wanted to take a touch, which slowed him up, rather than shoot first-time. Again, it was too close to the goalkeeper. Moments later, he blazed over the crossbar from a Marcus Rashford cut-back. An offside flag from the buildup spared his blushes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What is clear is that Eze will remain unflappable, moving on quickly from Andorra, never getting too far ahead of himself.View image in fullscreenEze with the FA Cup Crystal Palace won with his goal.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersThe summer has given Eze a boost and how he has the tales to tell, even if some must remain for private audiences, such as one about the phone call he made to the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, after Tottenham had agreed a deal for him. “Nope, I can’t tell you about that,” Eze says, with a smile.There was the street art mural of him that appeared outside the Emirates Stadium and which was promptly defaced by a Spurs fan with white paint. The signing interview with Ian Wright. The welcome video message from Thierry Henry.“It is special,” Eze says. “It’s not everyone that gets to experience these types of moments but I try to enjoy it and take it in my stride because there’s always something that is coming – another opportunity and challenge.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersArsenalCrystal PalacefeaturesShareReuse this content",

But I doubt it.Ten months before the epic landscapes of World Cup USA 2026, the Day of the Jackal seems a pretty good cinematic model for the missionThomas Tuchelis facing. As England trundle through the familiar autumn rhythms of a tournament preamble, it is probably time for some real talk about thesui generisone-shot task the Football Association has devised for its head coach.It is of course still necessary to take a view onAndorra at homeand the more urgent test of Serbia away on Tuesday night, because they are happening now, because this is content and the football brain demands its chemical hit.But Andorra was dull.Senegal at homeand Andorra away were poor. We know how this works, the background throb of social media, radio chat, England angst channelled reflexively into dark talk about progress, signs, culture, finding your best team.Tuchel prepares to change tactics in pursuit of England World Cup gloryRead moreAt which point it is also necessary to take a step back from these well-grooved anxieties, because the task at hand is also very different this time. First because the goal that has been set for Tuchel – win the World Cup or die – is both absurd and bracingly aspirational. England have a good team. Reaching a final is possible, because finals have been reached before. Why not try something different now, crank the lever to 11, apply a little wild short-term pressure?But it is also important to accept that this changes what needs to happen now. We can already say with some clarity the success or failure of the Tuchel project is likely be defined by a single passage of football, half an hour in New Jersey or San Francisco next summer. The mission is agreeably stark: can you beat Spain, France or similar in a knockout game? Can you find that moment, the mid-match tactical rejig, clarity under pressure?A game of walking-football in early autumn has always been an entirely separate thing to the sharp end of a tournament, at best a chance to finesse and think about the future. It is now entirely irrelevant. For the first time being England manager is overtly not about making something. Tuchel is not president of the republic, out there building a culture. He is instead the Jackal. The mission is a one-off hit, a headshot from the balcony, using only the tools within his reach.Understanding the nature of that mission is key at this stage, for Tuchel himself, but also for those on the sidelines. We are hardwired to look always for wider progress. Recent history tells us World Cups are won by building things. The French academy system. The German academy system. Argentinian genius-ball. We remember the Gareth days, which were all culture, the sense that a kindly anteater in a waistcoat is going to repoint your entire house even if it kills him in the process. As far back as the Graham Taylor era there was a sense of trying to express some half-understood form of Englishness, a benevolent nativism, like trying to cure knife crime with trolleybuses and Morris dancing.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel’s job is to find tactical hacks for when England are playing a totally different kind of game to that against Andorra.Photograph: Dave Shopland/APTuchel is being asked to do the exact opposite. Building a culture, finding an entirely un-English form of self-expression against the nihilism-ball of Andorra. This is a distraction. The job is to find tactical hacks for when England are playing a totally different kind of game, when the ball has suddenly disappeared, the midfield been suffocated, when victory is about shifting the energy against a better team.It is vital to know what the Tuchel era is not. Do not build a team in your own image. What’s the point? There’s a team already there. England managers always need a thing, a gimmick. Don’t have one of these. There isn’t time. Don’t experiment too much or reach too high. It was perhaps a good thing Tuchel was missing six key players against Andorra, players who will be vital to the actual test, the high‑end stuff next July. The fix, if there is to be a fix, will be the simplest, shortest route, uncluttered by more complex notions of team building.No doubt Tuchel himself appreciates this. Although before Andorra there were still some slightly worrying noises. What, for example, is this?“We tried to give solutions in the first two camps through the structure. We played different structures in the buildup and put players in new positions. Maybe I underestimated the effect that it has. Maybe we translated it a little too much from club football and we need to take a step back to speed up our game with a bit more freedom and less changes within the structure. Maybe the solution comes from running more, from more energy than the structure.”No, Thomas. Just no. This is all valid, complex, finely tuned chat. But it’s also culture stuff. It’s anti‑clarity at this stage. This is macro-management, not the one‑shot killer with a mercury bullet in his Zimmer frame. You don’t ask the Jackal to explore the mechanics for democratic change. And if you did the Jackal would become distracted, would lose his sniper sight case on the bus. You ask him for one clean shot and leave the future to other people.Tuchel said other culture-based things. He questioned whether England’s players actually loved or just liked representing the national team. Do you really want to open that box, to unravel those unravellable feelings? Remember Gary Cooper. The problem with Gary Cooper? They got him in touch with his feelings. In the end they couldn’t shut him up. Eleven months. Four proper games. We don’t have time for resets, for anything more than target practice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And Tuesday night does at least present something more urgent, at this stage the most useful pre‑World Cup assignment of the entire Tuchel project.The only other games in the book right now are Wales at home, Latvia away, Serbia at home and Albania away. There will be friendlies in the new year, but no high-grade tactical test of the type Tuchel will face when the moment arrives.Arguably the best possible preparation would be to end up in a playoff, to be tested in March in a way that is at least analogous to next summer and the need for winning on the fly, feeling the tactical moment in your body and blood, to borrow from Fabian Hürzeler after Brighton’s comeback against Manchester City last week.Unflappable Eberechi Eze vows to keep living in the momentRead moreWith any luck the Red Star Stadium (now known as the Rajko Mitic Stadium) will be the right kind of hostile. Serbia are good enough to have periods of domination. In an ideal world England would concede first, or struggle with their shape, demand a mid-match rejig.Success at the World Cup is likely to come down, as ever, to the midfield balance, a search for players brave enough to keep the ball in knockout games against elite opponents. Elliot Anderson seems likely to get a chance in Belgrade. He is clearly a calm, technically gifted option. Ideally he too will struggle, battle with the occasion, and give the manager some evidence that he can also overcome this.For now this is the only kind of practice that matters, not another turgid night watching English footballers struggle with the idea of free expression against a low block. Come the day of the Tuchel, the target will be stationary, the mission parameters defined, a one‑off shot from the balcony. Until then everything else is just noise.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld Cup 2026featuresShareReuse this content",

There were one and a half millionAssociationsLoi1901at the last count, which equates to one for every 48 inhabitants, with 60,000 to 70,000 new groups created each year. They constitute an essential part of the fabric of French society, a natural response to every kind of need felt by local communities – except when it comes to organised football.This is odd, considering professionalism was introduced by the French FA as late as 1932 after a decade of hand-wringing and it would have been natural for practitioners of the game to take the matter in their own hands. Yet in France, club ownership at all but the lowest level has always been the preserve of private individuals, local authorities and, a very French trait, businesses that have set up teams for their employees, thefootball corporatiforfootball entreprise, which has its own leagues and federation.Vitesse Arnhem celebrate after reprieve reinstates them into Dutch leagueRead moreWhat is missing from the picture is clubs run and owned by their members, similar to those in Spain, Sweden or Germany; or, more accurately, what was missing until recently when fan groups started to organise themselves in groups ofsocios(the abbreviation ofsociétaires) in order to purchase shares of their clubs.It is too early to speak of a phenomenon sweeping through the French football pyramid as only 10 of them have joined theFédération des Socios de France, which was created in October 2023.If they are still few, their names are etched in French football history. En Avant Guingamp, two-time winners of the French Cup in the 21st century, lead the way with 18,000 paid-up members of their shareholding group,Les Kalons(“kalon” means “heart” in Breton). Three others are now part-owned by their fans:Sochaux-Montbéliard, twice French champions and Uefa Cup semi-finalists;Bastia, Corsica’s most-famed club, Uefa Cup finalists in 1978; and 126-year-oldRouen.View image in fullscreenGuingamp supporters lead the way with 18,000 paid-up members of their shareholding group,Les Kalons.Photograph: Sebastien Salom-Gomis/AFP/Getty ImagesFive of the six others – Nîmes Olympique, Nancy Lorraine, Ajaccio, Metz and Girondins de Bordeaux – are considering allowing supporters to take a stake. The sixth, Saint-Étienne, are on their way in doing so, with the support of club greats Michel Platini and Jean-Michel Larqué. Fans have until 15 September to contribute to a €150,000 (£130,000) fund that will enable them to buy the shares of an anonymous minority stakeholder. Under 16s can join the initiative for €6. There is every indication the target will be met by the deadline date.One thing these historic clubs share – with the exception of Guingamp, a unique case in French football, where a 19,000-capacity stadium is often full in a city of 8,000 – is that they are all facing financial difficulties of such magnitude that some are or were in danger of disappearing altogether.The name Nîmes fans chose for their association is revealing in this regard:Le Collectif Sauvons le Nîmes Olympique. Girondins were relegated to the fourth tier by the French regulator last August. Bastia had fallen even lower in 2017, to the fifth tier, when the new owners, the three Ferrandi brothers, decided to open the shareholding to fans, who had to contribute a minimum of €50 each.Partnering with local companies and the city’s council, now a shareholder in its own right, the 1,800 “popular shareholders” helped rebuild it around a unique cooperative model, putting action in theBastiaiscommunity at the heart of their project. Bastia are now back in Ligue 2. Fans sit on the board, where they hold 20% of the voting rights.Something similar happened in Sochaux, which went in freefall after Peugeot, its historic owner and the largest employer in the region, sold the club it had founded for its workers in 1928 to the Chinese company Ledus in 2015. Eight years later, Sochaux, demoted to the third tier by the regulator, was all but dead. A small group of local businessmen stepped in. Perhaps inspired by the example of Bastia, they decided to call on the fans to contribute to the rebuilding process. Those fans raised the €800,000 that saved the club from liquidation. TheSociochaux, as they call themselves, now number 11,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The newsociosdo not feel that way. They talk about the reality of reconnecting with institutions that had drifted away from them, but also reconnecting with those whom they would otherwise live alongside, but not with, in a fractured society. Mathilde, a 45-year-oldSociochauxtoldLibération: “It is about building something with people who slip a different voting paper in the ballot box. Those spaces are rare.”What is happening is not just a conjunction of one-offs brought on by economical necessity, as was the case with Portsmouth in England or Real Oviedo in Spain. It is a genuine trend, a seed sown in fertile ground, in keeping with the French inclination for collective enterprise, a reason for hope when there is not much of it going around.Explore more on these topicsFootballFrancecommentShareReuse this content",

We trust it massively. Kicking the ball away, we are happy to do that. We are happy to show we have a defensive set and be comfortable without the ball.“Sunts [Sarah Hunter, the ­England defence coach] is passionate about it, she is passionate about the game and she has been a leader for so many years. She has built that into the ­leadership group but particularly myself; I have worked closely with her and we want to take a bit of pride in that. When Sunts speaks, we ­listen. She is really clear with the ­com­munication she has and we trust her massively.”Alex Matthews captained the ­England side against Australia and was also pleased with the nature of the victory. “I think it was how the girls came together,” the No 8 said.“How we had problems to solve, how we were still calm, composed at half-time. We stuck to the game plan and had confidence in each other. We stuck by each other which is what you need in these big tournaments.”View image in fullscreenAlex Matthews captained the England side against Australia.Photograph: Rob Newell/CameraSport/Getty ImagesWhile England are expected to ­welcome back the captain Zoe­Aldcroft from injury for the match against Scotland,they will be ­without Ellie Kildunne. The star full-back was taken from the pitch against the Wallaroos because of concussion and is now in a mandatory 12-day ­stand-down period. The Red Roses have options in regards to stand‑ins at No 15 with Helena ­Rowland and Emma Sing among those in contention.Hunt, who plays with Sing at Gloucester-Hartpury, said: “We have an incredible squad, Emma Sing can step in and is the person who has beaten the most defenders in the PWR [Premiership Women’s Rugby]. We are really blessed with the squad that we have got. We want Els to be OK.

What does any of it mean? A game that might anyway have been considered meaningless by many, the final encounter of an already settled series, was rendered almost absurd by England’s towering margin of victory and the extraordinary, borderline nonsensical fashion in which it was decided.As Jacob Bethell, who marked it with the first century of his professional career, put it: “Very good fun, yeah. Not much else to say.”England, having already lost the series, romped to their fifth-highest total of all time; South Africa, having already won the series, were dismissed for their second lowest score, and the result was the single most one‑sided match in the history of the format, the teams divided in the end by 342 runs.Hundreds from Bethell and Joe Root helped England to post 414 for five, after which a magnificent display with the ball fromJofra Archerbewitched South Africa as all nine wickets – their captain, Temba Bavuma, unable to bat because of a calf strain – fell for just 72. Harry Brook called it “the ultimate performance”; Bavuma surmised that “things went terribly wrong”.England beat South Africa by 342 runs for biggest winning margin in men’s ODI history – as it happenedRead moreEngland scored at least two runs in each of their 50 overs; Archer’s first five overs included three wicket maidens, and by the end of them he had four wickets and had conceded just five. He stayed on for a sixth and a seventh, not wanting to snip the magic thread, returning later for a couple more and those perhaps included his best single delivery of all – to Corbin Bosch, who was a complete irrelevance as the ball whispered sweet nothings to his off-stump on its way past at 93mph – there would be no more breakthroughs.“There are some spells you hardly bowl a bad ball, where every ball you release you’re happy with how it’s landed,” Archer said. “For the most part today was one of those.”Most England players ended the day equally content. In addition to their two centurions Jamie Smith (off 48 balls) and Jos Buttler (32) stood out in scoring precisely 62, and only Ben Duckett – playing his final innings of an intense summer and apparently in need of the rest he has finally been granted – and Brook, who ran himself out for the second time in the series and is probably due some time off as well, looked in anything less than fine touch.As pleased as England would have been with their total, Bethell’s contribution was particularly sweet. They have gone all in on the 21‑year‑old’s talent: just over six weeks before he turns 22 this was his 33rd international innings, his 141st as a senior professional, and if his promise across all formats has always been evident he had clearly been desperate for this affirmation.View image in fullscreenJacob Bethell thrashes the ball away en route to his first century for England.Photograph: Harry Trump/ECB/Getty ImagesAs the ball sped through the covers to carry him to triple figures he ran down the pitch, arms outstretched, and aeroplaned into the arms of Root, celebrating his very first century with someone on route to his 73rd.“I think he’ll score a few more, there’s no doubt about that,” Shukri Conrad, South Africa’s head coach, said. “I first saw Jacob at the Under-19 World Cup [in 2022, when he scored 88 runs off 42 and England won by six wickets]. He put us to the sword in that as well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They had lost five wickets by the time they had scored as many runs as the 19 they gave away in wides.Theirrun of wins against Englandin this format thereby ends on four, England beating them here for the first time since the teams last played a dead-rubber final game in a three‑match series the Proteas had already wrapped up, in Kimberley in February 2023. In that regard there is something of a theme, and South Africa have now lost the last game of their past four one-day international series, in Ireland, Pakistan, Australia and now England. It is just a couple of weeks since they last found themselves 2-0 up with one to play, and on that occasion Australia scored 431 and won by 276.“We were definitely off today and against a top side when you’re not on top of your game you do get exposed,” Conrad said. “A similar thing happened in Australia, a complete aberration. If we’re going to be poor at something we’d rather be poor at games that aren’t clutch games. Not making light of today’s game, it was an embarrassing performance in the field and the batting just followed.”The day started with South Africa dropping Senuran Muthusamy and Lungi Ngidi – Codi Yusuf coming in for a chastening ODI debut – and then they also dropped the quality of their fielding, as well as Smith (inexplicably, by Matthew Breetzke, on 23) and Bethell (puzzlingly, by Nandre Burger, on 44). It was a performance they will want to forget, but a result so bad they may not be allowed to do so.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamJoe RootJofra ArchernewsShareReuse this content",

Hull KR had to work for every inch of a high-octane and often ill-tempered derby win. But the result remains the same: as does the way we arrived at a sixth successive triumph in this game for the Robins.Wigan come roaring back to take derby spoils after St Helens’ rapid startRead moreIn the more crucial moments, and in the fine margins this game often throws up, it was the team wearing red and white who were the stronger and, in this instance, the more clinical when it mattered. That has been the story of their season – and why they have almost two hands clasped on the League Leaders’ Shield.From this point only a mathe­matical miracle will prevent Hull KR from finishing top of Super League for the first time. Having not won a trophy for 40 years before this ­season, the Robins are closing in on two in a matter of months aftersecuring the ­Challenge Cupthis summer. But the one they really want, to complete the treble, is now where their attention turns.Havingcome up short in the grand finallast season, Rovers are ­favourites to go one step further this year. They showed their credentials again here in a derby that was punctuated by big disciplinary moments and just enough flashes of brilliance in attack to hold their fiercest rivals at bay again.“It was tough and we knew it would be,” Willie Peters, theHull KRcoach, said. “We made it tough for ourselves with completion but we knew what FC team would turn up. It wasn’t a great game to watch but we got there in the end. Overall, it was scrappy.” Scrappy is a fair assessment, especially when you consider there were only four points scored by the break.They went the way of Rovers after a fine piece of play led to Noah Booth crossing in the corner, but for the rest of the half the Black and Whites did a good job of holding the Robins at arm’s length. Crucially though, they were unable to take advantage of any of their attacking positions at the other end and against Super League’s best defensive side, that is a recipe for disaster.They continued to apply themselves well after the break and got the try they deserved through Tom Briscoe. But by the time he had crossed, so too had Jack Broadbent and the outstanding Jez Litten for the Robins to make it 14-4 with just minutes remaining. It was, in the end, mere consolation for a Hull side unable to find the winning solution against their rivals.“I’m very frustrated, especially in the first half where we couldn’t seem to get out of our own end,” Cartwright said of his Hull side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First, Hull’s Yusuf Aydin was sent to the sin-bin for a hip drop that could leave him in trouble with the RFL’s disciplinary panel.Hull KR’s captain, Elliot Minchella, then followed him after a ­dangerous tackle on the Hull youngster Lewis Martin before Jordan Rapana was also sent to the sin-bin in the ­closing stages. FC prop Jack Ashworth may yet be cited too after attacking the head of Mikey Lewis, a moment which left Peters unimpressed.“It’s a derby and things can happen, but some of the things out on the field were not part of the derby,” he said. His side rounded off the scoring late on with Tom Davies’s try which assured another derby win and one more step towards more history for a club fast becoming one of the game’s elite sides.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueHull KRHull FCRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content",

By the end of the afternoon, as he rode to his last finish line in central Cardiff, he admitted he was “choking up”.Thomas said: “When you’re a kid, you always have a dream of being part of the big things. Like going to the Olympics and Grand Tours, but the career and the longevity I definitely didn’t expect. That’s definitely not just down to myself, but my family and this team [Ineos Grenadiers, formerly Team Sky].“It’s been a massive part of my life and I’ve got some really good friends and mates there. That’s also key to why I’ve had such a long career.”“G”-fest aside, there was a real race going on, with the Olympic road andtime trial championRemco Evenepoel, winner of the hilltop finish on the Tumble on Saturday, hoping to make up his two-second deficit in the overall standings to the French race leader, Romain Grégoire.View image in fullscreenRomain Grégoire sprays the champagne as he savours his overall victory in the Tour of Britain.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesThose hopes were thwarted, though, first by a herd of cows crossing the road on the moorland climb of Myndd Bedwellte, and later by his status as the most marked rider in the peloton, with the 22-year-old Grégoire hanging on to take the overall win and Olav Kooij sprinting to his third stage win of the race.But, really, the day was about Thomas. In a sport characterised by increasing insularity, he has always encapsulated the air of a club cyclist, selfless teammate, and genial bloke in the pub. Stoic and resilient, there were also some genuine lows during Thomas’s career. With a little more luck, there could have been several more highs.The summer after winning the yellow jersey in Paris, he finishedsecond in the 2019 Tour de Franceto his teammate Egan Bernal, after a winter of celebratory excess. As Bernal took the yellow jersey to Paris, Thomas was asked when he’d realised back‑to-back Tour wins might prove beyond him. “Last November, to be honest,” he deadpanned.In 2023 he led the Giro d’Italia into the final time-trial and was favourite to win but came undone on the climb to Monte Lussari, wherePrimoz Roglic overhauled the Welshmanto win thecorsa rosaby only 14 seconds. “That’s life,” Thomas said. “You don’t always get what you deserve. It’s ups and downs, but it’s how you come back from those downs.”Thomas was distraught but forgot his woes quickly enough to revert to playing the role of loyal friend, offering former BritishCyclingacademy teammate Mark Cavendish an expert lead-out the next afternoon in the Giro’s final stage in Rome.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But to come back from the downs is just as important as those wins.”Looking back, Thomas said he felt that he had been “lucky my whole career, really, with how things have panned out”, adding: “Being able to be in my prime for the home Olympics, finishing here, the fact that the Tour of Britain is in September and I can do it as my last race.

He said his new job description, in a role for which he is expected to be mentored by Dave Brailsford, is “pretty much done”.“As a rider, I have definitely got a lot of knowledge and feel like I can help out the boys, but then there’s also a lot of other stuff behind the scenes that as riders you don’t really see,” Thomas said. “I feel like I’ve got a lot to give.”Explore more on these topicsTour of BritainGeraint ThomasTeam IneosCyclingnewsShareReuse this content",

When stadium monitors showed him saluting as a member of West Point performed The Star-Spangled Banner, a burst of cheers sprang up and was quickly drowned out by boos, at which point the president offered a brief smirk. After the first changeover, he reappeared on the big screen and stayed up there for a while – causing fans to boo even longer until the camera cut away.The USTA’s censorship of Trump dissent at the US Open is cowardly, hypocritical and un-American | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreTrump’s return to the US Open marked his first time at the tournament since 2015, when he was booed after leaving a match between Serena and Venus Williams. Invited to this year’s tournament by Rolex, he sat in a suite next to a winner’s trophy among a welter of cabinet and family members. He arrived more than an hour before the scheduled start of the match and raised a triumphant fist for the cameras.Meanwhile, thousands of fans were left trickling into the match because of the heightened security around the president’s visit. The stadium was not yet at its expected capacity 45 minutes into the match, at which point Carlos Alcaraz already had a 6-2 lead over Jannik Sinner.In a statement, the Secret Service said that protecting the president “required a comprehensive effort” that “may have contributed to delays for attendees.”Trump’s return to the Open is somewhat of a homecoming. He was once a fixture at the tournament, styling himself as a celebrity to dwarf all others from New York or Hollywood. During that time, he was often shown on the big screen and booed.But after he kicked off his 2015 presidential campaign with a fiery announcement speech hitting out at immigrants and foreign allies, the prevailing attitude toward Trump in New York shifted negatively.The reception Trump received from the crowd on Sunday was in marked contrast to the enthusiasm that went up for the match’s other prominent attendees. During a changeover in the second set, the camera cut to Bruce Springsteen, who has been the target of a fusillade of Trump criticism. The crowd cheered deliriously.The US Tennis Association, which organizes the US Open, had emailed broadcastersrequesting reactions to Trump not be shown. Despite that, Trump’s appearance during the anthem was briefly shown on ESPN in the US.A scattering of protestors stood outside the grounds before the match. Among them was Emma Kaplan, a 33-year-old executive assistant from Brooklyn, distributing flyers that read “The Fall of the Trump Fascist Regime.” She was joined by three members of RefuseFascism.org, one hoisting a poster that declared “GAME, SET, MATCH! NOV 5, FLOOD DC. TRUMP MUST GO!”; another’s sign demanded the shutdown of “the whole Trump fascist regime.”Some fans nodded quietly in approval. Others made their opposition clear.“Oh my bad, I voted for him,” one man muttered.Kaplan brushed off the jeers. “Trump has historically been booed here,” she said. “He should be booed everywhere he goes. And on 5 November we’re calling for millions of people to come to Washington DC. They might try to silence our boos, but they can’t silence our rage.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisTennisUS sportsDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content",

Fans don’t just buy in, they perform it: the $23 Honey Deuce held aloft forInstagram, the $40 lobster roll posted before the first serve, the $100 caviar-topped chicken nuggets bought as much for the flex as the flavor. The tennis has never been the cheapest day out, but lately the sticker shock feel less like a barrier than the point. The price tags are festival markers, proof that what was once a tournament with posh accents has morphed into a cultural happening. In what seems like a remarkably short time, New York’s major has become less sporting event than aspirational brand.The USTA’s censorship of Trump dissent at the US Open is cowardly, hypocritical and un-American | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreThe final grand slam tournament of the season, which concludes Sundaywith a mouth-watering men’s finalbetween Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, has never completely shied from its tony roots as part of the New York “social season”, but its latest evolution has taken it past a major sporting event into a festival economy. The sport is still there – highlight-reel shots, lung-busting rallies, after-midnight thrillers – but the real main draw are cocktails priced like small bond issues, influencer blocs in branded bucket hats and a dating show filmed courtside. The spectacle isn’t Sinner’s thunderbolt serve orAryna Sabalenka’s power-baseline game but whether Chloe Malle is Anna Wintour’s plus-one or Kareem Rahma of Subway Takes posts his courtside selfie before or after the Honey Deuce runs dry. That libation, once just a cute themed lemonade and vodka in a souvenir cup, has mutated into aninflation-defyingfetish object with its own merch line. Entire kiosks now sell Honey Deuce shirts and trucker hats in pastel colorways, so you can broadcast your melon-ball allegiance long after the hard-won hangover fades. It’s less a drink than a franchise, an alcoholic Funko Pop, proof that you didn’t just attend the Open: you consumed it, posted it,stacked it, wore it and recycled it into personal branding.View image in fullscreenThe Honey Deuce, once just a cute themed cocktail in a souvenir cup, has mutated into a fetish object with its own merch line. A record-breaking 556,782 of them were sold at last year’s US Open, according to the USTA.Photograph: Ishika Samant/Getty ImagesThe Open, known as the US national championships until 1968, has been staged every year since 1881, but its defining feature over the past decade or so has beensprawl: temporal, spatial, financial and, increasingly, attention-economical. Starting this year, the tournament expanded its footprint by starting on a Sunday rather than Monday, stretching the long-familiar 14-day format into 15, or effectively 20 if you count thecontroversial, purist-rankling mixed doubles eventthe week before. It is no longer just two weeks in late August and September straddling Labor Day, but a near-month-long residency in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, calibrated to command not just your time and money but your feed. The prize fund for this year’s event climbed to an eye-watering $90m (£66.6m), the highest single-event purse in tennis history and a 20% jump from 2024. On the ground the United States Tennis Associaton has gone maximalist, rubber-stamping an $800m renovation of Arthur Ashe Stadium (separate from therecent three-year transformationthat expanded the square-footage of the property). A $250m Player Performance Center is going up alongside it, kitted out to house 2,800 athletes and entourages, all part of the global arms race in sporting infrastructure. Meeting the luxe standard of Wimbledon is no longer enough; the pressure now is keeping up with Indian Wells and Madrid too.‘Hash court’ and high drama: how weed became the US Open’s new distractionRead moreAnd in today’s climate the most significant currency is attention. Once upon a time the US Open existed in the collective imagination for two weeks; now it seeps across August and September, propped up by the USTA’s celebrity program, influencer activations and, yes, its new in-house dating show.Game, Set, Matchmaker– eight couples on first dates filmed around the grounds – is an explicit attempt to hijack the Love Island economy and make tennis trend on YouTube. It may scandalize traditionalists, but it’s entirely of a piece with a tournament that now produces as much reality TV as it does actual reality.Amanda Wight, the USTA’s director of international strategy, marketing and celebrity management, has become the impresario of this circuit. Asoft-focus New York Times profileon Thursday detailed how she grew up in a tiny fishing village in South Australia, yet now knows exactly when Gigi Hadid’s SUV pulls up to the President’s Gate, slips a colored band on her wrist and escorts her past the phalanx of photogs on the blue carpet. In another life she might be curating a DJ lineup in the desert; now she’s booking Olivia Munn and John Mulaney into Ashe and ensuringCoco Gauff’s selfie with Simone Biles makes its way to Instagram. Celebrities don’t simply “drop by” anymore. They are recruited, logged and tracked like assets in a derivatives portfolio. The USTA enlists consultants to measure the engagement value of each famous face: how many posts, how many tags, how many millions of impressions. Those numbers determine whether you get another invite. The Open has built its own influencer exchange, trading futures contracts on Queen Latifah’s Instagram story. If you’ve been wondering why your feeds have become lousy with selfies snapped inside Ashe, often with an obligatory postscript like “thanks @americanexpress” or JPMorgan Chase or Emirates or some random make-up brand, it’s not an accident. From F1 paddocks to NBA front rows, modern sports all court star power. But in New York, the Open has turned it into something close to an art form. At times it feels less like a stop on the tennis tour than an aperitif toFashion Week. The stands double as a runway, the sponsor suites as showrooms.View image in fullscreenThe US Open surpassed one million attendees for the first time in 2024.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesBrands have always hovered around tennis, but now they’ve colonized every space across of the grounds. Rolex maintains its discreet, air-conditioned sanctuary where you can hear Novak Djokovic muttering to himself while politely slicing carrot cake topped with chocolate tennis balls. It feels like a Geneva watch fair disguised as a tennis match, a cool temple of precision where the $300,000 Daytona on a collector’s wrist matters as much as the scoreline. Just a few sections away, Graza Olive Oil commandeers a matrix of lower box seats packed with digital creators, influencers and fashion TikTokers. If Rolex is haute couture, Graza is streetwear – and both are equally stitched into the US Open’s cultural fabric. The levels of service for the VIP and VVIP sets inside Ashe have always caught my attention since my first year covering the Open in 2008 – there have always been different restaurants and hospitality experiences available exclusively to the various tiers of premium ticket holders – but the present-day setup has scaled it to entirely new late-capitalist levels.Serena Williams built her legacy on defiance. Why lend it to Ozempic culture? | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreFrom a labor-studies perspective the irony is stark: ball kids sweating through 10-hour shifts, concession workers hustling food priced like fine dining, facilities staff removing garbage and re-stocking bathrooms, security guards scanning QR codes to keep the economy moving – all so celebrities can glide through a velvet-roped experience and post their carefully staged candids. The festival economy, whether in Coachella’s desert or Flushing Meadows’ heat, runs on the underpaid many serving the overexposed few. Yet sociologically, it’s more complicated. The Open has long prided and marketed itself as the “people’s slam”: No 7 subway rides, raucous night sessions going past 2am, the roar from Ashe echoing down Roosevelt Avenue when a match tips into a fifth set. That energy is still real and palpable, but it is increasingly filtered through fan performance and the ceaseless din of conversation during matches, especially inside the main two stadiums. Attending is no longer just about watching; it is about being seen watching. For a growing subset of fans, that means turning the Open into content. Taylor Fritz’s girlfriend Morgan Riddle, dubbedby the Timesas “the most famous woman in men’s tennis”, has argued that “fangirls” drive the memes and the merch. Tommy Paul’s fiancée, the Dairy Boy founder Paige Lorenze, folds the action into her lifestyle vlogs. They’re not just spectators but producers, treating Ashe as both stadium and studio.View image in fullscreenWhat was once a grand slam with posh accents has morphed into a cultural happening.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesMedia theory would call this the triumph of the attention economy. What the USTA and its sponsors have achieved is a transformation of a two-week tournament into an endlessly scrollable feed. The result is a hybrid of competition and content, where the cutaways toKevin Hart mugging from a suiteor theKylie Jenner-Timothée Chalamet hard launchare as important as the next break point. Anything popular becomes corporatized, as Chris Black, the podcaster and vibe consultant, puts it. The Open is no different.And yet the fans seem to love it. Attendance topped a million for the first time last year. Every person you follow on Instagram or TikTok seems to be there. For all the complaints about how grounds passes used to cost $60 (not that long ago), or how tickets are directly siphoned to the resale market and never hit the box office at face value (unconfirmed but probably true), and broader carping about how the regular fan is getting priced out, the uncomfortable truth is that admission could probably be even more expensive and the place would still sell out. We normies complain about the influencer zoo, then double-tap its highlights. It’s the same contradiction that keepsCoachellaoversold and Art Basel hashtagged within an inch of its life. In that sense the Open is both groundbreaker and windsock: it’s setting the tone for how sport can be repackaged as culture while also reflecting the social economy we already live in.So is itbad? From one angle, yes: the commodification of everything, from caviar-flecked poultry to celebrity cameos, can be seen as crass or even obscene. But from another, it is simply the way we live now. Tennis is not immune to the elemental logics of virality, and if the price of cultural relevance is a $23 cocktail, a marked-up hoodie, a dating show onYouTubeand a 20-day schedule, that may be the collateral of a deal we’ve already entered long ago. The ball is still in play, but somewhere between Queens and Indio, the US Open has become a festival of its own: less about forehands and backhands than about selfies, sponsorships and sprawl.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025New YorkTennisUS Open tennisUS sportsCoco GauffAryna SabalenkafeaturesShareReuse this content",

Firstly, she’s the Mother Teresa of Aussie supermarkets. Secondly, I don’t know anything about her personally because this savvy queen doesn’t market herself like your average influencer. She lets her work speak for itself.The work in question? Weekly uploads of POV-style videos where Tennille meticulously goes through major supermarkets to show you what’s on special that week. Her soothing voice and steady hand shepherds you through a sea of yellow price tags. It’s detailed work, considerate and necessary.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

Wednesday was even more special – that’s Aldi catalogue day, and nothing can rival the feeling of a niche European snack or a new power-cleaning tool with a 75% discount.For me, looking through a supermarket catalogue produces a frisson I’ve only ever experienced while scouring the Royal Easter Show showbag booklet as a child of the early 2000s. The excitement I would feel running my finger over each lolly listed in the $15 (slightly offensively named) Mega Sumo Bag. The burden picking between Wonka or Wizz Fizz because I knew my mum wouldn’t let me get both. A supermarket catalogue offers the same thrill: an anticipation of what could soon be yours.AI has created a new breed of cat video: addictive, disturbing and nauseatingly quick soap operasRead moreBut the days of flipping through paper catalogues are well and truly over. That’s why Tennilles_deals is so important, giving us tight, three-minute videos that provide us with a 360-degree view of each product: a walking, talking catalogue. We’re in the combat zone of the Woolies andColesduopoly with her and she is protecting us, guiding us through each aisle. She is our mum. We are her children.And I’m not alone in the admiration I have for this woman. There’s a reason Tennilles_deals has amassed almost 100,000 followers. She offers the people something the mega-chain supermarkets could never: a personable touch; a space where cash-strapped Aussies can vent about price-gouging.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenA selection of the comments on Tennilles_deals’ TikToks: a space for both adoration and solidarity.Photograph: TikTokOne of her videos about the price of extra virgin olive oil starts a debate in the comments. Kerry from Tamworth says she remembers when it was only $7; we love-react Kerry’s comment in solidarity. She is not alone. We are not alone. Barry from Wagga Wagga voices outrage on the Cadbury chocolate block deal. We agree that two for $10 is ridiculous and we remember the simpler $3 block days. Barry then says something out of the blue about his hot cousin, but we ignore it because we agreed about the chocolate thing and we don’t need to go any further.The effect of cozzie livs gives the average Australian fear when entering a supermarket. Gone are the days when I would enter a store without a list and a finite plan of what to purchase. Having the opportunity to see that I can get five Chobani pots for $10 soothes me. As do the gently encouraging words of Carol from Broken Hill: “Do not pass up that Chobani deal.” It means I can enter a Woolies free from the anxiety that I’ll go over budget in pursuit of protecting my gut microbiome.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

The drugs won. NowDonald Trumpis turning a failed metaphor into a worse reality.On Tuesday the US presidentclaimedthat the military had killed 11 drug traffickers from Venezuela, posting footage of the strike that US officials said took place on a speedboat in international waters in the Caribbean. The administrationsupplied no evidencefor its claim that the boat contained Tren de Aragua members, or drugs, and gave varying accounts of its destination. It also warned that there was more to come, with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, arguing that intercepting boats had not curbed the drugs problem: “What will stop them is when you blow them up.” Earlier this year, Mr Trumpsecretly orderedthe use of military force against cartels internationally.With US warships patrolling the coast of Venezuela – and F35 fighter jets reportedlydispatched to Puerto Rico– some fear that this could be pretext for adisastrous intervention, as its president, Nicolás Maduro, has suggested. Alternatively, Washington may hope it unnerves other regime members into unseating him, or prompts Mr Maduro himself to flee – two longstanding dreams. The US hasalready offered a $50m bountyfor his arrest. At best, this may bepolitical theatre, with both Mr Maduro and Mr Trump posturing for their bases.If this campaign truly targets the drugs trade, it is dangerous and misguided. Likerebranding the Department of Defenseas the “Department of War”, it speaks to Mr Trump’s love of macho spectacle. But it sets a precedent for launching military strikes on whomever the US authorities wish, without congressional approval or a UN mandate,simply by declaring that they are “at war”.The Obama administrationstretched the boundaries of executive power, and any plausible definition of self-defence and imminent threat, with its campaign of drone assassinations, includingthose of American citizensfar from battlefields, under the hazy label of the “war on terror”. Despite thehigh civilian tollandminimal transparency, it met lamentably little political pushback.The Trump administration has gone even further. Cartelsare spreadingand entrenching themselves in Latin America, devastating communities. But arbitrarily designating them as terrorists is plainly a nonsense. Extrajudicial killings of this kind are always wrong. Offenders who would not face the death penalty if charged are executed without due process. Innocents inevitably fall victim too. Many children were among the thousands killed inRodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs”in the Philippines. The former president is now awaiting trial for crimes against humanity at the international criminal court.Summary executions are also counterproductive. They make it harder to gather information, and strikes on foreign soil would make governments less likely to cooperate with US efforts, due to the domestic backlash – especially inMexico. That would not only hamper the fight against drugs, but also Mr Trump’s efforts to curb migration.To tackle its devastating fentanyl epidemic, the US must ultimately tackle demand:an immense task, since it means addressing the conditions that birthed this crisis, as well as entrenched addictions. In the meantime,carefully targeted action and financial disruptionwould be more effective than killing cartel members. Above all, the administration shouldstem the flow of US arms, which have supercharged violence in Mexico and elsewhere.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It will tout another record-setting Open: more than a million fans through the gates, unprecedented social-media engagement, double-digit growth in food and beverage sales, and hundreds of celebrities packed into suites from Rolex to Ralph Lauren. It will beam about growing the game, championing diversity andturning Flushing Meadows into a pop-culture destination.But for all the milestones the USTA is teeing up to celebrate, this year’s tournament will be remembered for a different kind of first: the governing body’s lamentable decisionto ask broadcasters not to show dissentagainst Donald Trump. In making that pre-emptive concession, the USTA has committed an unforced error that can’t be undone: sacrificing credibility in order to shield a politician –anypolitician, regardless of party, ideology or affiliation – from the sound of public disapproval.Broadcasters told not to air any booing of Donald Trump at US Open men’s finalRead moreAccording to internal emails obtained by outletsincluding PAandBounces, the USTA instructed its television partners to “refrain from showcasing any disruptions or reactions” when Trump appears on screen during Sunday’s final. A separate note reminded staff he would be seated in Rolex’s suite as a client guest. The 11-word statement to the Guardian on Saturday night from a USTA spokesperson – “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions” – is so weak it could buckle under the weight of its own hypocrisy. (Rolex did not respond to a request for comment.)This is, after all, the same tournament that happily televised a climate protestergluing himself to a seatfor nearly an hour during Coco Gauff’s semi-final win over Karolina Muchova two years ago, along with countless other fan disturbances. The same tournament that shrugs at the drunken buffoonery behind itsUS Bro-pen reputation. The Open practically invented televising distractions. Chaos is its brand. For the USTA to draw the line at showing boos for a sitting president is not “policy consistency” but capitulation.And to what end? Because of the fear that Trump –once a fixture at the US Openbutloudly booed on his last visitin 2015, three months after announcing his first presidential campaign – may once again be exposed as unpopular before a global audience? Because of the fear that a chorus of jeers could overshadow the match itself? But that fear misunderstands both sport and democracy.Crowd dissent on broadcasts is not a breakdown of civic order. It is its expression. Then UK home secretary Theresa Maywas booed at the 2012 London Paralympics. French president Emmanuel Macronwas whistledduring the 2023 Rugby World Cup opening ceremony in Paris. In the US, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell isall but guaranteed a chorus of boosduring public appearances, and that’s practically a standing ovation next tothe venom reservedfor NHL commissioner Gary Bettman from fans. And Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, have beengiven hostile receptionsby sports crowds. Somehow the United Kingdom, France and the United States survived those incidents intact.That the USTA thinks Trump must be insulated from reality hints at something darker. It is reminiscent of regimes where the leader’s image must be protected from public ridicule. It shows how much Trump’s first term – and his bullying of cultural institutions – still shapes behavior. In his first presidency, he was broadly reviled by athletes and sports bodies. Now, as Tom Dartwrote before this year’s Super Bowl, he is increasingly accommodated or treated with silence.View image in fullscreenThe US Open is supposed to be New York’s tournament, brash and democratic, rowdy and unfiltered.Photograph: Ishika Samant/Getty ImagesThe Open is supposed to be New York’s tournament, brash and democratic, rowdy and unfiltered, vibrant and exuberantly multicultural, where the crowd is as much a presence as the players on the court. By sanitizing its reaction, the USTA isn’t just shielding Trump. It is stripping the event of its unique character, authenticity and integrity.That irony cuts even deeper because the Open has always been at the forefront of progress. It was the first of the majors to award equal prize money to women and men, long before other sports caught up. It platformed, embraced and celebrated LGBTQ+ athletes decades before it was fashionable to do so, from Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova in the 1970s to Renée Richards breaking ground as one of the first transgender athletes in professional tennis, to Open Pride nights today. And this year’s theme, “75 years of breaking barriers”, honors Althea Gibson, who in 1950 became the first Black player to compete at the tournament’s predecessor, the US nationals, and went on to clear a path for generations of Black players who followed. Her story is literally built into the grounds this fortnight, from the banners and installations designed by Melissa Koby – the first Black artist to create the Open’s theme art – to the constant reminders that the sport has prided itself on inclusion.From a Maga vantage point, of course, it probably looks like the Woke Super Bowl: King’s name on the gates, Gibson’s silhouette over Ashe Stadium, Serena and Venus Williams lionized, rainbow-tinged Pride nights, and a governing body trumpeting diversity at every turn. Which, if we’re being honest, may be one reason Trump is showing up in the first place: a 4D chess move with the intent of turning a tennis match into another battleground of grievance. Getting booed by thousands of fans drinking $23 vodka-lemonades won’t exactly be a bad look for his base, especially in a corrupt, disgusting hellhole like New York.Fans will still do what fans do. If they want to boo, they will boo. But millions at home may never see it, thanks to a governing body that has chosen to act less like a guardian of sport and more like a nervous producer of campaign stagecraft. For a sport that prides itself on honesty and clarity – the ball is in or out – it is a shameful retreat.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025TennisUS Open tennisUS sportsDonald TrumpCarlos AlcarazJannik SinnercommentShareReuse this content",

Not only does the ageing president alter his demands on a whim, but it is unclear to what extent he has the power to make them stick.Yet even if the “reciprocal” tariffs first announced on 2 April are rolled back, they are only one aspect of a much wider assault on the last vestiges of what was once known as the “Washington consensus”.Trump’s war on Fed is ‘serious danger’ to world economy, says ECB headRead moreTo name just a few of Trump’s recent interventions, he hastaken a 10% government stakein the US tech company Intel,demanded 15% of the revenueof Nvidia’s chip sales to China and suggested the chief executive of Goldman Sachsshould go.This at the same as taking a sledgehammer to Federal Reserve independence bylobbing insultsat the chair, Jerome Powell, andtrying to sack Lisa Cookfrom the central bank’s board.The head of the Bureau of Labor Statisticswas removed by Trumpafter a run of poor jobs data; the chief of the National Labor Relations Board, Jennifer Abruzzo,was fired, too.The tech bros who back Trumploathe the NLRBfor its role in upholding workers’ rights – mandating unionisation ballots at Amazon warehouses, for example.Trump’s approach is simultaneously systematic, in its determination to smash existing norms, and utterly chaotic. It is hard to categorise: corporate America is being unleashed – through the wilful destruction of environmental and labour standards, for example – and brought to heel.The leftwing senator Bernie Sanders welcomed Trump’s efforts totake a stake in Intelin exchange for government grants, for example –something he advocated in the Guardian back in 2022– while some Republicans have condemned the approach as (heaven forbid) “socialism”.Partly because it coincides with the AI-fuelled stock boom that has propelled the value of tech companies into the stratosphere, the market response to this torching of the status quo has so far been modest.Whatever emerges from another three and a half years of this maelstrom is likely to be unrecognisable as the US economic model of recent decades.Its destruction has not happened overnight. The days were already long gone when the US, as the world’s undisputed economic superpower, could export free market, financialised capitalism worldwide.After the 2008 crash, the conditions for which were created in Wall Street boardrooms, any moral or practical claim the US had to offer an economic example to other nations evaporated.As the turmoil rippled out through the global economy, and the US government responded by bailing out large chunks of its financial sector, the lie of laissez-faire was laid bare.The crisis exposed the risks of turbocharged capitalism to countries outside the US, too – not least in the former Soviet bloc – that had been advised to adopt the model wholesale.As Ivan Krastev and Stephen Holmes put it in their compelling polemic The Light that Failed, “confidence that the political economy of the west was a model for the future of mankind had been linked to the belief that western elites knew what they were doing. Suddenly it was obvious that they didn’t.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hisfirst-term China tariffswere, with hindsight, a relatively modest stab at, as he saw it, tilting the playing field back towards the US.Joe Biden did not unwind those tariffs, which went with the grain of geopolitics, as any hopes that economic liberalisation would bring China into the fold of democracies were sadly dashed, and President Xi’s regime took on an increasingly authoritarian bent.Biden also took a muscular approach to the state’s role in the economy, with the billions in grants and loans distributed under the Inflation Reduction Act linked to national priorities of cutting carbon emissions and creating jobs.So the idea that before Trump arrived on the scene, free market US capitalism was motoring along unchallenged is misleading, but the pace at which he is crushing its remaining norms is extraordinary.There is ample ground for legitimate disagreement here: taxpayer stakes in strategic companies are much more common in European economies, for example. Trump may be laying down tracks that future US governments with different priorities could follow.Given that it is so unclear even what kind of economy he is groping towards, the overriding sense for the moment is of radical uncertainty. Friday’sweak US payrolls data, with the unemployment rate close to a four-year high, suggested companies may be responding with caution.Investors appear to have decided to avert their eyes for now, buoyed up by the prospect of Fed rate cuts, and the mega returns of the tech companies. However, with every chaotic week that passes, the risks must increase – and as the UK has learned in the wake of the Liz Truss debacle, economic credibility is quicker to lose than to rebuild.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEconomics viewpointUS economyTrump tariffsTrump administrationEconomicsUS politicsTariffscommentShareReuse this content",

Narendra Modi is the latest world leader to learn this lesson the hard way. Wooing his “true friend” in the White House, India’s authoritarian prime minister thought he’d conquered Trump’s inconstant heart. The two men hit peak pals in 2019, holding hands at a “Howdy Modi” rally in Texas. But it’s allgone pear-shapedthanks to Trump’s tariffs and dalliance with Pakistan. Like a jilted lover on the rebound, Modi shamelesslythrew himselfat Vladimir Putin in China last week. Don and Narendra! It’s over! Although, to be honest, it always felt a little shallow.Other suitors for Trump’s slippery hand have suffered similar heartbreak. France’s Emmanuel Macron turned on the charm, feting him at the grand reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. But Trump cruelly dumped him after they argued over Gaza,calling hima publicity-seeker who “always gets it wrong”. The EU’s Ursula von der Leyen, desperate for a tete-a-tete, flew to Trump’s Scottish golf course to pay court. Result: perhaps the most humiliating,lopsided trade dealsince imperial Britain’s 19th-century “unequal treaties” with Peking’s dragon throne.The list of broken pledges and dashed hopes is lengthy. Relationships between states normally pivot on power, policy and strategic interests. But with faithless, fickle Trump, it’s always personal – and impermanent. Disconcertingly, he told Mexico’s impressive president,Claudia Sheinbaum, that he “likes her very much” – then threatened to invade her country, ostensibly in pursuit of drug cartels. Leaders fromCanada, Germany, Japan, South Korea and South Africa have all attempted to ingratiate themselves, to varying degrees. They still haven’t fared well.All this should set red lights flashing for Britain’s Keir Starmer ahead of Trump’s state visit in 10 days’ time. The prime minister’sunedifying Trump-whisperer acthas produced little benefit to date, at high reputational cost. Starmer apparently believes his handling of the US relationship is a highlight of his first year in office. Yet Trump ignores his Gaza ceasefire pleas and opposes UK recognition of a Palestinian state. He hugely boosted Putin, Britain’s nemesis, with his half-baked Alaska summit. US security guarantees for postwar Ukraine are more mirage than reality. His steel tariffs and protectionist policiescontinue to hurt UK workers.His second state visit is an appalling prospect. The honour is utterly undeserved. It’s obvious what Trump will gain: aroyal endorsement, a chance to play at being King Donald, a privileged platform from which to deliver his corrosive, divisive populist-nationalist diatribes at a moment of considerable social fragility in the US and UK. Polls suggest many Britons strongly oppose the visit; andmost don’t trust the US.So what Starmer thinks he will gain is a mystery. The fleeting goodwill of a would-be dictator who isdismantling US democracyand wrecking the global laws-based order championed by the UK is a poor return.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump holds up a photograph Putin gave him in the White House on 22 August 2025.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesAs he demands homage from abject subjects, this spectacle will confirm the UK in the eyes of the world as a lackey state, afraid to stand up for its values. Starmer’s government is now so morally confused that it refuses to acknowledge that Israel, fully backed by Trump,is committing genocidein Gaza, while at the same time making the wearing of apro-Palestine T-shirt a terroristact. The Trump travesty will be an embarrassment, signalling a further descent into colonial subservience. As next year’s 250th anniversary of US independence approaches, thechronically unhealthy “special relationship”has finally come full circle.Not everyone is genuflecting to Trump – and evidence mounts that resistance, not grovelling, is by far the best way to handle this schoolyard bully. Modi’s geopolitical fling in China showed he’s learned that when dealing with Trump, firm resolve, supported by alternative options, is the better policy. Last week’sdefiant speechby China’s leader, Xi Jinping, reflected a similar realisation. Both he and Putin have discovered that when they dig their heels in, whether the issue is Ukraine, trade or sanctions, Trump backs off. Xi has adopted an uncompromising stance from the start. Putin uses flattery, skilfully manipulating Trump’s frail ego. The result is the same. Like cowards the world over, Trump respects strength because he’s weak. So he caves.The bigger the wolf, the more sheepishly Trump responds. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, like Putin, an indicted war criminal, has shown that by sticking to his guns (literally, in his case), he can face down Trump. More than that, Trump can be co-opted. After Netanyahuattacked Iran in June, against initial US advice, he induced the White House to join in – although, contemptibly, Trump only did so once he was certain who was winning. Then, typically, he claimed credit for a bogus world-changing victory. North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un,similarly bamboozledTrump during his first term. Having learned nothing, and nursing his implausibleNobel peace prize ambitions, Trump is again raising the prospect of unconditional engagement with Kim.Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has the right idea. The more Trump tries to bully him with 50% tariffs and a barrage of criticism, the morehe resists. Trump is particularly exercised over the fate of Jair Bolsonaro, Lula’s hard-right predecessor, who, like Trump, mounted a failed electoral coup. But Lula is not having any of it. “If the United States doesn’t want to buy [from us], we will find new partners,” he said. “The world is big, and it’s eager to do business with Brazil.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But admonishments against blowing one’s own trumpet date back at least 2,000 years earlier.InChristianityit’s taught that virtue should not be performative, but active. To be good, a person had to do good. Jesus was very vocal when it came to his criticism of the Pharisee sect and their showy, costly acts of piety, in the absence of what he considered to be genuine virtue.The sixth-century BCE Chinese philosopher Kong Qiu, better known in the west as Confucius, would have agreed. He called for a society built on five elements;jen (benevolence/humaneness),chun tzu (gentleman or exemplary person),li (correct conduct),te (moral force/virtue, particularly in rulers) andwen(cultivation of arts, culture, harmony).The secret to happiness? Finding joy in others. It’s free, simple and will gladden your heart | Nadine LevyRead moreThese components, he argued, would create a society infused with respect, integrity, dignity, diligence and kindness, each virtue building on the other. People in positions of power or seniority, according to Confucius, must demonstrate kindness and benevolence, while those in positions of lesser power are to behave with reverence and loyalty.Li,or correct conduct,also emphasises Confucius’s doctrine of the middle way. This means that even virtue should be subject to moderation and examination. No person should enact the rules ofliblindly. According to Confucius, a virtue must always be subject to thought and reason.The fourth-century BCE Greek philosopher Aristotle would have agreed with Confucius that a person should avoid the extremes of too much or too little of the virtues. The right amount of courage, say, depends on the situation, and must be subject to reason. Being brave is only a virtue if a person is acting for a social good.So what would Confucius and Aristotle tell me to do, next time I want to advertise a virtuous act or opinion online?Growing up Catholic, I must have imbibed St Augustine’s position that “humility is the foundation of all the other virtues” Whenever I make an online donation, a pop-up window asks if I want to announce it on social media. I almost always select “no”.But in not wanting to risk being seen as a virtue-signaller, I may be undermining the virtue of my act. I might miss an opportunity to encourage others to support a good cause. If I publicly commit to a position,research indicatesthat I might also be inclined to take further action.Grief has always been my companion: poetry taught me how to live with it | Ali HammoudRead moreBy refusing to share my support for a cause, I may have gone too far in the other extreme. I am not avoiding the vice of self-aggrandisement, so much as performing the virtue of humility for myself.Confucius reminds me that, to become achun tzu, or an exemplary person, I have to reach beyond my audience of one. I become a more fully realised human being as my heart/mind,hsin,expands to encompass everyone I am in relation with. Ultimately, the posture of my self dissolves into the relation. Signals of virtue are the steady echo of a heart, beating inside a network of care.Jackie Bailey is the author of The Eulogy, the winner of the 2023 NSW premier’s literary multicultural award.

Among midday pints, onstage pyrotechnics and a huge stand advertising the wonders of investing in gold, a party led by those bumptious public schoolboys Nigel Farage and Richard Tice was suddenly rejoicing in the departure of British politics’ most prominent working-class woman. The news, moreover, only boosted an atmosphere of energy and optimism, laced with a delighted surprise at what might be the UK’s defining political fact. We all know it: this new party has a tiny handful of MPs, no meaningful policy platform and a worldview thatconstantly blurs into conspiracy theory, but Reform UK is on course to either form or lead the next British government.There are lots of reasons for that, and most of them cast very harsh light on the failings ofKeir Starmerand his allies. As toxic as its messages always are, Reform has vivid and simple stories – about immigration, diversity and the supposedly endless failings of the two traditional parties. Its leading figures instinctively understand that politics has long since turned raw and primary-coloured. And it uses its complete inexperience of power as an advantage: the only answer to the UK’s inertia and failure, it says, is to hand the keys to untried outsiders.Whether we like it or not, Farage is also the embodiment of the transformation of politics by celebrity culture, a change massively accelerated by the dominance of social media. Jargon-heavy, technocratic, man-in-a-suit politics suits neither our modern means of communication, nor a world that seems to be constantly gripped by noisy chaos. Instead, success increasingly requires an altogether more performative, authentic – or, in his case, faux-authentic – style of leadership, and the ability to confidently rise above the din and make yourself heard.With all that in mind, look at the Starmer government and where the events of the past few days leave it. Rayner was hardly a political wizard, but until she was swamped by stories about stamp duty and seaside flats, she was probably the only Labour high-up who brought a visibly human element to the business of government, and could talk movingly about life at the sharp end. Her policy priorities – not least her energeticchampioning of social housing– were focused on exactly the parts of the electorate to whom Farage most powerfully speaks. Moreover, she was at least a modest counterweight to the power wielded by Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney – who has seized the opportunity provided by her resignation for a reshuffle, and seemingly encouraged Starmer to lean even further into the blank, technocratic approach that has defined this government from the start.At cabinet level, there has been a frenzy of job swapping, but no sense of any rethink. We will see what transpires at Labour’s conference, but the PM and his colleagues still seem to be spurning narratives and stories in favour of the vapid idea that power can be reduced to a model of “delivery” that shows no real signs of actually delivering anything. If you want an instant sense of how little this has to offer, look again at the videoStarmer put outa few days before the Rayner crisis: 35 tedious seconds in which he talks about getting “all the No 10 staff together” and “marching forward to the next phase of government”. The resulting feeling is all too familiar: he looks like a man standing close to a burning house, promising a set of new shelves and a couple of nice rugs.1:38'That was just the beginning': Reform UK conference arrives in Birmingham – videoMeanwhile, some of the biggest questions about what he and his colleagues are doing centre on the government’s approach to what Farage thinks is his strongest ground. The new home secretary is the Birmingham MP Shabana Mahmood – who,we are told, will intensify the government’s cold, punitive rhetoric on asylum, immigration and so-called small boats. Clearly, the government needs to sort out the chaos in the asylum system, and it should sometimes talk – carefully – about the challenges of integration. But as evidenced by Starmer’s “island of strangers” speech, it is actually floundering into much more dangerous political spaces, again and again.For yet more proof, go back only a fortnight, to thespeech Farage gave about mass deportations, paying the Taliban to take back people who come here from Afghanistan, and yet another suggestion that the UK is on the brink of social collapse. Starmer’s spokespersondeclined to criticise any of it. Labour, in other words, does not want to contest his most fundamental ideas, nor point out how dangerous they are; indeed, its instinct is to blankly validate them. The result: Reform UK is not just riding high thanks to Farage’s shamelessness and skill. Amazingly, Labour is actively helping.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the real crisis for Starmer may have only just begun | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreWhich brings us to the awful urgency of this moment. If Reform UK succeeds in taking power, what does anyone think will happen to state education, our systems of justice, crime and punishment, or the BBC? What will everyday life feel like amid Farage’s promised mass deportations? If you woke up a couple of weeks ago and found your neighbourhood suddenly covered in flags (note thepathetic response of Yvette Cooper, the-then home secretary: “Oh put ’em up anywhere. I would put them up anywhere”), imagine the people who glory in that kind of sectarian territory-marking running the country. Then watch Starmer in action, and ask yourself: does he understand what’s at stake here?Of course, there is nothing easy about any of this: to shout “be bold” and deny the gravity of the government’s predicament would be as crass as many of its own pronouncements. But deep uncertainties nag away, and Rayner’s exit makes them even more pressing. In a new political age, does the prime minister understand what leadership really involves? And even if he does, can he actually provide it?Those concerns can be put another way, which cuts straight to the ice-cold political winds that I felt whirling around Birmingham. The idea that we are at one of the gravest moments in our peacetime history might sound melodramatic, but it has to be confronted. And so does a question that will sooner or later become unavoidable: does Starmer’s presence at the top help or hinder the onward march of the darkest forces to have ever been so close to taking control?John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionAngela RaynerKeir StarmerShabana MahmoodReform UKNigel FarageRichard TicecommentShareReuse this content",

Every day he would try to make conversation and play with the other children, and every day he would be ignored. One night it got so bad that my grandma found him crying himself to sleep, unable to process, as an eight-year-old, why no one would want to talk to “the brown kid”. This kind of social exclusion was sadly all too familiar in postwar Britain – my white grandma had endured her own share of abuse ever since she fell in love with my Sri Lankan grandad in 1966, committing the family’s original sin of interracial marriage.When I heard these stories as a child, they felt like terrible tales from a different time – one of National Front marches and street battles, shot with big bulky cameras on black-and-white film. Growing up at a multicultural school in south-west London in the 2010s, I certainly had a different childhood to my father’s – the notion of being an outcast because of the colour of your skin was nothing short of laughable. Now, though, it doesn’t seem quite so funny.Just a year ago, in the aftermath ofthe Southport killings, towns and cities up and down the country were hit with what can only be described as attempted pogroms. Hordes of men in Middlesbrough stood at intersectionschecking the skin colourof drivers; family homes were vandalisedwith racist graffiti; rioters in Rotherham tried to set fire to asylum seeker accommodation. As I turned 19 in the midst of the chaos, I was being taught an important lesson, one that much of my generation has had the luxury of forgetting. For the first time I learned what it really means to live in fear because of the colour of your skin, and it has never left me since.This is all a far cry from my own laissez-faire childhood, which reflects many of the experiences of young people of colour who grew up at a time when racist attitudes were in decline. In 1993almost halfof Britons said they’d be uncomfortable if their child married someone of a different ethnicity; by 2020 that numberhad fallento just 4%, a stunning drop. Likewise, the percentage of people saying that you have to be white to be truly British has fallen from 10% in 2006 to 3%. While British society has always been far from perfect (many have rightly taken aim at the continued prevalence of institutional racism and unconscious bias) a consensus seemed to have evolved that racism was itself a fundamentally bad thing that was on the way out.There have been many acts of racist violence in the past 30 years – from theLondon nail bombingsof 1999 to theIslamophobic attacksthat accompanied the “war on terror”. But something feels different now. Racists in Britain are both more unapologetic than ever and more in touch with mainstream opinion, as our media and politicians happily scapegoat asylum seekers. What this means, in practice, is that I’ve experienced more racism in the last 12 months than the rest of my life put together. Whether it’s being told to go back to my country by a stranger at a London club during Pride or having the slur “Paki” thrown my way more times than I can recall (one particularly uncomfortable incident occurred at a pub on a family holiday in Cornwall), it has now become a regular feature of my life. And it’s not just me feeling this way. Mothin Ali, the new deputy leader of the Green party, took to Instagram just last week to sharea videoof several men yelling “Paki bastards” at himself and his family. “I haven’t experienced this kind of random racism on the streets since I was a child in the 80s,” he wrote. “I was hoping my own children wouldn’t have to go through the same thing.”The answer lies not in falling into an alarmist panic, but in rediscovering the lessons that previous generations learned the hard way: the necessity for organised resistance and the strength of our collective power.Last year, at the height of the riots, a message was circulating around from a far-right Telegram group that was organising hate marches across the country. “Niggers, Muslims, Pajeets,” it opened, “you will be slaughtered on Wednesday if you arrive at the protests. Think wisely or die.” That message was designed to scare people such as me away from showing up to counter-protest, to maintain the illusion that it is only the racists who have a voice in our country. But all that message left me with was anger, not fear. That Wednesday I did show up, along with tens of thousands of other antiracists from up and down the country. In Walthamstow, east London, not a single far-right group dared show their faces, and the streets were instead filled with people from all walks of life celebrating together late into the night.Rather than slipping into despair, it is time for young people to lead the charge against those who want to drag us back to the dark ages. On 13 September, Tommy Robinson and his acolytes are planning on terrorising central London with yet another one of their hate marches, and, once again, we will be on the streets to make clear that we will not live in fear. It doesn’t matter how many homes the far right vandalise, slurs they spew or how much they dominate our political discourse. Just like our mothers and fathers before us, our generation’s fight has come. We will have the audacity to keep winning, so that no child ever has to cry themselves to sleep again.Rohan Sathyamoorthy is a 19-year-old writer from south-west Londonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Will he take Macron with him?Sun 7 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 7 Sep 2025 12.52 EDTShareFrançois Bayrou may have thought it was a smart pre-emptive move tocall a parliamentary vote of confidencein his minority government ahead of a planned national protest day on 10 September and the start of a fraught parliamentary budget season.Determined not to meet the same fate as hispredecessor who was toppledby parliament last December, the French prime minister appears to have chosen political hara-kiri instead. His near-certain ejection by a hung parliament on Monday(8 September) is set to turn a smouldering political deadlock into a blazingcrise de régime.France’s Fifth Republic constitution, framed by Gen Charles de Gaulle in 1958 to create a strong executive and a pliant legislature, has ceased to deliver stable governments. Without a change in the system, France faces extended political paralysis. In the meantime, it seems incapable of resolving a chronic fiscal crisis that is starting to worry financial markets. The finance minister, Éric Lombard, last weekdeclined to rule out having to seek an IMF bailoutbefore abruptly back-pedalling when investors took fright.If, as expected, the veteran centrist prime minister is ousted, PresidentEmmanuel Macronhas no easy option to steady the ship of state, pass a budget to curb the swollen deficit, and preserve his liberal legacy of supply-side economics and pension reform.View image in fullscreenFrance’s prime minister, François Bayrou, at the Hotel de Matignon in Paris, 3 September 2025.Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty ImagesMacron could appoint a new prime minister – his fourth in two years – but there is no sign that France’s political parties are willing to compromise on a workable budget. He could dissolve parliament again and call a general election – the third in three years – but that would probably produce no more decisive an outcome than the snap poll he called last year in an impetuous blunder.The president had sought “clarification” from voters after far-right populistsmade big gains in the European parliament elections. Instead of clarification, the legislative ballot cast the country into greater confusion, producing athree-way split between roughly equal blocs– a leftwing alliance dominated by Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s radical France Unbowed (LFI), Macron’s own centrist and centre-right supporters, and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN).Macron, who cannot run again after his second five-year presidential term, which could last until spring 2027, has ruled out another option – resigning from office and precipitating an early presidential election. How on earth did the charismatic, still only 47-year-old president get himself into such a mess?He and Bayrou seem to have misjudged both the public mood and the parliamentary arithmetic. They calculated that either the RN or the centre-left Socialist party would keep the government in office since each had good reason to avoid another election – the former because Le Pen would be disqualified from standing due to a fraud conviction, the latter because it risked losing many seats. But neither wants to act as a life raft for an unpopular prime minister who proposed axing two public holidays and freezing public spending next year to narrow the fiscal gap.Bayrou gambled that by dramatising France’s soaring debt, he could persuade the public and the political class of the need for drastic measures. Capitalising on public anger over those proposals, an anonymous collective called Bloquons tout (Let’s Block Everything) has called for strikes and demonstrations to bring the country to a standstill next Wednesday, seeking to revive the spirit of the leaderless gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement that staged months of guerrilla protests against a planned carbon tax in 2018.Although some of those calls appear to have originated onfar-right social media accounts,Mélenchon has piled in behind the blockade campaign in the hope of forcing Macron’s removal. So far, the mood seems sullen and distrustful rather than insurrectionary. It’s not clear that unionised public sector workers have the stamina to sustain a campaign of strikes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So why is it spending billions a year subsidising business? | Alexander HurstRead moreThe Socialists are trying to project themselves as a constructive alternative to either Bayrou or snap elections. The party’s leader, Olivier Faure, says the president should appoint a Socialist premier to implement a “counter-budget” featuring a wealth tax on large fortunes, a suspension of the raising of the retirement age enacted in 2023, a cut in welfare taxes and smaller public spending cuts than Bayrou envisaged. Macron is determined not to do that, but he has urged his centrists to reach out to the Socialists to try to draw them into joining or supporting a government.Centrist leaders are urging the president to avoid a fresh election, in which the RN would probably further increase its score at their expense. But French parties have neither the German and Dutch political culture of painstakingly negotiating a compromise programme for a legislature, nor the Italian tradition of backing a government of technocrats for a limited time to carry out unpopular but necessary reforms.A prolonged political crisis will only fuel support for the nationalist, anti-immigrant right and further discredit the jaded mainstream parties. With toxic social media echo chambers and a growing US-style far-right media railing against crime, immigration and Islam, Le Pen and her young protege Jordan Bardella seem ever closer to winning power.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsFranceOpinionEmmanuel MacronMarine Le PenEuropecommentShareReuse this content",

We are open to diplomacy and a new deal over our nuclear programme, but sanctions must goSun 7 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 7 Sep 2025 06.17 EDTShareFor more than two decades,Europehas been at the heart of the ongoing, manufactured crisis over my country’s peaceful nuclear programme. In many ways, the European role has reflected the state of broader international power relations. Once a moderating force aspiring to restrain a belligerent America with maximalist aims in our region, Europe is today enabling the excesses of Washington.Last week, Britain, France and Germany –or the E3– said they hadactivated the process to “snap back” UN sanctionson Iran. The mechanism was set up to penalize significant non-performance under the2015 nuclear dealsigned by Iran, the E3, the US, China and Russia.The E3’s gambit lacks any legal standing, chiefly because it ignores the sequence of events that ledIranto adopt lawful remedial measures under the nuclear deal.The three countries want the world to forget that it was the US, and not Iran, thatunilaterally ended participation in the joint comprehensive plan of action(JCOPA), the formal name of the deal. The E3 are additionally omitting how they failed to uphold their part of the bargain, not to mention their outrageous welcoming of thebombing of Iran in June.Britain, France andGermanymay appear to act out of spite. But the truth is that they are intently pursuing a reckless course of action based on the logic that it may provide them with a seat at the table on other issues. This is a grave miscalculation that is bound to backfire. President Trump has made clear that he views the E3 as tangential actors. This is evident in the way Europe is sidelined from issues that are vital to its future – including the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The message from Washington is loud and clear: to gain relevance, the E3 must exhibit undying fealty. The recent images of European leaders sat in the Oval Office before President Trump vividly underscore this dynamic.Things were not always like this. When the E3 was formed in 2003, to rein in the George W Bush administration after its invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, Iran welcomed the endeavor. But talks collapsed when Europe could neither offer anything substantial nor stand up to Washington. At the time, my colleagues wanted Iran to keep 200 centrifuges for small-scale uranium enrichment, only to be met with American maximalism channeled through the E3. War did not erupt partly because the US woke up to the heavy price tag – in both blood and treasure – of illegally occupying Iran’s neighbors to the east and west.Following an eight-year race of sanctions v centrifuges between Iran and the west, during which my country amassed 20,000 centrifuges – 100 times more than in 2005 – two important dynamics enabled unprecedented dialogue: E3 and US acquiescence to enrichment in Iran, and Iranian recognition of America as a negotiating partner. This fundamental realignment directly led to the signing of the JCPOA. The bargain was straightforward: unprecedented oversight and curbs on Iranian enrichment in exchange for the termination of sanctions. The formula worked.Yet, one decade later, we are almost back at square one. President Trump initiated an avoidable cascade of events when he ceased US participation in the JCPOA in 2018 and reimposed all sanctions.Initially distraught with the sabotage of a landmark agreement, the E3 pledged remediation,publicly recognizingthat “the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions and normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran constitute essential parts of the agreement”. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire,thundered thatEurope is not a “vassal”while other European leaders insisted that their “strategic autonomy” would ensure continuation of trade with Iran and that the dividends pledged to my people, including the sale of oil and gas along with effective banking transactions, would follow. None of it materialized.While failing to uphold its own obligations, Europe has expected Iran to unilaterally accept all restrictions. Exhibiting this mentality, Britain,Franceand Germany declined to condemn the US attack on my country in June – on the eve of diplomatic talks – and yet are now demanding UN sanctions on Iranians for supposedly rejecting dialogue.As I have cautioned my E3 counterparts, their gambit will not achieve the result they seek. On the contrary, it will only further sideline them by eliminating it from future diplomacy, with broad negative consequences for all of Europe in terms of its global credibility and standing.There is still time – and a dire need – for an honest conversation.It does not make any sense for the E3 to claim participation in a deal pillared on uranium enrichment in Iran while demanding that Iran must disavow those very capabilities. Openly cheerleading illegal military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities protected by international law – as Germany’s chancellorhas done– does not constitute “participation”.While this lawless behaviour is fueling calls for action to ensure “never again”, Iran remains open to diplomacy.It is ready to forge a realistic and lasting bargain that entails ironclad oversight and curbs on enrichment in exchange for the termination of sanctions. Failing to seize on this fleeting window of opportunity may have consequences destructive for the region and beyond on a whole new level.Israel may be pitching itself as capable of conducting war on behalf of the west. But as in June, the truth is that the powerful armed forces of Iran are ready and able to once again pummel Israel into running to “daddy” to be bailed out. The failed Israeli gambit this summer cost American taxpayers billions of dollars, robbed the United States of vital hardware that is now missing from its inventories, and projected Washington as a reckless actor dragged into a rogue regime’s wars of choice.If Europe truly wants a diplomatic solution, and if President Trump wants the bandwidth to focus on real issues that are not manufactured in Tel Aviv, they need to give diplomacy the time and space that it needs to succeed. The alternative is not likely to be pretty.Seyyed Abbas Araghchi is foreign minister of IranDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Because unfortunately, political point-scoring is paramount. The future of the nation comes second.In the Senate, the Greens accused the Coalition of positioning itself to “platform neo-Nazis”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe Nationals senatorBridget McKenzietook the debate straight to Israel and Gaza, saying: “Who supported Australian Jews in your team? No one.”Remarks from Greens senator David Shoebridge condemning the government’s latest steps on offshore detention provoked the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, who said: “You are an absolute disgrace.”We wonder why our communities seem so angry. While the fringes are certainly the noisiest, there is anger everywhere. On social media, in the mainstream media, in politics and increasingly on the streets.It was clear to many MPs, I’m sure, during the 2025 election campaign, that the culture wars, conspiracies and cookers who had previously predominantly occupied online spaces had metastasised into the real world.The increasingly visible presence of “sovereign citizens” like Porepunkah’s Dezi Freeman is no surprise to me, having lived in the United States and covered four years of Donald Trump. The erosion of trust in leadership that led to the election of such a disruptor was central to my decision to enter politics.I’m the son of an immigrant and my mother is Indigenous. This is the racism I experienced photographing a March for Australia rallyRead moreAustralia’s intelligence services have warned about the consequences of this erosion of trust for years and have repeatedly appealed to those in positions of power and influence not to inflame it.But just like cancer, the anger, blame and hate are spreading, and the cure is elusive.During the 2025 election campaign, for no reason other than being an MP, I was shouted at, threatened, abused. So were my campaign volunteers.One man screamed that I was a “woke cunt” in the middle of a shopping centre. Another yelled, “I hate you; everyone hates you”, at a local crime rally that was hijacked by rightwing protesters. I was spat on, followed, doxed.Neo-Nazis turned up at the pre-polls, intimidating voters, bellowing from a megaphone from the back of a truck. Some voters in the queue were visibly frightened and in tears.Untruthful political advertising, designed to divide, compounds this behaviour. So does the politically motivated fanning of culture wars over immigration and, by extension, crime and housing, climate and energy policy and the active deployment of mis- and disinformation to skew public sentiment by misleading and scaring people.Populist offerings of quick fixes are also damaging because they inevitably disappoint.All this splinters trust. And when trust is lost, society becomes vulnerable to dark forces seeking to exploit that weakness. They exist both inside and outside our borders. Claims of recent Iranian activity on Australian soil is one example.And yet, every sitting day in our parliament, we watch politicians verbally attack each other with minimal constructive debate.It is one of the reasons I and a cluster of other community independents were elected in 2022, seeking to help restore civil and constructive solutions to the many problems we face.For years we’ve seen boundaries of civility slip under Trump and other populists. Social media has become a cesspit of unaccountable abuse. And for mainstream media, conflict drives clicks.It also drives policy at times. Labor has been guilty of shocking overreach on migration policy due to perceived political risk, repeatedly seeking to neutralise high court decisions by legislating around them at the cost of human rights.The latest attempt to pander to the lowest common denominator – removing procedural fairness for non-citizens who have lost their visas on character grounds and deporting them to Nauru, regardless of the risks. Those who have committed crimes should be held accountable but this kind of approach merely validates anti-immigrant sentiment, and with it we lose our humanity.It’s worth noting that the genesis of the euphemistically named March for Australiawas apparently TikTok.Social media has its upsides but any forthcoming legislated duty of care must hold the platforms accountable for managing harmful content, including transparency provisions so the way systems and algorithms spread destructive information can be seen.Husic rebukes PM’s assertion ‘good people’ went to March for Australia rallies as Nampijinpa Price walks back immigration claimRead moreWe know that Elon Muskshared a post on Xthat exaggerated the turnout at the rallies by 10 times in the aftermath. Inevitably, many believed him.As both the prime minister and the opposition leader have said (in a rare moment of shared thinking), there may have been good people at those awful rallies.But were they there based on truth or lies?Days after, theAustralian Financial Reviewreported that tradies in Perth are now earning as much as $250,000 a year because of our chronic shortage of skilled workers.No doubt many of those protesting about immigration also complain about the price they have to pay for a plumber, not realising that, if we don’t import them, demand will exceed supply and prices will rise.Never underestimate the ability of people to entertain two entirely contradictory thoughts, especially if all we do is shout at each other rather than sit down and work issues through.At the same time, we can hardly expect reasoned community conversations to bridge divides when our leaders can’t even have those constructive discussions.Until they can, there’ll be a trust gap.Zoe Danielis a three-time ABC foreign correspondent and former independent member for GoldsteinExplore more on these topicsFar rightOpinionAustralian immigration and asylumAustralian politicsLabor partyAustralian GreensKaty Gallagher (Australian politician)Bridget McKenziecommentShareReuse this content",

But it got the top prize, the Golden Lion, from Alexander Payne’s jury.Benny Safdie’sThe Smashing Machine(15 minutes), with Dwayne Johnson as a troubled MMA fighter, got best director. Paolo Sorrentino’sLa Grazia(six minutes) got Toni Servillo the best actor prize, for his elegant fictional Italian president.

People were sobbing in the auditorium, and predicting the surely inevitable Golden Lion would be a tipping point for international political opinion. The Venice jurors had it in their power to make history. Didn’t they?That isn’t how it works. The Voice of Hind Rajab only earned the grand jury prize, the second prize, to online fury from those who thought this decision was a copout and a blandly pro-American copout at that.But every jury decision is a copout. All juries are horse-trading and compromising and collectively accepting second-choice movies that no one objects to from film-makers whose prestige they all endorse. Unanimous choices are vanishingly rare. I wonder what Venice juror Mohammad Rasoulof felt this year. His filmThe Seed of the Sacred Fig, challenging the Iranian regime, was widely tipped to win the top prize at Cannes last year and, of course, make history in the same way. But it had to be content with the special jury prize.At the lively post-decision press conference, Payne was confronted with questions about another juror, actor Fernanda Torres, who had threatened to quit over the Hind Rajab snub. The reporters had to decide if Payne’s reply was a clear denial: “One of my jurors threatened to quit? … I did … no. Did someone threaten to quit? I think we know … not to believe everything we read online.” (The loneliness and weariness of jury-presidential command is certainly detectable in the first part of that musing response.)View image in fullscreenJury members Cristian Mungiu, Maura Delpero, Stéphane Brizé, Fernanda Torres, Mohammad Rasoulof, Alexander Payne, Zhao Tao and festival director Alberto Barbera at the closing ceremony.Photograph: Stefania D’Alessandro/WireImageBetween Jarmusch’s Father Mother Sister Brother and Ben Hania’s The Voice of Hind Rajab, I personally would have given it to Hind Rajab. But overall, my choice would have been Francesco Rosi’s climate-change meditationBelow the Clouds, or maybe Park Chan-wook’s excellent black comedyNo Other Choice(whose omission from the prize list also infuriated Venice delegates, and which had to be content with the special jury prize) or even Kathryn Bigelow’s barnstorming anti-nuclear shockerA House of Dynamitewhich I suspect may have been too vulgar, too popcorny, to register with the jury.As for The Voice of Hind Rajab, it is brilliant and pertinent, though myfeelingsabout its docufictional approach were nuanced – and I wasn’t the only one.‘Humanity is facing a reckoning’: Venice shrugs off the glamour to take aim at politicsRead moreEveryone I have ever met agrees that prizes and ribbons and cups and medals for movies are, in the end, an absurdity, so perhaps we shouldn’t be too hot under the collar when a jury does something to annoy us.

His unearthing of energy, humour and a desire to achieve deserves our supportJack SealeSun 7 Sep 2025 16.10 EDTLast modified on Sun 7 Sep 2025 16.12 EDTShare‘Talk about grassroots cricket,” says Freddie Flintoff, leaning on a rickety railing outside a dilapidated Liverpool sports club. “This is in t’soil, this.” After three years on air, Field of Dreams, the documentary where the former England captain trains teenagers from deprived areas to play a sport they have no previous interest in, has reset to zero. His original group of lads from Preston, Lancashire, have become a team (season one) that has toured India (season two). They returned as young men who love cricket but no longer need their friend Fred’s help.For the series to continue, the format needs to start again. And it is now a format: all the emotions and challenges are familiar as Flintoff arrives in Bootle, Liverpool, another neglected area of deindustrialised north-west England. A representative of the local cricket club, once a thriving community hub that is now regularly vandalised, takes Flintoff on a tour of the neighbourhood’s derelict and boarded-up buildings, explaining that kids there commit petty crime and join gangs for a lack of anything else to do. When Flintoff visits a class of 16-year-old boys at a PRU – a pupil referral unit, ie a school for children who are unable or no longer welcome to attend mainstream schools – they have never heard of him and think cricket is a way for posh eccentrics to waste time.But even as they snigger at the idea of cricket and report that the dominant after-school activity in Bootle is smoking weed, we can see some of the sparkling potential that took a while to identify in Preston. At a park knockabout session overseen by Kyle, the gentle assistant coach who fills in when Freddie is off on celebrity business, the first wave of volunteers enjoy giving cricket a go, and key personalities emerge in the form of natural leader Ryan and charismatic trouble-maker Stevie. When the lads’ behavioural issues cause strife at a subsequent training session and Flintoff makes his comment about this being something beyond grassroots sport, we suspect it will all come good in the end.View image in fullscreenAssistant coach Kyle Hogg with Flintoff.Photograph: BBC/South ShoreA cynical viewer might check out here, feeling vindicated in their suspicion that Field of Dreams is a comforting fantasy: its miracle transformations only happen to young people who have won the lottery and been visited by a superstar with TV cash behind him. That’s one way to look at it. Another is that the show is a beacon of hope. It may put these kids into unusual circumstances, but the qualities it brings out of them – the energy, the humour, the desire to achieve – are not unusual at all. They are in every young person, not far below the surface. Organised sport brings them out, and Field of Dreams does not have to do much to demonstrate that. Flintoff’s fame is a shortcut to success, but the time and money the show invests are not massive. The experiment could be replicated.To underline the point, this year Flintoff runs several teams at once. Soon he is at South ShoreCricketand Squash Club in Blackpool, which is like every other venue in Field of Dreams: a sad relic that would easily be revived by a minor adjustment in national budgeting priorities. In the bar, a lonely room still warmed by good times of the past, one of the senior members looks as though he is holding back tears as he concedes that the club currently has no youth team, which means it is doomed.Flintoff and co set up a girls’ squad, which means a change to the show’s regular rhythms. Getting the new recruits to concentrate on the game and not muck about is not a problem, but communicating with them is. “With the lads you just chat, you’ve got an idea of what they’re going to say,” says our hero, flummoxed and a little scared by all the probing questions, unpredictable emotions and sudden outbreaks of dancing. “With the girls, no.” When 16-year-old Madison fixes Flintoff with her gaze and asks how he recovered mentally from the serious car crash he was involved in three years ago, and the permanent change to his physical appearance it caused, we see him surprise himself with a revealing, vulnerable answer about dealing with depression and struggling to achieve self-acceptance, and how those problems were already there before the accident.That Flintoff is not your average alpha male sports legend is one more reason why we can tolerate him going through the reality-TV motions of questioning whether the girls’ team will flourish, when we are sure it will. His uniquely nuanced charm, and the important core message Field of Dreams plaintively sends out, still deserve our wholehearted support.Freddie Flintoff’s Field of Dreams: Ultimate Test aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAndrew FlintoffCricketreviewsShareReuse this content",

Unlikely. This summer’s glossy TV treatment of their story, Outrageous, is the latest proof of the aristo-family’s inexhaustible appeal. Amy Rosenthal’s new play may be lucky, or not, to pitch up so soon after.The sisters are so well established by the vast repository of existing content they barely need introduction: the waspish novelist (Nancy), the society beauty (Diana), the Hitler obsessive (Unity), the socialist revolutionary (Decca), and the country-living one who just wants to marry a duke (Debo). Pamela, who spent her life happily married and tending a farm, remains staunchly off stage.The Kardashians of history: why are we so obsessed with the Mitford sisters?Read moreRosenthal’s play explores how their political passions affected the sibling dynamic. The action foregrounds and favours “dauntless” Decca who, at 25, found herself a working single mother in the US, after her husband Esmond’s disappearance during the second world war. But it flits back and forth through the sisters’ lives as they each carve out their own escape from familial and societal expectations: elopement, divorce, writing.View image in fullscreenHitler obsessive …  Potter as Unity.Photograph: Mark SeniorRichard Beecham’s direction feels determinedly period, although he is unafraid to mine the absurd and sometimes dangerous humour of the teenage Decca and Unity sharing a bedroom, carving swastikas and hammer-and-sickles into their respective windows. The sight of young people fascinated by fascism and family members estranged by their polarised viewpoints hints at plenty in the Mitfords’ story that might speak acutely to today, not least the fear that we’re living the 1930s all over again.But this drawing-room drama never really gets us there. Elisabeth Dermot Walsh finds the chill factor as the older Diana, still spouting holocaust denial, and Ell Potter is a convincingly unstable Unity. There’s no sense, however, of the younger Diana as the beguiling influence she is claimed to be.More convincing than the sororal bonds is the chemistry between Emma Noakes’s Decca and her colleague in the American rationing department,Bob Treuhaft(an engaging performance from Joe Coen). It’s a romance that helps to ground the play – but not to shed new light on this well-worn tale.Touring until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreThe Mitford sistersreviewsShareReuse this content",

It’s an important attempt to do justice to a deeply dark taleRachel AroestiSun 7 Sep 2025 17.00 EDTShareWhen exactly is true crime a force for good? It’s a question we should probably ask ourselves every single time we consume something in this lurid and inevitably exploitative genre. Death of a Showjumper is, in many ways, a standardly sensationalised account of a young woman’s murder: paced for maximum dramatic intensity; details judiciously withheld to spin the most compulsively watchable yarn. But its broader subject matter – the epidemic ofviolence against women, and the ways such abuse is silenced, minimised and weaponised against the victims themselves – is one of the few that can justify the existence of a series like this.It’s easy to feel cynical at first. Visually stunning and thematically arresting, Death of a Showjumper’s backdrop is tailor-made for a TV crime drama. It’s set amid the equestrian community of Northern Ireland, and we are transported to a place brimming with bucolic beauty as well as “secrets and silence”. The lifestyle is familiar but subtly alien: horses are ubiquitous and the associated culture not reserved for toffs – the hunt is an adrenaline sport for skilled riders. And 21-year-old Katie Simpson was one.Simpson’s world revolved around horses: this three-part documentary portrays her as a hard worker with huge potential and an irreverent sense of humour (she named her horse Satan). But in August 2020, Simpson’s friends and family were told she had hanged herself from a banister; she died in hospital six days later. To say they were baffled by the circumstances of her death is an understatement. For the journalist Tanya Fowles, this apparent suicide was more than just out of character – it was deeply suspicious.A veteran court reporter who had known Simpson since she was a child, Fowles is one hero of this story. When she found out who had discovered the body, alarm bells grew louder: it was Jonathan Cresswell, the perpetrator of one of the most disturbing domestic abuse cases she had ever covered. He was also the partner of Simpson’s sister; the three of them lived together.When Fowles contacted the police with her concerns, they dismissed her as a nuisance. So she phoned detective sergeant James Brannigan – the other hero here – who Fowles remembered had once cracked a domestic abuse murder without a body. The pair’s pursuit of justice in the face of authorities who were ambivalent at best (Brannigan also met with significant resistance from colleagues) is the stuff of bleak cop drama that somehow ends up restoring your faith in humanity. Cresswell was chillingly close to getting away with murder; Brannigan put him on trial against all the odds, risking his own career in the process.This strand of the story may be TV-friendly, but the rest is mired in almost inconceivable darkness. We get a lengthy account from Cresswell’s ex-girlfriend Abigail Lyle – now a dressage rider who represented Ireland in the 2024 Olympics – of the abuse she suffered at his hands. It proves that Cresswell was a depraved and dangerous monster. But, after his release from a brief stint in prison, locals threw a party for him, while Lyle was ostracised. The community’s response was, by the sounds of it, a combination of denial and contempt for anyone accusing a charming man of heinous violence. Many were under Cresswell’s spell. Jill Robinson, another ex-girlfriend, is interviewed extensively here; she was one of three women eventually convicted of perverting the course of justice or withholding information, contributing to the cover-up of Simpson’s murder. However poorly judged Robinson’s behaviour was – she claims she had no idea how Simpson died – it is clear she was one of Cresswell’s victims too.Death of a Showjumper concludes amid a cloud of hopelessness. Due to events not revealed until the final episode, there are numerous aspects of this crime that will never be uncovered. Meanwhile, Brannigan quit his job owing to his frustrations with the case and the intimidation he experienced in the police during his investigations. More generally, the programme hammers home how widely tolerated domestic violence remains. (It partly attributes this to the rural, insular area Cresswell and Simpson were from, but the proper context is a merciless global patriarchy, not the equestrian community of County Armagh.)There is a fine line between using a harrowing crime to create entertainment, and using entertainment to exact some semblance of justice. Death of a Showjumper may reel in viewers using a litany of true-crime tricks of the trade, but it is a valuable endeavour in itself. This is a series made propulsive and gripping by teasing the prospect of Cresswell finally paying for his crimes. By telling Simpson’s story as comprehensively as possible, it ends up being the closest we’ll ever get.Death of a Showjumper aired on Sky Documentaries and is on NowIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

His 1928 trench tragedy Journey’s End, a drama for doomed youth, became a school play staple and has beenfilmedor televised, with degrees of looseness, six times, as well as explicitly being a model for Blackadder Goes Forth.As can happen to authors of a classic, Sherriff suffered from his other output being overlooked, but the punchy above-pub Tabard theatre in west London has revived Home at Seven, a now forgotten 1950 success. In a curious parallel to the Blackadder link, Home at Seven’s main cultural prominence has been in Dad’s Army studies, as the play in which the Captain Mainwaring actor Arthur Lowe was touring the UK when he died in 1982.Whereas Journey’s End takes place mid-battle, Home at Seven is set five years into peace – though everything is still inflected by the second world war. Assistant bank manager David Preston (Sam Ellis) was an air raid warden and serves on the committee of a social club with a Major (Karl Moffat) struggling to reproduce his significance during the hostilities.At the titular time on a Tuesday evening, Preston returns to his Bromley house after an apparently routine commute. But he is convinced it’s Monday, and finds that his distraught wife – called on the cast list, in a dating detail, only Mrs Preston (Bridget Lambert) – has believed him missing for 24 hours.View image in fullscreenA tribe of professionals … Greg Fitch as Inspector Hemingway and Andrew Williams as Dr Sparling, with Ellis as David Preston.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHome at Seven premiered in London four years after JB Priestley’s An Inspector Calls and two years beforeThe Mousetrapby Agatha Christie, whose murder mysteries were already a West End fixture. Sherriff seems to shadow both dramatists. One of numerous solutions of the plot – the audience is finally left to decide – is a Priestley-like time-slip. But, after a murder is reported, this may also be a whodunnit, with a cop interrogating shifty suspects including Preston.Mysterious people are hard to play because, while the writer requires the audience to be unsure, an actor must decide at every moment what the character knows or is withholding. The superb Ellis facially and physically offers clues to when Preston might be confused or deliberately confusing others. Modern theatre dramaturgs and accountants would baulk at a brief last-minute appearance. But, taking advantage of mid-20th century largesse, Sherriff penultimately surrenders the stage to a barmaid, Peggy (impressive 2025 drama school graduate Maddie Crofts), whose clarification of events enjoyably further muddies them.A sign of the play’s time is that the other professionals drawn by Preston’s mystery – a GP, detective and solicitor – are all white men of similar age, but Claire Evans’ production neatly treats them as a tribe, in which Andrew Williams, Greg Fitch and Jeremy Todd find individual lives. This welcome rediscovery suitably marks the 50th anniversary of Sherriff’s death and the 40th birthday of the enterprising Tabard.AtTabard theatre, London, until 20 September, then touringExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content",

They have backgrounds in fashion (Vera, from Porto) and photography (Cam, from Los Angeles), and the restoration looks great: original features, calming colour schemes and locally made textiles and artworks.Foodand wine is part of the package – the couple serve healthy brunches and dinners made with Alentejo produce, run cheese- and jam-making workshops and cooking classes, and organise visits to artisanal bakeries, wineries, organic farms and local markets. They also run a three-night sustainable food and wine retreat, and a “not so serious” surf, yoga and wine retreat.The newest rooms are in the forest, a few minutes’ walk away from the communal areas, and are multilevel with terraces for sunset views. There are also rooms and apartments in the old country houses; the whole property sleeps 23 (no children under 12) and is pet-friendly.There are gardens with vegetable plots; a pool, gym, yoga studio and sauna; and hiking trails. Cercal is a short walk away, and it is a 15-minute drive to surf beaches.

Get the ratio of this three-tier national treasure wrong,as the New York Times stood accusedof doing in 2021, when its Instagram account posted a picture of squares that one user described as “an insult to Canadians everywhere”, and you’ll discover you can push them only so far.The Times is not alone in attracting ire. So popular are nanaimo (pronounced nuh-NYE-mo) bars, named after the British Columbian logging and mining town where they are said to have originated, that Canada Post put them on a stamp in 2019 … only to face similarhowls of outrage, albeit in Canadian: “One hesitates to be critical,” Nanaimo’s mayor explained carefully, “but it’s not a very accurate depiction.”View image in fullscreenFelicity’s perfect nanaimo bars – cue ‘howls of outrage’. Thumbnail pics by Felicity.In short, Canadians, who in 2006 voted the nanaimo bar the “nation’s favourite confection”, feel very strongly about these sugary little treats, a mainstay of kids’ birthday parties, wedding buffets and funeral teas from Nanaimo to Nova Scotia, though if Justin Trudeau had any problem withthe version served upby White House chefs during his state dinner with Barack Obama in 2016, he was too polite to say so. Please don’t hold back in the comments below – I’m British, I can take it.The baseBefore I tasted a nanaimo bar, I had assumed that the base, whose principal ingredients are biscuit and desiccated coconut, was the kind of crunchy affair usually found on the bottom of cheesecakes. I was wrong. With the exception of the Canadian Living recipe, which sticks it in the oven for 10 minutes to dry it out, the nanaimo relies on the coagulating power of refrigeration, rather than on heat.View image in fullscreenCanadian Living’s nanaimo bars swear by ‘moist, sweet coconut’ for texture.Revelation two: instead of the large lumps of biscuit suspended in chocolate that one might expect in a British fridge cake, this base is made from fine crumbs soaked in sweet, cocoa-flavoured butter, giving it a soft, almost squidgy texture. Once I’ve come to terms with this fact (I do love a crunchy base), I need to decide the best replacement for the graham cracker crumbs demanded by Canadian recipes. Graham (pronounced “gram”) crackers, are a peculiarly North American phenomenon named after whatthe Encyclopedia Britannica describesas the “eccentric … clergyman and health reformer” Sylvester Graham, who travelled around early 19th-century New England warning against the dangers of lust, as incited by, among other things, refined sugars and grains. His unsweetened, fatless crackers were made from coarsely ground wholemeal wheat flour. Modern equivalents, Britannica explains, “would likely be unrecognisable to Graham, as they are typically made with refined white flour, sugar and trans fats, and are flavoured with honey or cinnamon; chocolate varieties are also common”.They are also £18 a box online, excluding delivery, which means they will not feature in my recipe, though I do buy a bag of graham cracker crumbs to try to work out the nearest equivalent. To my surprise, they’re a fine, if slightly gritty powder, rather than a crumb, with a flavour somewhere between a British digestive and a rich tea biscuit. The original texture feels somewhat irrelevant, so, having given rich tea, digestives and Hobnobs (a suggestionfrom the Cupcake Jemma team here in the UK) a try, I conclude that you should go with whichever takes your fancy. Personally, I enjoy the more restrained sweetness of a rich tea, but you might yearn for the oaty nubbliness of a Hobnob or the more malty flavour of a digestive. That said, I’ve deliberately left in a few larger chunks to give the base a more interesting texture, which may be offensive to nanaimo purists – in which case, keep whizzing.(I do try baking my own graham crackers usinga recipefrom Deb at Smitten Kitchen, which, for some reason, possibly relating to metric conversions, end up sticky, chewy and hard to grind – they taste good, but as far as I’m concerned they add an unnecessary layer of complexity to proceedings; the nanaimo bar was designed to use processed ingredients, and I’m happy to let that spirit live on in mine.)View image in fullscreenSusan Mendelson nanaimo bars feature the most popular base.The biscuits are bulked out by that typically British Columbian ingredient, coconut – the Zingerman’s Bakehouse Celebrate Every Daybookcalls for fresh,chef Susan Mendelson, whose recipe Margaret Atwood included in her 1987 Canlit Foodbook, unsweetened shredded stuff, and Serious Eats and Canadian Living magazine advise the more moist, sweetened kind. The last is not readily available in the UK, butnigella.comsays you can readily substitute it by stirring sugar and hot water into the desiccated stuff. Fresh coconut leaves the biscuit layer too wet, and almost like trifle, while the sweetened sort only adds to the sugar content, so straightforward desiccated feels the best and easiest choice.Nuts also feature. Atwood, the New York Times confides, favours walnuts, but Joyce Hardcastle, whoserecipe won a nanaimo contestto nail down an official version back in 1986, specifies finely chopped almonds, while Mendelson offers a choice of “finely chopped walnuts, almonds or pecans (or a mixture)”. Like the great novelist, I have a strong preference for the bitterness of walnuts, which echo and enhance those in the cocoa, making for a pleasingly rich, almost fruity contrast with the sweetness of the other layers. Toast them, as Zingerman’s suggests, to really bring out their flavour and, while you’re at it, why not do the same with the coconut?On binding and thicknessThe crumbs, coconut and nuts are suspended in a kind of ganache made from melted butter stirred over heat with sugar and egg, and flavoured with cocoa powder. The most popular base is Mendelson’s from the New York Times, which contains the lowest ratio of butter and sugar to nuts and crumbs, though I will be increasing the cocoa content slightly to ramp up those bitter notes. I don’t see any benefit in baking it, though; that just makes it crumbly and hard to cut.View image in fullscreenOnly Molly Allen’s nanaimo bars include some salt to balance the sweetness.At the risk of provoking Canadian ire – I’m desperate to come and visit, so this is a risky business – the base absolutely should be thicker than the custard or chocolate, because these are, in truth, mere icings, gilding the lily with sweetness and fat. Too much of a good thing is still too much, unless you spend all day working outside in sub-zero temperatures. Then you get a pass.The custardSpoiler alert: this isn’t actually custard, it’s custard-flavoured buttercream – and, in my opinion, and the considered opinion of my testers, the main cause of the common complaint that nanaimo bars are, as the New York Times put it delicately, “tremendously sweet” (this from the country that invented marshmallow fluff). That’s because most of the recipes I try cram icing (powdered) sugar into butter at a ratio of 8:1 – for context,Mary Berry’s buttercreamuses two parts icing sugar to one part butter. Only Hardcastle andthe Serious Eats version, by Canadian writer and former bakery owner Molly Allen, suggest a more restrained 4:1, though I’ve reduced the sugar content even further to suit my own taste. If you feel it’s lacking, feel free to adjust it as you go. Bonus: a lower sugar content makes for a lighter consistency, particularly if, as in those same two recipes, you loosen it with milk rather than double cream.View image in fullscreenJoyce Hardcastle ‘specifies’ finely chopped almonds in her nanaimo bars. So take note.Note that almost every recipe I try, with the exception ofCanadian Living, specifies unsalted butter, with Hardcastle going as far as to call for “European-style cultured” butter, which has been allowed to ferment before churning, giving it a slightly tangier, more complex flavour. This, I have no hesitation in telling you, is a complete waste of money, because no one is able to detect anything about the butter once it’s been drowned in sugar. Only Allen recommends including some salt to balance all the sweetness – personally, I’d just use salted butter to begin with anyway, not least because that’s what I keep on hand, but, however you include it, salt is a must.The unusual part about the nanaimo bar is the use of custard powder as a flavouring; traditionally,our very own Bird’s, which suits me just fine. American recipes often propose “vanilla pudding mix” as a substitute, but for once I have just the thing on the shelf already. As a cornflour custard devotee, I’d recommend dissolving it, along with some sugar, in milk before whipping it in, to avoid that slightly powdery finish common to all those I try.Allen and Canadian Living are also unusual in using vanilla extract to ramp up the custard powder’s “flavouring”. For me, one of the charms of Bird’s custard is this nostalgic artificial vanilla flavour, but if you avoid ultra-processed foods, then by all means use cornflour and genuine vanilla extract instead, but otherwise I see no reason to spoil things with the real, highly perfumed deal.The chocolateChocolate is chocolate – for me, 70% cocoa and butter makes a fine topping. You could experiment with adding flavourings such as orange zest or the New York Times’ sea salt, though I don’t think the combination of nutmeg and custard can be improved upon.The construction and slicingView image in fullscreenZingerman’s bakehouse toasts its nuts –andits coconuts, which then go into these nanaimo bars.The single most important thing I learn in this whole process is patience. Chill each layer thoroughly before adding the next, and everything will be much easier, a detail tactfully omitted from many of the recipes I try. (If you’re Canadian, no doubt you justknow.) The crumb layer needs to be solid enough for the buttercream to spread easily on top, and the buttercream should be firm enough to take the warm chocolate afterwards without melting into it. Oh, and line that tin, unless you want to end up with scratches.As Allen notes, nanaimo bars are best served cold from the fridge, rather than at room temperature, whatever some recipes claim. “You can also let them come to room temperature for several minutes, if you prefer, you’ll just have to be prepared for very soft chocolate and custard layers,” she allows, though perhaps my fridge is Canadian room temperature.

Tip out and leave to cool slightly. In the same pan, toast the coconut until it’s apricot-coloured, then tip out likewise. Use a food processor (or the end of rolling pin and a plastic bag) to smash the biscuits into uneven crumbs; a few larger chunks are fine. Roughly grind the nuts in a food processor or mortar, again leaving several large chunks and being careful not to overprocess and turn them into butter.View image in fullscreenPut the butter and sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter melts. Meanwhile, put the biscuit crumbs, nuts and coconut in a large bowl, and line a roughly 20cm x 20cm baking tin with baking paper (scrunch it up first to help ease it into the corners and sides).Stir the cocoa and a pinch of salt into the butter and sugar bowl, then add the egg and stir until the mix thickens slightly (you may need to whisk it). Off the heat, combine with the biscuit, nut and coconut mixture and, once that’s all coated, tip it into the lined tin and pat down firmly into an even, flat layer. Cover and freeze for 10 minutes (or chill for 30), until firm.View image in fullscreenMeanwhile, put the butter for the custard layer in a large bowl or stand mixer and beat until soft. Sift over the icing sugar, then beat in until the mixture is really soft and airy. In a small bowl, stir the custard powder and milk until the powder dissolves, then beat this, and a pinch of salt, if necessary, into the custard mixture. Using a spatula or similar, spread this on top of the now chilled and firm biscuit base, taking care not to get too many crumbs into the custard, then cover and chill again for at least an hour, until really firm.View image in fullscreenMelt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, and grate in the nutmeg, if using. Take off the heat, leave to cool slightly, then tip on top of the butter layer and tilt the tin so the chocolate spreads evenly. Bang the tin against a counter to settle the chocolate layer, then cover and return to the fridge. After about 20 minutes, once the chocolate has begun to set, but is still tacky, score into bars or squares, then return to the fridge to set solid.View image in fullscreenTo cut, lift out of the tin (use the paper lining to help you), then slice – to make life easier, use a knife dipped into hot water and quickly wiped dry. Covered, the nanaimo bars will keep well in the fridge for up to five days, and can also be wrapped and frozen.View image in fullscreenNanaimo bars: Canadian icon, or a poor third to poutine and butter pies?

To be fair, my use of the word “precinct” to describe this lovingly titivated landmark feels a bit shabby, as does “retail experience”. And plain old “mall” definitely won’t do, because Battersea’s collection of 150-odd shops is very much in the la-di-da, aspirational, lululemon, Mulberry and Malin+Goetz range of money-frittering, all set over multiple floors with dramatic mezzanines. This is a sumptuous paean to industrial chic, with pleasing air-conditioning and polished floors, and there is currently no more jocund and luxurious a place in London to spend money you don’t have on things you don’t need.View image in fullscreen‘Plump, voluptuous, wobbly’: the Duck & Rice’shar gauprawn dumplings.In keeping with all this luxury, Battersea’s flagship restaurant right now is the new Duck & Rice, created 10 years ago by the renowned Hong Kong-born British restaurateurAlan Yau OBE, who also founded the likes ofWagamama,YauatchaandHakkasan. The original Duck & Rice’s claim was that it was a Chinese gastropub, which, to my mind, confused it as a brand. Yes, it is indeed housed in a former pub on Berwick Street, but at the time it felt more like a very modern Cantonese restaurant that served roast duck, dim sum, “small chow” and wok dishes, most of them around the £10-£15 mark, as well as so-called “hero dishes” such as lobster laksa for £72. Yes, they sell Pilsner Urquell, which in 2015 was very gastropub-ish, but they also offer an array of lychee, chilli and blue curaçao cocktails, which is, well, a bit Ritzy’s nightclub.At the new Duck & Rice Battersea, however, they have £415 bottles of Vega Sicilia, which isn’t at all gastropub, and much more quaffing an oligarch’s cellar with George Osborne while celebrating the glorious 12th. This is made all the more peculiar by the fact that you’re indulging in such pompery at a restaurant that has the dystopian address of “Unit L1-003, Level 1, Phase 2”, and that’s next door to a champagne bar calledControl Room B.Even so, I find the Duck & Rice Battersea fascinating, not least because the great British public are, in 2025, still yet to fully submit to spending big money on important dinners inside shopping centres. The food courts of Westfield, theTrafford Centreand so on are swamped with all manner of casual dining options, but for important anniversaries and birthday dinners, we still lean towards bricks and mortar down the high street or, even better, in some bucolic setting or other.View image in fullscreenThe house special at the Duck & Rice in Battersea: ‘£25 for a glossy, crispy, medium-rare fillet of duck laid across white rice with a bit of cucumber.’Yet here is a restaurant in Battersea power station, just along the way from a pilates studio and a luxury gilet shop, that isn’t really your typical bowl-of-noodles stopgap joint. When we arrived on a Tuesday lunchtime, we were to start with the only guests, but there were 22 cooks in the kitchen, three bartenders and four floor staff. This is a gargantuan space with little about it to love. Still, a round of plump, voluptuous, wobbly freshhar gau, stuffed to nigh bursting with shrimp, were delicious, as was a plate of venison puffs where crisp, warm, buttery pastry meets rich, long-stewed meat. A “Duck old fashioned” with Volcán de mi Tierra tequila and Mozart dark chocolate liqueur was punchy, even if it rather ripped up the rulebook of what an old fashioned should be.For mains, we ordered the classic duck and rice house special, a vegan option of glass noodles with tofu mince and a wildcard Indonesian dish of Assam chilli prawns. After they appeared, however, we entered what I call the “service Siberia” stage of a meal, when no server speaks to or looks at us ever again. Those main courses were filling, but largely unmemorable: £25 for a glossy, crispy, medium-rare fillet of duck laid across white rice with a bit of cucumber, and tofu noodles that could really have done with more oomph, heat and spark; the whopping great chilli king prawns, on the other hand, were possibly the highlight of the meal: fiery as heck, and in a fragrant pool of bright red, tamarind-heavy sauce.View image in fullscreenThe Duck & Rice’s vegan glass noodles and minced soya claypot ‘could really have done with more oomph’.I might even have lingered over ashoumeiwhite tea or imperialpu erinfusion and leafed through the dessert menu, but the moment we finished the prawns, the bill was plonked on the table. By this stage, there were still only eight other guests, so you might think they’d have liked me to stay and spend more money, even if only to make the place look just a bit busier. After all, if there’s one thing for sure at Battersea power station, it’s that there are plenty of other places where I can spend my cash.The Duck & RiceUnit L1-003, Level 1, Phase 2, Battersea power station, London SW11, 020-3327 7881.
