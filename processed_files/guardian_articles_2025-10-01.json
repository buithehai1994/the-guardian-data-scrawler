Aides had met in Chequers at the beginning of the summer to find Starmer had reams of notes on his vision of how to address the rising tide of nationalism.What most in the hall could not see but were clear to anybody watching on television were the stony faces of cabinet ministers sitting in the front row for much of his address.The four days in Liverpool followed a predictable dramatic arc. Andy Burnham was thename on everyone’s lipsat the beginning of conference but the butt of jokes from the main stage by the end.Starmer, under pressure to give the speech of his life, delivered what many of his party had been waiting to hear: afull-throated defenceof progressive values as the antidote to Reform, with no more equivocation.Summing it up, one senior adviser said: “National renewal, patriotism, clear dividing lines between us and the left and the right, aimed directly at middle Britain.”A minister said: “He finally made an emotional connection. Also scrappy and defiant, which is always good when your back’s to the wall.”But any suggestion that Starmer has silenced his critics and left his rival chastened would be a chronically naive misreading of the grim mood among many cabinet ministers and MPs.“If this conference had been held two weeks ago, I believe there might have been the possibility of a leadership challenge now,” a senior Labour politician said. “As it stands, I think a combination of the right speech and the conduct ofAndy Burnhamhas saved Keir for now. If I was Keir I would send him a bunch of flowers.”A cabinet minister said: “I don’t think this is over for Burnham, far from it. The commentator class has decided he fluffed it and it isn’t the comms strategy I would have deployed. But underneath all that, everyone knows his diagnosis of the peril we are facing is correct. Come next May, he might look like the Cassandra we should have all listened to. Maybe he will come back with better advisers and an actual strategy.”The strategy will need to be an inventive one: multiple sources said Morgan McSweeney had let it be known he would never let Burnham stand in a byelection while he openly planned to challenge the leader.Starmer still has many ministers and MPs willing him to succeed and who have been reassured by the speech he gave. One cabinet minister said: “It was always clear that Boris Johnson’s leadership was going to implode at some point. The same goes for Jeremy Corbyn’s. But that’s not the case here – the possibilities are wide open. Anything could happen.”At least five cabinet ministers said they believed there would be a moment of reckoning for Starmer in May wereLabourto lose in Wales and Scotland and lose a sweep of councils, especially in London. “He is a very decent man,” one minister said. “I think if there does come a moment where the country seems otherwise irreversibly on the path towards Farage then he would do the right thing and clear the way.”But another minister disagreed. “This is not likeHartlepool, when he came close to resigning. He was miserable then. He actually does like being prime minister, especially what he can do on the international stage. I do not think he would resign easily after all we’ve fought for.”Cabinet ministers spoke in private of being worried that Starmer had isolated himself too much from them, and a feeling that “the shutters have been coming down” when he feels under pressure.They said those who had pushed No 10 on Gaza had in particular felt a degree of distance since. One said Starmer had shown he was not open enough to being challenged – and they repeated the idea that although Burnham had been too forthright in his criticism, the substance of his concerns about the party stifling debate was valid.Senior cabinet ministers and other veterans politicians over the course of conference described agonising repeated attempts to get Starmer and No 10 to respond quicker to the threats of the far right. “It’s an analogue operation in a world which will not wait for them,” one cabinet minister said.In the lead-up to conference, MPs had been sharing on WhatsApp an anonymously authored piece titled “What did we learn on our summer holidays?”. Written on the day after the divisive reshuffle, it warned in florid and sometimes tortured prose of impending disaster for the party.“Labour won power in the old era but it is governing in the new, in a world it did not expect and in a country it does not know,” it said. “Cathartic crises have not produced positive change in Labour but political inertia. The party retains its old atrophying instincts and repeats its mistakes, ad nauseum.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The atmosphere in conference receptions and the bars around the Albert Dock was if anything more upbeat than atlast year’s strangely pessimistic conferencepost election victory.But several MPs remarked that it was hard to find much of the grassroots in between wall-to-wall lobbyists. Many junior ministers had stayed in London to get to grips with new briefs.Two Labour-linked firms, Arden Strategies and Anacta, had pop-up venues in the centre of the conference courtyard, black alien-spaceship structures for talks and events, branding that decorated the backdrops of all the cabinet walking into conference.Among aides in No 10, there is a feeling that Starmer has for now silenced many of his public critics. He will spend much of the next week out of the country, during the rest of the parliamentary recess for the Conservative party conference, though some allies are worried that he will “leave the pitch” having just started a fight with Farage.Due back in Westminster in a week’s time, factions of MPs are beefing up. Receptions for the “red wall” group andblue LabourMPs were full to bursting. The Burnham-backedMainstream groupplans more interventions.And the previously loyalist but increasingly impatientLabour Growth group, which counts dozens of ambitious new MPs among its members, announced a formal partnership with the Good Growth Foundation thinktank, a sign it will start a new muscular approach to publicly pitching policy that it believes the Treasury should offer.Among those MPs, there is still a feeling that the government’s fundamental lack of ambition to tackle complex problems with the economy will be its eventual downfall.Burnham left the conference venue before Starmer’s speech on Tuesday. His name may have been on the lips of MPs and members at the start of conference but there was another at the end: Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary.In fringe events, Mahmood exuded the confidence of a minister who knew that an entire reshuffle had been more or less engineered toget her into the Home Office. On Monday she swept through the conference to take the stage, ready to puta difficult argumentbefore Labour activists.Mahmood’s speech received less than a minute of applause. One seasoned journalist thought the audience may have been a little stunned by her punchy language and her wish to connect the rise of “ethno-nationalism” with the rise in legal and illegal migration.While the party seemed to be struggling with Mahmood’s proposed measures, the media were not. The following day, her speech and thefringe meetingreceived a tide of positive headlines from newspapers across the political spectrum.Asked would she ever consider taking on the job of prime minister, Mahmood, who attempts to respond to even the most difficult questions, declined to rule herself out. “You shouldn’t believe anyone in politics who says they’re not ambitious about the top job,” she said, “because they’re basically lying to you.”Explore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025LabourKeir StarmerAndy BurnhamnewsShareReuse this content"

Surely not! Not our fearless Nige! The man who is never happier than when he can cast himself as the outsider – a lone voice speaking truth to power. When he can control the narrative. A saviour rising from these streets. The politician who only knows he’s alive when the cameras are rolling. That’s the character Farage wants you to believe in.So you’d have thought that Nige would have been thrilled by Keir Starmer’s speech to theLabourparty conference on Tuesday. A whole hour pretty much devoted to him. The recognition that he was now the real leader of the opposition. The hostility only underlining his sense of importance. That he was now living rent-free in Starmer’s head. That he had the government precisely where he wanted it. Let the campaign for the next general election start now.Only it didn’t quite play out like that. Instead, Nige looked rattled. Angry even. Trying to look prime ministerial in front of a couple of flags as he gave his response on social media, but merely looking slightly unhinged. Confused that Starmer had somehow deviated from Nige’s own script. That Keir had drawn a line in the sand between what was and what wasn’t racist, between decency and division, and had found Farage to be on the wrong side of it.It turns out that Nige can dish it out but he can’t take it. I’ve heard more Farage speeches than is good for my health and I can’t remember Nige once saying something nice about Starmer. He’s called him a liar, he’s called him unfit to be prime minister and all sorts in between. Including danger to the country. But he’s never once said that deep down he’s an OK bloke. If Nige now thinks that our politics has become seriously toxic he might care to think about where the decline set in.You would have thought that with a night to sleep on it, Reform would have had a more measured response to Starmer’s speech on the Wednesday morning media round. A chance to make their case. To say that Nige might have been a little hasty. Not a bit of it. If anything, Zia Yusuf was more deranged than his boss. The 15-minute interview on Sky News was a collector’s item. Wilfred Frost, the unfortunate TV host, looked as if he needed a lie down once it was over.Yusuf started with a bold assertion. That if someone supported a racist policy then they were de facto racists. Given that most people seem to believe that Reform’s plan to deport some people with indefinite leave to remain is racist, then Zia is presumably quite happy to accept that some of his party’s supporters are racist. Quite the admission. Not how I’d have wanted to frame the argument if I was him.But this was just for openers. Then we got to the heart of the matter. Yusuf was appalled by Starmer’s speech. It had been vicious, vindictive and inflammatory. An attempt to demonise Nige. As such it had been an incitement to violence. Here was the crux of it. Starmer knew that he couldn’t beat Farage at the ballot box so he was trying to have him assassinated.“There’s a term known as ‘stochastic terrorism’,” Zia went on. It meant to whip up so much hatred that one supporter takes it on themselves to kill the target. And that was what Starmer had been doing. It was almost certainly the first time the prime minister has been called a terrorist on live news. Time and again, Frost invited Yusuf to back down. To qualify his language. But Zia wasn’t having any of it. Starmer was a terrorist. The one aim of his speech had been to incite someone to kill Farage. Everything else was a smokescreen. Yusuf alone knew the truth. You wonder what he makes of Nige’s speeches.Now Zia went deeper into the Reform conspiracy theories. Just two weeks ago the parliamentary authorities had reduced Farage’s security detail. This wasn’t because the level of protection had been deemed unnecessary and excessive. It was because Starmer – the orders had very definitely come right from the top of government – was deliberately trying to make it easier for someone to kill Farage.Nigel Farage: what are schoolboy racism claims – and why have they resurfaced?Read moreBy now Frost was beginning to look a bit desperate. He tried to change the subject by exploring the racism in Reform’s policies. But Zia wasn’t bothered about a bit of recreational racism. Who cared if hundreds of thousands of brown people working in the NHS got deported? That was nothing compared with the bigger story. The whole of the media and the rest of the country had been duped by the conference speech. It wasn’t a state-of-the-nation epic. It was a licence to kill. “HE’S A TERRORIST. HE’S A TERRORIST,” shouted Yusuf.All of which rather overshadowed the final day of theLabour conference. Which was presumably just fine by the Labour party. After all, having had your leader’s speech on the penultimate day is a sure sign that you want everyone to bugger off home on the Tuesday night. A quick thought. If you want a three-day conference next year, just book it. There’s no need to include the Wednesday. You’d save the party a lot of money.Predictably then, the conference area was a bit of a ghost town on the last day. Ed Miliband did his best to rally the troops but next year he will be begging not to be given the graveyard slot. He’s one of the few ministers who knows how to give a speech.Shabana Mahmood wrapped things up. We lucky few. “We’re here for the panels not the parties,” she said to a depleted hall. She didn’t sound as if she meant it. More that she had drawn the short straw and would rather have been on a train home.Explore more on these topicsReform UKThe politics sketchNigel FarageLabour conference 2025Labour conferenceLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The latter is a red pepper and garlic relish, hailing from the Balkans. “It’s homemade,” she says, given to her by a friend. Her Irish assistant, Declan, who cooked the lamb, bustles around her amicably. Abramović is amicable too, offering me the chops and lathering ajvar on to a rice cake for me to taste (delicious).It is a disarmingly cosy welcome from the high priestess of performance art. Then again, this might be the quiet before the storm. Her new show, Balkan Erotic Epic, a four-hour performance conceived and directed by Abramović and commissioned by Factory International, may ruffle some feathers. More than 70 actors, dancers and local performers will feature in 13 scenes that enact ancient ritual, rites and folklore from Slavic tradition. Many contain nudity and act out explicit eroticism that arises out of the tales collected from Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Greece, Turkey, Serbia, and more.She points to a phallus that looks like a long thin neck. ‘We call that one Giacometti,’ she says“I found out,” she says, “that these ancient rituals for farming, for childbirth, for weddings, for funerals, with absolutely no exception, used the genitals – the vagina and the penis – in so many different ways.” Screens, film, music and animation will accompany live performance and fill the monumental 64-metre long, 21-metre high dimensions of Aviva Studios.It is the most important project of her life, she says, with an aim to rediscover the past and our present selves through it. It is significant for Aviva Studios, too. John McGrath, its artistic director, says the venue was partly built with Abramović in mind. “When we were developing the building, she was right at the top of our list. We felt she could do something amazing here.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve never done anything so complex’... Abramović and cast.Photograph: Marco AnelliInitially, she proposed a collaboration with Lady Gaga, but that changed after an emergency meeting in which she introduced this idea. Is Abramović scared by its maximalist scale? “Oh my God! First of all, my works are very minimal. This is not minimal. I’ve never done anything so complex, so daring … I wake up in the middle of the night. I’ve never been like this for any other work.”That’s saying something for an artist who in previous works has had a bow-and-arrow aimed at her heart by her former partner, the artist Ulay, lost consciousness inside a burning wooden star and famously sat in the same chair for 700 hours at New York’s MoMA. And those are justsomeof her gruelling exercises in pain and endurance.This show is clearly personal for Abramović, who was born and raised in former Yugoslavia, now Serbia. It begins with the funeral of its one-time communist leader Josip Broz Tito and ends with wedding revelries. There is a world of ritual in between, from filmed clips of women beating their breasts in mourning to dancing skeletons and a giant orgy.I expect a lot of criticism but that just proves the point – we don’t accept our own historyThere will be Albanian warrior women alongside men “penetrating” the soil as part of a fertility rite, and a homoerotic dance between an Albanian and Serbian (politically, they are “mutual enemies”) while a pregnant woman will be soaked in milk, in keeping with Romany ritual. There will also be a “mushroom garden” populated by five-metre penises growing out of the ground. Abramović shows me a miniature picture of it and points to a phallus resembling a long thin neck: “We call that one Giacometti.”Nearly 79, the artist is warm and delightfully unboundaried, linking arms as we walk, looking ageless in head-to-toe black, with gleaming red nails and a pale-skinned glamour. Will her body be part of this piece? “I don’t promise anything: maybe, maybe not.” She will introduce the show to audiences each night, but beyond that, she admits, “I find it extremely difficult to direct and be a part of it at the same time.”Is she worried that a British audience will find it all terribly embarrassing, or be scandalised? She has had a taste ofthatalready – in 2023, when Imponderabilia,featuring anaked couple in a doorway, was staged as part of her retrospective at the Royal Academy in London (re-enacted from 1977 when she conceived it with Ulay). It was all the tabloids could talk about, she says, rather than the meaning of the work itself. Yet, at the same time, “nakedness brings so much power because people are scared, interested, amused and intrigued. So I accept an audience seeing this over four hours will have lots of different emotions. They will be shocked, amused because there’s humour in it, disturbed, and they will be emotional.”View image in fullscreen‘I went back into mythology within Slavic culture’ … the artist at rehearsals.Photograph: Marco AnelliA rehearsal of a funeral scene contains just this churn of emotions as a dead, naked man is slowly dressed by a woman while an ensemble dances to a Serbian lament. It weaves grief – wailing and sobbing – with romance and erotica, as do other scenes in the show (the orgy has skeletons writhing between living bodies).To those who might equate it to pornography, Abramović would say it is emphatically not. It is too elemental, and earnest, for that. Female performers have even been asked not to shave their underarm and pubic hair for three months beforehand.“For me, these rituals deal with the history of human beings. It’s about humanity, not about pornography. That’s incredibly important.” Still, she says, “I expect a lot of criticism because it’s so easy to criticise. But that just proves the point that we don’t even accept our own history: I didn’t invent any of these rituals.”The idea for the show was in fact a reactionagainstthe blank-faced performance of sex that pornography offers. In 2006, she made a short movie for a film anthology called Destricted. It featured myths from the Balkans in animated form. She was asked to create a piece about pornography in art after this. “So I started looking at pornos and I found them incredibly boring and repetitive. They had absolutely no substance. I gave up the whole idea and went back into mythology within Slavic culture.”Whatever thetabloids may say,Abramović is excited. Her tone is low-key, her humour deadpan, but she begins to bubble with enthusiasm as she talks. “Let me just show you this,” she says, opening file after file on her laptop, flicking up image upon image.In one wedding day ritual, a groom makes three holes in a bridge, penetrating each one with his penisThere is canny branding alongside the heartfelt exuberance, with accompanying merchandise ready to go. Declan splays open white T-shirts with tastefully sketched breasts on them, along with baseball caps and aprons dotted with black-and-white willies. They are vaguely comic and so cutely inoffensive that I am tempted to ask Declan if he accepts credit card payments.Therewerecertain rituals that couldn’t be performed as part of the show, though, because “they would be crossing all the borders”. Those stories are not excised altogether but told through animation, Abramović explains. So there is a story from 14th-century Croatia that involves a wife putting a fish into her vagina overnight to make a love potion; and, from 14th-century Bosnia, a wedding day ritual to protect against impotence in which a groom makes three holes in a bridge, penetrating each one with his penis.What has led her to create this work now, in a world of so much political tumult, from Ukraine – a war she has publicly criticised – to Gaza, Trump, Putin and Netanyahu. “We have hell,” she says. “That’s why this is so important. I want to go back to the roots of everything.When I went to Glastonbury [to lead seven minutes of silence, en masse, from the Pyramid stage in 2024]everyone told me it was crazy and that no one would do it. But I knew that this was what we needed. The only way to change the world is to change ourselves. But for that, we have to look into our pasts.”Abramović lived in Amsterdam with Ulay for several years before relocating to New York. She does not regret leaving Europe. “There was no stimulus in Amsterdam, even Van Gogh left Amsterdam! I need places with trouble, because then I have a reason [to create art].” And while her work is not always overtly political, it often relates to the current moment.Right now, the US feels “totally divided … There could be civil war,” she says. So if anything can be said or done through art, she is there to do it. “I don’t think art can change the world, but it can definitely contribute in opening the consciousness and asking the right questions. That’s my function.”This work, in which sex and the genitals are shown to play a vital part in community life, may even be healing for our time, she suggests. Because, however much guilt religion imposes on the flesh, sexual and reproductive energy is not an opposing force to spirituality for Abramović. “It is the only energy we have in our bodies. This energy can turn into violence, into aggression, but also into tenderness and love. That is what I’m exploring here.”View image in fullscreen‘Liberating my mother is something I couldn’t do in life, so I’m doing it in this work’ … at rehearsals.Photograph: Marco AnelliBorn a year after the end of the second world war, she was partly raised by her grandmother, who was a deeply religious Orthodox Christian, as was her mother. The latter was a keen supporter of Tito’s regime and strict with her daughter. “I lost my virginity at 24 years old. My mother said that sex was dirty. I was not able to go anywhere … So I needed to rebel. I needed to find out, ‘Who am I?’ I wanted to know all the possibilities of the body and mind – how the body, mind and soul is connected.”The show gathers another layer of intimacy because Abramović has inserted her mother into it, albeit as a fictional character. She emerges in communist uniform – a national hero and decorated army major, ever present, weaving among the 13 scenes, silent and aloof, until she arrives at a scene involving drinking, dancing and nakedness. “She gets more interested, starts dancing and taking off her clothes. Liberating my mother is something I couldn’t do in life, so I’m doing it in this work.”Was her mother proud of her? “It’s so complicated. When I sent her cuttings of my work, she cut out every single page of nudity before showing other people, so 360 pages became about 72 pages. She was thinking I was completely wild and she’d lost control of me.”I hope Trump doesn’t come to see the nakednessAbramović only found out the extent of her mother’s admiration for her when she found her diaries after she died, having had dementia. “If I had read one page of her diary while she was alive, my life would have been different with her. She wanted to make me a warrior. She never kissed me my entire life. Ever. I asked her one day, at 40, why. She said she didn’t want to spoil me.”She intends to celebrate her 80th birthday when this show travels to thePark Avenue Armoryin New York next year. She will throw a gigantic party amid the bare-breasted women and outsized phalluses. “I hope Trump doesn’t come to see the nakedness,” she jokes. But seriously, she will invite everybody who means something to her. “I had a difficult life, I had a good life, I had a more interesting life than I could possibly have imagined. So I want to embrace that moment.”And after that? Well, her diary is fully booked until 2029 and she has just had a knee replacement. She rolls up her trousers to reveal a long white scar. A German film-maker recently called her up, wanting to make a retrospective of her life, on her 80th. “I said no,” she says, deadpan. “It’s too early for that.”Balkan Erotic Epic is atAviva Studios, Manchester, from 9-19 October followed by an international tourExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMarina AbramovićPerformance artinterviewsShareReuse this content"

How to cope with national sporting despairAdrian ChilesAmerica’s Ryder Cup defeat sparked some ugly behaviour among their fans. But, as some of us know all too well, losing can be a bonding experienceWed 1 Oct 2025 12.29 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 15.06 EDTShareIfeel a bit sorry for Americans. They don’t go through enough national sporting despair. OK, they had an invigorating shot of misery last Sunday night losing theRyder Cup, but that was a rare thing for them. It’s rare because they’re so dominant in all the team sports they really care about, not least because their biggest team sports – certainly NFL and baseball – aren’t played by anyone else. Or at least not to the extent that another nation is ever going to come close to beating them in any meaningful “world cup” competition. Basketball, to be fair, is widely played around the world but essentially the same applies – the US men have been Olympic champions 17 times out of 20; for the women it’s nine out of 12. Ice hockey is slightly different. Here, Americans haven’t had it all their own way, and in Canada have a genuine local rival. This may be one reason Trump makes noises about taking them over.So, why feel sorry for them? For a start, how diminished must be the joy of winning if you’re winning all the time? As a bloke with whom I go to the football always says after a miserable defeat: without despair there is no joy.Losing takes practice, which is why I can almost forgive the pretty despicable behaviour of some of the Americans over the weekendLosing takes practice, which is why I can almost forgive thepretty despicable behaviourof some of those Americans on the course over the weekend. They don’t know how to do it. So they just resort to nastiness. And worse, even after their team had performed brilliantly and nearly pulled off an incredible comeback, they were leaving in droves, storming out in a massive collective sulk. There didn’t seem to be any sticking around to applaud the worthy winners and, more importantly, salute their countrymen who, in the end, did themselves great credit in running Europe so close. Marching off towards the Long Island Railroad, it was like they were all channelling Vince Lombardi: “Show me a good loser,” the NFL coach famously said, “and I’ll show you a loser.” OK, point taken. But he was talking about the athletes rather than their fans.Americans don’t get the chance to come together in support of their national team in the way the rest of us do. It’s such a valuable thing for the people of a nation to go through together, opportunities to feel such unity and belonging being rather rare. And in the really big moments losing is just as valuable as winning, in the sense of all being in it together. The morning after one England final defeat I passed a mother and her young boy on their way to school. They happened to be of Indian heritage. The lad was wearing an England shirt. I made a sad face at the kid, and his mother’s look told me it had been a very difficult evening for the whole family. Me too. We’d all been through it together. The three of us and millions of others. OK, it wouldn’t have been the be-all and end-all for all 60-odd million of us, but it wasn’t nothing either. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all had their moments too, when everyone’s been pulling in the same direction and sharing the same feelings. In Croatia – the other country I care about – it’s been said to me that everyone disagrees with everyone else all the time about everything, until such time as the national football team walks on to the pitch for a big match.I’ve now watched England lose two European Championship finals, and Croatia lose in a World Cup final. On all three occasions I went home bloody miserable, but I’ve never felt more at one with my fellow country folk. Honestly, the Americans don’t know what they’re missing.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Say hello to the television stars whose excellence turned humdrum shows into essential viewingMichael HoganWed 1 Oct 2025 11.31 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 12.34 EDTShareEver find yourself loving a specific character on TV but slightly ambivalent about the show they’re in? Sadly, it happens. Sometimes a scene-stealer finds themselves stranded in a series that doesn’t deserve their brilliance.We’ve cogitated, consulted the archives and compiled a list of fictional creations who were arguably too good for their own shows. Consider it a counterpoint to our recentlist of characters so bad that they ruined shows. Here are 20 great characters in vehicles that weren’t worthy.The Dowager Countess(Downton Abbey)“What is a ‘weekend’?”The mighty Maggie Smith’s waspish one-liners were a beacon of bitchy deliciousness amid all those tedious toffs with upper-class problems. Without the Dowager Countess – or Violet Crawley to her friends (most of whom she loathed) – Julian Fellowes’ stately home saga would have been little more than a soap opera with a Fortnum & Mason account, a wardrobe full of Harris tweed and ideas above its station.Ari Gold(Entourage)View image in fullscreenThe show’s MVP … Jeremy Piven as Ari Gold AKA ‘the poster boy for high blood pressure’ in Entourage.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyWell, can you remember what the others were called? HBO’s 00s hit, loosely based on executive producer Mark Wahlberg’s rise to movie stardom, was basically Men Behaving Badly: Hollywood Edition. Its MVP was the ruthless, ranting agent Ari, played with scenery-gobbling glee by Jeremy Piven. He won three consecutive Emmys as the fast-talking ten-percenter, dubbed “the poster boy for high blood pressure”. FYI it was Vinnie, Eric, Turtle and JohnnyDrama. Hug it out, bitch.Bender(Futurama)Matt Groening’s animated sci-fi sitcom will for ever be damned with the faint praise “Well, it’s no Simpsons”. Its equivalent of antihero Homer is bad-tempered robot Bender – the tinny roommate of pizza delivery doofus Fry. With his power cells fuelled by alcohol, Bender is a hard-boozing, cigar-chomping, potty-mouthed, kleptomaniac misanthrope. Even better, he’s named after Judd Nelson’s character from The Breakfast Club. Bite my shiny metal ass!Jenny Gifford (Cold Feet)View image in fullscreenGlass act … Fay Ripley in Cold Feet.Photograph: Ben Blackall/ITVWhen the 90s Mancunian couples drama got aperimenopausal rebootin 2016, it was a faintly depressing Boden catalogue of death, divorce, mortgage troubles and moody teenage offspring. That’s middle age for you. Thank the Granada gods for Fay Ripley’s lovable Jen. Her return to education as a mature student and poignant breast cancer diagnosis – handled with deadpan wit and down-to-earth emotion – were the standout story arcs of “Old Feet”.Saul Berenson (Homeland)View image in fullscreenThe whiskery surrogate father every spy needs … Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson in Homeland.Photograph: Antony Platt/ShowtimeThe Showtime espionage thriller gripped us with the game of psychological chess between CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) and suspected terrorist Sgt Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis). Sadly, the ginger Judas was lynched by Iranians in the third season finale. AsHomelandwent on for a further five years, it was largely carried by Carrie’s mentor and protector Saul, played by Mandy Patinkin. All grizzled beard, Middle East expertise and twinkly wisdom, “the Bear” was the whiskery surrogate father every spy needs.Penelope Featherington (Bridgerton)View image in fullscreenRomp and circumstance … Nicola Coughlan as Penelope in Bridgerton.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixShondaland’s bosom-heaving Regency romp is an often preposterous package of sexed-up style over substance. But its beating heart is Nicola Coughlan as the people’s heroine, Penelope. Her lifelong friendship with Eloise (Claudia Jessie) lends depth, while her secret side hustle as anonymous gossip columnist Lady Whistledown provides intrigue. When she finally hooked up with longtime crush Colin (Luke Newton), the “Polin” portmanteau was born. The nation swooned, cheered, then had to loosen its corset and go for a lie down.Mr Blobby (Noel’s House Party)View image in fullscreenUtterly upstaged … Noel Edmonds with Mr Blobby.Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./AllstarNoel Edmonds’ light entertainment extravaganza saw him utterly upstaged by a bulbous pink-and-yellow agent of slapstick chaos. All the sweeter because it dented the cheesy host’s huge ego, like Alan Partridge playing second fiddle to Sidekick Simon. Upon his 1992 Crinkley Bottom debut, Blobby became a bona fide British cultural phenomenon and notched a Christmas No 1 the following year with his eponymous novelty hit. To this day, he pops up for clumsy cameos on other shows. The New York Times called him “a metaphor for a nation gone soft in the head”. Bob Mortimer was more succinct: “A pink, spotty, rubber twat.”Sylvie Grateau (Emily in Paris)View image in fullscreenFrench revelation … Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu as Sylvie and Arnaud Binard as Laurent in Emily in Paris.Photograph: Stephanie Branchu/NetflixDespite the berets, baguettes and ooh-la-la cliches, Darren Star’s Gallic romcom inexplicably became a Netflix smash. Its saving grace is luxury marketing magnate Sylvie (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu) – sleekly stylish, laconically straight-talking and so darned Parisian that she chain-smokes Gauloises for lunch. She started as the sneering antagonist who disapproved of Emily’s very existence. Across four seasons, she has evolved into a total queen and taken the annoying American under hertrès chicwing. En route, Sylvie navigated her open marriage, expanded her business to Rome and exposed sexual abuse in the fashion industry. No wonder fans have called for her to get her own spin-off.Lana Washington(Trigger Point)View image in fullscreenClear the area! … Vicky McClure as Lana Washington in Trigger Point.Photograph: ITVClear the area! Wipe sweat from brow! Snip the wire! Afghan war veteran “Wash” works as a bomb disposal expert for the Met, using her “expo” skills to foil ticking terrorist devices on the streets of London. Combining the star power of Vicky McClure and the tense thriller chops of executive producer Jed Mercurio, you can’t blame ITV for lapping it up. Three series in, however, Trigger Point remains landfill TV. Surrounded by cardboard-cutout men and implausible plot twists, McClure heroically and single-handedly keeps the hit drama the right side of daft. Just.Schmidt (New Girl)View image in fullscreen‘Vanilla-scented ladies’ man’ … Max Greenfield as Schmidt with the cast of New Girl.Photograph: Fox/Channel 4When quirky teacher Jess (Zooey Deschanel) answered a Craigslist ad and moved into an LA loft with three male roommates, heartwarming hilarity ensued. The screwball Fox sitcom made for a bland-but-serviceable Friends replacement, and its Chandler-like chief lol-merchant was the perma-shirtless Schmidt (Max Greenfield). This vanilla-scented self-styled ladies’ man wore driving moccasins, couldn’t pronounce chutney and dispensed quotable “Schmidtisms”, while failing to conceal his endearingly neurotic true nature. Stick another dollar in the douchebag jar.Lale(Gangs of London)View image in fullscreen‘Die Hard with full dilation’ … Narges Rashidi in Gangs of London.Photograph: Christopher Raphael/Sky UK Limited/AMC LLCSky’s underworld epic is a testosterone-pumped affair, populated by cartoonish kingpins and grunting henchmen engaging in endless turf wars. By far its best character is lone wolf Lale (Narges Rashidi), fierce leader of the Kurdish heroin cartel. Season one flashbacks fleshed out her tragic backstory. A third season bottle episode saw the heavily pregnant Lale escape her Pakistani captors, give birth in an empty office block and strangle a foe with the umbilical cord, placenta still attached. Think Die Hard with full dilation.Daddy Pig (Peppa Pig)The rest of the cartoon oinkers are one-dimensional: Peppa’s an insufferable brat, Mummy Pig is quietly efficient, George just cries about dinosaurs. However, the porcine paterfamilias contains multitudes. He’s pathologically hopeless but displays unexpected talents. He’s unable to read a map but brings home the bacon as a successful structural engineer. He sports a beard, beer gut and specs, like a proper dad. No wonder mums of toddlers find themselves secretly developing strange cross-species crushes on him. Neither age nor muddy puddles can wither him.Seema Patel (And Just Like That)View image in fullscreen‘An unapologetic diva’ … Sarita Choudhury as Seema in And Just Like That.Photograph: HBOWhen the majestic Kim Cattrall regally declined to return for the Sex & the City spin-off, it left a whopping Samantha-sized hole to fill. In tottered real estate broker Seema (Sarita Choudhury), who wasn’t just an unapologetic diva but added desperately needed diversity. A purring cougar with a taste for Birkin bags, martini lunches, hazardous smoking in bed and seducing hot gardeners, Seema was fabulosity personified. She was totally short-changed plot-wise, mind you.Will McAvoy (The Newsroom)View image in fullscreenSwashbuckling idealist … Jeff Daniels as Will McAvoy in The Newsroom.Photograph: Karen Ballard/HBOAaron Sorkin’s HBO drama kicked off in incendiary style as disillusioned Republican anchorman Will (an Emmy-winning turn from Jeff Daniels) went rogue and delivered a withering speech about America’s shortcomings as a nation. Awoken from his midlife slumber, the swashbuckling idealist set about creating a mould-breaking cable news show. Unfortunately, he was surrounded by a bunch of whining po-faced millennials and Sorkin’s writing lapsed into smug sermonising. Here’s Tom with the weather.Mrs Coulter(His Dark Materials)This valiant BBC/HBO bid to turn Philip Pullman’s sprawling fantasy trilogy into blockbuster TV turned out plodding, preachy and impenetrable. Things perked up when Ruth Wilson sashayed on to the screen as Marisa Coulter, the Cruella de Vil-esque villainess who turned out to be protagonist’s Lyra’s power-mad mother. Wilson did similar on detective drama Luther. When her saucy serial killer, Alice Morgan, was flirtatiously facing off against Idris Elba’s stroppy sleuth, it was electric.Seth Cohen (The OC)View image in fullscreenHe absolutely eclipsed the lead … Adam Brody as Seth and Samaire Armstrong as Anna in The OC.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyWearing vests and pouting moodily in the Cohens’ pool house, bad boy Ryan (Ben McKenzie) was supposed to be the California teen soap’s romantic lead. Yet he was absolutely eclipsed by his geeky, sarky adoptive brother Seth (Adam Brody). His slow-burn romance with popular Summer (Rachel Bilson) was way cuter than Ryan’s predictable love for poor little rich girl Marissa (Mischa Barton). When Marissa was killed off in the series three finale, the show’s quality nose-dived – leaving Seth and his toy horse, Captain Oats, to shoulder the burden.DI Annika Strandhed(Annika)Spooks, Last Tango in Halifax, River, Unforgotten, The Split … Nicola Walker can do no wrong, except perhaps this uneven cosy crime drama, which started life as a Radio 4 drama. As a Norwegian detective based in Glasgow, she solves maritime murders, tiptoes around her teenage daughter and drolly breaks the fourth wall to tell us all about it. Formulaic cases, pedestrian plots, perfunctory dialogue. If it wasn’t for Walker, this watery series wouldn’t stay afloat.Lindsay Cunningham(The Newsreader)The shoulder-padded Australian period piece portrays the bond between an embattled female newsreader (Anna Torv) and a closeted male reporter (Sam Reid). Yet its cult hero is the irascible, unreconstructed and ratings-obsessed boss of News at Six. As nicotine-stained Lindsay (William McInnes) bawls and bullies, stripy-shirted paunch hanging over his grey slacks, you can almost smell the strong liquor and overpowering aftershave.Princess Disa (The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power)View image in fullscreenBadass … Sophia Nomvete as Princess Disa with Owain Arthur as Prince Durin IV in The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.Photograph: Courtesy of Prime VideoA voice that can literally move mountains? Count us in. When badass Princess Disa (West End veteran Sophia Nomvete) lifted rocks with the power of her singing, saving the lives of dwarf miners trapped by a collapsed shaft, Amazon’s giga-budget fantasy epic finally delivered a spine-tingling moment. As the first female dwarf ever depicted on screen in a Tolkien adaptation, Disa is also a Middle-earth mould-breaker. Just ignore the nerdy nit-pickers who complain that she doesn’t have a dwarven bushy beard.Barney Stinson (How I Met Your Mother)Suit up! The focus of the long-running CBS sitcom – billed by UK broadcaster E4 as “like Friends but without the boring Ross bits” – was supposed to be narrator Ted Mosby. As the frequently punchable Ted droned on about his quest to find a wife, his gang of mates became way more interesting, notably besuited playboy Barney (Neil Patrick Harris). He hatched outrageous schemes to seduce women, played a lot of laser tag and lived by the “bro code”. He even found his own happy ending. Well, until that widely reviled finale.

The DHSC said that on 30 September, a day before the judgment was issued, an application was made to put PPE Medpro into administration. Thecompany’s accounts, published a week before the judgment, show that it had funds of less than £1m.The DHSCsued PPE Medproin December 2022, arguing that it had not complied with the relevant PPE laws to ensure that the gowns were sterile.The trial heard that the gowns were rejected after their first UK inspection in September 2020 and never used in theNHS. The gowns were labelled with a CE mark, denoting compliance with European standards, but no authorised quality assurance organisation had certified their safety and sterility.How the Michelle Mone scandal unfolded: £200m of PPE contracts, denials and a government lawsuitRead morePaul Stanley KC, representing the DHSC, argued that this meant the gowns “were invalidly CE marked … and did not comply with the law”. Stanley referred in his opening submission to a statement by a health official who had said of the gowns that “the potential impact on safety was such that they could seriously harm or kill patients and so could not be released for use”.PPE Medpro’s barrister, Charles Samek KC, argued that the gowns had been properly manufactured and sterilised in China, and that the DHSC had agreed to the process before it awarded the contract.“The secretary of state [for health] knew everything there was to know about my client’s offer, all cards were on the table face up, and they entered into this contract … with their eyes wide open,” Samek said in his opening.Cockerill, however, ruled in favour of the DHSC, determining that the gowns were not validly CE marked because no quality assurance organisation, called a “notified body” had certified the manufacturing process, and that PPE Medpro had also breached the contract by failing to comply with other requirements to show the gowns had been validated as sterile.She rejected the DHSC’s claim for a further £8m it said had been incurred storing the gowns, ruling that these costs had not been proven.The two contracts awarded to PPE Medpro for a total £203m became the most controversial to come from the “VIP lane” operated by Boris Johnson’s Conservative government during the Covid pandemic. As thousands of companies bid for contracts to fill the UK’s depleted PPE stockpile, the VIP lane gave high priority to people with political connections.The DHSC awarded the £122m gowns contract to PPE Medpro, and another contract worth £80.85m to supply face masks, after Mone first approached the thenCabinet Office minister Michael Govein May 2020. The contracts were processed via the VIP lane, and the trial heard that “Baroness Mone remained active throughout” the negotiations with civil servants for the gowns contract.Mone rose to celebrity prominence in the 2000s through her lingerie company, Ultimo, before itfell into financial difficulties, and David Cameron appointed her to the House of Lords in 2015. She and Barrowman for yearspublicly denied through their lawyersthat they were involved in PPE Medpro, until in December 2023 the couple confirmed their involvement and Barrowman said he was the company’s ultimate beneficial owner.In November 2022, the Guardian revealed thatBarrowman had been paid at least £65mfrom PPE Medpro’s profits, then transferred £29m to a trust set up to benefit Mone and her three adult children. Barrowmanacknowledged in a BBC interviewin December 2023 that he had been paid more than £60m and transferred money into the trust; the couple said that his children were beneficiaries as well.The high court case was separate to an ongoing investigation by the National Crime Agency, begun in May 2021, into whether Mone and Barrowmancommitted any criminal offencesduring the process of procuring the contracts. Mone and Barrowman have denied any criminal wrongdoing.After the judgment, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “PPE Medpro put NHS staff and patients in danger with substandard kit whilst lining their own pockets with taxpayers’ money at a time of national crisis. Today’s court ruling makes clear we won’t stand for it and we’re coming after every penny owed to our NHS. This government will ruthlessly pursue any company which tried to exploit the pandemic for their own ends while our health service was fighting to save lives.“PPE Medpro must now repay the government and the taxpayer £122m. My department will work closely with PPE Medpro Limited’s administrators to recover everything we can.”Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusMichelle MoneNHSHouse of LordsConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

In 1977 she founded the Jane Goodall Institute, which works to protect the species and supports youth projects aimed at benefiting animals and the environment.She was considered the leading expert on chimpanzees, her career spanning more than 60 years. Her research was pivotal in proving the similarities in primate and human behaviour.The renowned conservationist was on stage in New York just last week, before appearing talking about her work on a Wall Street Journal podcast two days later.She was due to appear at a speaking event reflecting on her long life and career in Los Angeles on 3 October, before another event in Washington DC the following week.View image in fullscreenJane Goodall photographed in London in 2017.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianTributes poured in from around the world from conservation and animal rights charities, as the UN praised how she had “worked tirelessly for our planet and all its inhabitants, leaving an extraordinary legacy for humanity and nature”.Greenpeace UK’s co-executive director, Will McCallum, said Goodall was “one of the true conservation giants of our time”.After developing a love of animals from an early age, Goodall visited a friend in Kenya in the late 1950s and began working for an archaeologist there, who sent her to study primate behaviour in London.While still in her 20s, Goodall began researching chimpanzees at Gombe Stream national park in Tanzania. Her work observing their social behaviour helped challenge the idea that only humans could use tools and that chimps were vegetarian.She went on to set up the Jane Goodall Institute to improve the understanding and treatment of primates, and to protect their natural habitats with the help of local people. It now has officers in more than 25 countries around the world.Goodall, who was awarded the title of Messenger of Peace by the UN in 2002, was an outspoken advocate of environmental issues and campaigned against the use of animals in medical research and zoos.View image in fullscreenJane Goodall in the 1965 CBS television special Miss Goodall and the World of Chimpanzees.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesIn 1991, the institute launched the Roots and Shoots project to involve young people in conservation. The project started with a group of students working with Goodall but went on to create a network of active young people across nearly 100 countries.Earlier this year, the institute’s Hope Through Action project facedfunding cutsfrom the US government under Donald Trump, after it had been pledged $29.5m (£22m) over five years.The initiative was designed to protect endangered chimpanzees and their habitats in western Tanzania through reforestation and “community-led methodology” to conserve biodiversity and improve local livelihoods.Well into her 80s, Goodall showed little sign of slowing down as she continued to write and speak about her work. During the pandemic, she launched a podcast called Hopecast in which she interviewed other environmentalists and activists.She was made a dame in 2004, and earlier this year received the Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian honour, from the outgoing president, Joe Biden. In 2022, her legacy was marked in more unusual fashion in the form of a Jane Goodall Barbie doll, as part of the producer’s series on inspiring women.In a2023 interviewwith the Guardian, she spoke of the importance of focusing on making any kind of difference rather than trying to solve the world’s problems.“We have a window of time to change this planet’s course, but it’s rapidly closing,” she said. “If governments do what they say they’ll do, we still have a chance.”View image in fullscreenJane Goodall at chimp rescue centre in Entebbe, Uganda in 2018.Photograph: Sumy Sadurni/AFP/Getty ImagesLooking back on her childhood, she remembered an early appetite for discovery, hiding inside a hen house for hours to find out where eggs come from. “When I finally returned, Mum had called the police,” she said. “I’d been missing for hours. Instead of punishing me, she listened intently to my discoveries.”Her mother was instrumental in pushing her to pursue her dreams, including volunteering on her daughter’s first expedition because women were not allowed to travel solo.In 2021, Goodall published The Book of Hope, in which she admitted she sometimes felt she was fighting a losing battle, but explained how she kept going.Speaking to the Guardianat the time, she said: “You have to feel depressed, but then there’s something that says: ‘There is still an awful lot left and that’s what we’ve got to fight to save.’“So then you get extra energy. I have days when I feel like not getting up, but it doesn’t last long. I guess because I’m obstinate.“I’m not going to give in. I’ll die fighting, that’s for sure.”Explore more on these topicsJane GoodallPrimatologynewsShareReuse this content"

We will reduce the pull factors.”The policies are a riposte to Reform’s plans announced last week to strip the status of indefinite leave to remain [ILR] from hundreds of thousands of non-EU citizens who already have it and to force them to reapply for visas under stricter criteria.Foreigners underrepresented among prisoners in England and Wales, report findsRead moreStarmer is under intense pressure from within his own party to fight back against the growing electoral threat of Nigel Farage’s party.In advance of the European Political Community (EPC) summit on Thursday, where leaders will discuss how to tackle illegal migration, Starmer said: “We’re making fundamental changes to what those granted asylum are afforded in the UK.“Settlement must be earned by contributing to our country, not by paying a people-smuggler to cross the Channel in a boat.“The UK will continue to play its role in welcoming genuine refugees fleeing persecution. But we must also address the pull factors driving dangerous and illegal small-boat crossings. There will be no golden ticket to settling in the UK, people will have to earn it.”In September,the government suspended the family reunion routethat allowed people with recognised refugee status or humanitarian protection to sponsor close relatives to join them. The route, which admitted spouses or partners and dependent children under 18, granted 4,671 family reunion visas in the year ending June 2025.Starmer’s comments follow the announcement by the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, on Monday that the government will imposenew requirements on those seeking ILR to settle in the UK.Mahmood said those seeking to settle permanently, most of whom come to the UK through regular routes, will face requirements of a higher standard of English, proof that they have contributed to society, and will be excluded if they have a criminal record.Ministers will also examine whether to impose similar requirements upon those given asylum, sources said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This approach didn’t work then and there is no evidence to suggest it will work now.“Restricting family reunion only pushes more desperate people into the arms of smugglers in an effort to reunite with loved ones … family reunion overwhelmingly supported women and children – who made up nine out of 10 visas granted through this route in the last year.”Kolbassia Haoussou, a director at the charity Freedom from Torture and a refugee, said: “The men, women and children who come to the UK seeking sanctuary – just as I did – want nothing more than safety and the chance to rebuild their lives as part of strong and vibrant communities.“Blocking our chance to settle or to reunite with family members still at risk of harm keeps people like us and our children on the outside, never really allowed to feel secure or like we truly belong.“These measures are taken straight from the populist playbook the government itself has condemned.”On Wednesday, Starmer said he would look at how international law is being interpreted by British courts in an effort to tackle small boats, which he labelled“Farage boats”because of their increase in number since Brexit.Before leaving the EU, the UK was a signatory to the Dublin convention, which states that asylum seekers can be returned to the first member state they arrived in before their claims are considered.Starmer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that while “those genuinely fleeing persecution should be afforded asylum”, countries were experiencing “mass migration in a way that we have not seen in previous years”.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumRefugeesLabourKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Republicans squarely blamed their political opponents.Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in theUS Senate, said his party would fight on several fronts including “TV stations, social media, in picketing, in protesting, every way” to drive the party’s point home. In an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Wednesday, he said: “We’re going to say, ‘Go tell Trump he’s the one doing it.’ That’s our plan.”As the blame game intensified on Capitol Hill, Schumer accusedRepublicansof blatantly lying with their talking point that Democrats had shut down the government in order to extend healthcare benefits to undocumented immigrants. Noncitizens are barred from federal healthcare programs.What does a government shutdown mean and why is this year’s more serious?Read more“That’s an effing lie,” Schumer said. “They are afraid of the truth – they know that what they have done has decimated healthcare for 20 million Americans.”Later on Wednesday morning, Republican congressional leaders gathered outside in Washington DC for a press conference to continue hammering home exactly that point.The speaker of the House of Representatives,Mike Johnson, said: “Democrats could have worked with us. Instead they prioritized taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.”Johnson, a Louisiana congressman, said the situation had been “entirely avoidable” and warned: “The longer this goes on the more pain will be inflicted, because it is inevitable when the government shuts down.”He accused theDemocratsof encouraging the shutdown to “satisfy their far-left base”.The Senate majority leader, John Thune, signaled his goal was to wear Democrats down and pick them off one by one as he holds another vote on Wednesday morning on a bill that would fund the government mostly at current levels.“We are one just one Senate rollcall vote away from ending the shutdown,” Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said in a speech in the chamber. “We need a handful of Democrats to join Republicans to reopen the government.”Schumer, the senior senator for New York, remains in a tight spot as he stands in the middle of a tug-of-war between wings of his party. Three members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate broke ranks and voted with the Republicans.From the other direction, progressive Democrats are pushing Schumer to stand resolute to reflect many voters’ thirst for strong resistance to the extremes of the secondTrump administration. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a leading progressive Democratic representative from New York, told MSNBC that holding the line over healthcare would act as a brake on all Trump’s extremist ambitions.“We have to stop enabling their abuse of power. When we’re fighting on healthcare, it forces them to act in accordance with the law in other ways too … They want us to blink first, and we have too much to save,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in last November’s presidential election,posted on X10 minutes after the shutdown began at midnight that “President Trump and congressional Republicans just shut down the government because they refused to stop your health care costs from rising”.She added: “Let me be clear: Republicans are in charge of the White House, House, and Senate. This is their shutdown.”Cory Booker, the Democratic senator from New Jersey,put out a videoat midnight in which he said the cause of the shutdown was because “Republicans refuse to work with us to deal with the healthcare crisis they have created”.Trade unions representing federal workers called for a rapid end to the shutdown, amid fears that the Trump administration would use the crisis as an opportunity to fire additional government employees. Trump has threatened to lay off “a lot of people”, adding: “They’re gonna be Democrats.”An alliance of unions, including the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), is suing the administration in federal court in San Francisco over the threatened layoffs. “Our message is clear: fund the government, fix the healthcare crisis and put working people first,” the AFL-CIO said after the shutdown kicked in.Markets reacted nervously. US stock markets slipped in premarket trading, with the S&P 500 down about half a percentage point.Stock futures were also falling, and the dollar weakened early on Wednesday, indicating anxieties over the impact on the wider economy.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025RepublicansDemocratsTrump administrationChuck SchumerMike JohnsonDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Rates of the disease have risen and are projected to increase further by 2040, linked to people holidaying in sunny countries.IARC’s view, and a report that year by the UK’s Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (Comare), led the government to outlaw the use of sunbeds for under-18s in England and Wales.However, regulation of tanning salons has failed because a sizeable minority of 16- and 17-year-olds still use them, the co-authors of an opinion article wrote in the BMJ.Colon cancer is on the rise among young people – and research points to one major culprit | Devi SridharRead moreThe WorldCancerResearch Fund (WCRF) backed the closure of tanning salons. The co-authors estimate it would cost between £11m and £55m. Last year there were an estimated 4,231 salons in England and 232 in Wales. The number in Scotland and Northern Ireland was unknown.“It’s a well-known fact that sunbeds increase the risk of skin cancer and there are safer alternatives like fake tan. That’s why phasing out sunbeds would help reduce cancer risk and support people to live longer, healthier lives,”saidKate Oldridge-Turner, WCRF’s head of policy and public affairs.But while Cancer Research UK warned people not to use sunbeds, it did not endorse the call.“Despite what people might hear on social media, there is no such thing as safe tanning using sunbeds. It’s illegal to allow anyone under the age of 18 to use sunbeds, and it’s vital that this is properly enforced,” said Fiona Osgun, its head of health information.“Some people are more at risk of skin cancer than others, including those with lighter skin tones, lots of freckles or moles, or a history of burning easily.“But everyone who uses sunbeds increases their risk of cancer. Nearly nine in 10 cases of melanoma are caused by exposure to too much UV radiation from the sun and sunbeds.“If you want to look tanned, it’s much safer to get a spray tan or use fake tan from a bottle.”The government urged people not to use sunbeds and said it was considering further steps to tackle the harm they cause.“Commercial sunbeds significantly increase the risk of melanoma and other skin cancers from UV radiation. It is strongly advised not to use them at all,” a government spokesperson said.“Anyone considering using a sunbed should understand the serious health risks. We are looking at the evidence and considering next steps.”Explore more on these topicsSkin cancerCancerHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

I keep going – walking, running, crawling – but I never manage to reach it.”Home for Lebedeva is Opytne, a tiny village – one school, no supermarkets – just outside Donetsk.View image in fullscreenElena Lebedeva with her husband, Rodion, outside their new apartment block in Kryvyi Rih, 2023Sitting at the table of the flat that her family fled to, she reels through the fates she knows of the roughly 30 people who remained in Opytne as Russian troops advanced. Lebedeva’s neighbour, known as Uncle Sasha, died in his basement, where he’d been living since his house was destroyed. Perhaps he fell from the ladder or suffered a heart attack. By the time his body was found, rats had eaten his hands.Three people had been sitting on a bench outside their apartment building when a mortar shell struck them directly. Neighbours gathered what was left of their bodies, but constant bombing meant they could not stay outside long enough to dig their graves. They wrapped the remains in plastic bags, along with their passports, and placed them in a shed. Later, the shed also took a direct hit. Nothing was left.View image in fullscreenElena Lebedeva drops neighbours home to Opytne after a shopping trip to Avdiivka, 2019View image in fullscreenElena Lebedeva has her shrapnel wounds dressed at a hospital in Pokrovsk after being injured by shelling while gardening at her home in Opytne, 2022Lebedeva herself was injured in the summer of 2022, when an artillery shell landed in her back yard and shrapnel pierced her back and buttocks. That might have saved her life – after being hospitalised, she was unable to return home and, with her husband, Rodion, relocated west to the city of Kryvyi Rih. Until then, they had stubbornly remained in Opytne.The village had been stranded between frontlines and cut off from the outside world since 2014. For eight years, residents had lived without electricity, water, gas, heat, groceries, or access to health care and other essential services. The only way in or out was by a mud road through a minefield. Together, Elena and Rodion kept the village alive throughout that time, bringing in supplies in their bright yellow minivan and caring for elderly neighbours who had nowhere to go.Across Donbas, countless families made similar choices to carry on with ordinary routines in impossible circumstances. To outsiders, the decision to stay in a war zone, to keep going about daily life even as bombs fall and everything collapses, can be hard to grasp. But for many people living through war, it makes sense. In fact, it’s a typical response. Even amid waves of violence, life often continues.People dive bomb and somersault off a dive board at the water’s edge on a summer’s day, while groups of people swim around itSwimmers at the sand quarry beach in Avdiivka, 2018The violence of war is measured in distance. Sometimes, it’s a matter of millimetres, the distance by which shrapnel missed Lebedeva’s spinal cord. Sometimes, it’s a matter of kilometres, how far from the shifting frontline your home is. Sometimes, it’s the space between minds: the emotional distance between those who experience the violence and those who cannot imagine it ever happening to them. For the past seven years, we documented the stories of those living in communities in Donbas for a project called Five Kilometres From the Frontline.They show us what it truly means to live with war: not just survive its explosions, but endure its routines.View image in fullscreenA heavily damaged apartment building in Lyman, 2022View image in fullscreenUkrainian soldiers eat lunch at a base near Pisky, 2018View image in fullscreenNew recruits from the 80th Airborne Brigade during medical training drills in the Bakhmut area, a few days before deployment to the frontline, 2023War comes as a paralysing shock only at the beginning.

He kept reporting for duty even as shelling forced him into a basement. His short walk to work became a daily gauntlet: “I lived only 500 metres away, but it took me forever to get there. You start walking, then hear a whistle and run for cover into the nearest building. You wait for the explosion – if it goes off elsewhere, you keep walking, but only until the next whistle.”View image in fullscreenOleksander Dokalenko and his wife, Elena Dyachkova, before they were displaced, Avdiivka, 2018View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenElena Dyachkova and her grandson Nikita in the family’s new apartment at a semi-permanent housing facility for people displaced by the war in the Kyiv region, 2024Most people think they know what war is. We’ve seen it thousands of times in movies and news coverage: tanks, soldiers, explosions, crying women, pitiable refugees. These images are so familiar they’ve become trite. But most of the time, war does not look like this. Most of the time, it seems too normal, too much like peace to catch the eye of journalists and film-makers. Often, only a tiny detail – tape in the shape of a cross on a window, or an unusual emptiness in the street – reveals that something is off. Yet, this seeming normality of the abnormal, this integration of horror and the mundane, is what tells the truest story of war.View image in fullscreenParishioners take part in a procession at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Avdiivka, 2018Across Donbas communities, many people who could no longer live in their destroyed houses near the frontlines still returned whenever they could. They tidied up what remained of their homes and tended their gardens, even when it made little practical sense. “I think we should have abandoned this house long ago, but I don’t prevent my husband from visiting it,” one woman tells us. “I feel like it would deprive him of the last hope he has of returning to our normal life.”Dropped by drones and scattered by rockets: how Ukraine became one of the most heavily mined countries in the worldRead moreFor a long time, it was this surreal state – snatches of ordinary life inside a looming disaster – that endured in many villages skirting the frontlines. But since 2022, the escalating brutality of the war has pushed local communities past breaking point. Many of those who clung on for years are now scattered across the country.View image in fullscreenA man says goodbye to a woman before taking a bus from the frontline town of Kurakhove into occupied territory in Donetsk, 2019In the small village of Polohy in centralUkraine, Olha Grinik struggles to care for her two children in a rundown, abandoned cabin without running water or electricity – the only housing her family could afford after they were displaced from Avdiivka and her husband, Mykola, was drafted into the armed forces. Before the war, Avdiivka was a working-class town of 25,000 people, anchored by its vast metal plant.After 2014, it became a frontline town, and the Griniks raised their two small children in a home just 50 metres from the trenches. Mykola worked shifts at the plant and Olha kept the household together. Before the full-scale invasion, when life was precarious but still had a rhythm, Olha was a laid-back young woman. Today, she seems transformed, her former ease giving way to anxiety and strain.View image in fullscreenOlha Grinik (centre) with extended family at her new home in Poltava after being displaced from Avdiivka, 2024View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenMiroslava Grinik reading a schoolbook in the Poltava province, 2024; Kirill Grinik (left) playing with relatives in a broken down car parked in the yard of his new homeShe has lost a lot of weight, and seems on the verge of tears when she speaks. “When Mykola comes home, the children are all over him. But it happens so rarely,” she says. “He got 15 days of leave, but they called him back after five days. I was heartbroken. I want to be next to him, hug him, hold his hand, do things together.”At her house, windows are covered with plastic sheeting instead of glass, and the children are bathed in a bowl, with cold water. Olha bought hunks of firewood for the stove in preparation for winter, but she’s too weak to chop it. In the beginning, male relatives helped with manual tasks, but eventually, they too were drafted or signed military contracts as there are no jobs in the village.View image in fullscreenMykola Grinik fishing with his son, Kirill, and daughter, Miroslava, near Avdiivka, 2019The homes that Lebedeva, Grinik, Dokalenko and all their neighbours left behind have been destroyed in the fighting. The destruction runs so deep that not only have houses been obliterated, the land itself has been torn apart. None of those who once lived there can access the area. Its condition can be imagined from aerial footage: videos show artillery scars that stretch far beyond the built environment, ripping through grasslands and leaving a pockmarked, contaminated terrain.View image in fullscreenA destroyed bridge over the Siverskyi Donets River in Bohorodychne, 2023For Serhii Lymanskyi, a ranger who has devoted his life to caring for this land, its devastation is an open wound.“I know every tree, every patch of grass here,” says Lymanskyi about the chalk-steppe nature reserve he cares for.

His son Yevhen, who grew up helping his father, later became a professional ranger himself. The war upended everything. Yevhen was conscripted and severely wounded; after more than 30 surgeries, it is still uncertain whether he will walk again. A direct strike destroyed the family’s home.The reserve itself has not been spared. Shell craters and trenches have torn through the chalk slopes, wiping out large swathes of flora. For Lymanskyi, the loss is ecological and deeply personal. “These days, whenever I come to Kreydova Flora, I see it shedding tears – there is a little rain drizzling every time,” he says. “All my labour, all the labour of nature to create this beautiful place – everything is gone.”View image in fullscreenFather Rostislav strims the verge outside St Epiphany church in the village of Karlivka, 2022The Guardian documentary You Don’t Think It Will Happen To You, directed by Paolina Stefani, documents Alisa and Anastasia’s time in the towns of Ukraine’s frontline.Watch it hereExplore more on these topicsUkraine in depthUkraineRussiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In front of more than 100 family and iwi (tribal) members who travelled to Oxford to witness the honour, Papakura was posthumously awarded an MPhil in anthropology for her work documenting the life, language and customs of her Te Arawa people.New Māori queen brings hope for New Zealand in first speech: ‘Being Māori is forever’Read morePapakura’s descendant, June Northcroft Grant, was teary as she accepted the certificate from the university’s vice-chancellor.“It was very surreal. I had to collect myself because I was getting emotional and didn’t want to do ugly crying on TV,” she said.Watching a livestream from the nearby Natural History Museum, dozens of her extended family launched into a thunderous haka as a mark of honour.View image in fullscreenPapakura’s descendant June Northcroft Grant with Prof Irene Tracey, vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford after receiving the posthumous degree.Photograph: University of OxfordBorn in New Zealand’s Bay of Plenty region in 1873, Papakura grew up during a time of significant change forMāori, including the rapid loss of land, language and Indigenous knowledge as the grip of colonisation tightened.She was raised by her elders from Tūhourangi and Ngāti Wahiao, two Arawa subtribes, around the geothermal village of Whakarewarewa. The village is near the city of Rotorua, famed for its boiling mud, simmering streams, and geysers that gush from the Earth’s crust.It was while working as a guide near Rotorua that she attracted attention during a royal visit in 1901, and later became a model, featured on a range of postcards and in photoshoots.A decade later, Papakura travelled to England with a cultural performance tour group that went bankrupt, with many of the participants staying to work or marry locals.She returned to Rotorua only briefly before marrying a wealthy Englishman, Richard Staples-Browne. She moved to Oxfordshire where she enrolled at the university and befriended the anthropologist TK Penniman.In tight cursive, she spent years writing her detailed knowledge of genealogy, histories, language and customs on thousands of sheets of paper, recalling the ancient traditions of the Arawa people.Remarkably for the time, it was a detailed work about Indigenous people, by an Indigenous woman.But Papakura died in 1930, aged 56, just three weeks before her thesis was due.View image in fullscreenMākereti Papakura’s original thesis seen at the Pitt Rivers Museum.Photograph: Jamie Tahana.Penniman would later publish the thesis as a book, The Old Time Māori, which her descendants say is as relevant today as ever. Grant said it has been used by Māori trying to reclaim their language and ancestral knowledge, even proving useful in legal land claims.“We found a lot of information about our lands in the village. All the caves and the geysers,” she said. For nearly a century, the fact she didn’t have her degree proved something of a sore point.“Ninety-five years, why did it take so long?” Grant asked. “We’ve been quietly and patiently telling her story.”At a reception with the family among the displays at Oxford’s Pitt Rivers museum on Saturday, the vice-chancellor, Prof Irene Tracey, said it was an honour to finally recognise Papakura’s influence as a scholar.“I could not think of a person – globally, historically – more worthy of that honour,” she said. “At a time when so few women came to Oxford, so few women did degrees.”Fifty years on, New Zealand’s tribunal upholding Māori rights faces a turning pointRead moreThe delegation of Te Arawa spent nearly a week in the UK, attending a range of ceremonies, performances and other events.Anthony Wihapi, an elder who was among the delegation, described a feeling of “amazement”. “It’s existed for 900 years and I’m told this is one of the first times they’ve awarded a posthumous degree. It’s an incredible thing for our [family] to be proud of.”Part of the delegation’s tour included presenting a gift of a two-metre carved figure, or pou, intricately chiselled into a slab of tōtara wood.Papakura and her concert party brought the pou to England in 1911, during their first visit.“They used the whakairo (carving) as a facade behind them and they would perform in front of it,” said Rob Schuster Rika, a carver who is also a relation of Papakura.View image in fullscreenRob Schuster Rika with Mākereti Papakura’s pou.Photograph: Supplied British Council, photographer David PoultneyIt stayed in the UK, passing through various owners and uses – including as a work bench – before falling into a state of disrepair, Rika said. Last week, after careful restoration by Rika, Te Arawa gave the pou back to the British people at the Stratford headquarters of the British Council, where it will go on display.“It was the rejoining of the pou, or a people, and revitalising Maggie Papakura’s [work] to share our culture to the world,” he said.Explore more on these topicsMāoriNew ZealandUniversity of OxfordAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gym bros, migrant workers, mums and dads with their children, even tourists. As a crowd of hundreds disembarks from the train a crowd of people cheer “jiayou”, a chant of encouragement which translates to “add oil”.Dubbed the “shovel supermen”, they have come to Guangfu in their tens of thousands, as volunteers ready to help after a distant typhoon burst a natural dam and sent millions of tonnes of water, mud and silt crashing through the streets.This small town in Hualien, a picturesque county on Taiwan’s east coast had long been a magnet for tourists, beforedisaster had strucka week ago.. The outer bands of2025’s strongest typhoon, Ragasa, dumped torrential rain on the region, and on Tuesday afternoon it burst a precarious barrier lake in the Matai’an river. The lake, formed by a landslide in July, had been under constant monitoring and authorities had expected it would overflow, butit exceeded expectations. More than 15.4m tonnes of water came down, blasting a tsunami of thick sludge into Guangfu. At least 18 people died.View image in fullscreenCars piled up in the town of Guangfu. The destruction is worse closer to the Matai’an river.Photograph: Helen Davidson/The GuardianDirt and debris is piled high in the streets, as people empty out ground floor dwellings. Destroyed cars are piled in corners, and the high school sportsfield lies underneath a metre of mud. The destruction gets worse closer to the river, where some houses on rural land areburied up to their roof. Most of the deaths occurred here.‘They just want to come and help’A week on, and the search and rescue operation has dwindled, and the rains have stopped. The sludge on the roads is thick, sucking boots from feet, and it smells, cooking in the hot sun. Some of the mud has dried into a fine dust, which fills the air around Guangfu station. People shout over the crowds, directing people to supply sorting groups, or into teams to help individual homes nearby.View image in fullscreenVolunteers line up with shovels in Guangfu to help after a mudslide sparked by typhoon rains.Photograph: Helen Davidson/The GuardianBut people are laughing and cheering each other on. Almost everyone is from out of town. On Saturday alone – the first day of a long weekend – more than 30,000 volunteers arrived by train, quadrupling the town’s usual population. Ten extra services were added, and by Monday traffic controls were in place to deal with the influx.Hundreds of police officers and military are on site, as well as disaster responders from Tzu Chi, a Buddhist charity, managing about 10,000 of the volunteers. Some of the volunteers have answered social media pleas from residents, or come directly to the homes of friends or relatives. Many are walking around with shovels until they find someone who needs help digging out a room.“A lot of volunteers, they just want to come and help,” says Tzu Chi’s deputy CEO Scott Liu.It’s well meaning and mostly helpful, but has been chaotic. At several intersections, hundreds of volunteers walk along streets filled with mud and debris, while cars, motorbikes, and small excavators veer around them.“If it’s not properly managed, it would affect those who truly want to do the rescue work, and it would slow things down,” a firefighter says, but adds that it hasn’t been too bad.map‘No government people had come here’Across town the volunteers have been welcomed with open arms by residents.View image in fullscreenWang Wei-chang stands on the ground floor of his parents’ home in Guangfu. He has welcomed the volunteers, saying official help had still not arrived three days after the flood.Photograph: Helen Davidson/The GuardianWang Wei-chang is scraping the last of the mud from his parents’ home. Wang lives out of town, and says his parents survived after retreating to the second floor. A water mark sits 1.5 metres (5ft) high on the walls, not quite reaching the paper calendar that hasn’t been changed since 23 September. Inside is mostly empty now, but the street outside is piled high, waiting for professionals to clear it for a fourth time. He says that without the volunteers, they’d all still be sitting in mud.“Three days after the flooding, no government people had come here at all,” says Wang. “But the volunteers came in, at 5 o’clock in the morning. They said they were from Tainan [on Taiwan’s west coast].”He’s not the only resident who is unsatisfied with the authorities’ response. While disasters always stretch resources, this one has sparked an unsavoury fight over blame between county officials and the central government, who are from rival parties. The largest ever evacuation order in Taiwan was issued by the central government a day before the lake burst, but there arequestions about its implementation.County officials said the expansion of the evacuation zone – two days before the breach – was too late, and people should have been told to leave, not just go to a higher floor. The central government said it had issued multiple warnings but that the county was legally in charge of enforcement. Taiwan’s premier, Cho Jung-tai, said the government would investigate why evacuations weren’t carried out in some areas.Of the 18 people who died, almost all were elderly people who stayed in their homes, some drowning on the first floor, according to Taiwanese outletthe Reporter.View image in fullscreenVolunteers carry out damaged furniture into the street to await collection.Photograph: Helen Davidson/The GuardianThere were several red alerts issued, including the day prior to the disaster, according to reports. But assessments changed frequently, and some residents say there wasn’t enough of a sense of urgency, and that the mostly elderly population should have been doorknocked in case they didn’t hear loudspeaker broadcasts or receive texts.“Our convenience stores, our PXMart, were all open that day, and so were the restaurants,” says Peng Shin-yi. “Everything was operating normally, so we didn’t expect it to be that serious.”View image in fullscreenPeng Shin-yi stands outside his destroyed house, while volunteers behind help to dig out tonnes of mud.Photograph: Helen Davidson/The GuardianPeng himself had gone out to lunch when a friend nearby shouted that the water was coming. He says he ran to his scooter as the wave washed down the street towards him. Making it home, he climbed to the second-floor balcony and then watched as almost two metres of water and dirt destroyed the ground floor, his car, garden, and those of his neighbours. His aunt, an elderly woman living in a house closer to the river, died in her home.Qiu Jinzhong, the head of badly hit Datong, told the outlet he had doorknocked everyone in his village two days before the lake burst. When the water hit, Qiu and his wife were on their second floor, safe but trapped as neighbours who hadn’t left called out for help. “Many people simply refused to believe,” he says.By Monday afternoon, most volunteers are leaving to get back to work. As the thousands trudge back to the train station to head home, residents shout “jiayou!” and “xie xie!” (thank you). Some have set up buckets and hoses to wash people’s boots before they get on the train, others hand out food and beer.Guangfu’s disaster soon left international headlines, but in Taiwan, social media feeds are still full of scenes from the clean-up. Some give advice for anyone else wanting to help this town on the long road ahead, one person evenwrote a song, but most just want to share some hope in the wake of disaster.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsTaiwanExtreme weatherAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Charitha, the youngest ever curator of the National Museum of Antiquities, does not care for it.The pretender also wears a crown of matted hair and holds her right hand invaradamudrā, poised to dispense blessings. But no one is fooled. This Tārā is a plaster cast of the eighth-century original—made of gilded bronze, now mounted on a marble block in England. Donated by the British Museum, custodian of the real statue, her gold paint falls as flat as their gesture. A reproachful sign at her feet tells viewers exactly where they can find the authentic figure.Charitha often peppers her guided tours with pointed remarks: ‘At the British Museum, the statue of Tārā is identified by the accession number 1830,0612.4 which securely links every object to its history—the first four digits indicate the year of acquisition.’It’s a mouthful, but the public never seems fazed.For some thirty years of the British Museum’s custodianship, the real Tārā—nearly five feet tall, wearing only a sarong knotted at the hips—was hidden in theSecretum, a special room once reserved for objects deemed too perverse for public display. Charitha finds it vexing that the statue remains in the care of those who do not quite understand its spiritual significance. She scoffs each time her eyes land on‘high tubular coiﬀure’,the museum’s description of Tārā’sjatamukuta, the crown of the ascetic. Periodically, she revisits the statue’s exhibition history, as if expecting something new will have transpired, but the last feature remains the 2010 BBC radio series‘A History of the World in 100 Objects’. Her latest loan request was declined with a galling line:‘We appreciate your interest in cultural exchange.’Charitha writes about these and other pet peeves atNotes from the Margins. Her blog barely has a readership, mostly comprising other South Asian curators and historians. All the same, her last entry on Tārā’s repatriation—amplified by a wokefluencer angling for clout—has triggered a politely scathing email from the Ministry of Culture, Artifacts, and Technology.While your passion is commendable, Ms. Wijesinghe, we must remind you that repatriation eﬀorts were pursued in 1937 and again in 1980—with no favourable outcome. We urge you to reﬂect on the remit of your position and respect the delicate balance of international cultural relations.Athul reads the note over her shoulder during breakfast, chuckling in his usual gormless fashion.‘Sounds like someone used ChatGPT,’ he says, breathing crumbs all over herkola kanda.‘They’re more worried about the latest trade deal than about cultural heritage.’‘Maybe,’ he says, idly skimming her blog. ‘But calling them imperialists in the first paragraph probably didn’t help.’‘I call it like I see it.’‘Bully for you. But you know very well if we got our precious statues back, they’d be crumbling in a week. Not like we can afford all those climate-controlled latrines.’‘Vitrines,’ she corrects, even though she’s used to his hyperbole.‘Tomayto, tomahto.’‘A little support would be nice, you know,’ she says, glancing at him sideways. ‘But I’m your biggest advocate, Charitha.’‘Really? Because it doesn’t always feel like that.’‘I hate it when you get this way,’ he sighs.‘And what way is that?’ she asks, raring for a fight.Athul shrugs and stuffs a piece of toast into his mouth.‘Fractious.’Everyone expects disenchantment to sneak up on them in a marriage, but Charitha braced for it at seven years, not twenty.They do not have the distraction of children. And here they are, having made it to a milestone where they should be toasting their endurance, but she finds it harder than ever to feign enthusiasm at his glib remarks. The irritation that was once fleeting now lingers; easing herself out of it takes a day and a half. She doubts Athul even notices. He oversees a chain of ayurvedic spas and it shows. Lately, he’s been more concerned with the beard he’s growing than with anything she has to say. He spends hours manicuring it; their credit card statements reference oils and balms fromStubble & Spice. Sometimes, she wonders who he’s primping for.At work, Charitha considers how she can leverage the interest in her latest post to advance the conversation on cultural repatriation.‘Restitution can’t just be performative,’ she tells Kanishka, her curatorial assistant, over lunch. ‘There has to be something real behind it.’Kanishka, who recently completed a degree in ethnography at the University of Colombo, nods vigorously.‘You know what I’d like to see?’ he says. ‘A statue swap. I mean, they do it with prisoners, don’t they?’Charitha looks at him quizzically.‘What?’ he asks. ‘Shouldn’t colonial statues be returned to the metropole?’‘I think that might be a little tricky,’ she backtracks, realising he’s hinting at the regnal statue by the museum’s side entrance. ‘Politically speaking.’Kanishka shrugs. ‘Reparations aren’t just a buzzword.’He’s a protégé of sorts. Charitha sees in him the same rebellious streak that runs through her. But his ideas stretch boundaries in ways that his current position cannot sustain. She feels compelled to offer both guidance and protection—at least until he can stand on his own.‘I’ve been looking at this manuscript,’ she says, changing tacks. ‘Twenty four double-sided palm leaves, bound in wooden covers decorated withdharmawheels. The British Museum has it but it’s not even on display.’Kanishka leans in, squinting at the screen. ‘Says here it was a donation from the United Society for the Propagation of the Gospel…?’‘Might have been a missionary trophy,’ she says, her frown deepening. ‘Hard to know for sure.’‘That could be something new for your blog,’ he offers helpfully. ‘Why don’t we dig deeper?’Just then, Charitha’s phone buzzes. It’s another push notification from the bank:Your purchase at Lankatilaka One Galle Face has been approved.She sighs in frustration. It’s the third time this month. It’s not enough that her husband spends on artisanal skincare—must he also keep buying overpriced tchotchkes?She comes home that evening to find a new wooden door stopper, painted to look like a Sinhalese village woman in a red cloth and green jacket. The figure looks uncomfortable, its flat feet tucked beneath their solid oak door. On their bookshelves, a pair of Kandyan aristocrats raise their hands in the traditional greeting ofayubowan.‘Weren’t last week’s fishermen enough?’ she asks Athul derisively.‘What? I find them charming.’‘Yes, cultural commodification is delightful, isn’t it?’‘Must everything be a battle, Charitha?’‘It wouldn’t be if you weren’t so clueless. I’m always having to explain things to you.’‘Have you considered that I don’t live for your lectures?’ he asks, his voice rising.She stares at him for a moment, trying to muster a retort.‘Of course you haven’t,’ he continues. ‘Because that would force you to confront your saviour complex, wouldn’t it?’With that, he disappears into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. ‘Maybe you’d like me more if I sold beard oil!’ she shouts after him.Charitha stands there for a minute, feeling foolish. She needs a huffy exit too—something to spare her from the sting of Athul’s words and her own pettiness. She storms to the balcony for some air. Outside, a neon sun is setting over the Kotte cemetery, edging the scudding clouds with fire. She looks out over Maligawa Road.Before the graves, there had been a Portuguese church. And before that, the royal palace of the Kotte kingdom. The oldsandeshapoetry spoke of an edifice made of blue gems, a pinnacle that could be seen from the surrounding villages.That’s long gone.Somewhere along the way, the Dutch took the foundational stones for monuments in the capital, the British carted off the rubble for the breakwater at Galle Face, and the moonstones reappeared in the homes of contractors. Today, electrical wires streak the skies and multistoried homes stand like sentries along their lane, braving smoke from the cremator.Charitha, raised on stories of Sri Lanka’s golden past, had pushed Athul to buy the apartment, hoping it might anchor them to that lost world. There was a time she looked forward to passing those tales on—she would picture wonder dawning on a pair of little faces as they listened to the exploits of old kings like Kassapa and Dutugamunu. Tales that had captivated her, back when she sat nestled in the cradle of her father’s sarong. But now, all that seems a little naive—a maternal ideal that never materialised.Is that why Tārā matters so much?Somewhere along the way, did the statue become a stand-in—for everything lost, for stories left untold?She steps back inside, where the air is cooler but no less heavy. Athul is still holed up in the bathroom and the paper bag fromLankatilakasits insolently on the counter. As she moves to clear it, something inside catches her eye. A note.‘It was lovely chatting today, A—let me know if you still want the engraved elephants.’—MHer hand stills. Who the hell is M?The next day, Charitha drives to the One Galle Face mall on her lunch break, takes the escalator up two floors in a daze and makes a beeline for theLankatilakastore. Walking in, she finds the place festooned with coconut shell bowls and batik shirts, rattan mats and clay pots,rakshamasks andsesathfans.‘Can I help you find something, madam?’Charitha spins around to face the lilting voice, her gaze sharpening on the woman’s badge.Meaghan.With a clinical eye, she surveys the woman’s long legs, freckled cheeks, and fair hair—suddenly, Athul’s new obsession with handicrafts makes perfect sense. The discovery doesn’t bring the bolt of jealousy she expected, though her first thought is still uncharitable:Couldn’t they get a local for this job?‘Are you looking for a gift?’‘Er, yes,’ Charitha says, stiffening. ‘Do you have any engraved elephants?’‘Of course,’ Meaghan says, gliding through the aisles. She gestures to a shelf lined with every manner of pachyderm—painted, engraved, metal, wood, fabric, and plastic.‘All our pieces tell a story.’‘And what story is that? Capitalism?’ Charitha blurts, before she can stop herself.Good grief, maybe she really is insuﬀerable.Meaghan smiles awkwardly.‘We help local craftspeople make a living’.Charitha stares at her, discomfort deepening.Trying to salvage the moment, she grabs the first elephant she sees, a fever dream of a creature, daubed in the saffron, green, and maroon of the national flag.‘I’ll take this one.’‘It’s one of our bestsellers,’ Meaghan says brightly.Charitha pays for the gaudy memento in silence, then leaves before she can say anything else.‘So what if he likes a cute shop girl?’ Nandani asks, sipping her tamarind margarita. ‘It’s a couple of ornaments, Charitha. Not like the man bought her an apartment. As far as affairs go, this one is pretty tame.’Charitha fixes her friend with a hard look.‘Who said anything about an affair? For all I know, the note is part of her sales pitch.’‘Fine, a bit of banter then,’ Nandani says. ‘Nothing wrong with a harmless flirtation.’‘Maybe you’re not the right person to discuss this with,’ Charitha says.‘Why? Because I don’t subscribe to your narrow ideals about monogamy?’‘I couldn’t care less about that. It’s more about what she represents. You wouldn’t get it.’Nandani narrows her eyes.‘Oh, I see. This has to do with her being white.’Charitha looks down, her eyes darting between her sensible black flats and Nandani’s pointy pink suede heels.‘That’s a disgusting amount of toe cleavage,’ she says, trying to change the subject.‘Careful!’ Nandani says, ignoring the deflection. ‘You’re heading into reverse racism territory.’‘You know very well that’s a myth,’ Charitha starts.‘Racism is prejudice anchored in institutional power, blah blah blah,’ Nandani says, rolling her eyes. ‘Yeah, I caught your Ted talk. I’m more interested in why you’re so rattled. You say you’re not jealous, and yet this is all you’ve talked about since we sat down.’Charitha sighs. ‘Fine. It’s not that he’s noticed another woman—it’swhathe might have noticed about her. Blonde hair, blue eyes, skin like a peach. What if it’s her otherness he’s drawn to? What if he fetishises her? Or am I just projecting?’‘See? I called it.’‘Well? What do you think?’‘For starters, Charitha, you sound like a bloody thesis,’ Nandani groans. ‘But honestly? I’m a little surprised you care.’‘What’s that supposed to mean?’‘Lately, all you’ve done is complain about the man. I kind of thought things were running their course.’‘How could you say that?’ Charitha asks, flashing indignance.Nandani sighs and takes another sip of her drink.‘When you married Athul, fresh out of university, do you remember what I asked you?’‘Yeah,’ Charitha says wryly.‘Are you sure?’‘And do you recall what you said?’‘Yeah, I’m sure. He’s my counterpoint,’Charitha quotes.‘Exactly. Now when was the last time you felt that way?’‘I don’t know, Nandani,’ she says, frowning. ‘Things were different back then. I was angry, full of theory, wanting to prove myself in a field dominated by men. He was calm, grounded…older. He’d traveled the world but still loved Sri Lanka best. I thought we were kindred spirits.’‘So… what’s changed?’ Charitha sighs.‘It’s hard to put my finger on it. I just don’t recognise him anymore. It’s not only about this flirtation… or banter…or whatever it is. Athul acts like I’m wasting my time at the museum. I’m trying to reclaim our heritage and all he can do is make light of it. What am I supposed to feel?’‘Babe, I get it. Your work matters to you.’ Nandani says, gently. ‘But no one wants to be locked in a war all the time. Maybe the man just wants to live.’‘That’s unfair,’ Charitha says, sulking. ‘Whose side are you even on?’Nandani reaches over and touches her wrist. ‘I’m not saying you’re wrong to care. But maybe ease up a little?’Charitha stares at the condensation running down her glass.There it is again—her husband’s words, echoed now by her friend. Nandani’s honesty can be brutal, but she’s rarely wrong.Must everything be a battle?And yet Charitha cannot bring herself to let it go. If she doesn’t move the needle on cultural repatriation, what other legacy is there? She thinks of Kanishka, who keeps nudging her to do more. She can’t spend her life crafting eloquent laments. What kind of a weak and ineffectual mentor would that make her?That night, she comes home and plonks the elephant in front of Athul. ‘For your collection.’He looks up from his phone, puzzled, and takes in the offering. ‘Thanks?’For a moment, the room is quiet. Charitha stares hard at her husband, wanting him to say something.But Athul stays put, giving the ornament another glance.‘Bit on the nose, isn’t it?’Charitha can’t tell if he means the elephant’s ridiculous nationalism or her unspoken accusation.She glances at it, as if looking for the answer. The elephant stares back, trunk frozen mid-salute.‘I know you saw the note,’ Athul says, finally. ‘It’s not what you think.’‘So you’renotflirting with a shop girl?’‘Okay—maybe a little,’ he says, refusing to meet her eyes. ‘But that’s all it is.’‘Must be nice to be admired,’ she mutters. ‘Bet she praised your beard.’‘Stop it, Charitha.’She drops her head into her hands. Suddenly, she feels drained.Athul’s tone softens. ‘Why are we always sniping at each other?’‘I don’t know,’ she says, voice muffled through her hands.The next morning, Charitha wakes up to find the elephant in the trash. She takes the gesture as a sign that Athul has come to his senses. But the other ornaments remain stubbornly in place, as if hinting at the precariousness of their reconciliation.A note from Athul sits on the kitchen counter:Oﬀ to work early. Black Gram product line launches today.After a moment’s hesitation, Charitha rounds up the offending tchotchkes and patriotism be damned, tips them into the bin. She drives to work in better spirits and the momentum carries into her day at the museum.The conversation with Nandani—about Athul being her counterpoint—has unlocked a memory.Post-pandemic, Charitha’s first work trip had taken her to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. There, an exhibit by the same name,Counterpoint,caught her eye. She hadn’t thought of it in years, but now the word draws a clean line between past and present, sparking an idea.She decides to run it past Kanishka. Even as Charitha walks over to his desk, a niggling feeling tells her she might be acting irresponsibly.Should she really drag her assistant into this plan?For a moment, Charitha considers consulting one of the other curators in her network. But fearing they might dissuade her—or worse, pounce on the idea themselves—she banishes the thought. Kanishka is the only one she trusts to understand.‘Let me get this straight,’ Kanishka says. ‘The Ashmolean’s Chantrey Wall features a bunch of oldies who benefited from the slave trade.’‘Yes, sixteen busts of the notoriously rich.’‘And Mary Chamberlain createdCounterpointas a response to the Chantrey busts?’‘That’s right. She ran community workshops to get to know people of colour—those who have shaped modern Britain but remain absent from its museum walls.’‘And then she sketched them?’‘Using pigments from colonial imports like coffee and saffron, on vellum.’‘The stuff they used to encode the law? That’s poetic.’‘It’s incredible. The work is confronting, yet still full of vulnerability.’‘So…it’s kind of a posthumous face-off then?’‘Or a symbolic showdown,’ she smiles.‘Andyouwant to dowhat?’‘Commission a local artist to paint Sir Robert Brownrigg and have him confront our replica of Tārā.’Kanishka raises an eyebrow.‘The Governor of Ceylon who brought the original to Britain? You can’t be serious.’‘Why not? No one knows how he came into its possession.’‘Maybe he thought she’d keep him safe on the high seas,’ Kanishka chuckles. ‘Isn’t she the protectress of earthly travel?’‘Never mind that. What do you think?’‘I mean… it works as an homage,’ he says slowly. ‘But as an actual exhibit? Isn’t it… derivative? You’d be replicating someone else’s idea.’‘Exactly,’ Charitha says.Kanishka stares at her in surprise.‘By adapting the visual language of theCounterpointexhibit, I want to critique colonial theft.’‘So you want totakesomething to draw attention to what wastaken?’‘Yes, mimicry as a form of resistance,’ she says.‘But Charitha…’ he gasps. ‘That’s brilliant.’She smiles. ‘I figure it’s about time we stirred the waters.’With that, they dive into the project, brimming with excitement. In an afternoon, Charitha scrapes together funding for the installation and its publicity, while Kanishka puts out an open call for artists’ expressions of interest. To make it work, Charitha has to shave a sliver off the air conditioning budget for the numismatics exhibit—but the coins have survived several imperial regimes already; they can take the heat.Amonth later, the museum is milling with people for the launch of the new installation, mostly academics and journalists but also history buffs.Nerdy types, Nandani declared upon walking in—and she isn’t wrong.Her friend stands now before the display, eyeing it with a wry smile.‘I mean, it’s something.’She pivots between the five-foot oil portrait of Brownrigg, pristine in full military regalia, and the replica of Tārā.‘Couldn’t you have given her a wipe down though?’ she asks. ‘The goddess looks crusty.’‘It’s intentional,’ Charitha says. ‘He’s in all his power and glory, confronting the consequences of his actions…taking the original statue, that is…and the contrast is only magnified by this shabby replica.’Charitha plays it cool, rehearsing lines she hopes to use on other attendees, but her palms are moist, and she presses them discreetly against her cotton saree.An early tweet has already skewered the museum for ‘aping the West’and‘appropriating ideas from other artists’.Another tweet criticises Charitha for her unrelenting campaign against the British Museum, calling it a#CulturalGemwith a deep commitment to preserving history.Kanishka comes over, offering the women a pair of champagne flutes.‘The results are in,’ he says. ‘A solid 74% say institutions shouldnotco-opt original work.’‘Interesting,’ Charitha smiles. Earlier, she’d enlisted Kanishka to run a poll among the evening’s attendees. They’d posed a single question: ‘Is it acceptable for an institution to take an artist’s idea and repurpose it for its own ends?’‘I said it’s okay if the artist consents,’ Nandani pipes in. ‘Otherwise it’s plain exploitative, isn’t it?’‘She’s in the 10% of respondents who picked that option,’ Kanishka reports. ‘Another 10% said it depended on the context and purpose.’‘The rest actually believe that institutions can do as they please?’ Charitha asks, incredulously.Kanishka nods. ‘A minority, yes. But don’t worry. A little controversy drives engagement.’‘Why do I feel like there’s more to this…face-off?’ Nandani asks, raising an eyebrow.‘There’s always more when Charitha’s involved,’ Athul says, joining them. ‘Sorry I’m late—still managing the PR circus.’Charitha nods and gives him a brief hug. Several customers of his black gram product line have developed skin reactions lately—the Ayurvedic specialists have chalked it down to excesspitta dosha,or internal heat.‘Thank you for coming,’ she whispers, politely.When the time is right, Kanishka taps her on the shoulder. Charitha makes her way to the centre of the hall, feeling nervous. She takes a deep breath and starts speaking:On the surface, our exhibit functions both as an homage to Mary Chamberlain’s Counterpoint and as a spotlight on the real statue of Tārā, which remains at the British Museum—far from its rightful home.But it is also more than that. Today, we asked you a question about artistic ownership and many of you responded by critiquing us for co-opting Chamberlain’s ideas—we couldn’t agree more. When institutions take without permission, it echoes a long history of appropriation, both colonial and corporate.Our simple poll is only a stand-in for a much bigger question—that of cultural ownership—and this installation is not merely a reproduction: It’s a subversive act. By deliberately echoing the visual language of the Counterpoint exhibit, by taking something that is not ours to take, we are holding a mirror to the very mechanisms by which cultural artifacts—like the statue of Tārā—have been appropriated, displayed, and misinterpreted by colonial powers.At this, a scattering of applause breaks out among the academics in the group.‘Bloody hell, I still don’t get it!’ Nandani hisses.‘In plain English, someone?’‘They’re stealing from the West to stick it to the West.’ Athul chuckles.‘That’s an oversimplification,’ Kanishka whispers. ‘But, yeah.’Someone overhears them—because the next morning, a version of the exchange makes it into theDaily Gazetteheadline:Museum of Antiquities exhibit steals from the WestThere’s a colour photograph of the plaster Tārā positioned to face the portrait of Brownrigg, along with a pair of front-facing shots. Also in the mix is a slightly grainy image of Charitha, looking like the ghost of the resistance in white.Later, several local academics flock to her blog, leaving praise for the museum’s ‘transgressive act of mimicry’and‘clever homage’.An Indian curator in her network catches wind of the news and sends her a one-liner:‘Wish I’d thought to do that with a replica of the Koh-i-Noor.’She even gets a LinkedIn message from the director of a South Asian think tank: ‘If you’re ever looking to switch gears, we could use someone with your savvy.’For a few days, Charitha coasts on a cloud while Athul fumes over the implosion of his black gram line.Then, another missive arrives from the Ministry:Critical engagement may be acceptable in academic forums, Ms. Wijesinghe, but public-facing exhibitions must adhere to standards of neutrality, respect, and sensitivity.Charitha skims the withering email, rolling her eyes at the Ministry’s regret over the ‘unilateral nature of recent programming decisions’ and their demand for ‘clarification on the exhibit’s intent.’ For a moment, she lingers on their final line:Please refrain from media engagement on this matter until further notice.But Kanishka has already leveraged a third-degree connection to get theGazettearticle on the radar ofTea & Outrage, a political podcast run out of London. The hosts, Zola and Rehan, a pair of youth activists who wish to platform unheard voices, have invited Charitha to participate in a 5-minute segment on the exhibit. It’s the farthest she’s managed to advance the issue and she can’t resist the opportunity.She spends days fussing in front of the mirror, double-checking her Zoom setup and tailoring her remarks, as if preparing for an interview with a major news network.‘I’d be more cautious, if I were you,’ Athul says, not unkindly. ‘The Ministry will see it as an impertinence.’‘With any luck, they won’t even hear about it,’ she says. ‘It’s only an up-and-coming podcast.’‘What’s all this effort in aid of then?’Charitha shoots him a stormy glance but decides it’s not worth fighting over. He’s been sore about his failed line and on the backfoot ever since their talk about the shop girl.Let the man be.On the day of the podcast, Charitha starts her segment by describing the exhibit and clarifying its intent. She finishes off with a few soundbites on the importance of Tārā’s return.‘Your take on mimicry is compelling,’ Zola says. ‘Crafting an exhibit that’s both homage and critique is not an easy line to walk, especially for the curator of a publicly-funded institution. It’s one of the reasons we really wanted you on our show.’Charitha takes a deep breath, grateful for the validation.‘Thank you Zola. It’s never easy finding new ways to shed light on old injustices.’The compliment barely sinks in before Zola adds—‘But if I’m honest, Charitha, I’m divided on this one,’ Zola says. ‘Mary Chamberlain’s work challenges the historical erasure of Britain’s marginalised communities. I can’t help but feel that your exhibit undermines her message.’‘How so?’ she asks, feeling the heat rising in her chest.‘Mimicry notwithstanding, aren’t you risking a false equivalence? By equating the plunder of artifacts with the horrors of enslavement?’For a moment, Charitha reels.How did she fail to see that coming?But she has to stay the course.‘I hear you, Zola,’ she says, trembling slightly. ‘But from my perspective, both evils stem from the same oppressive system. Slavery violates the body and freedom—looting attacks cultural memory and identity.’‘But that’s not the same thing, is it?’ Zola asks, more fiery now. ‘Enslavement is a crime against humanity, one that’s recognised internationally.’‘Of course!’ Charitha says, choosing her words carefully. ‘But the comparison underscores the depths of colonial violence, doesn’t it? While we highlight different issues, our exhibit shares the same spirit asCounterpoint. It’s about challenging colonial narratives. Through mimicry, we’re revealing contradictions in how people—universal museums in particular—think about cultural ownership.’‘I understand your intent, Charitha, truly. But for people like me, the trauma of slavery isn’t abstract. It’s not merely a lens for critiquing colonialism—it’s lived pain. It echoes through our bodies, our families, our words, our silences. It’s not up for debate.’Charitha nods mutely, letting Zola’s words sink in, her bubble of self-assuredness well and truly punctured.‘And that’s all the time we have today folks!’ Rehan pipes in. ‘Tune in next week for more polite outrage.’Charitha slams the laptop shut, feeling defeated.‘That was brutal,’ she says.Kanishka, who has been watching from a corner, lets out a loud exhale.‘Uncomfortable to say the least.’‘It’s my fault,’ Charitha says, rubbing her temples. ‘I got so caught up in the fight, I didn’t even realise what I was missing—until she filled in the blanks.’She looks up, expecting one of Kanishka’s usual quick takes. He stretches his legs and sighs.‘I guess that’s what makes it a blind spot,’ he says quietly. ‘It’s not like I saw it coming either. We were both too caught up in making a statement.’Charitha stares at him glumly.‘But that’s part of the challenge, isn’t it?’ Kanishka continues. ‘All this time, we’ve been locked in an insular fight…blogging for a predominantly South Asian audience…shooting emails into the ether. None of us can see beyond our own hurts.’‘That’s generous,’ she says. ‘But it won’t get me off the hook, will it?’‘Hey, at least now you’ve started a conversation. We just have to keep nudging it in the right direction.’But Charitha doesn’t get the chance. The podcast receives a flurry of comments, slamming her for minimising the generational trauma of enslavement. Before long, a transcript of the interview makes its way into theDaily Gazettewith the headline:Bold or Blundering? Museum under ﬁre for likening artifact loss to slaveryShe spends the next few days on damage control: fielding calls, replying to comments, and hiding under her blanket.Athul brings her cups of masala chai, her go-to comfort. Though he makes it too sweet, it becomes the only thing she looks forward to.Within the week, she receives a letter from the Ministry, reassigning her to the role of Assistant Director, Inventory and Conservation Logistics.‘What does that even mean?’ Athul asks.But they both already know the answer: Backroom work with no public interface.‘I’m really kicking myself here, Athul. If I hadn’t been so enamoured with the cleverness of it all—the hope that Tārā’s repatriation would finally make headlines—I might have thought more seriously about how this exhibit would land.’‘Who are they bringing in to take your place?’‘Some former diplomat…fresh off a UNESCO posting. Someone better at charming the bigwigs and keeping the museum…globally palatable.’He nods, saying nothing.‘Go on, say it,’ she says, wearily. ‘You were right.’‘I take no pleasure in it.’Charitha looks up at him, searching for a hint of smugness but finding none. He’s been unusually devoted since the fallout from the podcast, almost as if softened by her failure.‘I really thought I could bring the statue back,’ she says. ‘That I could be the one to succeed where others had failed, that if I tried hard enough, long enough, that I could skew public perception in our favour. Maybe it was just hubris.’She offers up this moment of reflection, tied up in a bow, wondering if Athul will tug it loose with a smirk.But he sits next to her and touches her hand instead.She pauses for a moment, looking around their immaculate apartment. Their walls crisp and untouched by crayons, the stainless steel fridge free of report cards, their photo frames only ever populated with the two of them.Is this why she feels so compelled to make her mark?But she shakes her head, checking herself. Being childfree hasn’t driven her to prioritise her career, it’s the reason she can afford to take risks.‘Do you resent me?’ she asks him suddenly.‘Whatever for?’‘The life unlived,’ she says, gesturing around their home. ‘Children, or the lack thereof?’‘That decision was mutual, Charitha.’‘Just checking.’‘Does it get lonely sometimes? Sure. Do I wonder how different things might have been? Occasionally. But I look at the life we’ve built and I’m mostly content.’‘Mostly?’ she asks, thinking of the shop girl.Athul catches her drift.‘Despite all our missteps, there’s still more right with us than wrong.’She weighs his words, running a mental inventory of their past.‘What do you want to do now?’ he asks after a moment’s silence.‘Honestly?’ she asks. ‘I need a break.’Athul sighs. ‘I could use one myself.’They sit on the couch in perfect equanimity, the TV playing to no one.‘Do you want to go away together?’ he asks, cautiously. ‘Maybe Ella?’It’s where they honeymooned.Charitha shakes her head. ‘I don’t think we’re there yet.’He nods, not pushing it.‘Down south then?’‘Somewhere without history,’ she says.Charitha isn’t ready to forgive his small betrayals, not yet. But she can’t pretend the high ground is hers anymore.Quietly, she makes an invocation to Tārā. For traveling mercies and the strength to try again.Explore more on these topicsBooks4thWrite short story prizeFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, this documentary depicts abhorrent neglectHannah J DaviesWed 1 Oct 2025 16.00 EDTShareOver the summer, BBC Scotland journalist Catriona MacPhee went undercover, working as a cleaner at the Castlehill Care Home in Inverness. The home – part of Simply Inverness Ltd, itself an offshoot of the company Morar Living – promises a comfortable, even luxurious standard of care for up to 88 residents. When Kerry first looked at the home with her mother, Jessie, she wanted to move in too, she says. But by the time you finish MacPhee’s hour-long film, you will have little doubt that the image Castlehill presents to the outside world – complete with champagne and fine dining – couldn’t be further from the appalling reality.MacPhee meets residents like Teasha, who has dementia and has also used a stoma bag for 35 years. Due to the poor or often absent care at Castlehill, the stoma is now causing her significant discomfort and she is often seen crying out in distress. In one clip, filmed covertly by MacPhee, a member of staff describes Teasha as “mental”. It’s abhorrent, but within the wider context of the neglect and even intimidation endured by those at Castlehill on a daily basis, it is far from surprising. MacPhee finds residents left wearing incontinence pads for more than 12 hours; human excrement on chairs in the lounge; and one woman who hasn’t had a shower in weeks. Castlehill is short-staffed, and even as the regulator begins to ask questions (there’s a surprise visit from the Care Inspectorate in MacPhee’s first week on the job), it’s clear that this place isn’t just mildly inadequate but deeply dysfunctional and dangerous. At one point, Kerry took Jessie home with her; nobody noticed as they left the building.MacPhee’s investigation was triggered by a number of complaints about the home, including one made by Su, who recalls the horrific scenes she herself caught on a hidden camera. She watched in horror as a carer and housekeeper colluded with one another, threatening to hit her father, who has dementia. When Su saw the housekeeper grab her father by the wrist and pin him to his bed, she called the police. Her police complaint would become a social services issue, and when they told the home about the hidden camera, her father was barred from having guests. Su’s father has since left Castlehill; she says that carers were still noting him as being asleep and comfortable in bed on their app when he was no longer living there.Su’s complaint was upheld in full by the Care Inspectorate. In fact, says MacPhee, no other care home in Scotland had as many complaints upheld against it last year as Castlehill. It’s easy to see why: the home is so stretched that when Teasha’s daughter Vanessa visited every day, she found herself more or less taking on the role of a carer. But, beyond being stretched, there’s also the sense that many staff simply don’t care enough. MacPhee’s hidden camera footage shows Teasha in major distress, yet being frequently ignored by staff she knows well. One of MacPhee’s colleagues – her face blurred for obvious reasons – recounts how other colleagues told her that somebody needed to be changed while she was with another resident, instead of doing it themselves. “There’s principles and they don’t have it,” she says, wearily. “It’s common decency.”But is it so common after all? Based on everything we see in the film, there’s often very little concern for the welfare – never mind the quality of life – of the people who live at Castlehill. And while some staff are clearly trying, the general picture is bleak. Linda breaks down when she sees footage of her mother-in-law, Rachel, being forced to receive intimate care from a male staff member, against the wishes stated in her care plan. “They’ve seriously let us down … they’ve let her down,” she says with tears in her eyes. And even when the home does manage to get the basics right, there is little stimulation for many of these people, whom MacPhee encounters sitting in the same position for hours on end. This, in turn, leads to more rapid cognitive decline.The film briefly considers what can be done to improve the sector (such as recruiting more staff), but the truth is that it needs the kind of radical overhaul that would require several hours more airtime to truly dissect. But what it does do – brilliantly, blood-boilingly – is to show us just how grim it can be, and how much money is being made in the process. Teasha’s self-funded place at Castlehill cost £7,033 a month, while Morar Living is expected to make £90m in pre-tax profits over the next five years. While the company didn’t provide a spokesperson for interview, in a statement it said that each resident is consistently monitored and evaluated; that a clinical lead had been appointed; and the number of zero-hours staff had been reduced to zero. It also said it would invest £1m to refurbish Castlehill, and that recent improvements had been noted by the Care Inspectorate. Regardless, I really hope its shareholders were watching.Disclosure: Care Home Undercover aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDocumentarySocial careCare workersreviewsShareReuse this content"

If he’s weird about other men wearing makeup (“like, K-pop idols”), says he wants a “slightly autistic woman”, has no skincare routine or only likes songs that got famous on TikTok. It’s an ick if he doesn’t call his parents, sniffs every five seconds, is an unsuccessful DJ or is embarrassed to do karaoke. Recently, she uncovered a new one: if he’ssaving himself for marriage. It’s now at the top of the checklist on her Notes app that she references whenever she starts seeing someone new.I’ve been idealizing this one man who will drop everything for meLea Veloso“Three strikes, you’re out,” she said.Between growing up on a steady diet offan fictionand a never-ending parade of dating content on her feeds, where strangers share thejust-because flowersthey receive and beloved creator couples post their lengthybreakup announcementson YouTube, Veloso finds it harder to take in the nuance of a person when she’s dating them. The noise of who sheshouldbe dating is just too strong.“For so long, I’ve been idealizing this one man who will drop everything for me, who will know my likes, and is someone who’s the perfect mold,” she said. “I think I’m constantly disappointed by real men.”Gen Z have long faced accusations of being losers in the dating realm: young people are havingless sex,meeting fewer new people, getting cringed out by evensending roses on Hinge. They are themost rejected generationand theloneliestgeneration. Most of these trends point to a big change in dating culture: social media has entrenched itself into our romantic reality, often informing our interpersonal relationships rather than the other way around. For youngwomen like Veloso who have never dated without the internet’s input, that means the construction of a Dream Man informed by viral terms served to her by algorithms, social feeds and stories people share online more than her IRL dating life.The phraseology is expansive and ever-evolving, and for many, wielded as a prescriptive rubric for tackling the thunderdome of heterosexual dating content. There is no shortage of ways to describe the kind of man who is a romantically superior kind of partner: aloserprovider manwithgolden retriever energywhoworshipsyou becauseif he wanted to, he would. The health of a prospective match can be deemed on a red-to-green flagscale, fromminimum effortandweaponized incompetenceto getting theprincess treatmentfroma real yearner,written by a woman. Your happily-ever-after can be ensnared with thered nail theoryor theorange peel theory. The truest love, the ship,the OTP(one true pairing), is also increasingly championed on social media through tropes, whether it’s enemies-to-lovers or aslow-burnrelationship arc.There’s a big narrative around ‘these are the types of people you date’ ... and it leaves little room for compassionCynthia LaForteThis desire to develop theories that explain the painful steps of falling in love feels similar to older adages around dating, like the teachings of Cosmo magazine, Sex and the City,or Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. But relational psychoanalyst Cynthia LaForte said there is also a generational trend of diagnosing and clinicalizing everything, often propelled bymisappropriated therapy speakon social media, that is unique to gen Z and the digital era of dating.“We’ve pathologized away personality,” LaForte said. “I think there’s a big narrative around ‘these are the types of people you date’ and ‘these are the people you break up with’ and it leaves little room for compassion.”TikTok user Lexie, @spicycokezero, is a creator who has built her from creating such viral videos as “3 Ways To Tell When They’re Being Friendly vs. Being Interested In You” and “3 Signs You’re Having a Friends-To-Lovers Dynamic.” The creator, 19, is a psychology major at school, and she saidthat she is not an expert on these subjects – but when she began posting videos in hopes of finding an outlet to share her in-class learnings, thousands of people resonated with her content.“I frequently see comments that say something similar to they feel seen or understand themselves or others better after watching the video,” Lexie said. “I’ve also gotten comments saying my videos helped them start dating someone, realized the feelings are mutual, encouraged them to ask someone out, etc, which I always enjoy reading.”Some dating criteria are undoubtedly useful. Nicole, 22, who asked to go by her first name for privacy reasons, said that the last promising guy she was seeing never got past the talking stage because of the first bullet point on her own ick list: “finds me intimidating”.“As time went on, he kept making sly comments about how he was scared of me because I’m intimidating and he gets nervous,” she said. It seemed like an awkward attempt at flirting – asking her to plan the date in a flattering tone – but Nicole was not impressed. “I flat out told him: ‘There is nothing intimidating about me. You feel intimidated because some part of you believes I’m better, stronger, or even smarter, and I don’t have the time to make you feel equal to me.’”“He had to go,” she said.When asked about what kind of relationship she does want, Nicole referenced everything from television shows to celebrities: George and Amal Clooney, Damon and Elena from The Vampire Diaries, the notorious on-and-off relationship of Mr Big and Carrie Bradshaw except for the cheating.“For lack of better words, I don’t want to wear the pants in the relationship,” she said.Everyone is on the wave of holding people accountable ... but it also drowns out the hopeless romanticsNicoleWhether you are young or not, human relationships are fraught with emotional tripwires, and Dream Man content offers a safer way forward. But that means we are all dating under a panopticon, where virtues and sins can be broadcasted and scrutinized and farmed for engagement. There is a huge appetite for other people’s horror stories especially. Millions-strong Facebook groups likeAre We Dating The Same Guy? and apps like Tea were specifically designed to catch cheaters in the act. Really any fuckboy behavior can be posted and reposteduntil daters are ubiquitously known across the internet asWest Elm Calebor theCouch Guyor the man from Reesa Teesa’s notorious 50-part “Who TF Did I Marry?” TikTok series. And online, it doesn’t matter if the crime was pathologically lying or not looking overjoyed enough when your girlfriend walked through the door – the deliberation and condemnation processes are the same.“Social media makes me scared shitless to date,” Nicole said. “Everyone is on the wave of holding people accountable, which I do very much support, and because of this, people are highlighting more of the abusive side of things to raise awareness to it. But it also drowns out the hopeless romantics.”It is not just women Build-A-Bearing their ideal partner. There are plenty of phrases to describe the ideal woman among creators that make dating content for men, whether it’s ahigh-value womanor ablack cat girlfriendorsomeone they can piss off on purpose. The Cut recentlysurveyed100 men and found many were cutting women off for their own icks: “because she was a picky eater, she was too into Burning Man, she didn’t like the book Nickel and Dimed, she deleted his ex’s profile from his Nintendo Switch,” EJ Dickson reported.A generation of ‘virgins’ is leading America’s next sexual revolutionRead moreLaForte said that having guidelines for dating, even if informed by social media, can often serve as a grounding reminder of what you actually want when things get complicated: “It can guide you, save time, it can help hold yourself accountable.” But in the same breath, treating dating as an intellectual process of ticking off boxes fails to account for the humanity of it. “It also can be very reductive. It can be taking a person and reducing them to checklists.”Veloso particularly feels like the digital world offers too much content about what love should (or should not) feel like, and particularly how a love interest should (or should not) show their passion. So she plays otome games such as Love and Deepspace – romance video games where players assume the role of a female protagonist with the goal of developing a connection with another male player.“It’s a kind of love that feels more safe than going out into the world and being uncertain about what kind of love you have,” she said. “Having a guy who is completely devoted to you and very much willing to defend your relationship with all his might is a goal for me. But then it’s all these sorts of realities when it comes to men [that bring] everything down.This man can’t even talk about his own interests?”For Veloso, it’s just easier to leave it all as fiction."

Most nights, my head hits the pillow, and that’s all I remember.But several times a week, I find myself wide awake at 2.00am – stressing about a work deadline, wondering if my daughter is adjusting to her new school or making a note on my phone to get the car washed. Usually, I get back tosleepin an hour, but when my 8am alarm goes off, I feel groggy, wishing I’d had that extra shut-eye.This inability to stay asleep is calledmaintenance insomnia, says Dr Julia Kogan, a health psychologist and insomnia specialist based in Chicago. While it’s common to wake at night, some people have trouble getting back into slumber. Anxious thoughts are a common cause. “People wake and cannot shut their mind off, which interferes with their ability to fall back asleep,” says Kogan.The sleep disorder can impair a person’s daily function, but there is treatment. Here’s what you need to know about maintenance insomnia.Trouble sleeping? This therapy can help with insomniaRead moreWhat is maintenance insomnia?While many people think of insomnia astrouble falling asleep, there are different forms, says Dr Jamie Zeitzer, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University. Some people have difficulties falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia), some wake too early in the morning (early waking insomnia) and some find themselves up in the middle of the night (maintenance insomnia, named for the inability to “maintain” continuous sleep).Many people suffer from a combination of these, and Zeitzer says maintenance insomnia, on its own or experienced with other forms of insomnia, is fairly common. Nearly 20% of those with insomnia symptoms in one2014 studyexperienced extended middle-of-the-night wakings.It’s normal to wake up at night, says Zeitzer. For instance, you might need to go to the bathroom or simply wake at the end of asleep cycle, when sleep is the lightest. He says most people don’t remember their brief wakings and aren’t impaired by them the next day. But others aren’t so lucky.“It’s not necessarily what wakes people up, but what happens after with their mind that keeps them up,” Kogan says. Some people wake up at night and their mind starts racing, keeping them awake. They may even worry about losing sleep and that stress also keeps them awake, creating a frustrating cycle of wakefulness.Maintenance insomnia can look different from person to person, Kogan adds. One might experience one or two long windows of wakefulness a night, while another wakes up and falls back asleep many times.Maintenance insomnia can cause a number of mental and physical health issues, including impaired daytime performance, anxiety, headaches and body aches, says Dr Olabimpe Fashanu, a sleep physician based in Maryland.Sleeploss can also increase the risk of other conditions, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’What causes maintenance insomnia?There isn’t always a single underlying cause, but several factors can contribute to the inability to stay asleep, says Kogan.Stress and anxiety:The most common reason for maintenance insomnia is high stress and anxiety, says Kogan. When some people wake, they start thinking – perhaps about their to-do list, daily stressors or the stress of not being able to get good sleep.“Nightmares related to anxiety, PTSD or other mental health conditions can also make it hard to return to sleep,” Kogan says.Lack of sleep drive:A lack of sleep drive, or not being sufficiently tired, can also keep people up at night, Kogan says. Common causes for low sleep drive include taking naps during the day and staying in bed longer than necessary. “People with maintenance insomnia think that spending more time in bed will help them get more sleep, but it usually leads to less sleep overall,” says Kogan.Physical pain and discomfort:Pain is often associated with insomnia. It can wake a person up and make it difficult to fall back asleep, Zeitzer says. Painful, chronic conditions can spark long-term sleep issues, but even temporary issues like a backache or sunburn can cause problems.Other uncomfortable and anxiety-inducing medical disorders are associated with sleeping issues, says Kogan. These includeneurological disorders(like migraines and inflammatory diseases),cardiovascular diseaseandbreathing disorders. Medications associated with many of these conditions can themselves cause nighttime awakenings, says Kogan.Age and gender:Older adultstend to wake more often because they’re more prone to neuropathy, urinary problems and acid reflux, according to Zeitzer. “Even in the absence of these stimuli, older adults generally experience lighter sleep, which can mean more wakings,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For example, some might wake up to the soft sound of footsteps down the hall, while others can sleep even with the TV blaring. “Some people do better with sleep disruption in general,” Fashanu says.How do you treat maintenance insomnia?Treatment for maintenance insomnia typically depends on the underlying cause, says Fashanu. If physical pain or environmental factors are causing frequent wakings, remedying those factors is often enough. Therapy or psychiatric medications can stop sleep disruptions caused by anxiety.If these factors are ruled out, other treatments are available.CBT-I:Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a form of therapy that “essentially teaches you not to care about your insomnia, which enables you to go back to sleep much faster”, says Zeitzer. It is considered the go-to treatment for maintenance insomnia. It typically takes six to eight sessions to rewire how a person thinks about sleep and create new sleep behavior.Medication:Sleeping pills like Ambien or Lunesta can help for short-term use, but Kogan doesn’t recommend sleep medication before other options have been explored. “Insomnia is often related to cognitive and behavioral factors, so sleep meds are often a band-aid if those factors are not addressed,” she says, adding that regular and longterm use of over-the-counter medications is not recommended.Why do I feel so much worse after a nap – and how can I avoid it?Read moreExperts don’t recommend melatonin for this form of insomnia, either. “Melatonin is naturally produced by the body and often supports falling asleep. Most people don’t have a melatonin deficiency and therefore it’s not particularly helpful, especially for maintenance insomnia,” says Kogan.Arestful bedtime routine:A relaxing bedtime routine can help prevent long wake windows, says Kogan: “It’s helpful to have a 30-60 min buffer zone before bed where the person is shutting down devices and engaging in deep relaxation activity, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation and other relaxing activities.”She also says it can be helpful to spend some time earlier in the day – not right before bed – writing out any to-do items, worries or concerns, to clear one’s mind before getting to sleep.When it comes to treating insomnia in general, Fashanu advises seeking treatment sooner rather than later. She says that, over time, people with maintenance insomnia develop maladaptive habits, such as prolonged time in bed and clock watching, making sleep quality even worse. “Chronic insomnia is harder to treat the longer it’s been going on,” she adds.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyThe secrets of sleepSleepHealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Excellent socks! Anyway, some food for thought while you crunch through autumn leaves and make soup. Happy pumpkin spice latte season, kids!This is not a drill: afoolproof,10-minute DIY manicure that worksView image in fullscreenMylee gel nail wraps£11.99 at Superdrug£13.99 at MyleeAlmost every single time I buy something beauty-related on Instagram (silk heatless curlers for hair, I’m looking at you), I am profoundly disappointed in it. So no one is more surprised than me at how good these are. They’re nail-shaped stickers of shiny gel polish – solid colours, ombre, squiggles, whatever your little heart desires – that you press on to your nails and trim to match the length, no UV lamp required. They’re flexible and jelly soft, so they don’t feel fake in the way press-on nails do.I’m too clumsy to paint my right hand – I can’t even do the left very well – and while I have lots of friends who enjoy salon appointments as self-care, I find them an annoying suck on time, money and headspace. Frankly, I’d rather read my book or go for a walk. But I do love having nice nails. On me, these last a week, rather than the fortnight it claims on the packet, but I’m thrilled with that. There are lots of brands coming into this space – search “pre-cured gel nail wraps” – but Mylee are the ones I ordered (and reordered, and reordered).The perfect trousers for everyoneView image in fullscreenPleat-front Italian wool trousers£225 at Me+EmHere’s what I want from a pair of trousers. Generous pleats at the waist, for a bit of Lee Miller swagger, but neat and tapered so they don’t flap around my calves. Belt loops (essential). A fabric that holds a front crease and doesn’t sag at the knee. Life is too short for trousers that have to be washed and ironed every day; I want to hang them up and put them back on tomorrow. Me+Em is not cheap, but it makes classy, useful clothes, and the brand’sTrouser Labwill help you work out which pair is right for you. I’ve got these in deep indigo blue, which is what I think of as French navy – a bit brighter than classic navy, like the colour on the French flag – and they go with literally everything.Dior vibes, via John LewisView image in fullscreenCotton rugby shirt£45 at John LewisI recently saw an image on new Dior designerJonathan Anderson’s Instagramof a solid, no-stripe rugby shirt with a white collar underneath a classic Dior “Bar” jacket, and I instantly wanted to find a rugby shirt to wear like that. This is so chic and preppy but not in an annoying way, and it’s a perfect dress-up-dress-down piece. It’s menswear, so size down.Everything from & Other Stories under new creative directorView image in fullscreenFitted-waist cotton shirt£87 at & Other StoriesJonathan Saunders, one of London fashion week’s most beloved names of the 00s and 10s, is designing clothes for us again. This time, at high-street prices, as the chief creative officer of & Other Stories. There is so much good stuff – I’m also lusting after theknitted cape sweater– but this shirt is just brilliant. Loads of fashion details, but without any silliness.Argyle socksView image in fullscreenEveryday argyle socks£16 for two pairs at Burlington£11 a pair at AmazonI’m a big fan of an argyle check. The diamond pattern, which originated in Scotland in the 16th century, feels like a wearable, elegant way to do tartan. I’m tempted byBoden’s Abi cardiganin a charming lilac-and-chocolate colour combo, but I am also very much enjoying my sock drawer right now (age comes for all of us). An argyle sock with jeans and a loafer is such a good look, and Burlington is the OG of argyle socks.My current hero skirt isreduced from £198 to £88View image in fullscreenRuffle hem miniskirt£88 at Reiss£88 at NextMost short skirts are much too short. I get that this is a subjective point of view, but I think lots of women feel the same way. What looks good on a mannequin tends to expose an alarming amount of thigh when you sit on a chair or walk up stairs. This navy Reiss skirt is my go-to while I’m at fashion week: the sculptural shape gives it impact, so you can wear it with a white T-shirt and blazer and feel done, and it isn’t flimsy or too short.Are you always rummaging in your handbag? You need thisView image in fullscreenPenloop£3 at Cult Pens£3.90 at AmazonI’m a diehard stationery nerd, and I will never give up my paper notebook and diary. I am also on a perennial mission to reduce the amount of time I spend inelegantly rooting through my bag while muttering: “It’s in here somewhere!” Leuchtturm1917 is a German notebook brand that makes these brilliant pen loops with self-adhesive backing, which you stick inside the back cover to keep your pencil right there. My favourite part is that they come in 19 colours so you can match (or contrast) your notebook.New-bag-shape klaxon: introducing the east-to-west shapeView image in fullscreenCroc-effect baguette bag£36 at M&SYou know how the Scandi girl is the new French girl, right? I’ve been spending a lot of time poring over Copenhagen street-style blogs, trying to unpack the look. Lots of glossy slicked-back buns, but sadly these make me look more retired ballet mistress than It Girl. Year-round black sunglasses, which I can’t pull off. But another key element is a minimalist bag in a stretched horizontal shape, which is being dubbed the east-to-west. This shape tucks under your arm, making it comfortable to wear and secure for your phone and wallet, and looks instantly polished. This Marks & Spencer version is a goodie.How to stay chic in the rainView image in fullscreenDouble-faced hooded bomber£250 at the White CompanyMy absolute favourite thing in fashion is when clothes are designed to a super-high taste without compromising on the practicals. It doesn’t happen all that often, to be honest, but the new fashion collection from the White Company is smashing it. Here’s the thing: hoods need to be waterproof to work, but anoraks are just not that elegant. Enter this double-faced wool bomber with a detachable nylon puffer-style hood. The jacket is pure chic, and the hood has you covered (literally) when the weather isn’t so pretty. Pricey, but you know what they say: the best things in life are free; the next best things are very expensive.For more inspiration, check outthe 50 best coats for autumn and winterIt’sglovesseasonView image in fullscreenFringe leather gloves£25 at Accessorize£25 at NextIf you can find only one of last year’s gloves, may I recommend these?Explore more on these topicsFashionJess Cartner-Morley‘s editAutumnAccessoriesWomen's coats and jacketsSkirtsWomen's shirtsWomen's trousersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s full of stars!The only stars in Hollywood are on the pavement.Someone should help them up.These stars are the commemorative plaques comprising the Walk of Fame, a major tourist attraction.So Hollywood is full of tourists.Not so much these days – tourism marketing organisation Visit California is predicting a 9 % decline in international tourism in 2025.That’s not great, is it?It equates to about 170,000 fewer visitors. And things seem even worse in Los Angeles, where businesses on Hollywood Boulevard are reporting a 50% fall in foot traffic this summer.How come?Several reasons. First, they had those devastating wildfires in January.Second, the Hollywood Walk of Fame was named the world’s worst tourist attraction in 2023, with disappointed visitors citing a persistent smell of urine.Did that stop anyone visiting?No, actually.

I was expecting something like those Stepford-Wife AI language tutors that crop up on your Instagram feed, promising to practise German or Spanish or French with you. But it has to be said: “Tilly” is like an iPhone 17 making those faces look like a Nokia brick. It is not on screen for long and perhaps vanishes just before you sense something’s off, but as things stand, “Tilly” doesn’t look obviously less real than ​m​any of the performers​ who appear on screen today.It is not merely that the technology which creates these unreal figures gets relentlessly better and better – the creators of “Tilly” have in effect plagiarised a million style and performance touches from legions of actors who once sweated real blood to make a success of them. It’s also that the aesthetics of real-world performance and writing are themselves getting more and more programmatic, blandifying downwards to meet the robot’s existence halfway and create a seamless uncanny-valley context in which it can thrive. It is not merely a question of the aesthetics of female beauty (created by an overwhelmingly male army of coders and tech bros), but an aesthetics of everything on the screen.‘It’s too late to be scared’: readers on the controversial rise of AI ‘actors’Read moreOf course, it could be that Xicoia does not seriously expect “Tilly” to have an acting career with agents etc, and the whole thing is a cunning AI-generated media row to publicise its brand. But who can doubt that AI actors are a thing? Notoriously,the movie Alien: Romulusrecreated an AI avatar of the late Ian Holm to reprise his role in the 1979 sci-fi classic. It didn’t look real. But that was all of a year ago.So far, the media coverage has taken an indulgently bemused tongue-in-cheek approach to “Tilly” and the threat “she” represents. But a number of very real tech people created “Tilly” and a number of very real corporate lawyers are there to enforce ownership and licensing of the brand.CEO Eline Van Der Velden has defended the existence of “Tilly”but, assuming that she herself has no hands-on coding experience of its creation, I wonder if we might also hear from the team of Victor Frankensteins under her command, the guys doing the grave-robbing or writing the programs doing the grave-robbing.What is needed is not luddism, but a real pushback from the film industry, refusing to work with these hyper-plagiarism models – and at the same time a movement like the Dogme 95 collective led by Danish film-makers Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, swearing to get back to basics, cutting out the flummery and using real actors who look real in real situations, or as real as it gets in any movie. And, as I have said many times, we need another movement like the Campaign for Real Ale in the 70s, which was repeatedly told that gassy tasteless lager was the way of the future – but refused to accept it.Explore more on these topicsFilmArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingTilly Norwood (AI character)commentShareReuse this content"

Really? That is not how life looks to many on the ground in the UK car industry. Some smaller suppliers to Jaguar Land Rover are shouting that cashflow pressures on them aregetting worse. Nothing has changed since last week, they say.One cannot be surprised, because the government’s intervention took the most roundabout route. The state, via the UK export finance scheme, merely agreed toguarantee up to 80%of a five-year, £1.5bn loan that JLR had secured from a commercial bank. The guarantee presumably enabled JLR to borrow at a slightly cheaper rate but that is all. It cannot be considered a gamechanger, for two reasons.First, JLR’s access to cash was never seriously in doubt. The company should be quite capable of raising debt under its own steam if it needs more than the £5bn liquidity it was trumpeting just weeks beforeAugust’s cyber-attack. As pointed outhere last week, JLR is a rich business that made pre-tax profits of £2.5bn last year and has an even richer parent in the form of India’s Tata Motors.Second, the cashflow pressures were always most intense among JLR’s suppliers. What matters is the speed at which JLR can advance payments to its direct suppliers, who in theory should then be more equipped to pay their own suppliers, and so on. Cash has to cascade down the chain to be effective. Did the government, when it agreed the guarantee on the third-party loan, set conditions for JLR to hurry up? We haven’t been told.To be fair to JLR, it seems to be working as quickly as it can to support its first-tier suppliers. A scheme to make advance payments for components may help further. Nor should JLR lack motivation. It needs its return to production, tentativelydue to start this week, to run as smoothly as possibly. But the underlying problem remains lower in the chain: it takes time for payments to trickle down.So you can’t blame the Confederation of British Metalforming, a lobby group representing many JLR suppliers, for requesting their own support package. If the government is in the intervention game, shouldn’t it be intervening where need is most urgent?Loans from the British Business Bank are one idea. Or HMRC could be told to extend payment periods on payroll taxes for affected companies. Or the government could exert some soft pressure on the banks to go easy with affected suppliers. And since those actions would clearly indirectly benefit JLR itself, one could argue that the government could demand something in return – more UK content in the company’s batteries, for example.The point is that the government needs to make up its mind. If it thinks it is up to JLR to support its own supply chain in full, then leave the company to get on with it and let it live with the consequences. If, on the other hand, the government believes intervention is necessary to prevent long-term damage to hundreds of smaller companies that serve the wider auto industry (and, in some instances, the aerospace industry), then come up with something that helps them directly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 20-point plan toend the ongoing war in Gaza, presented on Monday by the US president, is everything the Israelis had dreamed of – even fantasised about. The hostages will finally return, some to their families, others to their graves. Hamas will be gone, at least as a ruling organisation, and the soldiers will come home. The “peace plan” will, supposedly, mean a return to normality.A brief read-through of the one-page plan might suggest that Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his people were involved in phrasing it. At times, it reads more like a list of Israeli demands than diplomatic compromises. Perhaps that’s why Netanyahu gave it his blessing rather quickly, which seemed to all but seal the deal. Even then, worth mentioning, his speech offered aslightly different versionof the plan from the one in the written document – saying he didn’t agree to a Palestinian state or a full military withdrawal.Once you unwrap the package, remove the ribbons and the superlatives (“potentially one of the great days ever in civilisation”, as Trump put it), more than a few holes open up. The most obvious is the other side in the deal – Hamas, which has yet to approve it. This small detail seems to have been deemed almost irrelevant. Given Netanyahu’s record, one might wonder whether a Hamas refusal would actually be a convenient outcome for him. It would allow him to appear as someone who had genuinely attempted to end the war – while still retaining the full backing of the US to continue it. And since ending the bloodshed might also mean the collapse of his coalition, perhaps there are deeper political calculations at play.Another major question lies in the alternative response that Hamas might give: yes, but. In other words – support for a deal to end the war in principle, but with certain details requiring further negotiation. This would raise the question of how flexibleIsraelcan be, given that Netanyahu’s government currently depends on far-right parties and that many of their members may view even the slightest compromise as grounds to dissolve the coalition (even the current plan has rattled them). At that point, it would become a test of how much pressure the US can realistically exert on Netanyahu – twisting his arm, if necessary. And if that fails, then what?Takesection 17 of the plan, for instance. It states that even if Hamas rejects or delays the agreement, Israel will hand over “terror-free” areas to an international force. How exactly is that supposed to happen? How will such a force actually operate in a war zone? There are no answers to those questions.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Tel Aviv demand an immediate end to the Gaza war, 30 September 2025.Photograph: Eyal Warshavsky/SOPA Images/ShutterstockEven if we assume the original proposal goes through with assistance from Arab and Muslim countries, it won’t be the end of the doubts – only the beginning. Many of the uncertainties concern the so-called day after. The plan promises full humanitarian aid toGaza, including the rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), hospitals, bakeries, and the entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and reopen roads. However, the allocation of funds is missing. The document provides no detail on how much this will cost or, crucially, on who will provide this funding.The same applies to the proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF). Which countries will send troops? How many? Who will have overarching authority over these forces? How will they coordinate with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)? Who will be in charge of ensuring Gaza doesn’t become a playground for various countries, each with their own interests and agendas? And, last but not least: who will give assurances to the people of Gaza that all of this is not just a new form of foreign occupation? These may seem like minor details, but they are essential – if not critical – to make the plan more than theoretical.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This shouldn’t come as a surprise.Many Israelis have been indifferentto the catastrophe in Gaza since the war began – including the mass death and starvation of unarmed Palestinians. It makes sense that they would not concern themselves with how Gaza moves forward.More often than not, it seems that, for Israelis, what happens in Gaza stays in Gaza – with no consequences for the other side whatsoever.In a way, the proposed end to the war fits comfortably within that same mindset. There’s a widespread sense that if the plan goes ahead, Israel can simply return to the days before it all happened. Everything that took place in Gaza will be forgotten, except, of course, the 7 October 2023 massacre won’t be. There will no longer be a reason to protest against Israel globally, and certainly not to impose sanctions on Israeli officials, or call for exclusion from international sporting events or theEurovision song contest.The fact that, for the foreseeable future, the Gaza Strip will remain a devastated area with barely any infrastructure may seem insignificant within Israel. Nor does it appear to matter that it will take the people of Gaza a long time to rebuild their homes and return to work – or to bury their loved ones and grieve. Not to mention that further horrors are likely to be uncovered if Gaza becomes safer and opens up to the foreign press. These issues are scarcely discussed. Like a history book returned to the library, it’s simply closed and filed away.Roy Schwartz is a senior editor and op-ed contributor at HaaretzDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In fact, I’m a self-proclaimedcrazy dog lady; there is not much I wouldn’t do for my scruffy little chihuahua-terrier mix called Rascal. That said, I’ve had it with a certain breed of dog person. You probably know the type. They assume you will automatically love it when their slobbery companion jumps on you. They say, “He’s friendly!” when their enormous hound lunges at your tiny animal. And, most egregiously, they don’t pick up after their pooch. Or, if they do, they inexplicably discard the bag on to the pavement ora tree, expecting some sort of poop fairy to magically clean up after them.The shituation seems to have got worse in recent years. Perhaps because the pandemic simultaneously caused a boom inpet ownershipand seems to have made large swathes of people forget their manners. A survey fromearlier this yearfound that nearly half of American adults (47%) say the way that people behave in public these days is ruder than before the Covid-19 pandemic.Whether the poll reflects reality or not, one town has had enough of entitled dog people. Startingnext year, the northern Italian city of Bolzano will charge tourists with dogs in tow a small daily tax of €1.50 (£1.30). Local owners are also being asked to cough up an annual tax of €100 (£87) a dog to help cover the cost of street-cleaning. Bolzano, by the way, has form when it comes to keeping pet owners on a tight leash. Last year it made DNA tests for dogs compulsory so that any abandoned excrement could be tested, and its owner thentracked downand fined.DNA testing and dog taxes are not fail-safe solutions; they present obvious logistical issues. But something has got to be done, hasn’t it? Particularly as various other initiatives haven’t done the trick. Paris tried motorised pooper scoopers(motocrottes)from 1982-2002, but they weretoo expensive. Variousappshave been tried, without clear success. Last year a street artist in LA startedputting little flagsin abandoned dog poop with messages such as “Who raised you?” on them. But shaming people doesn’t work when they’re incapable of shame. So why not try a tax? It’s either that or we bring back capital poo-nishment.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDogsOpinionAnimalsPetsItalyEuropeWastecommentShareReuse this content"

Does anyone care about celebrities in that way?Zoe WilliamsHaving famous contestants is a betrayal of all that’s great about the show – and a misunderstanding of what makes humans tickWed 1 Oct 2025 11.44 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 15.07 EDTShareIf you have never seenThe Traitors, you will be sick to death of people telling you to watch The Traitors: everybody loves it, no one can ever explain why. They describe the premise and it’s a load of people lying to one another. Contestants perform challenges – such as the challenge of running faster than most of them would like – and then they lie. They are often presented with the dilemma of whether to lie or not, but there is very little suspense, because they always choose lying. That is, of course, if they have anything to lie about; the ones who don’t just operate in a perpetual fog of misdirected trust and reptile-brained paranoia. It sounds like the kind of thing you wouldn’t have to watch twice, but that is so far from true you could easily find yourself scouring the world for the connoisseur’s The Traitors (The Traitors Australia, season two).Theoretically then,CelebrityTraitors, which starts next Wednesday, should be everything you want from TV, supersized. It arrives in a flurry of promises – the most brutal yet – with a cast list you couldn’t possibly dislike. Clare Balding, Stephen Fry, Charlotte Church, Celia Imrie, Niko Omilana, Paloma Faith: who wouldn’t want to see them confronting the darkness, or maybe lack of it, at their moral core?Sadly, no: the introduction of famous people to The Traitors is a misunderstanding of what makes the format work, what makes reality TV work as a whole – and what makes humans tick. It’s not that these are the wrong celebrities. It’s awell-curated list: David Olusoga is very trenchant, Joe Marler, a former rugby player, is sweary – and there’s no hate figure in there. They’re not making a pantomime, in the I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! style. They have respected the dignity of The Traitors – and yet still missed the point.‘You killed her!’: My 100% faithful attempt at Traitors Live ExperienceRead moreReality TV works, when it does, on people showing their unvarnished selves – their desires, flaws, highs and lows – disclosed without self-consciousness or egotistical display. It is almost impossible to make an authentic account of yourself unless you’re concentrating on something completely different, which is why the most successful concepts come in the form of a competition – preferably one so engrossing and technical that participants lose all sense of how they are perceived. That’s thegenius of Bake Off, to imagine a scenario in which the stakes could be simultaneously everything and nothing, in the lap of the gods and the sweating hands of each contestant. Even with the car crashes you can see a mile off, you’re obscurely rooting for them, hoping for a last-ditch salvation that couldn’t possibly arrive, not with that butter-to-sugar ratio. Intense concentration as a means of dissolving artifice, breaking down barriers to reveal the beating heart – well, how’s that going to work, with a celebrity? Are they really concentrating? Are they acting concentrating? Are they acting a person acting a lie, in order to then act a person acting ashamed to have been caught out in a lie?Which brings us to the money – regular Traitors are gunning for 100 grand, and an awesome amount of both their own self-reflection and our investment, as viewers, centres on what they want to do with the money, what bad thing has happened to them in the past that makes them want the money more, what they’re prepared to sacrifice to get the money. All money shows are basicallySquid Game-lite, a glowing yet sinister fairytale interlude in life’s harsh economic reality. I would never be so naive as to imagine all famous people are rich. Indeed, part of the drama of Celebrity Traitors is the vague awareness that some of them are probably on their uppers and too proud to admit it. But these guys – yes, even the comedians – are pledging to give the prize pot to charity, a laudable gesture that absolutely destroys the drama.You would only make these sacrifices – of authenticity, of magnetism, of drama – if you’d bought into the foundational myth that celebrities are inherently more interesting than regular people. It’s a weird mistake for this, of all shows, to make, since the most groundbreaking thing it’s done, culturally – yes, more novel even thanClaudia’s fringe– is to demonstrate that you can care about anyone, even the last four random Australians, with all your heart, as soon as their defences are down.I’ll probably still watch it though.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most generals took the new oath to keep their positions.” Hegseth’s account replied to Hodges post: “Cool story, General.”Yet when the meeting finally happened on Tuesday morning, the army generals and navy admirals were treated to a 45-minute speech by Hegseth, followed by a rambling, hour-long address by Trump, which confirmed at least some of what Hodges seemed to fear. The defense secretary emphasized the army’s appearance, decrying “fat troops” and “fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon”, and signaled his intent to reshape the military’s culture so as to purge “wokeness” and evoke a more masculine image. “No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses,” hesaid. “No more division, distraction and gender delusions. No more debris. As I’ve said before, and will say again: We are done. With that. Shit.” The military, Hegseth suggested, would become an advertisement for the Trump regime’s preferred cultural style, and this transformation will evidently involve many changes to what the armed forces look like when they are photographed.To this end, Hegseth announced that he would also be eliminating or drastically curtailing the equal opportunity, whistleblower, inspector general and complaint procedures that allow military personnel to report harassment and misconduct. The changes seemed designed to particularly roll back efforts undertaken over the course of the 2010s to reduce sexual assault in the military and end its impunity.“No more frivolous complaints, no more repeat complaints, no more anonymous complaints, no more smearing reputations,” said Hegseth, whosettled a lawsuitbrought by a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2020. (The settlement terms are confidential. Hegseth has said the allegations were false). “No more walking on eggshells.” One former official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,told CNN: “I think what this is, is people are sick and tired of not being able to make inappropriate or sexually explicit jokes at the staff meetings.” Hegseth, it seems, is committed to restoring this treasured freedom.Hegseth similarly declared that he would be changing procedures that have allowed the military to be more diverse – such as eliminating special permissions for soldiers to grow beards, frequently used by Black soldiers, and raising physical fitness standards for specialized, often high-pay and high-status combat roles to what Hegseth seemed to believe is a threshold only men will meet. Hegseth, who hasopposedwomen serving in combat roles, said that candidates for such jobs will be held to the “highest male standard”, which he also said was “gender neutral”. “If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it,” Hegsethsaid. “That is not the intent,” he added, questionably. “But it could be the result.”As for the officers themselves, a group which included several Black men and women of various races, Hegseth seemed to offer what he evidently thought was a flattering assessment of their masculine violence and virility. “You kill people and break things for a living,” Hegseth said to the assembled generals. “You are not politically correct and do not necessarily belong always in polite society.” The speech was repetitive and heavy on moments of self-conscious macho posturing. “To our enemies,” Hegseth said at one point “FAFO” – or, fuck around and find out. The defense secretary paused, seeming to wait for applause, but nobody clapped.Trump, meanwhile, also signaled that he seeks to transform the military into a partisan tool of his regime, repeatedly telling the assembled leaders that they would be tasked with missions targeting Americans. “America is under invasion from within,” the president said. “We’re under invasion from within. No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don’t wear uniforms. At least when they’re wearing a uniform you can take them out. It’s war from within.” Trump, who just days ago deployed 200 national guard troops toPortland, Oregon, with orders to use “full force, if necessary” offered that he had instructed Hegseth to use American cities as “training grounds”.At other times, Trump meandered, as he often does, intooff-scriptcomments that were difficult to parse. “But they’re not going to stand in our way, ever again,” Trump said. “You’re not going to see four years like we had with Biden and that group of incompetent people that ran that should have never been there. Because we have the United States military, the best, the boldest, the bravest, that the world has ever seen, that the world has ever known.”Trump, like Hegseth, sometimes paused, seeming to expect the generals to clap or laugh. But the laughs were not forthcoming; the military audience was largely silent.There is something pathetic about Hegseth and Trump, who have schemed and failed their way into positions of power and prestige that are comically outsized to their character. It is telling that Hegseth is so preoccupied with making the military into a photogenic spectacle of masculine strength – an anxious fixation on surface and spectacle that only highlights the US’s declining influence abroad.It is telling, too, that Trump can barely string sentences together, appearing distracted, sleepy, and barely coherent as he tells the armed forces to train their guns on his own people. There is no pretext that can sustain the delusion that these are serious people, or that their instructions to the military come from any motive other than their own desire for narcissistic gratification.They do not want to be strong to pursue the nation’s interests; they do not want to be strong to pursue any principles; they certainly do not want to be strong so that they can ensure the safety of the innocent. They want to be strong so that they can look big and important on TV. And for that, they flew the generals in from around the world, at tremendous taxpayer expense, to force them to sit as a captive audience for a pair of speeches that sounded like poor imitations of an action movie monologue.But as Hodges suggested, the ostentatious idiocy of these men does not mean that the generals and admirals assembled will not follow their orders. These military leaders have received the signal that their troops are to become whiter and more male; they have received the instruction that their next missions will involve suppressing domestic dissent. They have a choice between following their orders and keeping their jobs, or following an abstract set of principles, and leaving them. Most of them will choose the former.TheUS military, for all its wreckage and violence it imposes abroad and for all the cruelty and exploitation of the poor that it inflicts at home, has one consistent virtue: it has always been under quite firm civilian control. Most of the time, that’s a good thing.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS politicsPete HegsethDonald TrumpUS militarycommentShareReuse this content"

Amid deepening social divisions, it takes on a vital taskWed 1 Oct 2025 13.22 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 15.06 EDTShareThe gradual gentrification of Britain’s creative industries is a matter ofrecordand an all too familiar theme. The alarm has repeatedly been sounded in recent years by senior figures in the arts. In 2022, Mark Rylance memorablyquestioneda distribution of cultural resources in which England’s most famous public school enjoys the luxury of two theatres, while arts education is relentlessly downgraded in the state sector.To paraphrase Macbeth, the sound and the fury has yet to signify very much in the way of meaningful change. One recentstudyfound that between 2020 and 2023, working-class representation across the creative industries actually declined from 26% to a paltry 19%. In a country where issues of class and status have become politically volatile – as Sir Keir Starmer rightly diagnosed during his keynote Labour conferencespeechon Tuesday – this is deeply undesirable from every point of view. Culturally, it means the marginalisation of perspectives that can enrich the national conversation. Economically speaking, a wealth-generating sector is missing out on a talent pool it should be trawling. Politically, the trend reinforces perceptions of the UK as an unhealthily stratified society, where the rhetoric of equal opportunity rings hollow.News that Manchester is topioneerthe first regionally based review of working-class participation in the arts is therefore welcome and timely. The “class ceiling” inquiry, which will be headed by the former chief prosecutor for the north-west, Nazir Afzal, has pledged to produce a blueprint for change early next year. Given Whitehall’s lack of success in shifting the dial, the idea of a more locally based approach is a good one. Manchester’s historically rich working-class culture, and its vanguard status when it comes to devolution, offer grounds for hoping that steps will finally be made in the right direction.If the headwinds holding young people back in the arts are truly to be resisted, though, a joined-up strategy on the ground will need to be supplemented by a national reset. For those without deep parental pockets to draw upon, the risks attached to pursuing a career in the creative industries are prohibitive. Underpaid, precarious work as an aspiring actor, musician or artist has been justlydescribedas “hope labour” – a battle for survival in which mounting debt becomes a price of staying in the game. For too many young working-class people, that strategy can never be an option.In the context of such financial anxiety, the pledge by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, this week torestoremaintenance grants for some students is a significant and potentially invaluable move. Ahead of the budget, Ms Phillipson should aim to see it applied to arts subjects as well as the sciences. More broadly, the precipitousdeclinein public investment in culture needs to be reversed if those lacking both social and economic capital are to get a fair chance.It should be a no-brainer. The Equity union hascalculatedthat for every pound invested in the arts, the return for the local economy amounts to £1.27.

Markets aren’tconvinced. On Tuesday, the peso plunged by more than 6% before a central bank intervention clawed back losses. Argentine stocks abroad fell 7%, and the risk premium on its debt rose to 12.3 percentage points – far beyond sustainable borrowing levels. The rout continued on Wednesday.Mr Bessent admitted the aid was meant to prop up Mr Milei after his La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances) party lostdecisivelyin a key election last month. But no terms have been confirmed. With USRepublicansangry over Mr Milei’s tax breaks for soy farmers that undercut US producers, markets are asking the obvious: is the Bessent bazooka real, or just for show? It’s obviously a bad look for Mr Trump when the US government isshut downover health funding while $20bn is pledged to prop up a foreign ally. “America first” wasn’t meant to mean furloughed workers andstalledmedical trials at home while cash flows abroad.Argentina is a crisis foretold. This column warned inAprilthat the International Monetary Fund, under pressure from Mr Trump, looked like it was lending billions not to stabilise Argentina, but to entrench a capital‑friendly, resource‑exporting model aligned with US interests. The Guardian argued that Mr Milei could achieve genuine stability by taxing dollar export windfalls, building a sovereign wealth fund and following the east Asian path of currency depreciation and state‑led industrial growth. This was anathema to Mr Milei’slibertarianinstincts.Instead, he chose shock therapy, with predictable results. As the economistLucía Cirmi Obónputs it, real wages have plunged, industry has been gutted by import liberalisation and essential state support – from pensions to disability aid – has been slashed. Amid a welter ofcorruptionclaims against Mr Milei’s powerful sister,Karina Milei, the peso sell-off accelerated. Yet political calculation dominates economic rationality: Mr Trump’s bailout is tied to legislative midterm elections in Argentina on 26 October, not to long‑term economic stabilisation.Argentina is rich in resources, but has stilldefaultednine times – usually after borrowing in dollars and losing control of its economic levers to foreign creditors. Yet even with US bailout talk, the peso is shaky. Why? Because the currency is too strong, propped up by commodity exports while the rest of the economy limps along. By leaning on American swap lines and debt deals, Argentina risks giving up even more control.The proposed US bailout isn’t just about saving Argentina – it’s also aboutweakeningBeijing’s influence. China has an $18bn swap line with Argentina. Any American support may demand reducing or ending China’s credit. It’s no surprise that speculators are testing the peso and forcing Argentina to burn through its dwindling dollar reserves before polling day.Argentina hasrepeatedlyfound itself at the mercy of outside interests. If Mr Milei stumbles in the midterms, US support could disappear. If Argentinians see US cash as a handout to Mr Milei’s base of financiers and farmers, rather than a fix for their nation’s woes, the backlash could bite. Mr Milei’supcomingWhite House visit isn’t about a working plan – it’s about making the US bailout a Trumpian campaign stop. And Argentina,once again, becomes the backdrop for someone else’s political theatre.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But if Rachel Reeves only partially lifts the two-child cap benefit cap, then what does that tell us about this government?It tells that, although it acknowledges that the cap is cruel and discriminatory, it is still willing to discriminate against children based on the circumstances of their birth. It tells us that it has accepted George Osborne’s decision that the link in our welfare state between need and provision is no longer worth preserving – a decision that has abject consequences for the most vulnerable in society. And it tells us that whenKeir Starmertalks about delivering a “Britain where no child is hungry, where no child is held back by poverty”, those words are hollow.There can be no half measures when tackling child poverty. If the government has finally agreed that the two-child benefit cap is fundamentally wrong, it must release all children from it immediately, without exception.Jane MiddletonBathYour editorial (30 September) says “Rachel Reeves is considering a range of options including a taper, so that subsequent children would qualify for benefit payments at a lower rate.” It is typical of this cheeseparing, triangulating government and Reeves’s “Treasury brain” that they think the third or subsequent child can be raised more cheaply than the first two children and that they know better how many children parents should have before they are punished for having them in order to save the government money.Derrick CameronStoke-on-TrentAfter a period of accommodating to what passes for the policies for Nigel Farage and Reform UK, it’s good to see Keir Starmer come out and clearly oppose them (‘Decency or division’: Britain faces era-defining choice, Keir Starmer warns, 30 September). However, words on a conference platform are only a start. If the drift to the right in British politics is to be halted, Labour will need to end its obsessive factional war with the left and work with forces at the grassroots – in workplaces, pubs and cafes, communities – who are challenging Reform day in and day out.Keith FlettTottenham, LondonLabour’s conference uncharacteristically bristled with flags – “members of the cabinet were up and down like yo-yos with their union jacks,” as John Crace put it (Sketch, 30 September), but it was the absence of another emblem that was most remarkable: not a red rose in sight. What a shame. What irony. The England women’s rugby team have just invested this erstwhile Labour symbol with the kind of unambiguous inclusivity, diversity, sense of purpose and pure joy that both the party and the nation’s flags are struggling to convey.Paul McGilchristCromer, NorfolkGiven the new optics at Labour’s conference, here’s a modest proposal for a new anthem (with apologies to the Red Flag): “The people’s flag’s red, white and blue, / We’re patriotic through and through. / We’ll fight Reform with all our might, / But keep new migrants out of sight. / Then build a Britain fit for all, / While keeping debt repayments small. / Though leftists flinch and Tories sneer, / We’ll go on waving flags for Keir.”Dr Anthony IsaacsLondon“I’d do it now, before it’s too late,” writes Polly Toynbee (29 September) about the introduction of voting by proportional representation. Polly should take care what she wishes for. Electoral Calculus suggests at a general election now Reform UK would win 30.4% of the vote, the Tories 17.2% – a total of 47.6% – while Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens together would get 44.9%. The system might be changed, but a Nigel Farage/Robert Jenrick coalition of the right looks proportionally more feasible than one led by someone from the fractured left (but not Keir Starmer).Charles FosterChalfont St Peter, BuckinghamshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus, a letter byRobbie OwenWed 1 Oct 2025 12.36 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 12.38 EDTShareThe withdrawal of the UK from the Aarhus convention (Starmer asks Conservative peer to write planning bill to block judicial reviews, 27 September) would deter ordinary people and local groups from using the law to challenge poor environmental decisions made by councils and other public bodies. Thelegal challenge I brought against Elmbridge council in 2010, with my co-claimant Gerald McAully, was the first to receive cost protection following the incorporation of the Aarhus convention into English law.We were challenging Elmbridge council’s decision to give planning permission for flats to be built on the Thames flood plain oppositeHampton Court Palace, a truly appalling prospect. We would not have been to do this without the protection the Aarhus convention offered us, which limited our exposure to £5,000. Similarly, other individuals and groups wishing to protect treasured open spaces – allotments, playing fields etc – should be able to do so without the thought of incurring ruinous legal costs if they lose.Keith GarnerLondonYou report that the prime minister has tasked Charles Banner KC to write a new planning bill to remove the ability for environmental groups to delay projects with judicial reviews, and that leavingthe Aarhus conventionis being discussed as an option to remove the cap on costs for groups bringing a judicial review. Lord Banner has previously written that removing these cost caps could not be done without leaving Aarhus.There is an easier solution than leaving an international convention, which would rightly give rise to a long debate in itself. Ministers could easily amend the current planning and infrastructure bill to provide for a consent for a nationally significant infrastructure project that is categorised as a critical national priority, to be confirmed by a one-clause bill through an abridged parliamentary process taking between four to eight months, considerably quicker than judicial review.This would take us back to a well-precedented procedure that was once commonplace, where “provisional orders” made by ministers for infrastructure and other matters were then routinely confirmed by parliament. Arguments against the project concerned not already considered during the planning process could be raised and heard by a joint parliamentary committee. The result, a short act of parliament, would not then be judicially reviewable.An amendmentto put this process in placewas debatedin the House of Lords in July. It has since been revised to respond to some of the points then made. If the government support it when the bill comes back on report next month, the procedure could start to be used again from early 2026.Robbie OwenParliamentary agent and partner, Pinsent MasonsExplore more on these topicsPlanning policyHampton Court PalaceActivismInfrastructureHouse of LordslettersShareReuse this content"

And Rachel Reeves can be applauded for her pledge.However, she makes no mention of who will coordinate, run and refresh the items in this space. Will it be a newly labelled “teacher-librarian”, already frazzled as a classroom teacher with little spare time? Or will each school employ a qualified librarian? Who will fund this? School library spaces can look sad and uninviting without regular care and attention.I was once a librarian, supporting children and young people in UK school and public libraries. I worked with four authorities over 17 years. I also worked abroad.I remember, long ago, when there was funding for school libraries, especially at secondary level. Now it is precarious.

Many also knew of the problematic position of Jews in mandatePalestine, including the history of the 1929 Hebron massacre.This long history, of which the Holocaust was simply the latest and most revolting manifestation, was what drove the setting up of the state ofIsraelin 1948 and the determination of Israel to defend itself against successive attacks by Arab forces.Mazower’s comment that some saw Israel’s success in the six‑day war of 1967 as, potentially, a Pyrrhic victory may be true, in that it poisoned relations with its neighbours. But it would not have been so if the Arab states had not issued the notorious Khartoum resolution of September 1967, which declared there would be no peace with Israel, no negotiation with Israel and no recognition of Israel.When the rest of the world understood that it was impossible to eliminate Israel by military means, this declaration was a disaster for the Palestinian people as well as for Israel, and continues to be so today.Roger FiskenAshampstead, BerkshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Chaos ensued with a melee as City lost their cool and the chance of a perfectChampions Leaguestart, before Dier calmly slotted home a last-minute penalty.City have only themselves to blame for not finishing off a stubbornMonacooff earlier. Erling ­Haaland proved there was such a thing as a sure bet as he increased his club tally to 11 goals in eight games, only to have his work undone by two incidents of poor defending.Pep Guardiola makes ‘Spanish referees’ remark after Manchester City held to drawRead moreFirst, Jordan Teze was allowed too much space on the edge of the box, as he curled the first equaliser into the top corner and the foul for the penalty was at best naive. For González to raise his leg so high when defending a set piece was ill-judged, even if he made contact with the ball, with opponents buzzing around. Dier’s nose took the force of the Spaniard’s shinpad but it was worth the pain as Monaco got a point.View image in fullscreenManchester City’s Rúben Dias and Monaco’s Krepin Diatta clash as debate over the penalty raged.Photograph: Alexandre Dimou/ReutersThe anger City showed when it was clear the incident was being reviewed would have been better used when the ball was in play. Gianluigi ­Donnarumma took the ball while the referee, Jesús Gil Manzano, jogged towards the pitchside monitor. The City goalkeeper was joined by Monaco players and Rúben Dias got in the middle of the matter before the backroom staff and teammates got involved. A Monaco coach was sent off, delaying the referee finally pointing to the spot. Dier was one of few to not relinquish their calm and did the rest.City should have finished the contest far earlier, enjoying 18 shots, but got only six on target. They enjoyed almost three-quarters of the possession but were unable to find a third goal, hindered by Monaco’s low block and a slow tempo. Equally, they had shown defensive vulnerability throughout the match, allowing Monaco more opportunities than their limited attacking intent merited.The Stade Louis II provides a tepid atmosphere and there was little in the opening skirmishes to suggest the crowd would be awoken by anything happening on the pitch. City were quiet in the opening quarter of an hour, doing their best to build attacks without finding a spark. City, however, are packed with quality players who have the ability to change things in a split second. On this occasion it was Josko Gvardiol’s turn to provide the dynamism, clipping a ball over the Monaco centre-backs for Haaland to reach, stretching his legs to flick over the onrushing Philipp Köhn with his first touch of the match.If this was supposed to be the beginning of the procession, Monaco were not willing victims, despite missing several key players. Folarin Balogun immediately missed a fine chance to equalise when he could not make contact with a header. He was relieved moments later thanks to lazy midfield play for City, who allowed Teze, a defender pushed into central midfield, too much time on the edge of the box. He picked his spot in the top corner and executed the shot perfectly to level three minutes after the opener.When Vanderson left the pitch in tears after becoming the latest Monaco player to succumb to injury, City took advantage of the rejig. ­Tijjani Reijnders went close with a low drive from the edge of the box, Bernardo Silva’s looping header to the back post was unfortunate to not find a teammate to finish off the move and Phil Foden sent a further warning by crashing a shot off the bar.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland heads in Manchester City’s second goal.Photograph: Kieran McManus/ShutterstockMoments after missing a fine chance to retake the lead, Haaland made amends by leaping to head a Nico O’Reilly cross precisely into the corner.

With Monaco operating in the lowest of blocks, it was imperative that the Norwegian was clinical when the chances arose, aided with his physical attributes. Without his strength, he would have not reached the pass for the opener nor jumped a height Mondo Duplantis would be proud of for the second.Champions League roundup: Napoli’s Højlund doubles up to sink SportingRead moreFor all the control, City remained vulnerable at the back. Balogun again missed a superb chance to bring parity when he found himself unmarked at the back post; he could not provide the quality ­Haaland does, to City’s relief. Soon after that, Krépin Diatta should have done ­better after catching O’Reilly daydreaming and ­Maghnes Akliouche forced ­Donnarumma into a smart save to his right.It felt as if a third was required for City to be comfortable in the latter stages but it never came. There will be plenty of debate about the referee’s decision but City will be irritated by their failings when victory was there for the taking, while Dier and Monaco worked hard for their little bit of late fortune.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueMonacoManchester CityEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It is now eight wins out of eight in theChampions Leaguewith zero goals conceded. And if you add in the Europa League from earlier in his tenure, it is 14 victories out of 14 with two goals against.Olympiakos pitched up with a remarkable statistic of their own. They had won on their past three visits to this ground, the most recent two coming in the knockout rounds of the Europa League, even if the second in 2020-21 did not prevent an aggregate defeat. The first was in a Champions League group‑stage match in 2015-16.Arsenal 2-0 Olympiakos: Champions League – live reactionRead moreNobody expected anything other than anotherArsenalsuccess, the latest demonstration of the power and depth that Arteta has at his disposal despite this being a decent Olympiakos vintage. It was nervier than the home crowd would have liked in the closing stages, the visitors pushing and making for a couple of scares.This Arsenal team is not easily breached. We are into October and still they have let in only three goals in all competitions – one of them from open play. Gabriel Martinelli scored in the 12th minute and although Olympiakos had their moments they could not find a way past David Raya.Arsenal were wasteful in the final third. Martinelli was guilty and so were Arteta’s other starters in the front line – Viktor Gyökeres and Leandro Trossard. But when Bukayo Saka, on as a substitute, took a pass from the excellent Martin Ødegaard to jam a shot through the legs of the Olympiakos goalkeeper, Kostas Tzolakis, in stoppage time, it was over. Arsenal have built on the2-0 win at Athletic Bilbaoin their Champions League opener. Nights such as this only add extra layers to their reputation.Arsenal had to go back to November 2019 for the previous time they had failed to win a group match at this stadium in Europe; it was the defeat against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, which led to the sacking of Unai Emery, the caretaker hire of Freddie Ljungberg and the arrival of Arteta, whose first European assignment was against Olympiakos in the last 32 of the competition that season. It ended in alast-gasp extra‑time defeathere and an away‑goals exit.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka puts Arsenal out of sight late on with their second goal against Olympiakos.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersOf the numerous eye-catching lines around this encounter, many were linked to the past. When had Arsenal previously conceded a goal in a European group game on their own turf? It was against Rapid Vienna in the 4-1 Europa League win in December 2020.Ødegaard was in the mood from the first whistle, bringing the urgency on the ball; the incision. The captain sparked an early move that ended with Martinelli somehow glancing a Myles Lewis-Skelly cross off target; Martinelli was all alone in front of goal. It seemed to come off his shoulder.No matter. It was not long before Arsenal led and it was Martinelli with the tap-in from a tight angle after Gyökeres saw Tzolakis deflect his shot against a post. Ødegaard had played the pass to Gyökeres and it was all about the striker’s strength; he bulldozed in between two defenders to make it happen.It was Martinelli on his less favoured right flank; Trossard on the left. And Martinelli simply had to play in his teammate on 21 minutes when Arsenal broke with two against one. Instead, he tried to out-run the last man and could not get around him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gyökeres swiped another chance high after a lovely Trossard ball.Late Dier penalty for Monaco pegs back Manchester City after Haaland doubleRead moreOlympiakos came to play. Ayoub El Kaabi looped a header too close to Raya just before Martinelli’s goal and their big chance of the first half came in the 32nd minute when Daniel Podence caught a volley so sweetly from Santiago Hezze’s cross. Raya tipped over – an outstanding reflex save.The mood was different in the second half. It was not the handbrake from Arteta but his idea seemed to be containment. Arsenal changed down through the gears. Trossard blew a couple of chances and there was anxiety in the home seats; cries for their players to wake up as they survived an Olympiakos thrust on 66 minutes.Podence’s cross was made to measure for El Kaabi, whose header was well saved by Raya. The striker poked home on the rebound but the offside flag had gone up against him. Arteta, who would withdraw Gabriel Magalhães as a precaution against injury, saw Tzolakis deny Ødegaard; he should not have been able to make the save. Olympiakos retained hope.

He said San Francisco and Seattle were “run by radical left lunatics who don’t know what they’re doing”.Israel in line for World Cup qualifying reprieve even if Uefa imposes banRead more“It’s Fifa’s tournament, Fifa’s jurisdiction,Fifamakes those decisions,” the Canadian said to an audience at The Summit, part of Leaders Week London. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans.”Montagliani, whose country is co-hosting the tournament with the US and Mexico, has frequently had to engage on diplomatic matters since the second Trump administration began. On the subject of Israel’s continued involvement in international football, which has been the subject of much debate in the past week, Montagliani said it was Uefa’s responsibility to take a decision.“I respect that it’s a decision by Uefa. It’s their member, they have to deal with it and I respect not only the appropriate process, but whatever decision they make. Fifa get asked to deal with a lot of things by a lot of organisations, but first and foremost it’s a member of Uefa. No different than when I have to deal with a member of my region for whatever reason.”View image in fullscreenVictor Montagliani said he was opposed to a 64-team World Cup finals.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAOn the contentious topic of Fifa competitions and their expanding reach, Montagliani said he was in favour of a bigger Club World Cup but against a 64-team World Cup for the centennial anniversary in 2030.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And the reason I feel that way is because the quality of football is great. The storylines are great. There’s a lot to root for. It’s a giant underdog mentality, which, at least in the US, is massively appealing, and I suspect it would be elsewhere as well.”Reliable access to coverage of a competition, Wagner argued, helps to build fandom, an example he substantiated by talking about his gym habits. “I tend to torture myself in long workouts on Saturday and Sunday mornings,” he said. “When you’re pedalling away to nowhere, there’s a lot of media to consume. And I love when you begin to seeChampionshipgames broadcast. You know that when you can get it on your treadmill, that you’ve made it.”On the question of redistribution, Wagner called for a change of focus. “I think the best way to explain it is, rather than focusing on how we distribute an existing pie, we grow the pie,” he said. “We spend our time energy thinking about how we grow the overall revenue streams and interest in English football. If we’re able to do that, everybody benefits more than distributing an existing set of revenue streams in a different way. My comment has always been that we if we focus on growing the sport that we all win.”Birmingham head to north Wales this weekend to take on another Championship club with famous American owners and a documentary series. Wagner said the rivalry Birmingham have developed with Ryan Reynolds’ and Rob McElhenney’s Wrexham has benefited both clubs and is an example of the compelling stories football can create.“It’s great for both of us,” Wagner said. “And I have enormous respect for Ryan and Rob … they’re good people, and they’re doing a good thing. What they’ve done in Wrexham is amazing.“The people in Wrexham are incredible, period, full stop. It’s a wonderful place to go and visit and enjoy a football match. And that’s what I love about it.”Explore more on these topicsFootball LeagueBirmingham CityChampionshipLeague OneLeague TwoFootball politicsFinancesnewsShareReuse this content"

The most compelling West Country drama since Poldark? Friday Night Lights with pasties? Or, if you like, a little dash of Scrumpy & Western? Never let it be said we lack creative enthusiasm out here in the sticks, nor the desire to offer local theatregoers something refreshingly different.Welcome, either way, to the world’s most improbable new stage play. How else to summarise a production about the rise of an unflashy Devon rugby club, based on the book Exe Men by – there’s no easy way to say this – yours truly. Trust me, watching professional actors rehearse scenes that started life on your own keyboard is a surreal experience.Newcastle Red Bulls axe Steve Diamond after just one game as new ownersRead moreFortunately Exe Men the play – which opens next week – has been written by someone with significantly better credentials. Remember the BBC’s brilliant Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes? DetectiveGene Hunt firing up the Quattro? The show’s co-creator Ashley Pharoah has specialised in TV screenwriting but also loves his rugby and was instantly intrigued when Martin Berry, creative director atExeter’s Northcott Theatre, approached him.It was brave of them because rugby – with wonderful exceptions such as Up ’n’ Under, Stand Up And Fight, andGrav– can be a tricky theatrical theme. How do you improve, dramatically speaking, on Exeter going from lower-league anonymityto the champions of Europein little over a decade? Particularly if everyone knows the ending? Or if some people watching don’t really like sport?The aim, accordingly, has been to highlight the characters who made it happen and the intense regional pride they aroused. And how each can shape the other. Ashley, Martin and myself also share the same conviction: that the south-west deserves a higher national profile.View image in fullscreenActor Tim Hudson (left) and the man he plays, Tony Rowe, chair of Exeter Chiefs, during rehearsals for the play Exe Men.Photograph: Samuel Simpson-Pattison/Rugby Journal“When was the last time you heard a national newsreader with a West Country accent?” asks Berry rhetorically. If the peninsula does make the news it’s usually because something unpleasant has washed up on a beach or the weather has scared the tourists away.The lack of Premier League football south-west of Bristol has traditionally been another factor. Which is why it caused a stir when the Chiefs were promoted to English rugby’s top division in 2010. Devon has produced plenty of yachtsmen, swimmers and the occasional Tom Daley but, aside from a fewFA Cup victories for Plymouth Argyle, not much sustained team sporting success.Little did anyone guess that, by October 2020, the Chiefs would be claiming a domestic and European trophy double – a feat that even Pharoah, as a Bath fan, found extraordinary. “To go from sidestepping dog poo in a public park to winning the European Cup is amazing. It’s a bigger story, in some ways, thanLeicester winning the Premier Leaguewhen you think of where they came from.”The book sought to tell that epic tale through its central pillars. Men such as Rob Baxter who, along with his brother Richie, followed their farmer father John into the “other” family enterprise at the muddy old County Ground. Or the club’s chair, Tony Rowe, whose business nous helped to rescue the club financially. Or Gareth Steenson, the fly‑half previously rejected by his native Ulster. “We were all told we weren’t good enough somewhere else,” Steenson says. “The strength of the group at the start was that we were from all over the place so we got to know each other’s families.”View image in fullscreenExeter Chiefs lift the trophy after claiming the European Champions Cup in 2020.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersWhile slightly disappointed that Jamie Dornan will not be portraying him – “He would have been perfect” – “Steeno” is now looking forward to seeing how the Chiefs’ once lively post-match “rehydration” sessions are depicted. “Sitting on the bus home for three hours gave us time to socialise. I could barely tell you what happened in a lot of games but what I remember most are the social times. I remember we got our first losing bonus point away from home, at Northampton, and celebrating like we’d won with a bonus point.”All the above, plus the chocolate muffin‑loving Kiwi Thomas Waldrom, England’s Jack Nowell and Henry Slade, and Ireland’s Ian Whitten are played engagingly by six professional actors and a 31‑strong community ensemble.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBerry, though, is aware that on-stage rugby has to be done artfully. “Without giving away too many spoilers we’re doing it in various ways: lighting and sound, real and imaginary balls. There’s actually a lot you can do to take the audience with you. If we just ask them to sit and watch some footage then we’ve cocked it up.”Cometh the hour, then, for Robert Shaw Cameron, who plays the club’s big chief, Rob Baxter. The former was the dentist Laurence Reeves in Coronation Street but now has a role into which he can properly sink his teeth. “It’s the first time I’ve played a ‘real’ person and you do feel a deep responsibility. There’s a public version of Rob and Tony but there’s a private version as well. The challenge was accessing that private bit. I wanted to explore what people don’t see. When I asked Rob whether he has a confidant he talked about his wife, Jo. That’s something we’ve worked hard to reflect.”Team Europe and Red Roses use connection to past, present and future to create history | Cath BishopRead morePharoah has also sought to tease out the human emotions of other pivotal individuals. “It’s about sport but it’s not really. It’s about people and dreams.” And, when you dig slightly deeper, about male fellowship, too. “One of the elements is that men aren’t completely crap and can achieve things. I really like that about it. It’s a play about maleness which isn’t necessarily the most fashionable thing to write about at the moment, is it?”A few of those portrayed may not instantly recognise themselves but in Rowe’s case it is very much the opposite. Tim Hudson, the actor playing him, arguably looks more like Rowe than the chair does himself. “It is quite strange,” says Rowe, now 77 but still bound for South America this week to drive a rally car through Brazil and Guyana. “When the people who know me see him they’ll say: ‘There’s Tony.’”So brace yourselves. The south‑west – and rugby – is about to enjoy a rare stage closeup. As Cameron puts it: “In this golden age of telly and Netflix, this is what theatre can still do better than anything else: tell stories that resonate with people and speak to their community.” Will anyone “do an Exeter” again? Probably not. All the more reason, five years on, to reimagine how the west was won.Exe Men isbeing stagedat the Northcott Theatre, Exeterfrom 7 to 18 October.Tickets available athttps://exeternorthcott.co.uk/events/exe-men/#bookExplore more on these topicsExeterRugby unionTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hatton, who secured the half in the Sunday singles thatguaranteed victory for Europe, has told home fans not to seek retribution in Ireland in two years’ time.Tom Watson says he was ‘ashamed’ of US fans’ conduct at Ryder CupRead more“If it was my choice, and what I say isn’t really going to affect how people behave, I don’t really think that the insults are the way forward,” Hatton said. “Some guys on the team had it a lot worse than others. For me, there were a lot of insults maybe around height or hairline or weight, some of which I pretty much say to myself anyway, so it wasn’t like anything new.“But I would much prefer it to be a respectful atmosphere. You let the guys play and the best team wins – rather than trying to affect the outcome by trying to put off players or things like that. I don’t think it will be as hostile as maybe it was last week. I’d like to think that it will be very respectful.”The US captain, Keegan Bradley, whorefused to condemn the “passionate” home fansat Bethpage, claimed behaviour at the New York course was no different to that in Rome two years ago, when Europe last hosted. Hatton, who went unbeaten for a second successive Ryder Cup, disagrees.“Personally I don’t think they were close at all,” the Englishman said. “Certainly with what I heard last week, I don’t think Rome comes anywhere near that. I think they are quite far apart.”The PGA of America chief executive, Derek Sprague, told the Golf Channel he intends to contact McIlroy in person to apologise for what he and his wife went through. “I do plan on sending them an email with my heartfelt apologies for what occurred,” Sprague said. “There’s no place for that in theRyder Cupor in the game of golf.“I can’t wait to reach out to Rory and Erica and really, quite frankly, the entire European team. The whole European team should not have been subjected to that. And because of that, I feel badly and I plan on apologising to them.“When it [the Ryder Cup] started in 1927, it was about sportsmanship and integrity of the game, and that’s what we want it to be and continue to be and it’s unfortunate that people crossed the line last week.”However, Matt Fitzpatrick called out the organisation’s president, Don Rea, on Wednesday for his churlish reaction to the 15-13 home defeat at the trophy presentation. “I don’t want to speak on behalf of everyone but we did feel there was a little bit of bitterness when they presented the trophy,” Fitzpatrick said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fleetwood believes the job should be Donald’s if he wants it after back‑to‑back triumphs, but that Europe have a ready-made successor in his vice‑captain Francesco Molinari.“The ball is probably in Luke’s court and I think he’s earned that,” Fleetwood said. “I’ve spoken to Francesco about it numerous times.

The medium pacers Sophie Molineux (three for 25) and Annabel Sutherland (three for 26) shared six wickets between them.“I had some clear plans when I got into the middle,” said Gardner, who was named player of the match. “I wanted to score as many runs as possible because we needed a big total here.

The 22-year-old Litchfield, playing in her first 50-over World Cup, hit six fours and two sixes to provide a speedy start. She fell in the 11th over – at 81 for two – before New Zealand ushered in a mini-collapse. The medium pacer Lea Tahuhu picked up three for 42 in eight overs, blowing away the middle order.Tahuhu got rid of Ellyse Perry (33) and Beth Mooney (12) in the space of four overs, and later returned to dismiss Tahlia McGrath (26).

The Cambridge men’s team lead the fiercely contested head-to-head 88-81, and secured their third consecutive victory earlier this year. An estimated 250,000 fans attended the latest edition, with a peak of 2.8 million watching on TV.View image in fullscreenChannel 4’s  portfolio of sports rights include the Women’s FA Cup, Formula One highlights and England’s men’s football.Photograph: Andrew Parsons/PA“It’s the crown jewel of the rowing calendar and consistently captures the imagination of the British public year after year, both on the side of the Thames and in living rooms across the country,” said Pete Andrews, the head of sport at Channel 4. “We are committed to bringing the very best sports events to our audience, both from the UK, and around the globe, and The Boat Race is the perfect example.”Channel 4’s portfolio of sports rights includes the Women’s FA Cup, Formula One highlights and England’s home matches in the Uefa Nations League and European qualifiers.The broadcaster has also developed a reputation for striking last-minute opportunistic rights deals, including showing Emma Raducanu’s US Open victory, the victorious England Under-21 Euros campaign and the Cricket World Cup finals.While the BBC may have lost out on the rowing, the corporation has swiftly moved to capitalise on the booming popularity of top-flight women’s footballafter the Lionesses’ exhilarating triumph at the Euros.BBC Sport has struck a deal for the free-to-air broadcast rights for the Women’s Champions League through to 2030.The five-year deal will give it coverage of up to seven live matches a season including the final, which was won byArsenal last season in a gripping final against Barcelona.“This is a great moment for women’s football,” said Alex Kay-jelski, the director of BBC Sport. “Bringing the Women’s Champions League to a free-to-air audience is huge. We are making the competition more accessible, more visible, and more connected than ever before.”In May, the entertainment giant Disney entered the women’s football market,striking a five-year dealto show every match of the men’s Champions League on its Disney+ subscription streaming service.A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC has been proud to broadcast the Boat Race over many years. Our decision not to continue reflects the difficult choices we need to make to ensure we deliver the best value for audiences with the money that we have.”Explore more on these topicsThe Boat RaceChannel 4BBCRowingUniversity of CambridgeUniversity of OxfordTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Afterwinning the FA CupandCommunity Shield– the first major silverware in the club’s history – the Austrian manager who arrived in south London 18 months ago promising he was “no David Copperfield” is preparing his next trick: guiding Palace to the Conference League final next May.Having beendemoted from the Europa Leagueafter Uefa deemed Palace part of a multi-club network, Glasner’s sideedged past Fredrikstadin the qualifying round and the road to Leipzig starts for real against Dynamo Kyiv in Poland on Thursday evening. It is a fixture that has been greatly anticipated by 3,500 travelling fans, with an extra 900 tickets quickly snapped up for the match at Lublin Arena, which has hosted the Ukrainian side’s home matches in Europe since Russia’s invasion in 2022.Crystal Palace merited last-gasp win over Liverpool, admits Arne SlotRead moreGlasner has been keen to play down the significance of Palace’s astonishing 18-match unbeaten run since losing 5-0 to Newcastle in April, stressing afterthe thrilling late victory over Liverpoolon Saturday that “we’re still in September, so there’s nothing more to say”.Yet with his team boasting the longest sequence without defeat in all of Europe’s top five leagues by some distance, ahead of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, it is not an achievement to be sniffed at. The captain, Marc Guéhi, gave an insight into the belief coursing through the Palace squad at the moment.“In terms of mentality, yes for sure it’s there,” said Guéhi, who did not want to comment onhis failed £35m move to Liverpool on deadline dayother than to thank Palace fans for their continued support. “We’ve tasted success but we’re definitely not satisfied and we do want more. Every single person at the football club strives for more – from the manager all the way down to the players. We’ve seen what we can do. There’s no saying that if we keep our heads down, hopefully we can have many more opportunities. Many more chances to do even greater things.”Asked what Glasner’s impact has been, he added: “If he wasn’t there on the sidelines, I think we’d all know what to do. There’s one thing that he mentions all the time: it’s not what we do, but it’s how we do it. I think the approach of anything that we do is really, really important. Going down to the pitch, with that mindset that we were talking about, that mentality, and if we approach things that way, it always helps us and keeps us in good stead.”View image in fullscreenOliver Glasner is no stranger to European success.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe problem for Glasner is that the majority of his first XI has played almost every minute of a busy campaign so far, with Guéhi and Maxence Lacroix, Daniel Muñoz and Jean-Philippe Mateta having already racked up 10 club appearances by the end of September. Against a Dynamo Kyiv team who have plenty of pedigree in European competition over the years, and won their first league title since the war broke out last season under Oleksandr Shovkovskyi, the former goalkeeper who won 92 caps for Ukraine, Glasner is expected to take no chances and select a strong lineup.“We always play the best available team,” said Glasner. “We reward the good performance, because everybody who played, but also the players who came on in the last games, deserve to start, and that’s the best for a manager. We have many players who deserve to start, because they are in very good shape.”This competition is also uncharted territory for Glasner, who would have fancied his chances of repeatinghis 2022 success with Eintracht Frankfurtin the Europa League if Uefa hadn’t had other ideas. Yet Palace are rated as the bookmakers’ favourites to follow in the footsteps of West Ham and Chelsea by becoming the third London club to win the trophy that was introduced in 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that doesn’t mean you score four or five goals.

In March, von der Leyen chose toflesh outher€800bn (£700bn) defence spending planat the Royal Danish Military Academy in Copenhagen, where she endorsed the 2030 goal.In a paper to European capitals before Wednesday’s meeting, the commission said the EU needed to pursue two plans with “special urgency”: a “drone wall” to detect, track and shoot down such aircraft and a broader system to defend the EU’s eastern borders – on land, in the air and at sea – known as eastern flank watch.EU member states were urged to agree these broad plans by late October, as well as two other big joint projects, missile defences and a space “shield”.But leaders are divided over a €140bn reparations loan for Ukraine based on Russia’s frozen assets. The idea has gained momentum since theGerman chancellor, Friedrich Merz, swung behind itlast week, but France, Belgium and Luxembourg have doubts.“When assets are frozen, one has to respect international law,” Macron said on Wednesday, voicing his agreement with Belgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, who has said he is concerned his country could be left alone with the risk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under the plan, Ukraine would receive an interest-free EU loan that would be repaid once Moscow sent Kyiv reparations for the colossal damage inflicted during the war.Finland, Sweden and Ireland were among the countries to announce their support for the plan on Wednesday.The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, a longtime supporter of using Russia’s frozen assets to aid Ukraine, said her team wanted to move as fast as possible but acknowledged that not all member states supported the plan.She played down concerns the plan would damage investor confidence in the eurozone: “If you don’t start the war against another country, then you are out of the risk.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionDenmarkEuropeUkraineRussiaDrones (military)newsShareReuse this content"

The figure roughly mirrors official statistics indicating that about 12% of the overall population in England and Wales last year were foreign nationals.However, the centre’s analysis notes that young adults are more likely to commit crimes regardless of nationality, and non-citizens in the UK are more likely to be young adults. As a result, the researchers said they would expect foreign nationals to make up 15% of the prison population if they had the same imprisonment rates as British citizens of the same age (16-24).While non-citizens made up a higher proportion of people convicted for sexual and theft offences over the past decade, researchers cautioned that a lack of data for offenders’ age and sex complicated the picture and meant it was hard to make clear assertions.The picture was more complicated for certain crimes such as sexual offences, where foreign nationals were overrepresented among those cautioned or convicted, at 15%, but underrepresented in the prison population, making up 10%.Organisers involved in summerprotests outside asylum-seeker accommodationsought to reignite the issue by staging a demonstration outside Downing Street on Wednesday, where they were opposed by anti-fascist activists.View image in fullscreenThe ‘Pink Ladies’ holding an anti-migrant demonstation outside Downing Street on 1 October.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Sopa Images/ShutterstockThe former Conservative London mayoral candidate Susan Hall was among those who addressed the “Pink Ladies” group. Far-right activists have also attached themselves to the group’s protests in an attempt to exploit tensions around the housing of male asylum seekers.While the crowd on Whitehall was made up largely of a few hundred women dressed in pink and waving union flags, others present included far-right activists such as Steve Laws, of the Homeland party, as well as the Ukip leader, Nick Tenconi.A “women against the far right” counter-demonstration on the other side of Whitehall included the MP Diane Abbott and the former Big Brother contestant Narinder Kaur, who said she had come to oppose what she said was the Pink Ladies’ aim of spreading fear about asylum seekers.“The truth is that there is a sexual violence epidemic against women in our country but if you are teaching your daughter to fear only one type of man then you are putting your daughter back,” she said. “The sad fact is that the data shows women are already in danger from men they know. Women are not a weapon to be used to disguise racism.”Hall told the crowd: “I am a mother and a grandmother and we are worried when we have young men who are coming here from cultures that do not look after women, we have got every cause to be concerned.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was convicted of raping two girls, identified in court only as Girl A and Girl B, on multiple occasions. He was also found guilty of offences of indecency with a child and procuring a child to have sex.The gang membersraped one or both of the girls between 2001 and 2006from when the children were 13. The girls had “deeply troubled home lives” and were given drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, places to stay and people to be with, a jury heard.The girls, who did not know each other, were expected to have sex “wherever and whenever” the men wanted, whether in filthy flats, cars, or on nearby moors, the court heard.In an impact statement, Girl A told a three-day sentencing hearing this week that it had “destroyed” her life. “The abuse has affected every part of my life,” she said. “From what I look like, relationships, health, to my mental health.”Girl B said: “I coped with what these men did to me as at the time I believed that every man I came into contact with would expect sex. It is horrific that I didn’t know any different.”She urged other victims to come forward to police. “It doesn’t matter how much time has gone by, it is still possible to get justice,” she said.The abuse happened “under the noses” of people who should have been protecting the girls, the court heard. Rochdale council andGreater Manchesterpolice (GMP) have apologised for failings.The seven men were found guilty after a four-month trial of 50 offences and were given jail sentences on Wednesday by Judge Jonathan Seely.View image in fullscreenTop row, left to right: Mohammed Zahid, Roheez Khan, Mohammed Shahzad, Kasir Bashir. Bottom row, left to right: Naheem Akram, Mushtaq Ahmed, Nisar Hussain.Composite: Greater Manchester policeIn addition to sentencing Zahid, the judge jailed Mushtaq Ahmed, 67, of Oldham, for 27 years and Kasir Bashir, 50, of Oldham, for 29 years. Ahmed and Bashir were convicted of multiple counts of rape and indecency with a child, in relation to Girl B.Mohammed Shahzad, 44, of Rochdale was jailed for 26 years; Naheem Akram, 49, of Rochdale for 26 years; and Nisar Hussain, 41, of Rochdale for 19 years. The men, all taxi drivers, were convicted of multiple counts of rape against Girl A.Roheez Khan, 39, of Rochdale, was found guilty of a single count of rape against Girl A and jailed for 12 years.The court heard that Zahid, then a Rochdale indoor market trader with the nickname “Boss Man”, gave free underwear from his lingerie stall to the girls, as well as money, alcohol and food. In return he expected them to have regular sex with him and his friends.He was so confident of never being held to account that he would personally pick up and drop off Girl B at the children’s care home where she lived.Judge Seely said both victims had suffered “incessant abuse” and as children had been targeted by “gangs of sexually predatory men”.“Both girls were highly vulnerable, both had deeply troubled backgrounds and were known to the authorities,” he said. “They were highly susceptible to the advances of these men and others, and both were sexually abused by numerous other men.“They were passed around for sex – abused, humiliated, degraded and then discarded. Both were seriously let down by those whose job it was to protect them.”He said Girl B had been “failed woefully” and noted how she was “chillingly described” in a social services document as having prostituted herself at 10 years old.The prosecutor, Rossano Scamardella KC, told Manchester Minshull Street crown court: “Such was the brazen way [Zahid] did this that by the end of the abuse he felt almost untouchable.“It’s not as if she had no one to turn to. She turned to the care home. She turned to social services. She felt able to tell them at some stages, or other people did, and nothing was done. People knew, authorities knew. And nothing was done.”In 2016, Zahid was jailed for five years in an earlier grooming gang case. His barrister, Lisa Wilding KC, said her client continued to deny his offending.Girl A told the jury she could have been targeted by more than 200 offenders as her phone number was swapped and said “there was that many it was hard to keep count”.Girl B said she had presumed agencies knew what was going on, as police regularly picked her up after social workers labelled her a “prostitute”.After unanimous guilty verdicts in June, Sharon Hubber, Rochdale borough council’s director of children’s services, said: “We know that more could and should have been done by the people who were working here at the time, and for that we are truly sorry.”Det Supt Alan Clitherow, of GMP, said the way victims were dealt with had been “indefensible and inexcusable”.He added: “We have made comprehensive apologies for that. We’re not perfect but we are very much improving now on how we manage these investigations.”All the perpetrators were prosecuted as part of Operation Lytton, a continuing investigation, begun in 2015, by GMP into historical child sexual exploitation in Rochdale.So far 37 individuals have been charged, with five more trials scheduled to take place.In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

Experts say this is due largely to a widening of the diagnostic criteria and greater recognition of the condition.And, while autism is defined by having challenges with social communication, sensory processing and restrictive behaviours, there is huge variability in how these difficulties present between individuals. Scientists have been looking at whether the population clusters into subgroups, with shared traits or trajectories, that could make studying autism more tractable.The latest study used behavioural data from four birth cohorts, ranging from 89 to 188 people, and genetic data from two large studies, with more than 45,000 participants.Previously, it was generally assumed that those diagnosed earlier tended to be those with more marked autistic traits, underpinned by people carrying a higher proportion of autism-linked gene variants. However, the latest study revealed a different pattern.Autistic people could teach Donald Trump a thing or two about focus, facts and empathy | Rhiannon Lucy CosslettRead moreThe analysis,published in Nature,found that the underlying genetic profiles differed between those diagnosed with autism earlier and later in life, with only a modest overlap. The average genetic profile of later-diagnosed autism is closer to that of ADHD, as well as to mental health conditions such as depression and PTSD, than it is to autism diagnosed in early childhood.Those diagnosed before the age of six years were more likely to be slow to walk and have difficulty interpreting hand gestures and tended to experience social and communication difficulties that appeared early but remained stable. Those diagnosed after the age of 10 years were more likely to experience an increase in difficulties during adolescence and, by late adolescence, presented with more severe challenges.Prof Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, who was not involved in the research, said: “It makes me hopeful that even more subgroups will come to light, and each will find an appropriate diagnostic label.“It is time to realise that ‘autism’ has become a ragbag of different conditions.”Explore more on these topicsAutismMedical researchNeurodiversitynewsShareReuse this content"

He then set their house on fire, having earlier booby-trapped the building.Police said they believed he had probably killed his 90-year-old father, whose body was seen but could not be recovered from the still-burning house in the city’s leafy northern Lerchenau district.The man also shot his 81-year-old mother, who was taken to hospital with wounds not considered life-threatening, they said.His 21-year-old daughter was also injured but was rescued by firefighters from the first floor, having threatened to jump to escape the flames, police said.The man, who has not been named, fled after a police helicopter spotted him in the garden. After a short pursuit, he stopped in a lakeside park and killed himself, police said.Bomb squads were called in because the man had rigged the building with explosives – reportedly grenades attached to trip wires – and was also carrying an explosives-laden backpack.During his rampage, he had also set three vehicles on fire outside the house, including his own van, police said.The crime prompted a major police mobilisation shortly before 5am local time, and then the evacuation of nearby residents and a local school. About 500 police, firefighters and other first responders were deployed during the day’s emergency response operations.Bavaria state’s interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, said there was no sign of a political or religious motive. “It appears, incomprehensible as it may be, that this was solely a family matter,” he added.City authorities responded to the alarm by announcing the temporary closure of the Oktoberfest, considered the world’s largest such gathering. The festival, held from 20 September to 5 October this year, welcomed 6.7 million visitors in 2024.In 1980 it was the scene of a pipe bomb attack by a far-right group, which killed 13 people and wounded more than 200.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The encyclical cast care for the planet as anurgent and existential moral concernand launched a global grassroots movement to advocate for caring for God’s creation and the peoples most harmed by its exploitation.Leo told the estimated 1,000 representatives from environmental and Indigenous groups that they needed to put pressure on national governments to develop tougher standards to mitigate the damage already done. He said he hoped the upcoming UN climate conference “will listen to the cry of the Earth and the cry of the poor”.He did not name names but history’s first American pope spoke just days afterDonald Trump complained, with false statements, to the UN general assembly about the “con job” of global warming. Trump has long been a critic of climate science and polices aimed at helping to transition to green energies such as wind and solar power.Leo quoted Francis’s follow-up encyclical, published in 2023, in which the Argentinian pope challenged world leaders before a UN conference tocommit to binding targetsto slow climate change before it was too late.Citing Francis’s text, Leo recalled that some leaders had chosen to “deride the evident signs of climate change, to ridicule those who speak of global warming and even to blame the poor for the very thing that affects them most”.He called for a change of heart to truly embrace the environmental cause and said any Christian should be onboard.“We cannot love God, whom we cannot see, while despising his creatures. Nor can we call ourselves disciples of Jesus Christ without participating in his outlook on creation and his care for all that is fragile and wounded,” he said, presiding on a stage that featured a large chunk of a melting glacier from Greenland and tropical ferns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This means that in order to allow fracking, a future government would have to repeal the legislation with a parliamentary vote.This would be very difficult, as it means the government would have to gain the votes of MPs whose constituencies sit on shale gas. Miliband used his speech at theLabour conferenceto say the party will send campaigners to nearly 200 constituencies to “send the frackers packing”.A permanent ban on fracking had been akey pledge in Labour’s election manifestoand had beenreaffirmed by Miliband earlier this year, but Wednesday’s announcement laid out how the government would bring in the legislation.Miliband said he would legislate to ban fracking “at the earliest opportunity” to protect the 187 constituencies that sit above shale gas areas from drilling.Factcheck: why fracking in UK will not reduce your energy billsRead moreThere is a moratorium on the controversial energy extraction method, which involves drilling deep into the earth then shooting at high speed a mixture of sand, water and chemicals to dislodge shale gas.Reform UK supports fracking across Britain, but it is unpopular as it causes earthquakes. The last time fracking was tried in the UK, at Preston New Road in Lancashire, it resulted in nearly 200 earthquakes in less than a year.There have already been fractures in Reform over the fracking issue, with Lancashire council, which is under Reform control, saying it would not welcome drilling in the area. The party’s leader, Nigel Farage, and deputy, Richard Tice, have both backed the fracking and said it would bring down bills, a claimwidely debunked by experts.The Liz Truss government collapsed in 2022 after Miliband, then shadow energy secretary, forced a vote to ban fracking during an opposition day debate. Truss attempted to whip her MPs to vote for fracking, andmany rebelled, causing chaos.Tice and Farage have tried to draw comparisons with the success of fracking in the US, but the high population density in the UK and different geology means that there is a greater chance of disruption and earthquakes, and it is harder to extract gas because the shale resource in the UK is heavily faulted and compartmentalised.Explore more on these topicsFrackingLabourReform UKLabour conferencenewsShareReuse this content"

About 9,000 sq km of land – an area the size of Cyprus – was turned green to grey between 2018 and 2023, according to the data. That is the equivalent of almost 30 sq km a week, or 600 football pitches a day.Nature accounts for the majority of the losses, at about 900 sq km a year, but the research shows we are also building on agricultural land at a rate of about 600 sq km a year, with grave consequences for the continent’s food security and health.Steve Carver, a professor of wilderness at the University of Leeds, said: “Land lost to development is one of the primary drivers of wilderness loss and biodiversity decline. But we are also losing cropland and productive land as our cities expand into the green belt and on to agricultural land.”The most common developments, accounting for a quarter of all cases, were for housing and roads. But nature and farmland is also being destroyed to accommodate luxuries for the rich, tourism, consumerism and industry.Arena reveals that in Portugal, almost 300 hectares (740 acres) of the protected sand dunes at Galé Beach near Melides, an hour south of Lisbon, have been lost to create a new golf course at the CostaTerra Golf and Ocean Club, where properties will sell for about £5.6mThe resort, which is still under construction, is a second home to Princess Eugenie and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, who works for the development. It is being built on Natura 2000 land, which is supposed to be protected under EU regulations.Satellite imagery shows the areas of protected dune land lost to the CostaTerra Golf and Ocean Club in southern PortugalSatellite imagery shows the areas of protected dune land lost to the CostaTerra Golf and Ocean Club in southern PortugalThe resort promises “the simple luxury of European living” on “the last untouched Atlantic coast in southern Europe”. Its 75-hectare golf course is estimated to consume as much as800,000 litresof water a day to maintain the greens.Exceptions to development on Natura 2000 land can be granted if there is overriding public interest. The Portuguese authorities approved the resort, which is owned by the US property firm Discovery Land Company, on the grounds of economic benefit.Ioannis Agapakis, a lawyer for ClientEarth, an environmental law NGO, said a golf course did not fulfil these requirements. “It is obviously not overriding public interest,” he said. “The mere fact that you find economic benefits or some type of economic development from a project does not make it overriding public interest.”Discovery Land Company said in a statement: “We are developing CostaTerra to be a model for environmental stewardship and sustainability in the region.“Every aspect of the property – from the design of the golf course, to rainwater and waste management practices, to the development and preservation of wildlife habitat and corridors – was designed to meet or exceed EU standards, including the Natura 2000 framework.“We’ll continue to innovate and find solutions to make CostaTerra the most responsible property of its kind.”Brooksbank was approached by the Guardian but did not comment.In Turkey, the Çaltılıdere wetland in the İzmir province on the Aegean coast has been buried beneath more than a square kilometre of concrete foundations for a marina to repair and build luxury yachts, the investigation shows.Officially designated as a wetland by Turkey, Çaltılıdere was home to flamingos, pelicans, cormorants, sea bream and sea bass. It also served as a vital carbon store and natural flood defence.But local authorities overturned its protected status in 2017 after a tense and controversial local commission meeting. Satellite images show how the vital stopping point for migratory birds has been consumed by concrete foundations.Satellite imagery shows the wetland lost to the marina development at Çaltılıdere in TurkeySatellite imagery shows the wetland lost to the marina development at Çaltılıdere in TurkeyYatek, the industry cooperative developing the marina project, says it will bring huge economic growth and thousands of jobs to the area. “The richest people in Turkey and in the world will bring their big yachts here and repair them or have them built,” Yatek’s former director said in an interview in 2021. The cooperative foresees manufacturing as many as 132 luxury yachts a year.Yatek said in a statement that its project was “a fully compliant initiative that strictly follows all legal procedures, including the acquisition of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) report”, a document detailing a project’s effects for permission to be granted under EU law.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Accordingly, the entire project process continues lawfully and in line with the relevant legislation,” the statement said.Turkey, the largest country in the analysis, ranked highest for the amount of green land lost between 2018 and 2023. It built on 1,860 sq km of nature and crop land, accounting for more than a fifth of the total loss in Europe.But the developments are across Europe. In the Vermio mountains in northern Greece, defined as a roadless area of wilderness in Greek law, a large windfarm is being developed across the western and central Macedonia regions.According to the Dublin-based Aer Soléir, the ultimate owner of the Vermio windfarms, the plans are fully aligned with applicable Greek and EU regulatory frameworks. It said the development had “secured, during a lengthy demanding design and licensing process, all required permits and approvals”, and added: “The project was reviewed twice by the supreme administrative court. In both cases, the relevant annulment actions were rejected, and the court confirmed full compliance of the project with the environmental and regulatory framework.”The company also said a series of reforestation works were being undertaken in parallel with construction.In Germany, half a million trees were felled near Berlinto build a Tesla gigafactoryafter the governmentapproveda plan to expand the plant to double production to 1m cars a year. Tesla has been approached for comment.Satellite images show the woodland cleared to make way for the Tesla factory.Satellite images show the woodland cleared to make way for the Tesla factory.The methodology used in the Green to Grey investigation is different from the official method used by the European Environment Agency (EEA), which excludes areas smaller than 50,000 sq metres, the equivalent of about five football pitches. The investigation identified small, piecemeal nature losses as well as construction in urban green spaces, resulting in estimates 1.5 times larger than the EEA’s calculations and showing the total impact of cumulative small-scale losses.“It’s a slow-burning issue,” said Jan-Erik Petersen of the EEA. “It just accumulates over time.”The Green MEP Lena Schilling said: “For years, the EU has promised to lead on climate and nature protection, but what this investigation shows is that we are literally cementing over our own future.“Every forest, fertile field and biodiversity hotspot destroyed for short-term profit is a betrayal of the promises we made to young people.”View image in fullscreenThe construction site for Tesla’s gigafactory near Berlin pictured in September 2020.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesShe said that if nature continued to be treated as expendable, Europe would lose not only its climate goals, but also its food security, its health and the very places that made the continent worth living in.The analysis covered 30 countries, covering 96% of the EEA’s 39-country area. Every country examined is losing natural and agricultural areas, but some fare worse than others. The five countries with the highest green losses were Turkey,with more than 1800 sq km of nature and crop land lost between 2018 and 2023, Poland (more than 1,000 sq km), France (950 sq km), Germany (720 sq km) and the UK (604 sq km).Additional reporting by Rachel Keenan, Raphael Boyd, Olivia Lee, Yassin El-Moudden, Gracie Daw, Matthew Holmes, Mariam Amini, Gabriel Smith, Dominic Kendrick and Emma RussellFormore,visitgreentogrey.euThe next phase of this project will be planet-wide: join a crowdsourced citizen science initiative to measure global nature losshereExplore more on these topicsConservationGreen to greyBiodiversityFood securityWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

That number is up 160% compared with 30 years ago.Soaring tourism is making a substantial footprint on Lapland’s environment. Exclusive analysis shows that around tourist hotspots in Finnish Lapland, green areas equivalent in size to London’s Hyde Park were developed for the purposes of tourism in the five years to 2023. The developments include holiday homes, ski slopes and a virtual reality experience to give tourists who missed the light show another chance to view the aurora borealis.View image in fullscreenThe Utsjoki Arctic Resort was built in an area designated to have national significance.Photograph: Otto PontoThe extent of the development was uncovered as part of the broaderGreen to Grey cross-border project– with the Guardian, Arena for Journalism in Europe, Le Monde, the Finnish journalism platform Long Play and eight other news outlets in 11 countries across Europe.While some expansions are larger in scale, many are smaller-scale string developments consisting of one or two holiday homes. But all are leaving their mark on the region’s pristine landscapes.The Guardian estimates that 15% of developments in Lapland were tourism-related, jumping to around half in the main tourist hubs.Graphic showing cleared or developed land between 28 July 2018 and 9 August 2024 in the Utsjoki municipality of FinlandLapland, the largest and northernmost region ofFinland, became known as the home of Santa Claus in the 1920s, and in the 90s its small capital Rovaniemi (population 65,000) proclaimed itself Santa’s home city. Over the course of the year, now, and particularly in November and December, it receives many times that figure in tourists.In Rovaniemi, holiday homes have been built for tourists on green spaces that were once parks or forests. Other developments include a water park, a travel agency, a reindeer park, a husky facility and an extension to the existing Santa Claus village.Beyond the city, in the popular ski resorts of Levi, Ylläs and Saariselkä, expanding tourism has consumed at least 430,000 sq metres of natural landscape since 2018. Farther north, the Utsjoki Arctic Resort was built in an area designated to have national significance. The resort’s owner, Juhani “Jussi” Eiramo, was asked for comment but declined.View image in fullscreenIndigenous Sámi communities have practised reindeer herding in Lapland for generations, and rely on agreements with local authorities to protect pastures.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesLast spring, the municipal council of Inari approved 227 cottage plots along the shore of Lapland’s Lake Inari, in one of the remotest corners ofEurope. These plots are located in old-growth forests where indigenous Sámi communities have practised reindeer herding for generations.“What has been planned is completely absurd. Almost all reindeer herders are concerned about these kinds of developments, whether it’s logging, mining or tourism competing for the same land,” said Elle Maarit Arttijeff, a Sámi reindeer herder, lamenting what amounts to the reversal of a 20-year settlement between the state-owned forestry company and herders to protect pastures in the area. “It is so terribly stressful and sad.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, “along with logging and mining, the development of recreational activities, such as skiing, are the main threats currently facing Europe’s remaining wilderness areas,” warns Steve Carver, professor of rewilding and wilderness science at the University of Leeds.This article was amended on 1 October 2025 to use the full name of Elle Maarit Arttijeff, who was talking about a 20-year local land settlement that reindeer herders had with the state-owned forestry company, not with the local authority as stated in an earlier version.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentGreen to greyFinlandSwedenScandinavia holidaysEuropeNorwayRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said: “I think any foreign person is the worst to deal with.”Later he says of an alleged overstayer: “Either put a bullet through his head or deport him.”One sergeant made repeated sexualised remarks including about masturbation, and other officers are caught on tape talking about stamping on suspects, injuring those who do not comply and elbowing a suspect in leg restraints repeatedly in the face.Officers were also recorded discussing falsifying a statement after force was used, and avoiding making admissions in front of police cameras in their station meant to deter and detect wrongdoing.At the highest levels of the Met, as well as at City Hall and in national government, there is a fear, if not expectation, that the revelations will damage confidence in the force and cast doubt on claims it is reforming radically enough after years of scandal and damning reports.In a sign of the tensions, officers booed and jeered the Met deputy commissioner, Matt Jukes, at the National BlackPoliceAssociation (NBPA) conference when he refused to accept that Britain’s biggest force was institutionally racist.A report in 2023 by Louise Casey, commissioned by the Met after themurder of Sarah Everardby a serving officer, found the Metto be institutionally racist, misogynistic and prejudiced.Rowley – who became commissioner of the Met in 2022 – immediately rejected those terms, while saying he accepted the report’s findings of wholesale failings and toxicity.The London mayor,Sadiq Khan, said he would announce the much-delayed follow-up inquiry into the Met that Lady Casey wanted, checking how much the Met had changed.Jukes was scrambled to attend the conference of black officers on Wednesday as the Met was plunged into crisis by the alleged actions of its own officers, telling the audience the behaviours were “a matter of profound shame and regret”.Jukes, a strong favourite to be the next Met commissioner, warned of “gangsterish behaviours” among officers, covering up for wrongdoing and “coercing” others to do the same.View image in fullscreenA still from a BBC documentary about misogyny and racism inside the Met.Photograph: UNPIXS/BBCRowley said the BBC programme exposed “appalling and criminal” behaviour, apologised and vowed to investigate “deeper into the corrupt networks and cliques our actions have driven underground”.Since Rowley took charge in September 2022, the Met says it has ousted 1,500 officers who fell short of expected standards.Rowley said: “The behaviour depicted in this programme is reprehensible and completely unacceptable.“Officers behaving in such appalling, criminal ways let down our communities and will cause some to question if their sons and daughters are safe in our cells, and whether they would be believed and respected as victims of crime. For that, I am truly sorry.”He promised that “where there is incontrovertible evidence of racism, misogyny, anti-Muslim sentiment or bragging about excessive use of force”, those responsible would be “put on a fast-track hearing within weeks and on a path to likely dismissal”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This comes down to not more reports, not more recommendations, this comes down to leadership and implementation.”Imran Khan, the solicitor forDoreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was murdered by racists who stayed free because of police errors, said: “The police service now is as bad as it ever was. If the commissioner does not do anything about it, he has to go.”TheLondonmayor, along with the home secretary, has responsibility for the Met and said:“I have met with the commissioner to discuss directly the issues exposed by the BBC – and its impact on public confidence and trust in the police …“I will continue to work with the commissioner and hold him to account to ensure Londoners get the police they deserve. In support of that, I will soon be announcing details of a planned follow-up to the Casey review.”Alison Lowe, West Yorkshire’s deputy mayor for policing and crime, said she feared a national fallout: “People will see what is happening in Charing Cross and think that applies everywhere.”Andy George, the president of the NBPA, said Rowley had not taken the challenges on race and other bad behaviours seriously enough, sidelining – instead of listening to – black officers, and called for the Met to be broken up, adding: “What I see is a lot of chickens coming home to roost.”The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said: “The disturbing scenes in this footage are sickening. I welcome the Independent Office for Police Conduct fully and urgently investigating all the issues raised in this report.“It is right that the Metropolitan police have condemned this, and we fully support their pledge to root out those unfit to serve the public. I know this is a top priority for the commissioner.“We have given police chiefs the powers to automatically sack officers who fail background checks and dismiss those guilty of gross misconduct, and we expect them to be used.”Panorama: Undercover in the Policeis on BBC One at 9pm on Wednesday and is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsMetropolitan policePoliceMark RowleyRaceSadiq KhanLondonViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

The winner receives £1,000, a one-day publishing workshop at 4th Estate, and publication of their story on the Guardian website.Kapugeekiyana’s story,The Original Is Not Here, follows Charitha, a Sri Lankan museum curator who receives backlash after staging an exhibit centring on a replica of Tārā, which is housed in the British Museum.“Bold and inventive, this story pushes at the edges of form and meaning while remaining deeply human,” said Caleb Femi, the author, director, photographer, and one of the judges for this year’s competition. The story is “a triumph”, he added.Candice Carty-Williams, who founded the prize while working as a marketing executive at 4th Estate before going on to publish her bestselling novel Queenie, was also on this year’s judging panel.Kapugeekiyana “clearly has a flair for short story writing, creating a narrative that is engaging, topical and well-paced”, said judge and Guardian features writer Lucy Knight. “The story takes on the hot potato topic of cancel culture with great skill, offering a nuanced and thought-provoking take.”Other writersshortlisted this yearwere Nana Kwesi Boateng, Yasmina Floyer, Linda Helen Yu, Jacqueline-Faith Ísọlá and Monica Davis.Carty-Williams, Femi and Knight were joined on the judging panel by 4th Estate publisher Kishani Widyaratna, athlete Jazmin Sawyers, and Monica MacSwan, an associate agent at Aitken Alexander.The Original Is Not Here is a “provocative, wry and surprisingly affecting story delivered with flair by an assured and original new voice”, said Widyaratna. “A real talent.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

This week it said it wouldrestart limited manufacturing“in the coming days”.The production freeze has left many parts makers in a desperate position, without income for more than month.The Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), a lobby group representing many JLR suppliers, warned that without urgent government intervention the whole of the UK automotive supply chain could face irreversible damage, threatening thousands of jobs and an industrytargeted for growthby the Labour government.Michael Beese, the managing director of Genex UK, which presses metal parts for several suppliers to JLR, said commercial banks had said that in order to get an expensive loan, suppliers would need to give personal guarantees that could expose them to losing their houses and other assets.“I looked at getting a loan but was quoted interest of 16% and they wanted personal guarantees,” Beese said. “Why should I put my business and family home on the line when I’ve done nothing wrong?”Beese said he had been forced to lay off some of Genex’s 17 workers because of a cash shortage. Other suppliers have said loans are not an option for some small companies because they fear breaching rules on directors’ legal responsibilities.JLR is considering upfront payments to its direct suppliers in order to inject cash as quickly as possible, according to two people with knowledge of talks. However, it does not have a direct relationship with much of its supply chain, so it would be reliant on bigger suppliers quickly passing on cash to smaller companies.The business secretary, Peter Kyle, announced on Saturday that the government would provide a guarantee tounderwrite a £1.5bn private loanfor JLR, although that deal is not thought to have been formally completed. JLR has agreed another £2bn in new debt from banks without state support.However, the government has not pledged any cash to JLR or its supply chain since the hack, and several people in the automotive industry told the Guardian they believed the £1.5bn loan guarantee had been rushed out ahead of the Labour party’s conference in Liverpool without addressing the key issues caused by the hack.The government loan guarantee was meant to help parts manufacturers indirectly but some smaller suppliers believe it will take too long to trickle down from “tier one” makers of larger assemblies of components to the generally smaller “tier two” companies who supply parts to them in turn.Even if tier one companies receive invoices for new work, under UK law they have up to 60 days to make those payments to the second tier.The CBM told the Guardian there was “little prospect of second-tier and lower-tier suppliers receiving any funding in the short term” and it called for direct government support for companies further down the chain.Steve Morley, the CBM’s president, said: “This is the only way we can get money quickly to where it is needed most, to prevent the supply chain from collapsing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our focus now must be on ensuring that second-tier and smaller suppliers are supported so the whole framework is in place when production restarts.”Across the supply chain, thousands of workers have been laid off, according to industry sources.Beese said: “We’ve kept working, building some stock, to keep our employees in work but we’ve run out of space and material. I have now laid off staff due to the uncertain short-term future. Our customers can’t give us clear plans moving forward, so now I’m faced with some really tough decisions.”One option suggested by the CBM is using the British Business Bank’s growth guarantee scheme, for which the government underwrites lending to smaller businesses. Other suppliers have previously asked ministers for atemporary freeze on tax billsand some form of support for workers’ wages.A Labour source said: “The government acted quickly to ensure JLR and its suppliers could receive support as soon as possible given the tens of thousands of jobs depending on the business.”Small suppliers also called for improved communication from JLR on its progress in restarting production so that they could have a better picture of how long they will have to survive without orders.JLR, owned by India’s Tata, has been unable to give firm restart dates because it has had to rebuild all of its production systems, so it has been unable to make orders for parts. JLR has set up a helpdesk for suppliers.The government’s business department was approached for comment. The British Business Bank declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsJaguar Land RoverAutomotive industryManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The spokesperson added: “We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe.”UK has backed down on demand to access US Apple user data, spy chief saysRead moreApple withdrew ADP for new users in the UK in February and said existing users would need to disable the security feature at a later date. Messaging services such as iMessage and FaceTime remain end-to-end encrypted by default.Tulsi Gabbard, the US director of national intelligence, said in August the UK had backed down on demanding access to US customer data. Donald Trump had described the access demand as “something that you hear about with China”.Apple did not comment on the FT report directly, but said it was “gravely disappointed” that it could not offer ADP – an optional extra layer of security – to UK customers and reiterated that it would “never” build a backdoor into its products.“Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom. As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,” said the company.Apple had appealed against the first TCN via the investigatory powers tribunal, which investigates whether the domestic intelligence services have acted unlawfully. The Home Office had sought to keep details of the case under wraps but after a judgment in April some information wasreleased for the first time, confirming Apple’s appeal.However, details of the TCN were not revealed and under the Investigatory Powers Act recipients of such a notice are not allowed to reveal its existence. The FT has reported that the original TCN was “not limited to” data stored under ADP, indicating the UK government wanted access to the basic and more widely used iCloud service.The ADP service uses end-to-end encryption, a form of security that means only the account holder can decrypt files such as documents and photos – and no one else can, including Apple.Privacy International, a charity that launched a legal challenge against the first TCN, said the new order “may be just as big a threat to worldwide security and privacy as the old one”. It said if Apple is forced to break end-to-end encryption in the UK it will in effect break it for everyone by creating a vulnerability in its systems.“The resulting vulnerability can be exploited by hostile states, criminals and other bad actors the world over,” the charity said.Explore more on these topicsData protectionAppleHome OfficeTelecomsCloud computingComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

The seas around the Greek capital were vessel-free as crews, heeding union calls, kept ferries in ports.View image in fullscreenA university student holds a flare during a demonstration in Athens.Photograph: Alkis Konstantinidis/ReutersThe pro-business government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has faced growing opposition over the proposed changes, with workers contending they not only ride roughshod over their rights but kill off any hopes for work-life balance.The 13-hour day proposal is expected to be passed into law this month. The change would allow employees to clock in 13 hours, effectively extending their presence in the work place by up to five hours.Standing in Syntagma Square in Athens, Makis Kontogiorgos, a trade unionist from a major technology company, said: “Greeks are already forced to survive on some of the lowest wages in Europe and now they’re asking us to effectively work most of the day.“People can’t be pushed like this; at some point there’ll be an explosion.”View image in fullscreenMakis Kontogiorgos.Photograph: Helena Smith/GuardianWhile the Mediterranean country has recovered from a prolonged debt crisis in which the economy shrank by more than 25% – and biting austerity imposed in return for international rescue funds – salaries remain well behind other EU member states at a time when the cost of living has risen dramatically.At €880 (£765) a month, the minimum wage – though raised by Mitsotakis’s centre-right administration – is among the lowest on the continent.Critics have spoken of longer office hours causing burnout and work accidents. Pame, a union affiliated to the Communist party, likened the new measure to “modern slavery”.Labour market experts have questioned the wisdom of extending working hours when research shows such policies being detrimental to productivity and the quality of services and goods.According to the EU statistical agency, Eurostat, Greeks work on average 39.8 hours a week, compared with the EU average of 35.8 hours.Last year, the government caused a similar outcry by introducinga six-day working week, a voluntary scheme applied to private businesses in tourism and other sectors providing around-the-clock services. Unions deplored the measure as “barbaric”.Since assuming office in July 2019, Mitsotakis has said he wants to make the labour market more flexible by reducing the power of unions, including collective work agreements.The labour minister, Niki Kerameus, says the latest law has been designed to enhance that flexibility, claiming the 13-hour rule will only be applied in “exceptional” circumstances.Defending the measure, Mitsotakis said it would give young people, who often work two jobs to make ends meet, the ability to put in more hours for a single employer.View image in fullscreenKaterina Andritsopoulou, standing in front of Greece’s parliament.Photograph: Helena Smith/GuardianKaterina Andritsopoulou, 55, an employee in a privately owned manufacturing company, said she felt compelled to join Wednesday’s protests out of fear that many workers would fall victim to labour abuses as a result of the change.“While the rest of Europe talks about a shorter working week, inGreece, in the 21st century, it’s all about longer hours and wages that don’t reflect the cost of living,” she said.“It’s terrible that so many of us are forced to rely on government benefits to pay for our heating and other costs. We’re not here begging or making demands. We’re here because there are a lot of vulnerable people out there who won’t be able to negotiate with employers once laws like this are passed.”Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

After dozens of peaceful protesters were arrested over the weekend, violence broke out in several cities, especially in areas where jobs are scarce and social services lacking.“The right to health, education and a dignified life is not an empty slogan but a serious demand,” the organisers of the Gen Z212 protest movement wrote in a statement published on Discord. They cited King Mohammed VI, implored protesters to remain peaceful and criticised “repressive security approaches”.View image in fullscreenYoung people take to the streets in Rabat to voice anger at the dire state of some hospitals and schools.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APStill, the protests have escalated and become more destructive, particularly in cities far from where development efforts have been concentrated in Morocco. Local outlets and footage filmed by witnesses showed protesters hurling rocks and setting vehicles ablaze in cities and towns in the country’s east and south, including in Inzegane and Ait Amira.In Oujda, eastern Morocco’s largest city, one person was injured when a police vehicle rammed into demonstrators, local human rights groups and the state news agency MAP said.Morocco’s interior ministry said the anonymously organised protests lacked authorisation and were dealt with according to the law, noting that those found to be breaking the law would be treated “rigorously and firmly”. It said 409 people were taken into police custody.It said 263 members of law enforcement were injured during the nationwide protests that also damaged 142 of their vehicles. Twenty private cars were also damaged and 23 civilians were injured, the ministry said.The Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) said 37 protesters had been arrested in Oujda on Monday, among them six minors, and would appear in court on Wednesday.View image in fullscreenThe youth-led demonstration originated on social media platforms such as TikTok and Discord.Photograph: Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP/Getty ImagesThey are among the hundreds that AMDH said had been apprehended, including many whose arrests were captured on video by local media and some who were detained by plainclothes officers during interviews.“With protests scheduled to continue, we urge authorities to engage with the legitimate demands of the youth for their social, economic, and cultural rights and to address their concerns about corruption,” Amnesty International’s regional office said on Tuesday.In some of Morocco’s largest anti-government protests in years, the leaderless movement has harnessed anger about conditions in hospitals and schools to express outrage over the government’s spending priorities.Pointing to new stadiums under construction or renovation across the country, protesters have chanted: “Stadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?” The recent deaths of eight women at a public hospital in Agadir have also become a rallying cry against the decline of Morocco’s health system.View image in fullscreenOrganisers of the demonstrations accused the authorities of engaging in ‘repressive security approaches’.Photograph: Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP/Getty ImagesThe movement, which originated on platforms such as TikTok and Discord, which are popular among young people, has won additional backing since authorities began arresting people over the weekend, including from Morocco’s star goalkeeper Yassine Bounou and its most famous rapper ElGrandeToto.Officials have denied prioritising World Cup spending over public infrastructure, saying problems facing the health sector were inherited from previous governments. In Morocco’s parliament, the governing majority said it would meet on Thursday to discuss healthcare and hospital reform as part of a meeting led by the prime minister, Aziz Akhannouch.Explore more on these topicsMoroccoProtestMiddle East and north AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The book “makes a counterintuitive argument”, said the judges, “tracing the decline of the left that led to the rise of Islamism”, and is “tremendously well-written”.Garner was shortlisted for How to End a Story,describedby the Guardian’s reviewer Rachel Cooke as “the greatest, richest journals by a writer since Virginia Woolf’s”.Richard Holmes, who was previously shortlisted in 1999 and 2009, this time makes the cut for The Boundless Deep: Young Tennyson, Science and the Crisis of Belief.Frances Wilson, previously longlisted in 2016 and 2021, was chosen for Electric Spark: The Enigma of Muriel Spark, described as a “canny biography” by Olivia Laing inher Guardian review.Asked about the literary bent to this year’s shortlist at a press conference on Wednesday, Millen said that there was “probably less straight history being published than perhaps a few years ago”.Completing this year’s shortlist is Captives and Companions: A History of Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Islamic World by Justin Marozzi, and Lone Wolf: Walking the Faultlines of Europe by Adam Weymouth.Asked about the lack of racial diversity on the shortlist – all six authors are white – Millen said that “the diversity [the judges] were most interested in was diversity of topic and style, and it just happened that that’s the way the cards fell”.The winner of the prize will be announced on 4 November. While the winner will take home £50,000, the other shortlisted authors will receive £5,000 each.The Baillie Gifford prize is sponsored by the investment management company Baillie Gifford. In recent years, the firm has faced criticism for its investments in businesses connected to fossil fuels and Israel. Protests last year led to the company’ssponsorships of nine UK literary festivals coming to an end.Last year’s winner, Richard Flanagan – who won the prize for his book Question 7 –said he would not accept the prize moneyuntil Baillie Gifford shared a plan to reduce its investment in fossil fuel extraction and increase investments in renewables.In Wednesday’s conference, the prize director, Toby Mundy, said that Flanagan had had a “candid” conversation with the fund manager, but the ultimate result was that Flanagan did not accept the money. It will instead be donated to a literacy charity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Or utopian housing for the working classes? Here are the stories and scandals behind some of the UK’s most revolutionary homesHolly SmithWed 1 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 11.46 EDTShare‘There is nothing, it seems to me, more appalling, more deadening in the urban landscape than a uniform mass of low buildings covering acres and acres … High dwellings – I think, really very high dwellings – are an enormous enhancement of the scene.” So said Evelyn Sharp, civil servant and powerhouse within the Ministry ofHousingand Local Government, in 1955.Seventy years later, many would disagree. High-rise blocks are regularly denounced as ugly concrete monoliths: repetitive, plain, inhuman, boring …These so-called eyesores, however, were conceived as the polar opposite. The tall modern buildings were supposed to break up the repetitive, sooty dreariness of Victorian low-rise vistas and the swelling suburbs decried as “neither town nor country”.And, whatever their critics may say, they have shaped modern Britain, from the five- or six-storey blocks hailed as high-rise in the 1930s to the postwar structures of more than 30 floors. Some are famous in their own right; others have played host to remarkable stories.1.Kensal House, Ladbroke Grove, west London (1936)View image in fullscreenKensal House nursery, with flats behind.Photograph: View Pictures/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesAs the trend for mansion flats and modernistpieds-à-terrefor the wealthy took off in cities during the interwar years – such as Berthold Lubetkin’s Highpoint I (1935) and Wells Coates’ Isokon building (1934) – new models of working-class housing took shape in their wake. Kensal House, co-designed by Maxwell Fry and Elizabeth Denby, heralded a fresh prototype for working-class housing: bright, warm, comfortable and sociable. Its flats had two or three bedrooms, private balconies, pram sheds and labour-saving kitchens with up-to-date appliances. The bedrooms faced east, to catch the morning sun, and the living rooms west, for light in the afternoon. The estate had two social clubs, a nursery, a playground and allotments. It was tenant-managed, with a committee per staircase (although there were strict regulations about hanging washing outside and redecorating). Fry and Denby were trying to forge a more collective way of life. A trailblazing template for working-class housing, completely unlike the slums and tenements endured over the years before, Kensal House inspired thousands of estates in the decades to come.2.Quarry Hill, Leeds (1941)View image in fullscreenQuarry Hill under construction.Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty ImagesInterwar local authorities were hamstrung between the options of building up or out. Dispersal was the driving force in urban policy. All the while, whistles were being blown about the threat of formless urban sprawl gobbling up the countryside. In the 1930s, a subsidy system encouraged local authorities to clear slums and build flats on expensive inner-city sites, rehousing people near their workplaces and communities. Quarry Hill was devised by RAH Livett for the leftwing Leeds city council, to provide just under 1,000 multistorey flats and community facilities in a slum clearance area. It had an innovative, ferro-concrete design, lifts and futuristic waste-disposal flues. A slick photographed model served as the cover for the influential Pelican paperback Design(1938), but the real buildings fared worse. Quarry Hill’s experimental construction dragged on into the war, delayed by production-line hiccups and arguments with the contractors. Soon after completion, the estate was ailed by insecure wall slabs, corroding steelwork and fractures along the refuse chutes. Quarry Hill was demolished within just four decades. A local photographer, Peter Mitchell, captured resonant shots of the estate just before its clearance in the 1970s. Its rapid obsolescence reflects the stories of some other multistorey council estates in 20th-century Britain – but by no means all.3.Lawn flats, Harlow New Town, Essex (1951)View image in fullscreenThe Lawn was the first residential tower block in England.Photograph: Martin Bond/AlamyThis was Britain’s first tower block, designed by Frederick Gibberd. He was the chief planner at Harlow New Town, where sculptures by Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore were scattered around council estates for people to enjoy. His “point block” was engineered to provide a quiet, mostly low-rise neighbourhood with a visual accent, like a church spire. This district reflected the prevailing 1950s logic of mixed development – which allowed families with children to have houses with gardens and reserved flats for young couples, singletons and older people – all while achieving high densities. Nature was a prime consideration, with green fingers of land stretching into the residential areas in Harlow and pubs named after butterflies and moths. The earth-toned Lawn block had a tight footprint, allowing surrounding mature oak trees to be saved. Its ingenious design provided all the living rooms with views over the fields beyond. Following the establishment of green belts around major conurbations, building high saved precious stretches of countryside.4. Alton West, Roehampton, southwest London (1959)View image in fullscreenAlton West tenants enjoy spectacular views over Richmond Park and Wimbledon Common.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty Images“Each era needs, and has, its own architectural symbol,” reported the Architectural Reviewin its appraisal of the Alton Estate. “It would be difficult to find for the 20th century a more compelling one than the image of the great apartment building towering over the grass and trees of its surrounding parkland, bathed in the air and sunshine of a summer’s day.” Back in the 1930s, Christopher Tunnard had proposed an arcadian vision of tall blocks in the rolling 18th-century landscape of Claremont Park in Surrey, transforming this historically aristocratic property into a “common garden” for everyone. Such a dream was finally realised at London county council’s showpiece estate in Roehampton in the 1950s. The Alton West phase of the estate featured an epic row of five monumental slab blocks, from which maisonette-dwellers enjoyed spectacular outlooks over Richmond Park and Wimbledon Common. The slabs launched out from a sloping hillside on pilotis (pillar-like stilts that raise the building from the ground) so pedestrians could enjoy uninterrupted views of the vista stretching out beyond. Now these spaces have been given over to car parking, negating the effect.5.The William Stone Building, Cambridge (1964)View image in fullscreenThe William Stone Building was Grade II-listed in March 1993.Photograph: University of CambridgeCambridge’s only tower block is located in the university’s oldest college: Peterhouse, founded in 1284. Financed by a benefactor’s bequest, the William Stone Building was designed by Leslie Martin and Colin St John Wilson from the architecture department next door. Eight storeys high, it was structured as a laterally stepped ziggurat with wrap-around ribbon windows on its western side, taking inspiration from the sinuous work of the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. Most locals have no idea that this high-rise block exists, in spite of its height and striking design. The building nestles unobtrusively among trees in the south of the Peterhouse Deer Park, where it grants students views over the River Cam and the Fens. In the 1980s, the reactionary Peterhouse Right became notorious, as the intellectual home of Maurice Cowling, Roger Scruton, Michael Portillo and Michael Howard. In the 1960s, however, forward-thinking dons all across Oxbridge flocked to commission daring modernist firms to accommodate a swelling population of undergraduates. The William Stone Building represents the thumping ambition that underpinned this momentous period of educational expansion and upward social mobility.6. Ronan Point, Newham, east London (1968)View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of the gas explosion at Ronan Point in 1968.Photograph: David Graves/Rex/ShutterstockA gimcrack tower block that sparked a national scandal over high-rise safety. Just two months after it opened, Ronan Point suffered a progressive collapse after a minor gas leak on its 18th floor, destroying a whole wing. Five people died and 17 were injured. Ronan Point was built like a house of cards. Its concrete panels were stacked one on top of the other without an internal frame. Councils had handed out contracts to private developers who promised speedy construction at economies of scale through industrialised system building. Tenants were ushered back into a refurbished Ronan Point in 1973. In the 1980s, the Newham Tower Block Tenants Campaign and the activist-architect Sam Webb called for it to be replaced with better council housing.Ronan Point was forensically dismantled in 1986. Its joints were found to be filled with old cement bags, cigarette packets, tins and scrunched newspapers – including one dated 9 September 1972, packed during the botched restrengthening work. Ronan Point was not unique; thousands of high-rise flats shared equivalent structural faults. Tenants called for a national audit and urgent action, buthundreds of blocks remain unstrengthenedtoday. They highlight decades of state neglect, corporate wrongdoing and inadequate regulation – the very same conditions that caused the tragedy at Grenfell Tower in 2017.7. Trellick Tower, Kensington, west London (1972)View image in fullscreenTrellick Tower in west London.Photograph: Peter Trulock/Getty ImagesHigh-rise architecture could be slipshod. It could also be superb. Trellick Tower is a superlative work of crafted modern architecture, courtesy of the Hungarian-born architect Ernö Goldfinger. He insisted on the best materials for council tenants: a marble lobby, stained glass and fine hardwood joinery. Goldfinger maintained that building high could “free the ground for children and grown-ups to enjoy Mother Earth and not cover every inch with bricks and mortar”. The Parker Morris Committee had set high public sector standards in 1961, made mandatory in 1969, requiring council housing to have generous floor areas, indoor bathrooms, proper kitchens, central heating, plentiful electric sockets and ample storage. They recast the home beyond a site of basic shelter: “It must be something of which they can be proud; and in which they must be able to express the fullness of their lives.” Trellick is a moving testimony to this humane commitment.8. St Katharine’s Estate, Wapping, east London (1937)View image in fullscreenSt Katharine’s Estate, Wapping.Photograph: Mickey  Lee/AlamyThe home of a radical experiment in tenant control, hidden behind an unassuming facade. This dockland estate had been left to decay in the 1970s after the Greater London Council decanted residents but ran out of money for refurbishment. Homelessness was climbing; it could not remain empty. A determined group of locals came forward to form the Stephen and Matilda Tenants’ Co-operative. The St Katharine’s Estate housed the first-ever council tenants’ management co-operative in England and Wales, where residents took control of a property remaining under the legal ownership of the local council. Tenacious members moved in, refurbished more than 100 homes and converted one unit into a “playflat” for collective childcare. Different teams handled gardening, newsletter-writing, book-keeping and rent collection. They had a grocery shop, a playground and a shared minibus. A social committee organised discos, cinema outings, camping holidays, seaside trips, fireworks, football tournaments and chess matches. Central government praised Stephen and Matilda as a pioneering exercise, proffering a third way between municipal control and private ownership. Many such co-operatives sprang up at the end of the 1970s, but then faded from view after Margaret Thatcher’s election victory in 1979. Their model provides a precedent that could be revived today.9. Croxteth Drive, Liverpool (1965)View image in fullscreenTower blocks overlooking Sefton Park, Liverpool.Photograph: View Pictures/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesPerched on the edge of leafy Sefton Park, this tower block estate hosted a landmark 00s exercise in tenant participation. It was the home of Tenantspin, an internet television station run by elderly members of Liverpool’s High Rise Tenants Group. From the 1990s to the early 2000s, dozens of Liverpool’s ageing tower blocks were demolished and residents were moved to low-rise housing association new-builds. Tenantspin was conceived as a focal point for existing community bonds, especially for older people, who could talk about their memories and debate current affairs. Liverpudlian pensioners hosted, produced and broadcast hundreds of live webcasts on the world wide web. Viewers chimed in through their chatroom. Tenantspin toured internationally, even headlining an exhibition in New York City, where its broadcast was fed to a plasma screen display on Broadway.10. Cascades, Isle of Dogs, east London (1988)View image in fullscreenCascades was given the nickname ‘Yuppie Towers’.Photograph: Florian Monheim/imageBROKER/ShutterstockA flamboyant postmodern reimagination of the modernist tower block by the bold British firm CZWG (Campbell, Zogolovitch, Wilkinson and Gough). Cascades’ name pays tribute to its eye-catching sloped silhouette. It overlooks the River Thames from the Isle of Dogs. Taking inspiration from the industrial maritime heritage of its locale, Cascades playfully blended the aesthetics of the ocean liner with the Victorian warehouse. It makes for witty, allusive and enjoyable architecture – with portholes, rippling walls and mix-and-match materials. The first private high-rise housing completed for the London Docklands Development Corporation, gaining the nickname Yuppie Towers, this 19-storey block provides a foretaste of the shift towards high-rise as a luxury commodity. Cascades was kitted out with a pool, gym and sauna. We have since been faced with a curious paradox. Multi-storey estates of social housing are regularly denounced as sites of poverty, fecklessness and vice, while lavish new skyscrapers have been touted as symbols of investment, growth and prosperity.Holly Smith’s book Up in the Air: A History of High-Rise Britain (Verso, £20) is published on 28 October.

In between the bits of archive footage, Jobson gets a haircut, tries on a leather jacket or two, and trundles around the stage in a sleeveless T-shirt reliving the glory days.The way Jobson tells it, his and the band’s ascent to national prominence in the late 70s was bit of a miracle in itself: growing up in a bleak, postindustrial mining village outside Dunfermline, his first stroke of luck was bumping into Sid Vicious in Malcolm McLaren’s Sex shop on a trip down to London as a 15-year-old in 1976 to try to buy some leather trousers. Becoming a face on the early punk scene, Jobson’s second bit of luck was meeting fellow Dunfermline-ite Stuart Adamson, who asked him to join his nascent band after an audition at Cowdenbeath Workingmen’s Club. Jobson’s stories of Skids’ early days are pretty entertaining – most of them involving some kind of mass fight – as the band became part of the record-industry feeding frenzy after punk rock broke through in 1977.Jobson appears to remain justifiably proud of Skids’ best known songs – Into the Valley, The Saints Are Coming, Charles – and it remains bit of a late-70s madeleine to see him cavorting around on Top of the Pops. He is also fairly forthright about in his views on various fellow travellers (his dislike for John Lydon and Nancy Spungen is readily apparent) while former bandmates Rusty Egan and the late John McGeoch get a bit of a pasting for other reasons. Conversely Jobson, understandably, seems reluctant to talk in detail about Adamson, his former songwriting partner, who left Skids in 1981, went on to find major success with Big Country andwho killed himself in 2001; it’s clearly a sensitive subject. Well, Jobson appears to have emerged from it all relatively unscathed, and this film is an engaging stroll down the byways of 70s pop culture.The Story of Skids: Scotland’s No 1PunkBand is in cinemas from 1 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMusic documentaryPunkreviewsShareReuse this content"

When they were first produced and consumed, they were after all just films, not “silent” films – any more than photographs or paintings or sculptures are thought of as “silent”. Yet of course they often had improvised piano accompaniment; Gert Hoffman’s autobiographical novel The Film Explainer (filmed with Armin Mueller-Stahl) remembered the prewar time in Germany when his father was employed in a movie theatre to stand next to the screen with a pointer and literally explain what was going on. WhenAbel Gance’s Napoleon was revived in the late 70swith a live orchestral accompaniment, there was a new creative excitement around the idea of early cinema’s musical reinvention – we recently saw there-release of the special edition of Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkinwith the 2005 soundtrack composed for the film by the Pet Shop Boys.But now an artistic group from Austin, Texas, called Silents Synced and its director Josh Frank are offering a new approach to silent cinema: showing classics to music by established stars. This one, Radiohead X Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror putsMurnau’s 1922 vampire classic Nosferatuwith Radiohead’s Kid A from 2000 and Amnesiac from 2001. But I just couldn’t make friends with this fundamentally wrong-headed idea. Radiohead’s music isn’t composed for the film, it doesn’t illuminate it or intensify it or work interestingly against it; it just blares away arbitrarily alongside it. It’s just like trying to watch a movie while your next-door neighbour has their music on too loud. There are, possibly, interesting moments when an idea or image seems to chime or reverberate with the music; I worked very hard trying to isolate serendipitous touches like that. But this just seems to ignore the intentional form and structure of both film and album, turning both sound and image into wallpaper.

It makes sense, then, that the USP of their current tour is a collaboration with a different set of classical musicians in every city.Though mid-career-band-joined-by-orchestra sets so often enlist classical musicians to fill the holes left by fading creativity, leaving awkward blends between the two parties, that’s not the case tonight. The Icelanders meld seamlessly with the London Contemporary Orchestra, musically and visually, with both camps all in monochrome, mingled together under a sea of star-like lights. Opening with Blóðberg, one of several cuts from Átta, Jónsi’s voice – still utterly pristine after all these decades – floats up beautifully from the orchestra’s heaving waves of strings and brass, the lights brightening and dimming in time with the music’s volume.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

The tempo is slow, the music refined and elegant. Only the cheers of recognition for early favourite Starálfur briefly break through the dreaminess. It is all undeniably, objectively beautiful, particularly in such grand confines, and even more so when guest treble Malakai Bayoh provides a stunning vocal solo that cuts through the slow drift of first half closer Varðeldur like a knife through butter.And yet, though it frequently threatens complete transcendence, the set never quite gets over that line. It’s too polished and serene for the many crescendos to push the levels from calculated amber into the thrill of the red. There’s the occasional bit of edginess – Jónsi’s bowed guitar plunging into moody feedback at the end of Von, the way Sé Lest begins with a dance of glockenspiel and ends in an oompah of brass – which injects some welcome energy. Inevitably, however, the band revert to the show’s beautiful, palatable norm.That is, until its final stages.

This book tells the story of his dying, from the last time she saw him well, on a trip to Great Yarmouth at the end of summer, to his death less than two months later, just nine days after being diagnosed.It’s not easy to account for what makes this book so special. Its main character is as unpromisingly ordinary as its title suggests, and some may even find him a little boring. David Perry is the kind of man who spends hours sorting his beloved stamp collection into albums with the aid of long-tipped forceps and magnifying glasses, or filling in his Sudoku puzzle books, or reading the latest copy of the Antiques Gazette, looking intently at porcelain dogs and chased silver punch-bowls.He has lived the uneventful, comfortable life of an upwardly-mobile baby boomer born at the end of the second world war. He spends most of that life in Basildon, while commuting on the Fenchurch Street line to work as an industrial chemist. On family holidays in Yarmouth, he sets his deckchair 3ft from the sea but never goes in it. Not much to cloud his days, then, apart from caring for a disabled wife who dies 10 years before him. After downsizing to a bungalow in Norwich, he dies at 77 – a lifespan slightly short of the national average, but no tragedy there.The book perfectly catches a certain kind of clenched English male reserve, part shyness and part stubbornnessPartly, this book works its magic through the adamantine detail and quiet lyricism with which it recounts a particular, unrepeatable life. David’s Davidness – always eating a bowl of cereal before bed, hoarding Wagon Wheels, calling his artificial sweeteners “depth charges”, laughing with a half-private chuckle at his own bad jokes – comes off the page in sparks. The book perfectly catches a certain kind of clenched English male reserve, part shyness and part stubbornness. David only ever greets or says goodbye to his son with a handshake; they don’t even hug on the day he finds out he will die. He shows love, like many men of his generation, via punctiliousness, each January entering birthdays into a new wall calendar and then marking them with a tick once a card is sent. After his diagnosis he carefully writes, on the final page of this calendar, all his passwords and security details.Mostly, though, what makes this book gem-like is that it succeeds in conveying the reality of death as this monumental, mythic thing that coexists surreally with the mundane world of council bin collections and neighbours hanging out their washing. Death, once it has decided to capture us, descends with the inevitability of gravity. Considering herself too sane for prophecies, Perry nonetheless notes that, as her father-in-law walked towards her shakily and confusedly in Norwich’s market square, she “knew immediately, with the cool and perfect certainty of arithmetic, that he was more or less a dead man”. The 48 days he then takes to die make her see that “death has a duration and an amplitude, with events as various and strange as those of a life”.Along the way, the book becomes about something else – the care gifted by strangers who arrive miraculously, via form filling and phone calls, and then vanish for ever. Nurses and carers, with accents ranging from West Africa to Norfolk, turn up at the house to administer painkillers, fit syringe drivers or just keep the night watch over a dying man. Perry’s experience with doctors is more mixed. It makes her wonder at how “no other occupation entailed acts of service that sometimes resembled love, all carried out with such an extraordinary asymmetry of power”. One medic, shrugging at her while expertly tossing banana peel into the bin and then inserting something illegible on a form, stuns her with his insensitivity. But her anger quickly evaporates as she realises that this is just everyday thoughtlessness dizzily colliding with the brutal logic of mortality.Perry balks at the well-meaning phrase “dignity in dying”. Her father-in-law’s dying feels so unavoidably undignified, a matter first of confusion and fear, then immobility and incontinence. But the dying body, as she describes it – the desiccating lips and hands, the skin the colour and texture of vellum parchment, the labourer’s hands now resembling “those of a Russian pianist” – is also transfiguring. She watches David change hour by hour into someone else entirely, a diminished but more majestic self. Dying emerges as both ordinary, almost like an unpleasant chore to be negotiated, and unfathomably strange – “these things not cancelling each other out as they ought to have done, but persisting in undiminished quantities, like a failure of simple maths”.As a young, aspiring writer, Perry yearned for dramatic, painful experiences to give her something to write about. She wanted, she says, “to hoard rubies and lose them, and spill ink into the loss”. But here she has written beautifully and compellingly about the life of an unexceptional man, and an experience that is coming to all of us – and shown that there is no such thing as an ordinary life, or an ordinary death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The iconic photograph of a young woman screaming as she kneels over the body of a peer came tosymbolise the political and cultural divides that still shape US politics, while the event was immortalised in the song Ohio by Neil Young.But just 10 days after Kent State, another campus shooting – this time of two black studentsby the police at Jackson State– went relatively unnoticed. It’s a juxtaposition the artist Naeem Mohaiemen brings to bear in his new film installation, Through a Mirror Darkly, at London’s Albany House.“Kent State was larger than life, it was talked about all the time,” says Mohaiemen, who came to the US from Bangladesh in 1989 to attend Oberlin College. “It took me another 15 years to hear about Jackson State. It just hadn’t been part of the conversation.Naeem Mohaiemen: Through a Mirror, Darkly review – America on the brink as Tricky Dicky rides againRead more“What struck me was the fact that there have been many student deaths around the world, but none of them have had this level of memorialisation. That different lives have different resonances.”Mohaiemen’s “three-channel” documentary combines archival footage and contemporary recordings to contrast the prominence of one tragedy over another. It also examines the Nixon administration’s subsequent deployment of a narrative of “communist infiltration” of American universities.“The US government used the student deaths to say campuses are out of control, we need more law and order. I wanted to make a film about all of that,” he says.Mohaiemen was born in London in 1969, grew up in Dhaka, and now lives in New York. His research-led practice has repeatedly led him back to the 70s, including in another three-channel film, Two Meetings and a Funeral, which wasnominated for the Turner Prize in 2018.View image in fullscreen‘What struck me was the fact that there have been many student deaths around the world, but none of them have had this level of memorialisation,’ says Mohaiemen.Photograph: Thierry Bal/PR“It’s a decade I describe as ‘now promise, now danger’,” he says. “You feel very hopeful that a transformative system will emerge, and suddenly things get reversed. It’s the last period in many countries where there’s a hope for a socialist or left progressive government, but 1979 really transforms all of that – the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Iranian revolution, the rise of Thatcher, the beginning of Ronald Reagan’s election campaign.”Despite the film being based on events of more than five decades ago, there are resonances for modern audiences – including the pitting of educated “bums” against the working class (after Kent State, a large group of construction workers taunted and attacked anti-war protesters in New York’s Hardhat Riots). If headlines from recent weeks prove anything, it’s that such polarisation has not improved.The Nixon administration went through two waves, Mohaiemen says, beginning with contrition and quickly evolving into reproach. “Suddenly, the problem was that the campuses had been taken over. It was seen as a more effective strategy, certain blue collar voters could be peeled away from the Democrats. Class resentment was mobilised: hard workers versus lazy students.”Mohaiemen cites Mark Twain when he says: “History doesn’t exactly repeat, but it rhymes. You see certain patterns repeating, though they’re of a different velocity. Now we have these little devices that we’re dependent on. One side of that is: ‘I’m bypassing the mainstream media censors and getting the real story.’ That’s very true. [Technology] has emancipated a generation and allowed them to organise. But the other side is that it can also put you in this tunnel of only listening to people who reinforce your own beliefs.”Mohaiemen notes other differences between the university campuses of 1970 and today.“In 1970, calling someone a communist was a very important thing. Disloyalty could be defined as adherence to the Soviet Union. “But the demographics of US campuses have changed – due to international students and the changing population. Today, there’s a casual Islamophobia that has become acceptable. A new internal enemy always has to be manufactured.”For the artist, the dog whistles being deployed now include the Democratic party’s response to Zohran Mamdani’s bid for New York mayor. “It’s quite outrageous that it’s taken them this long to endorse him – even though he’s the most energetic new politician in the New York landscape and has brought out record numbers of first-time voters. It’s not accidental that [Andrew] Cuomo keeps mispronouncing his name. It indicates that he’s fundamentally foreign.”Through a Mirror Darkly was commissioned and produced by Artangel, which has previously generated prominent large-scale projects with the likes of Jeremy Deller, Steve McQueen and Rachel Whiteread. It is possible to take away an optimistic message from the work: that despite previous divisions US democracy did not end up collapsing (and the free press helped ensure Nixon’s presidency ended in disgrace).“After Nixon there was a pendulum swing,” Mohaiemen says. “I don’t know what similar thing is ahead. But I’m always hopeful that people try a very conservative far-right experiment and then realise things aren’t that straightforward.”Explore more on these topicsArt and designExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When we meet her, Kyla MacDougall has a frightening self-assurance. Played by Yolanda Mitchell, she is teasing, provocative and mercurial. It is all her nerdy classmate Jamie Sheldon can do to answer in complete sentences. Played by Testimony Adegbite, he is cautious and scared.It turns out he is not the only one. The more Kyla threatens Jamie, the more it becomes apparent that, while he is trapped in a tough corner, the real victim is her. Jamie has witnessed a sexual assault at a party and is earnestly committed to telling the truth. Kyla wants him to retract his police statement. If he claims to have lied, he will take the pressure off her friends, Ryan, Stevo and Paulie, teenagers under the influence of online misogyny. She, in turn, will win their favour.The girl who behaves as the boys’ emissary is actually the subject of their violence. Not that she can admit as much. Kyla sees being ostracised as a greater threat than being abused. In this way, Nixon draws out the contradictory emotions not only of teenagers trying to fit into a world where the pressure to conform is real and the urge to do the right thing is abstract, but also of a young woman trying to make sense of being raped.Gillian Argo’s chequered set reflects the mental chess game they are playing. A red ribbon scars the stage like the slash of a knife, as if cutting through their ability to think ahead. The term “cheapo” describes a trick to lure a chess opponent into making a losing move. The play, under the lively direction of Guardian critic Brian Logan, is a slippery to-and-fro of strategy, speculation and cunning, as the teenagers search for options to escape what feels like the inevitable checkmate, but might just go beyond a binary black and white.AtÒran Mór, Glasgow, until 4 October.

Rhythmic gasps and hoots from the dancers build a sonic matrix in which the work unfolds. There’s a physical matrix too, the ensemble forming lines, circles and grids from which solos, duets and trios emerge. It’s as if air itself had become a 3D maze, the dancers wriggling through its pathways without touching the sides, or each other. The feel is studious, both in the dancers’ rehearsal-studio attire and in the compositional exactitude. On the almost empty soundtrack, an occasional lo-fi hum will swell and subside. It’s layered and limpid, as subtle as it is incisive: Forsythe choreographs not only the stage, but also our attention.Undertainment was one of the most anticipated pieces at the 2025Lyon Dance Biennale, where Ioannis Mandafounis’s Lisa similarly set up clear structures within which the dancers improvise. This work, too, feels alert and alive. Yet where Forsythe is spare, Mandafounis is profuse: 1930s costumes, an onstage pianist (Gabriele Carcano) playing swirls of Fauré, poetry by Osip Mandelstam voiced in several languages, a tumble of turbulent dancing that echoes the piano’s splashing sonorities and feels full of ungraspably fleeting stories. Mandafounis’s method is generative, and the dancers are breathtaking in it; yet sometimes you feel a good edit might give the material more shape.View image in fullscreenSubtle and incisive … William Forsythe’s Undertainment.Photograph: Dominik MentzosÀ l’Ombre d’un Vaste Détail, Hors Tempête by Christian Rizzo also features a poetic text (by Célia Houdart), and though this sets the mutable mood it also pulls focus from choreography brimming with poetry of its own. It’s a shadowy work that seems almost to dawn upon the stage, dark figures gaining clarity as they traverse the space, hands sometimes passing amicably across shoulders. Scenes form and fade: a daisy-chain of linked gestures and steps; ripple effects and counterpulls; coils and recoils of action and energy. It’s all connotation and suggestion, yet never vague: the dancers are poised and precise, on a human scale, and the choreography offers coherence without conformity.Conformity – the adherence to group rules – was at stake in some other works at the biennale.About Lambada by Collectif ÈSdeconstructs the lascivious dance into two trios, one group sticking rigorously to the rhythm while the other is all about keeping bodily contact with each other. The play between the regimented and the organic is clever, but thin – certainly not strong enough to carry the weight of history on a video projection that mashes the libidinous energies of the hit lambada song with the fall of the Berlin Wall.View image in fullscreenDownbeat chorus line … Jan Martens’ The Dog Days Are Over.Photograph: Stefanie NashMuch more interesting – also exasperating and enlivening – is BelgianJan Martens’ revival of his 2014 work The Dog Days Are Over. A slight bounce in the knees leads a line of dancers in somewhat grungy gym clothes to start jumping on the spot. That is basically it, for 70 minutes (talk about sticking to rules), though they do swivel and shift place, evolve into side and backsteps, add some arms, and even stay still – though the pauses are as much an exercise in endurance as the bounces. This is a determinedly downbeat chorus line – no high kicks, no showtime – and you either submit to its regime, as the dancers must, or you don’t. Unlike 20th-century minimalist dance, which was interested in patterns, this relentless minimalism is about endurance and survival. What does it achieve? Respect for its dogged tenacity, discomfort with its spectacle of regulation and exhaustion. You can’t exactly like it, but it will probably make you think.F*cking Future, a big, bold and indeed beautiful new show by the Portuguese artist Marco da Silva Ferreira is easier to like though strangely superficial. The eight dancers are highly watchable, as is their stylistically freewheeling blend of steps; they’re also a mix of races and gender identities. But it’s mostly formation dancing, and the performers are oddly uniform: lithe and youthful in identikit shiny pants and backless tops. It feels like conformity masked by glow-up effects, and marshalled towards a saccharine finale. To be fair, Ferreira knows his aims (he talks about the military and the militant body, one repressive, the other liberatory), but it feels as if the insurgent energies of his previous work, Carcaça, had been packaged and marketed as F*cking Future.View image in fullscreenLooming future … Último Helecho.Photograph: Nina LaisnéFrançois Chaignaud has often brought the past into the present, and does so again in Último Helecho, alongside the music director Nina Laisné and the Argentine singer Nadia Larcher. The future – that is, death – also hangs over the performance, particularly in Spanish songs evoking the sorrows and the caperings that constitute life before death. Hybridising European baroque and South American folk styles, the piece spirals around Larcher and Chaignaud (both dance, both sing, both wear costumes that resemble ornamented exoskeletons), backed by a troubadourish band and a set design of bony granite. In other hands it might appear arch and affected; here, the performers – Chaignaud in particular, a classy and truly singular talent – imbue even the most stylised gestures with numinous significance.Elsewhere, Repertório No 2 by Afro-Brazilians Davi Pontes and Wallace Ferreira (who come to London’s Dance Umbrella festival in October) addresses the hierarchies and stereotypes that, like it or not, sit within and alongside us in the performance arena. Naked throughout, Pontes and Ferreira eyeball the audience and each other, and after a regimented stomping sequence (conformity again) they strike a pose. The cycle repeats, the poses becoming variously sexualised, abject or showy, and increasingly mingled with the audience. Stark as well as starkers, it has the feel of an art installation, more concerned with iconography than choreography.“Against the violence that pervades the world, dance as an act of freedom,” proclaimed the biennale’s own headline to preface this year’s edition, a sentiment that echoes its founding principles in 1984. After my return to London, I learned that on the penultimate night of the biennale, three of its invited artists had been racially abused and attacked in Lyon by a group of men, who reportedlyinvoked the name of Trump. People have rightly beenshocked and appalled, but can we truly count ourselves as surprised, in the current climate?La lutte continue.Selected productions from the festival areon touruntil 17 October.

Now, reforming her group after more than 30 years, James recalls her painful path through through the music business, surviving ‘Harvey Weinstein-type’ situations, and working with punk’s finestWed 1 Oct 2025 06.47 EDTShareBy 1989, Wendy James and her pop-rock band Transvision Vamp had reached the UK No 1 spot with their second album, two of their singles had been in the top five, and James, with her peroxide blond hair and fondness for lingerie and leather, had crossed the pop-rock divide as a cover star for both Smash Hits and NME. “I thought I was going to be bigger than Madonna,” she says, “and I was pretty sure I was going to win an Oscar.”Instead, everything unravelled within two years: the band split up after their third album was poorly received, and James vanished from the public eye for a decade. She later built a solo career, and hasn’t wanted to revisit the past. “Everyone fucking reforms,” she says, sat in a cafe in Toulouse close to where she has lived for the past five years, wearing a black velvet jacket with that blond hair in a high messy bun.But Transvision Vamp have indeed reformed for their first tour in three decades, due to begin in Australia in February. She didn’t have a bass player for this autumn’s solo tour, so she asked former Transvision Vamp bassist Dave Parsons if he’d do it. Though the other members aren’t on board, the pair have now decided to reclaim the band name. “Somehow it didn’t bother me any more,” James says of that name. “I just said yes – it could be the start of a great adventure.”We said, ‘We’re going to be the biggest band in the world: give us a record deal!’Adopted at the age of one and raised in a middle-class family in Brighton, James began her musical adventures by buying the Sex Pistols’ Never Mind the Bollocks aged 10, and at 14 she went to see the Clash at the Brighton Centre. “I was up at the barrier,” she recalls. “I remember the passion and the power – it felt like freedom.” She left home on her 16th birthday with £100 and a toothbrush, “absolutely fearless, ready for all of it”.James met guitarist Nick Christian Sayer in a Brighton bar in 1986 and they formed Transvision Vamp the following year. They marched into the offices of EMI and demanded to see Dave Ambrose, the executive who had signed Sex Pistols. “We said: ‘We’re going to be the biggest band in the world, give us a deal.’ It wouldn’t happen now, but the lady at the front desk ushered us up to his room.” James played Ambrose their demo and he gave them five days in a studio to flesh the songs out, including their first single, Revolution Baby. The band were soon gathered round the receptionist’s radio to hear the song’s first play on Radio 1 – “A mind-blowing concept: millions of other people hearing it at exactly the same time.”I was told to apologise if I wanted to ever go back on Going LiveFusing Bolan with Blondie by way of the New York Dolls and Sex Pistols, the band scored hits including I Want Your Love, Baby I Don’t Care and Landslide of Love, as well as Brit award nominations and regular slots on Top of the Pops. James the third “most fanciable female” in Smash Hits’ 1989 readers’ poll, but the Face dubbed her “the woman everybody loves to hate” and Time Out included her in its 1990 Hated 100 list. On television, meanwhile, she was often patronised by older male interviewers. The BBC’sFrank Bough“came at me a few times”, she says, referring to his derisive tone. “It made me think: ‘Who the fuck are you?’”When James casually admitted on the BBC children’s show Going Live that she was not wearing underwear, she was hauled up to the show’s producers. “I was told to apologise if I wanted to ever go back on,” she remembers, “so I said: ‘I’m so sorry if this disturbed your children’s broadcasting, but the kids didn’t care.’” At the opposite end of the spectrum, she was contacted byJean-Jacques Beineix, director of cult film Betty Blue (who died in 2022). James flew to meet him for lunch. “That was a little bit lewd,” she says. “He wanted to know how willing I was to be naked. In almost every scene. It was more the Harvey Weinstein type of audition.”View image in fullscreenJames performing with Transvision Vamp in 1989.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesTransvision Vamp remained “part of the zeitgeist at the end of the 80s and into 1991”, she says. As well as topping the UK charts, they broke into the Australian Top 10 and gained traction in the US. “But then grunge was coming, and east coast hip-hop, and rave.” Their label was so unimpressed with third album Little Magnets Versus the Bubble of Babble that it was not even released in the UK.James moved to the US to pursue a solo career. One day she was at the bar of the Sunset Marquis hotel in Hollywood when she spotted Pete Thomas, drummer with Elvis Costello, and asked if Costello might be interested in writing a song for her. Thomas suggested she write him a letter, which she did on headed hotel notepaper. “When I got back to England, there was a cassette popped through my mailbox.”This was Now Ain’t the Time for Your Tears, a whole album that Costello and his then partner, former Pogues bassist Caitlín O’Riordan, had written together for James in a single weekend. David Bailey was hired to shoot the cover portrait. “I was massive, and Elvis was one of the most famous musicians in rock’n’roll: what’s not to like?” Her record label, she says, “thought we would just ride this baby straight to the bank”. But it only reached No 43 in the charts. What went wrong? “The content of the music,” she says.She mentions Puppet Girl, which starts with the lines: “Hey there little puppet girl, how’d you learn to talk that way? / Hey there little puppet girl, who put the mouth in all the things you say?” Costello, she claims, “definitely had a concept of me as this silly little blond thing that’s trying to make it”. She accuses him of writing “a male cliche of what idiots young female pop stars are. It was quite nasty – he was asking me to sing derogatory stuff about myself, or this concept of myself.”I ask Costello for his take. He says the songs were “clearly written as a satire of the way contemptuous pop managers and moguls regard pop stars, particularly young women … It was a role to inhabit, in which the star was mocking tormentors by going to even greater extremes, making fun of her hit parade rivals and reading her own bad reviews.” He says the production on Now Ain’t the Time for Your Tears ended up having “all the punch of a sock full of cold rice pudding”, but “Ms James’s excellent delivery was the album’s sole redeeming feature … I’ve only ever met Ms James once and then very briefly but I thought she must by now have developed a sense of humour about this business that we call show. I fear I might have been wrong.”There’s a line of spunky, independent-minded, warrior-like young female pop stars. I think Miley Cyrus took a look at meAfter the commercial disappointment of Now Ain’t the Time for Your Tears, James retreated from releasing music. When she wasn’t having dinner with Bob Dylan and Van Morrison (“Van and I were good comrades for a while”) or hanging out with Bono in Dublin (“He was very protective and encouraging during that Elvis period”), she was living in Ladbroke Grove with her then boyfriend, ex-Clash guitarist Mick Jones.James did not release any music for a decade: were these her wilderness years? “I like to think of them as my industrious years,” she counters. “I was learning how to write songs. Normally you would do that as a teenager in your bedroom and then make it, but I did it the other way round.” She returned in 2004, releasing two albums with the group Racine and then four solo albums including 2016’s The Price of the Ticket, for which her backing band included a Pistol (Glen Matlock), two Stooges (Steve Mackay and James Williamson), a Bad Seed (James Sclavunos) and Lenny Kaye, a member of the Patti Smith Group. “I had known Glen since I was a teenager, I met James Sclavunos in a bar at the Bowery Hotel, Lenny lived two streets from me in New York and I contacted James Williamson on Facebook – all people that caused me to want to be a musician in the first place.”View image in fullscreen‘Completely unplanned’ … James today.Photograph: David Leigh DoddAfter 17 years in New York, James went to France to housesit for a friend, “and ended up staying. It was totally random and not planned at all.”She says she sees herself in Gwen Stefani, and “I think Miley Cyrus has had a look [at me]. There’s a continuous path of kind of spunky, independently minded, fearless young females that are warriors.” She speaks with pride about her solo albums, and while they haven’t had the impact of Transvision Vamp, “I don’t miss the clamour of people’s adulation. The only difference [not being famous] has made is that I have to book my own flights and find my own way to the airport.”Supporting the Jam, sausages with the Bay City Rollers and defying skinheads: post-punk girl group Dolly Mixture look backRead moreThere will be plenty of that with tour dates in Australia and Spain already confirmed for next year, more countries being planned, and maybe even another album. Joining the reformed Transvision Vamp alongside her and Parsons are Sclavunos and Thurston Moore collaborator Alex Ward, and James says she’s not in it for the money: “I’m not the wealthiest person in the world, but I’m by no means the poorest either. This was completely unplanned but I have great hopes for it. In the old days, my pinnacle was always to play Madison Square Garden, but this time, who knows. The potential is massive. All I know is that whatever the size of venue, I am going to walk off stage feeling exhausted, exhilarated and knowing I gave it everything.”The Wendy James Band begin their UK tour on 1 October.

But apparently he wasn’t right for the partWed 1 Oct 2025 07.46 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 13.46 EDTShareIn November, the biggest celebrity memoir of the year will be published. We Did OK, Kid promises to tell the life story of SirAnthony Hopkins, and anyone with even a passing knowledge of the man will know that it’s a hell of a story. Born working class, he was hauled out of repertory theatre after being spotted by Sir Laurence Olivier, a move that set him on a course to the stars. Sir Richard Attenborough called him “unquestionably the greatest actor of his generation”. He has battled depression and alcoholism. He can do a mean Tommy Cooper impersonation. His publisher promises that Anthony Hopkins will tell this story with “a voice that is both arresting and vulnerable”.That is, unless you listen to it on audiobook. Because Kenneth Branagh’s doing that bit.On Tuesday,Variety reportedthat Branagh – not Hopkins – will read the audiobook version of We Did OK, Kid. In statements, Branagh said that “Anthony Hopkins’s memoir is searingly honest. His astonishing personal journey and professional triumphs are shared with rare insight and emotion. It was a privilege to speak the inspiring words of a humble man and a genuine master.” Which isn’t to say that the voice of Hopkins will be entirely absent from the recording since, according to Variety, when the book is finished Hopkins will read “over a dozen of his favourite poems in his instantly recognisable Welsh cadence”.Which is something. But this news may well stir complicated feelings in potential readers. On one hand, Kenneth Branagh is an extremely high class choice for an audiobook narrator. Before you’ve even heard it, you can imagine the power, the subtlety of tone, that he’ll be able to bring to Hopkins’s story. It’s a testament to their friendship – a friendship that helped convince Hopkins to star in Thor – that Branagh agreed to do this.What’s more, Hopkins is 87 years old. The thought of spending a couple of days in an airless recording studio drily reading back his own words, wincing over sentences that it’s far too late to correct, is a galling prospect for anyone, but someone pushing 90 should be forgiven for wanting to spend their days doing something less laborious.Plus, for the bulk of authors, it doesn’t really matter who does the audiobook. For example, I haven’t narrated a single one of my audiobooks. Katie Leung from the Harry Potter films did one of my kids’ books, and another – a fairly personal book about my experience of hair loss – was read by a professional recording artist called Graham Mack, who has a full head of hair. In both cases, they did a much better job than I could have done.However, the reason they did better than me is because I am not the greatest actor of my generation Sir Anthony Hopkins. If I was the greatest actor of my generation Sir Anthony Hopkins, I would have smashed those audiobooks out of the bloody park. Listeners would have heard the depths of my sincerity and the weight of my gravitas as I growled out the tragic tale of a funny elephant.And this, I suspect, is what listeners of We Did OK, Kid will probably want. Not just the story of Anthony Hopkins told by Anthony Hopkins, but the sound of Anthony Hopkins at full tilt; wringing out every drop of nuance and emotion that might have been missed had they simply chosen to read it in their heads.That said, those who do read the book themselves may well find themselves doing it in Anthony Hopkins’s voice, since it’s so recognisable and distinct. Which begs the question; is Kenneth Branagh going to do the voice? As anyone who has seen Tenet or his Poirot films can attest, the man knows his way around an accent. Might it be the case that he decides to read We Did OK, Kid in an exaggerated Welsh accent to make up for the absence of the author? In reality, the chances of this are slim. But wouldn’t it be amazing?Either way, this is likely to be one of the last times you will hear of an issue like this. We live in an age where everybody fromMichael ParkinsontoAgatha Christieis being pulled back from the dead, their voices reanimated by AI. Had Hopkins chosen to publish We Did OK, Kid a year or two from now, it isn’t impossible to imagine that the audiobook would have been read aloud by an uncanny AI approximation of his own voice. Compared with that, Branagh will do just fine.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnthony HopkinsKenneth BranaghAutobiography and memoirAudiobookscommentShareReuse this content"

To celebrate we look back over the remarkably rich, radical – and sometimes risqué – career of an actor best known for tucking up children in the mid 1960sPamela HutchinsonWed 1 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 10.14 EDTShareDame Julie Andrews, so crisply accented, sweetly tuneful and girlish in her most famous movie musicals, has always had a sense of humour about her angelic image. She won the 1965 Oscar for playing a “practically perfect” English nanny for Walt Disney, but that didn’t stop her from driving around Los Angeles with a “Mary Poppins Was a Junkie” bumper sticker on her car. Or telling journalists that “I hate the word wholesome”, and her Hollywood nickname was “the nun with the switchblade”. Andrews turns 90 today, one of the most beloved of Hollywood stars, with one of cinema’s most astonishing voices. She can look back on a fascinating film career that includes such sweet spoonfuls of sugar as Mary Poppins (1964) andThe Sound of Music(1965) to The Princess Diaries (2001), but just as many films that are explicit, dark, or just plain surprising.The Sound of Music at 60: a flawed but enduring cultural touchpointRead moreAndrews grew up in the blitz. She was born in Surrey in 1935, but moved to London. As a little girl she warbled to her neighbours during air raids, but it was when her stepfather gave her singing lessons that the full extent of her talent was discovered. At the age of eight, Andrews had an adult larynx, and a clear soprano voice with a four-octave range. She later joked that “dogs would come from miles around”, but she was a phenomenon, with a voice of impeccable musicality and clarity. Andrews started out in music hall, and did the Royal Variety Performance when she was only 13, before getting regular work at the BBC. Broadway called while she was still a teenager, first in The Boy Friend, then she was the original Eliza Doolittle in Lerner and Loewe’s musical take on Pygmalion, My Fair Lady. She was a showstopper, and an even bigger hit once she toned down the cockney for American ears. Andrews would always be known for her immaculate diction as much as her euphony, the kind of singer who enjoyed the lyrics as much as the melody – which showed in her delivery.View image in fullscreen‘Dogs would come from miles around’ … Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins (1964), for which she won an Oscar.Photograph: Disney/Kobal/ShutterstockThe tale is well worn that Jack Warner rejected Andrews for the movie version of My Fair Lady in favour of a bigger star, Audrey Hepburn, who had to be dubbed for the songs. It’s forever to Andrews’ credit that she was cheeky enough to thank him on stage at the Golden Globes for freeing her up to doMary Poppins. World domination fell neatly into place after Andrews embodied Maria, the sweetly rebellious nun in megahit musical The Sound of Music. But in between, Andrews tried to shake off typecasting before it began, by starring in D-day comedy-drama The Americanization of Emily (1964). No songs, lots of love scenes – and she slaps James Garner round the face. A precedent was set. Andrews was as keen on edgy material as much as the next 1960s film star – albeit one with cut-glass vocals and perfect pitch.After working with Hitchcock on Torn Curtain (1966) and a couple of musical flops, Andrews spent most of the 1970s working in TV. But she continued to expand her range with her second husband, director Blake Edwards: The Tamarind Seed (1974) is a romantic spy thriller and 10 (1979), a sex comedy that has her married to a lascivious Dudley Moore. The pair of films they made at the outset of the 1980s really proved Andrews was willing to push the boundaries of her persona. She was brave to play a squeaky-clean film star sexing up her image in S.O.B. (1981), but she’s really, really good, making the most of her androgynous looks, in Victor/Victoria (1982), a queer musical farce about a singer who masquerades as a man, a remake of a German film from the 1930s. Andrews, it turned out, was game for on-screen nudity, and looked exceptionally hot in drag. Plus, she could still make a hit: Victor/Victoria was a runaway success and remains a cult favourite.View image in fullscreenCult favourite … Julie Andrews in Victor/Victoria (1982), directed by Blake Edwards.Photograph: Cinetext/Mgm/AllstarThere was a shock ahead of her, prefigured by two of her dramatic films from the 1980s. In That’s Life! (1986) she plays a singer waiting to find out whether she has throat cancer. In the terrific Duet for One (1986) she is a concert violinist with a philandering husband who is thrown into a breakdown by her career-ending MS diagnosis – and distracts herself by hopping into bed with Liam Neeson’s rag-and-bone man. As she baldly tells her psychologist Max von Sydow, “I’m fucking a totter!” In real life, in 1997, botched surgery on her vocal cords more or less ended Andrews’ singing voice, and she would rarely sing on screen again.Julie Andrews: ‘I was certainly aware of tales about the casting couch’Read moreThe indefatigable Andrews, made a dame in 2000, made another fresh start in her 60s. Playing the sassy regal grandmother in The Princess Diaries was both a valid comeback vehicle – she even sang in the sequel – and the perfect comic outlet for her refined pronunciation. She followed this up with more PG voiceover work in the Shrek and Despicable Me films.A generation of 60s kids grew up with Mary and Maria, and hung around to embrace the risque kicks of the Edwards years. Yet again Andrews has carried a new cohort of gen Z fans with her, as she now slyly narrates Netflix’s raunchy regency drama Bridgerton – every consonant of Lady Whistledown’s wicked whispers impeccably articulated. The most formidable voice in the movies, still as sweet, but also as sharp, as ever.This article was amended on 1 October 2025.

You know, I hear he has like 10 Playboys under his mattress.”Hegseth encouraged the generals to “tell it like it is in plain English, to point out the obvious things right in front of us”.Colbert then pointed out the obvious: “OK, you suck monkey butt.”Jimmy KimmelJimmy Kimmelalso touched on the government shutdown on Tuesday night. “Democrats want Republicans to agree to continue funding the Affordable Care Act, whereas Republicans want to use that money to add crab legs to the omelet station at Mar-a-Lago,” he explained. “And Trump is threatening to make irreversible cuts if there’s a shutdown.”“I was recently the victim of a government shutdown – they are reversible, I will tell you that,” he added.Kimmel then mocked Hegseth’s mandatory meeting with generals in Virginia. “All the top military leaders were pulled off the frontlines in Portland and Washington DC and summoned to Quantico for a pep talk with Pete,” he said before a clip of Hegseth boasting: “If our enemies choose foolishly to challenge us, they will be crushed by the violence, precision and ferocity of the war department. In other words, to our enemies: FAFO.”“He’s so awesome,” Kimmel deadpanned. “That was some speech. Usually when a big group of people gather in one room for Pete Hegseth, it’s an intervention.”“But this was a no mercy type of affair,” as Hegseth said he’d do away with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the military, as well as “dudes in dresses” and “fat troops”.“It’s completely unacceptable to see fat admirals and generals in the halls of the Pentagon and leading commands around the country and the world,” Hegseth said. “It’s a bad look.”Kimmel responded with a clip of Trump lumbering about. “I love the idea that Trump is lecturing these guys on fitness,” he laughed. “I mean, if that isn’t the fondue pot calling the kettle fat, I don’t know what is.”The Daily ShowPete Hegseth will text secret war plans, but he prefers to do his body-shaming face-to-facepic.twitter.com/gGoiejxKWQ— The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow)October 1, 2025On the Daily Show, Ronny Chieng also poked fun at Hegseth’s ominous mandatory meeting with US generals. “Listen, we all do weird things when we’re drunk, ok?” he joked. “Some of us slide into an ex’s DMs, and some of us call every US general to a meeting at Quantico.”Chieng then played clips from Hegseth’s tirade against “fat troops”, which he called a “bad look”.“That’s what you called all these generals in for? To tell them they’re fat?” he wondered. “Couldn’t you just leave some passive aggressive comments on their Instagram? Like ‘hey, congrats general, when are you due?’”“This guy will text secret war plans, but when it comes to body shaming, he’s like ‘I want to see their fat faces when I tell them how fat their faces are.’”“Look, I get the military needs to be fit,” Chieng continued. “But in defense of fat generals, they’re kind of like coaches, right? Coaches don’t need to be fit enough to play the sport, they just have to fit enough to date a 24-year-old,” he said next to a photo of Bill Belichick, the former New England Patriots head coach, and his girlfriend Jordon Hudson.Hegseth also said he’d ban beards or long hair. “According to Pete Hegseth, America’s military standards are now going to be indistinguishable from a Grindr profile – no fatties, no facial hair, and get those ladies the fuck out of my sight,” Chieng joked.Seth MeyersAnd on Late Night,Seth Meyersrecapped Trump’s meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the White House on Monday, where he told reporters that he’s very confident he could quickly achieve a peace deal in Gaza. “Dude, you said within 24 hours nine months ago, ‘quickly’ is no longer in the cards,” Meyers laughed. “That’s like James Cameron saying ‘Avatar 4 is coming quickly.’”“This from the guy who couldn’t even end the war in Portland,” he joked, referring to Trump sending national guard troops to Portland for no reason.Trump also told NBC News that he would imagine that the justice department is investigating the former FBI director, Christopher Wray, “then he winked so hard at Pam Bondi that his hair popped up like a garbage can lid,” Meyers quipped.Explore more on these topicsLate-night TV roundupStephen ColbertSeth MeyersJimmy KimmelTV comedyComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here is what happened when I set out to turn him into a sensationRuth LawesWed 1 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 09.22 EDTShareAday at work for Mark Wardle can include accompanying cats to Hollywood film sets or high-end magazine shoots. As an “animal talent booker and fur whisperer” (a title that makes me immediately regret my own career path) Wardle manages about 60 pets, many of them cats, at the pet influencer agency Urban Paws.His is not a unique job. In the UK and beyond, pet influencer agencies – including one devoted to cats, Feline Stars – have begun to proliferate. The reason, Wardle notes, is simple: many of these animals now have “more reach and followers” than their human counterparts, with enough clout to land primetime TV spots. It is, after all, an industry riding the wave of a global pet economyprojected to surpass $500bnby 2030.The most famous cat influencer isNala, who was propelled to stardom by virtue of being extremely cute and cross-eyed. In 2020, she secured the Guinness World Record for having the most followers for a cat on Instagram, currently 4.4 million, and now she has her own premium cat food brand, Love, Nala. Others include Don’t Stop Meowing at 2.8 million Instagram followers and Venus the Two Face Cat at 2.2 million.These sizeable followings are also translating into cold, hard cash. Wardle tells me pet influencers with more than 200,000 followers can earn between £2,000 and £3,000 a post and £10,000 for a campaign, comprising three or four pieces of content. Accounts with millions of followers can demand “tens of thousands”, with a minimum fee of £15,000. More people than you’d expect, he adds, have now abandoned their day jobs to manage their cats’ careers, estimating you need about 200,000 followers to do so.Frankly, Wardle had me at £2,000 a post. Turning to the family cat, Olly, I no longer saw a pet, but my first serious investment portfolio. Surely, it can’t be that difficult to make him into a social media star? I begin hatching a plan to turn him into the next Nala, using tips and tricks from the experts. Seven days seems feasible in the golden age of viral content. Hopefully at least one of us will get a pension fund out of it.View image in fullscreenOlly’s natural habitat … a cardboard box.Photograph: HandoutTo maximise Olly’s chances of becoming a cat influencer, I approach Niki, who runs the Instagram accountLady Lola and her Boys(336,000 followers), documenting the lives of her 20-year-old cat, Lola, and her two adopted siblings, Teddy and George. She began posting at the start of 2024 for a more noble reason than mine: she craved a creative outlet outside her demanding corporate job.One of Niki’s first posts – asking social media users to follow Lola, then 18 years old, instead of preternaturally adorable kittens – resulted in 10,000 followers overnight. Since then, Niki has grown her cats’ following onInstagramby focusing exclusively on “gentle” content of them sleeping, playing with catnip toys and being groomed. A simple, short clip of Lola sunbathing in the garden, intended as a dopamine hit for those having a “bad day”, received more than 83,000 likes.Niki assures me it is possible to moonlight as a cat influencer. She films and edits in her spare time, “I can put together content really quickly”. Though she has supplemented her income with brand deals, onTikTok, where she has 22,900 followers, she earns “pennies”, while Instagram offers no compensation for UK creators.Still, I’d be happy to secure a brand deal for Olly, so I take Niki’s advice on board. I do have some serious limitations, though: Olly, according to my mother, is “indolent and not photogenic”.Niki, however, protests at Olly’s shortcomings and instead offers three clear USPs: he’s black, a senior and a rescue cat. She claims if I wholeheartedly lean into his “branding” my bold goal of turning him into a cat influencer in just seven days isn’t as far-fetched as it sounds.Day oneNiki recommends filming cats in their natural habitat, and this, for Olly, is an Amazon box. Hardly the makings of internet stardom, surely? But Niki insists her fanbase was built on content that’s “not snazzy, not flashy and not funny”, which very much suits me.I decide to try a trend, believing it will be a shortcut to fulfil the criteria. Lately, cats being shuffled around to Ace Hood’s Bugatti have been racking up millions of views. One feline star,My Name is Kurama, earned 2.2m views and more than 115,000 likes for her take on the trend: being dragged around in a box while wearing a wide-brimmed sunhat. So, I recreate the same video with Olly, minus the sunhat.The results are underwhelming. A few hundred pity views at best. Maybe it is the lack of a sunhat. Or maybe, as Niki suspects, following a trend is the wrong strategy. Of her 400-plus videos, she estimates only five have been based on trends.Day twoWill carving a clear niche help Olly’s prospects? Wardle thinks so. “There are fashion cats, beauty cats and food cats, as well as just general lifestyle and travel,” he tells me. Inspired, I plot Olly’s reinvention as a cat fitness influencer – a move that certainly paid off for fellow black cat,Oliver Goose, otherwise known as the “treadmill cat”. One video of his morning run racked up a staggering 23.4m views. He’s even appeared on The Kelly Clarkson Show.The catch: Olly has yet to grasp the concept of “movement” as a verb, let alone go near a treadmill. But he is very good at everyone’s favourite yoga pose, savasana (lying on your back with your arms and legs relaxed). As Olly settles onto the yoga mat, I hit record and post the footage on TikTok. The views are as low as his cardiovascular rate.View image in fullscreenDestined for social media fame … or not.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianDay threeIn search of inspiration, I scroll through social media and discoverMerv the Cat. Once a stray in LA – found in an abandoned theme park, covered in ants and drinking detergent – she is now an internet sensation, with 2.6m TikTok followers, her own range of plush toys and Hollywood representation. “I can proudly say I met my cat’s agent in Beverly Hills,” her owner Chad Jamian, an actor, tells me over Zoom. “I’ve never even met my own agent there, I don’t think.”Merv’s account is absurdist humour. Some of her most-watched videos feature a romance with Jamian’s perpetually shirtless gardener, Charles, or showcase her talent for unleashing demonic meows. Regrettably lacking a hot gardener of my own, I film Olly meowing, adding what I think are “witty” captions, casting him as a petulant aristocrat demanding boxes. When it fails to set social media alight, Jamian’s earlier advice echoes back: “Put your ego aside”.Day fourIn the morning, Olly collapses to the floor with theatrical abandon, and I know exactly how he feels. His small act of resignation, however, sparks an idea. “You can’t predict the weird things that people connect to,” Wardle reminds me. “Plus, it should be a fun hobby; you’re not trying to work your cat to death.”Could Olly’s “flop” be our breakthrough? After all, others have built entire followings out of a single quirk – much of Organic Nature Channel’s 146,000-strong audience is devoted to nothing more than his two cats loafing. Emboldened, I post Olly’s second flop of the day. The post flops. I flop. Olly yawns.View image in fullscreenCould Olly’s theatrical ‘flop’ be the breakthrough post?Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianDay fiveSometimes, simplicity is best, so I return to Niki’s advice. “What I wanted to create was just a bit of happiness,” she says. “People worry about being absolutely perfect, but it doesn’t need to be. If it’s too polished, it’s too polished.” Niki’s two most popular TikToks? Short clips celebrating Lola’s 19th and 20th birthdays – nothing fancy, just joy.I hate to admit it, but I have no idea when Olly’s birthday is. Yet I do at least feel happy when Olly comes racing towards me as I step out of the car after a day in town. I like to think he misses me, although perhaps he’s just annoyed I’ve forgotten his birthday again. The subsequent clip I post to social media performs mildly better than my previous attempts. Still no brand deal, though.Day sixOn a quiet Friday, I improbably spend my evening “rebranding” Olly. I have not fully embraced Niki’s advice, and the consequences are evident. After a quick audit, she recommends I change the account’s name and reminds me of Olly’s USPs, which I have so far neglected.It works, sort of. Olly – no longer “The Average Cat” but “The Black Senior Rescue Cat” – receives his first-ever TikTok comment. “Olly, you are a very handsome boy,” one user writes. I don’t tell Olly, though: I’m scared he’ll want to replace me with a Beverly Hills cat agent.Day sevenNow I’ve found an audience – albeit fledgling – the key, Niki advises, is to keep posting similar content. “You need a style and to be consistent with the style, because your audience will expect that,” she says.Taking this to heart, I post another video of Olly running enthusiastically towards me (this time in the garden) and, to really hammer home his USPs, I write a caption urging people not to overlook black senior rescue cats. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it becomes Olly’s most successful video to date, amassing more than 1,000 views. It feels like a win, even though it is small fry for social media.By the end of the seven days, Olly has fewer followers than my nextdoor neighbour, at 106 on TikTok and 15 on Instagram, one of whom is his vet. I am mostly to blame, as usual. Niki tells me she “thrives” on making content. I do not.Though money and internet fame are within reach for cat influencers, there are downsides, too. Now that he has millions of followers, Jamian tells me Merv’s account can be “less fun and more difficult” to manage. “Throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks is no longer a thing [when you have a following],” he says. “Now you’re like, oh man, I’ve gotta get these one, two or three things that people are really loving to get those big numbers.”Even in the seemingly innocuous world of cat influencing, trolls pervade. Jamian reveals he’s conscious of how he holds Merv on camera out of fear of being called “a bad cat dad”. “The internet will be the internet no matter what,” he sighs. “And you have to be ready for that. You cannot please everyone.”The threat of trolls, coupled with the demands of running a cat-influencing empire, are enough for me to leave Olly’s social media accounts lying dormant. As I realise this, he rolls over on the floor next to me, apparently in agreement. My online ineptitude – unimproved, even with the help of experts – may have destroyed Olly’s last shot at fame and fortune. But as he saunters over to his Amazon box and settles in I suspect he’s much happier than he would be on a film set or magazine shoot, anyway.Explore more on these topicsCatsPetsSocial mediaDigital mediaInstagramTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Start at the top with larger rollers, saving any smaller ones for the sides and lengths. Maintaining good tension for the roll is key – nervously winding the hair without tautness is, ironically, what usually causes the rollers to tangle.It’s also important to leave some hair-free space at either end of the roller to give the Velcro suitable surface grip and stability. When the hair has had a chance to shape and cool completely (the duration of a mug of tea, or the length of time it takes to throw on some makeup, by my reckoning), you can unravel the rollers and gently brush through or arrange with fingers.

To cut through the marketing gumpf, I enlisted the help of experts across various disciplines and sports to identify the technology that can truly make a difference. And surprisingly, it isn’t always the newest, most expensive releases – some aren’t even “smart”.The best fitness tech and gadgetsCyclingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: photoschmidt/Getty ImagesJake Hales, head coach atRide RevolutionPedals and shoesWhen you pedal in trainers, you’re not attached to the bike, so you end up with a very quad-dominant, pushing-down movement. When you switch to clipless pedals, your shoes are directly connected, enabling you to pedal in a more circular motion and be more efficient with your technique.It also means you’re fixed in a position on the bike, which, when set up correctly, should leave you more comfortable – on long rides, having your feet out of position can cause problems further up the chain.The most accessible clipless pedal would be a two-sided mountain bike pedal, which makes getting in and out easier, because unlike one-sided road bike pedals, you can clip in on either side. The shoe’s cleat is also flush with the sole, making it easy to walk in.View image in fullscreenRockrider mountain bike shoes£79.99 at DecathlonView image in fullscreenShimano clipless cycling pedals£27.99 at Halfords£28.62 at AmazonTurbo trainer and third-party training softwareFor the uninitiated, a turbo trainer enables you to turn your bike into an indoor training tool. Previously the reserve of only the most passionate cyclists, improvements in technology have made turbo trainers more user-friendly than ever. “The main benefits of using a turbo trainer are accessibility and having control over your environment,” says Hales.“When you’re outside, there are a lot of parameters you’ve got to work around like traffic, junctions, road conditions, etc. From a training perspective, a turbo trainer enables you to control what you do a lot more and means you can jump on the bike and follow the exact session you want to do, rather than riding out of town to get stuck in rush-hour traffic.“Also, gone are the days of just having a fixed rear-wheel turbo trainer where you stare at a wall and ride away. In the past 10 years or so, the advent of software such as Zwift or Rouvy and improved turbo trainers means we’re able to create an environment that’s slightly less boring than it was in the past.”View image in fullscreenZwiftFrom £17.99 a month at ZwiftRunningView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesDoug Stewart, head coach atTMR CoachingGPS watchA GPS watch is one of the most helpful devices you can use as a runner. The key benefit is that it records your distance and speed, allowing you to track your progress, which can be a really good motivator.If you’re following a training plan, it can help to guide your workout, telling you when to speed up or slow down. The data you’ve captured allows you to then go back and analyse your effort afterwards.I would choose a running-specific watch. The likes of Apple watches are very sophisticated, but the data isn’t always the best. Something like the Garmin Forerunner series should be very reliable.View image in fullscreenGarmin Forerunner 165 music£249 at John Lewis£289.99 at GarminView image in fullscreenGarmin Forerunner 570£459.99 at Garmin£459.99 at Runners NeedCarbon running shoesCarbon-plated shoes improve running economy; in other words, they make the runner more efficient. In scientific literature, you’ll read about theoxygen cost of running; for every stride in carbon-plated shoes, youuse less oxygen than in traditional shoes. This is because the shoe acts like a spring of sorts, providing more propulsion for every stride.There’s evidence (in academic research, but also anecdotal finish times of marathon runners) that they can help runners of all abilities, not just elite runners.There’s individual variability, however, so trying a couple of models and finding what feels comfortable for you is important. The ones that have proved to be very beneficial are the Nike Alphafly and Vaporfly, the Asics Metaspeed, and the Saucony Endorphin Pro – the latter of which seems to be more robust. Generally speaking, the Nike Alphafly and Vaporfly appear to be good for about 100 to 200 miles – there is a range based on the conditions people run in, the forces they put through them, and then also the exact model of the shoe in use.The latest Puma Fast-R Nitro Elite 3 outperformed several other shoes inacademic research, and while the research was Puma-funded and is yet to be peer-reviewed, they would be the shoes I’d recommend to someone doing a marathon in a couple of weeks. I would also recommend athletes use their race-day shoes in training for key sessions to get used to them. The challenge is the lifespan, so it’s important to rotate them with other shoes, so that they’re still good for race day.View image in fullscreenNike Alphafly 3 (men’s)£234.99 at Sports Direct£284.99 at NikeView image in fullscreenNike Vaporfly 4 (women’s)£199.99 at Sports Direct£239.99 at NikeView image in fullscreenAsics Metaspeed Edge Paris (unisex)From £211 at StockX£220 at AsicsView image in fullscreenSaucony Endorphin Pro 4 (men’s)£229.99 at SportsShoes£230 at SauconyView image in fullscreenPuma Fast R Nitro Elite (men’s)£160.89 at Runners Need£230 at PumaHeart-rate monitorIf you’re new to the sport, running by pace is fine. When you’re looking to get to the next level, though, heart rate can be useful in terms of gauging how hard you’re working, because there are so many variables that influence pace, including the terrain, incline and your choice of footwear that day.A lot of people do easy runs too hard, and hard runs not hard enough, and end up training in an unhelpful middle ground. Knowing your heart rate can be beneficial because you can set your training zones; you can then use them to guide your workout, ensuring you’re not running too hard on your easy days.Although they’re improving, I don’t think the heart-rate monitors on GPS watches are reliable when running. Having a heart-rate strap and accurate data can therefore be a real benefit. An arm-based heart-rate monitor like the Coros can be particularly useful for women because of the chafing and fitting around sports bras with chest straps. It uses the same [optical sensor] technology, but while a watch is positioned on your wrist, where there is more bone and tendons, which interfere with readings, the Coros sits higher up the arm, where there is more consistent blood flow and less chance of movement thanks to a more secure fit.View image in fullscreenCoros heart-rate monitor£68.99 at SportsShoes£69 at AmazonSwimmingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: BalanceFormcreative/Getty ImagesPhil Murphy, head coach atTotal Tri TrainingPull buoyMost people weren’t swimming at a competitive level from a young age.One of the best ways to teach these “adult-onset swimmers” is to give them pool aids that help them feel the water better and have a better body position.A pull buoy is held between the thighs and lifts the body into a nice, neutral position in the water without the need to kick, allowing you to set the catch – the point when your hand enters the water – at the start of the arm stroke. Without a pull buoy, a lot of people sink their hips and they’re unable to initiate the start of the swim stroke properly.Not all pull buoys are created equal – it’s more about the size and buoyancy of them. A lot of people think they’re cheating if they swim with a pull buoy, but they’re not. Without one, you’re making swimming very difficult for yourself, which means it’s more fatiguing.

But the beauty of smart goggles is that they know exactly when you touch the wall and when you push off, so they’re good for people who want something that can record their times and count laps without pressing buttons, meaning they can get on with swimming.Their other big selling point is that they help you analyse body position in real time. They look at your head position and how far you’re turning to breathe and give you feedback on that, so that can help people swim better.View image in fullscreenSmart Swim goggles£299 at SelfridgesTennisView image in fullscreenAlex Johansson,@tennistechieFor years, tennis lagged behind other sports in technology adoption, but that’s finally changing.

For example, with a squat, you’re going to squat with your toes leading the movement, rather than your heels.For functional training sessions, I recommend a Nike Free Metcon because of the durability and the movement pattern it offers. It allows free movement and creates a bit of tension on the actual foot, so when you do things like agility – if you’re jumping side to side – it doesn’t roll your ankle and stabilises you on landing. The same goes for a jump up: if you’re doing things like jump squats or even a lunge, that landing pattern is a lot better than when wearing a lifting or a bog-standard running shoe.View image in fullscreenNike Free Metcon 6(men’s)£99.99 at Sports Direct£119.99 at NikeView image in fullscreenNike Free Metcon 6(women’s)£71.99 at Nike£119.99 at AsosLifting beltI do a lot of hybrid training, so if I’ve gone for a long run, and then I’m lifting the next day, my hamstrings could still be activated and engaged, which can trigger the back.It’s weight-dependent, but when lifting heavy, I’d recommend using a powerlifting-graded belt – it keeps you in place and it supports the lower back by supporting the glutes and hamstrings, so there’s no overstretch. It encourages a heavier lift and prevents injury.View image in fullscreenTitan Longhorn lever belt£164 at PullumRecoveryView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AndreyPopov/Getty ImagesAileen McCann, PT and sports massage therapist,@aileenmccann_movesMassage gunA manual massage is better than a gun, but they’re great all-rounders for pre-, mid- and post-workout.

Inspired by the glut, I returned to an old favourite,my beetroot nemesis, a twist on the River Cafe’s famouschocolate nemesis cakein which I use the whole beetroot, including its candied magenta stems. Blackberries have a tendency to turn squishy, but even when they’re soft, they’re still juicy and fine to cook with. Determined not to let this bounty go to waste, I’m using some of the surplus in this heavenly, complex, adult dessert, which is rich in antioxidants and endorphin-boosting flavonoids.Blackberry nemesisAs a recipe developer of predominantly seasonal recipes, I’m always on the lookout for simple dishes that can be tweaked with the seasons. Flourless chocolate cakes have an intense flavour, yet provide a blank canvas for all sorts of additions and/or substitutions. With our hedgerows producing untold thousands of tonnes of wild blackberries annually, there’s rarely been a better time to embrace seasonal adaptations of this kind. To keep berries for longer, store them in a sealed container in the fridge with a sheet of kitchen towel in there to soak up any excess moisture.This seasonal take on the River Cafe’s chocolate nemesis has a bright acidity that cuts through the chocolate’s velvet richness, and it’s actually quite simple to make. The berries, squished into a purple puree, are stirred through melted dark chocolate and butter before being folded into whisked eggs and sugar, so aerating the cake. Everything is then baked in a bain-marie, creating a moussey, intense and complex flourless chocolate cake with a lively berry sharpness. I had a few extra blackberries, so I baked those on top to add some freshness and a welcome counterpoint to the chocolate’s deep bittern-sweetness.Chocolate is fragile and prone to split when cooked, so chop it into small pieces to help it melt evenly, and make sure the bowl is not touching the hot water in the pan below. And aim to keep the water as low as 40C – that is, about hot-bath temperature – because chocolate melts at body temperature, which is just one reason it’s so heavenly to eat. The bain-marie is not 100% essential here, but it does protect the cake from the intense heat of the oven and helps it maintain a uniform, moussey texture.Serves6180g 70%-plus cocoa dark chocolate, chopped into small pieces125g butter, or coconut butter, cut into cubes3 medium eggs150g unrefined sugar150g blackberries, plus an optional 100g extra for the toppingTo serve (all optional)Extra blackberriesLive yoghurt, creme fraiche or double creamHeat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/340F/gas 3½, line a 20cm cake tin with baking paper, then set it inside a larger solid cake tin in which it fits comfortably, for a makeshift bain-marie.Put the chocolate and butter in a bowl set over a pan of hot but not boiling water, then stir occasionally until they melt: make sure the mix doesn’t get too hot or the chocolate may split. While the chocolate is melting, whisk the eggs with the sugar for five minutes, or until they have doubled in volume.Mash or puree the blackberries, stir them into the melted chocolate, then gently fold the chocolate and fruit mix into the eggs. Pour the mix into the lined cake tin and top with the extra whole blackberries, if using. Lift the cake in its lined tin and inside the larger tin into the hot oven, then pour just-boiled water into the outer tin to come three-quarters of the way up the sides of the small cake tin. Bake for 30 minutes, or until just set, then remove and leave to cool. Cover and refrigerate the cooled cake for a few hours, then slice with a hot knife and serve with extra blackberries and something creamy.Explore more on these topicsCakeWaste notFoodFood wasteFruitAutumn food and drinkBakingChocolatefeaturesShareReuse this content"

All of which helps make our cuisine so eclectic, yet somehow also so similar right across the culinary culture.Bhaji rice with salted pork (pictured top)Spinach is often calledbhajiin the Caribbean, no doubt derived from the various Indian communities who migrated here. This is just one of the many delicious one-pot rice dishes found in our traditional cooking, and features spinach, pumpkin, coconut milk and salted pork. The latter would normally mean salted pig tail, but here I’ve used pork shoulder, because it’s a little more accessible and because it has much more meat on it and is far less fatty. You’ll need to salt it for at least two days in advance.Prep25 minSalt48 hr+Cook1 hr 30 minServes4-6For the salted pork500g pork shoulder, trimmed and cut into medium chunks2tbspfine sea salt1tbspwhite sugarFor the rice stew3tbsp olive oil, or rapeseed oil1 brown onion, peeled and finely diced3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed8okra, thinly sliced200g fresh spinach leaves, finely chopped150g pumpkin flesh, or butternut squash flesh, grated500g jasmine rice, rinsed400ml can coconut milk¾ tbsp flaky sea salt, or to taste1 tsp ground black or white pepper1 fresh bay leaf15g coriander leaves and soft stalks, orchadon benior Thai parsley, finely chopped1 scotch bonnet, split in half lengthways (if you prefer less heat, leave it unsplit)A few sprigs fresh thymePut the pork, salt and sugar in a bowl, mix to coat, cover, then put in the fridge for at least 48 and up to 72 hours, so it gets well salted.Rinse the meat to remove the excess salt, put it in a medium pan, add enough cold water to cover, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a medium simmer, leave to cook for 40-50 minutes, until the meat is nice and tender, then drain.Put the oil in a large saucepan on a medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the onions and garlic, and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes, until soft. Add the sliced okra, cook for a minute or so to soften that, too, then stir in the poached salted pork, spinach and pumpkin. Mix well and cook for just a few minutes more, just until the pumpkin takes on a little colour.Turn down the heat a little so the spinach doesn’t catch and burn, and keep stirring for a minute or so – the juices released by the meat and veg should stop the contents of the pan from drying out. Stir in the rice, pour in 450ml water and the coconut milk, then season with the salt, pepper, bay leaf and coriander.Turn up the heat to medium-high, then, once it’s bubbling away, turn down to a simmer and poke the thyme and scotch bonnet into the rice – this way, the chilli will release its heat slowly and flavour the whole pot. Cover the pan and leave to cook for 25-35 minutes, until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid and is tender and cooked through – keep checking on it occasionally. This dish is meant to be quite wet and sticky, so if the liquid gets absorbed too quickly or/and before the rice is cooked, add a little extra water.Ladle into bowls and serve hot.Fish curry with green mangoView image in fullscreenKeshia Sakarah’s fish curry with green mango.This is based on a Guyanese dish calledgilbakafish curry. It’s usually made with the fish found in the many rivers that run through the Amazon rainforest to the northern regions of Brazil, before eventually arriving at the Atlantic Ocean. I’ve used haddock to imitate the meatiness of those river fish.Prep20 minMarinate1 hr+Cook45 minServes4For the fresh seasoning1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped2 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced5-6 garlic cloves, peeled1½ scotch bonnet peppersFor the curry600g piece fresh haddockfillet, cut into four steaks4 tbsp curry powder2 tbsp amchar masala, or garam masala1 tbsp tomato paste4 tbsp rapeseed oil, or vegetable oil1 medium tomato, diced1 unripe green mango, halved, stoned and cut into skin-onslices1 tbsp tamarind paste1 tbsp sea salt, or to taste¼ tsp ground black pepperFirst make the fresh seasoning blend. Put all the onions in a mortar with the garlic and scotch bonnet, then grind to a paste (alternatively, pulse in a blender). Towards the end, add up to 60ml cold water to help make a smooth paste.Put the fish steaks in a bowl, add a third of the seasoning paste, then rub all over the fish to coat. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least an hour and up to overnight.Next, make the curry paste. Put all the remaining seasoning paste in a bowl, add the curry powder, amchar masala, tomato paste and four tablespoons of cold water, and mix well to combine.Put the oil in a large, heavy-based pan on a medium heat, then add the curry paste – take care, because it may spit. Stir-fry the paste for a couple of minutes, until it starts to smell very fragrant, most of the liquid evaporates and the oil starts to separate. Stir in the chopped fresh tomato – at this stage, the mix will release more oil and the spices may start to catch a bit, so keep an eye on things – and cook for four or five minutes, until the tomatoes soften and start to break down.Add the green mango, stir to coat, then leave to cook for a few minutes, to soften a little. Stir in the tamarind paste, salt, pepper and 300ml water, turn up the heat slightly, so the mix comes to a simmer,then leave to cook for another eight to 10 minutes.Drop the fish into the curry, along with all the seasoning from the bowl, push down gently to cover in the sauce, then leave to poach for 10-12 minutes, until it’s cooked through – don’t turn it too much or it may break up. Once the fish is cooked, the curry is ready to serve with rice or roti.Keshia Sakarahis a chef, food writer and food educator.

Sign up hereNesrine MalikWed 1 Oct 2025 07.22 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 07.23 EDTShareWhen I first started chatting with Gina and Rachel, the founders of Ebony Bonds, I was braced for a painful conversation. Ebony Bonds, founded last year, supports Black families in the UK through bereavement after baby loss. What unfolded was a conversation that was mostly about how to show your love.Rachel Burrell and Gina Reeves were inspired to found Ebony Bonds after experiencing the loss of their babies to stillbirth, and feeling unsupported and not listened to at hospitals and by other care providers. Unable to find the specific, tailored resources for support within conventional charities, the duo began with what they thought would be a small gathering.In 2023, they put out the word for a “walk and talk” for Black parents with similar experiences, and were stunned by the turnout. More than 70 people showed up, including friends and extended families of parents. They all walked for miles together along the River Thames, then ate at a Caribbean restaurant. “We didn’t expect the turnout,” Rachel tells me. “And we didn’t expect people to say, consistently, ‘When is the next one?’” As they surveyed the numbers of people chatting and dining, Gina said to Rachel: “This is pretty big.” To which Rachel replied: “It’s needed, it’s needed.”View image in fullscreenCollective validation … a ‘walk and talk’ outing to support grieving families.Photograph: Ebony BondsThe demand was there because the support was not. Families “just never had a space before to express their loss freely, without judgment, without being moved on”, Rachel says. Most importantly, Gina and Rachel noticed “similarities in people’s stories, and how similarly Black people are being treated”.For a lot of women, in particular, their help “was validation that they haven’t been going crazy. It wasn’t [just] them that felt the doctors were off, or the sonographers weren’t paying attention to them, or the nurses weren’t listening.” The group conversations were a “collective validation that this was happening to us disproportionately”.Those feelings reflect the reality for Black parents. In England and Wales, Black babies are stillbornat almost doublethe rate of white babies, and Black women in the UK havedrastically poorer maternal healthoutcomes compared with their white counterparts.While we spoke, my own recollections of dismissive hospital treatment in the UK began to tingle. When I shared some of them with Gina and Rachel, there was again, that validation. Rachel describes these experiences as repetitive. “The leading factor,” she says, “is that you’re not being listened to.”Extending nurtureView image in fullscreenIn demand … Ebony Bonds provides a space for families to express their loss freely.Photograph: Ebony BondsI ask the two founders about how they help wider families and friend groups to help parents. “It’s such a stigma where we don’t talk about these things,” Gina says. “We find it difficult within the Caribbean and African community.” But what is most helpful is the most simple, she notes: you just need to regularly check in.Rachel believes that Black families are well positioned to be supportive, despite the stigmas around “not telling people your business”. “We have conversations with grandparents who see their children in pain and don’t understand how to cope with that. But as a community we are very proactive,” she says, in how to “nurture, especially with our women.” She says that the key is to just “support someone the same way you would support as if anything else happened to them”. Bring food, fill up the house, muck in. “Just don’t act like it hasn’t happened. That’s all. You don’t always have to have the answers.”There is a tendency to bury uncomfortable conversations under the carpet, or ask people to pray. “Our thing at Ebony Bonds,” Rachel explains, “is always to acknowledge that baby and those parents, and say, ‘I’m really sorry that happened to you.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gina tells me her husband, Peter, started a group that supports Black men who have experienced loss and other traumas. It’s called NINE, which stands for theNod Is Not Enough, in reference to the male tendency to simply nod instead of engage when they have a problem.Gina’s pride in Peter overflows and she brings him into our call. “I’ve just had the phone thrown at me,” Peter says. “NINE is not only for trauma, it’s also about just being a Black man.” He wanted to “create a positive space where you know if you have a problem or a life difficulty you can reach out, and someone will help you”.“Just be there,” Peter tells men who get in touch asking how they can help loved ones. His advice is simple: just go round. Spend the night, cook, clean, bring your own family. “When you look back,” he explains, “you realise how much that helped you, how much strength it gave you.”What struck me as they spoke about themselves and the network of friends and family around those they support is how much love always surrounds the bereaved. People just need to understand how they can show it.Baby Loss Awareness Weekis from 9-15 October.Ebony Bonds offers support and events, and can be contacted here.

However, by early in the week, business travel schedules are usually confirmed or adjusted, which can free up rooms. As a result, by around Tuesday, availability is often clearer, and booking websites may reduce prices to fill those spaces for near-term bookings.If you can be flexible, booking at short notice can sometimes pay off. Many hotels and platforms operate cancellation window policies of 24-48 hours, and if people cancel close to the date, the hotel would rather sell the room than leave it empty. It is a risky gamble but sometimes you can get a great deal by booking after 6pm on the day.However, with chains such as Premier Inn and Travelodge, Linda Reynolds at Personal Travel Agents recommends booking early, as they often release “saver” rates months in advance. For example, at the time of writing, Premier Inn was advertising rooms starting from £45 a night for stays between 1 October this year and 31 January 2026.View image in fullscreenIt is worth booking early at Premier Inn and Travelodge, a travel expert says.Photograph: Lee Smith/ReutersTravelodge has a “rooms from £35 or less” offer for stays before 25 June 2026 across many locations. Looking at central Reading, for a stay starting on 11 October, there were rooms from about £27 a night. In central London, for a stay from 11-17 October, rooms were available from about £45 a night.Sites and apps such as GoogleHotels, Kayak or Trivago will send you emails letting you know when prices drop. Some, including Google Hotels, allow you to track prices over time and receive email alerts when prices drop. Additionally, they provide insights into whether current rates are higher or lower than average.If your booking is cancellable, you can check back a week or two later. Prices often fall – and then you can rebook at the lower rate.Let the train take the strainSometimes booking a package that includes train travel and the hotel on a site such as Expedia, Lastminute.com, Great Little Breaks, Hotel Direct or Trainline can work out cheaper than booking each component separately.On Hotel Direct, for example, for a two-adult trip, you could book a hotel in Cardiff for two nights at £161.57 and a return train from London Paddington. Train times and prices varied, but departing at 10.15am on 6 October and returning at 10.50am on 8 October, two tickets were £161.56 – giving a total spend of £323.13.Set controls and teach privacy: how to manage your child’s first mobile phoneRead moreBooking the same components separately would cost more: the same hotel for those dates was priced at £184, while train travel at the same time came to £212.58, giving a total of £396.58.If you are looking at packages, also look at the cost of buying separately, as sometimes it will work out cheaper.Be flexibleStaying from a Sunday until a Thursday will usually be cheaper than a break over a weekend. Also check for school holidays and local events because these will push up prices.Where you are going makes a difference, too. Reynolds says: “Sunday nights in cities are usually cheaper than Friday or Saturday nights because leisure demand dips after the weekend. In rural locations, including coastal areas, midweek (Monday to Thursday) is often cheaper than weekends, when leisure travellers arrive.”View image in fullscreenStaying at out-of-town hotels such as the Premier Inn at Edinburgh Park can be cheaper than more central stays.Photograph: Premier Inn/PAStaying just outside a city centre can save you a lot. In London, zones 2–3 (locations such as Stratford and Greenwich) are far cheaper than inner areas but are still well connected. This works in places such as Edinburgh or Manchester, too.You could get a bargain by snapping up someone else’s cancelled break. The money coachMaddy Alexander-Groutregularly uses thePlans Changemarketplace. It allows people to resell a hotel room booking if they have changed their mind. Buyers benefit from a minimum 25% discount on the original price.“In my job, I travel around the country a lot, and I regularly use the site, saving about 20% on a hotel booking direct.,” she says.Check for discountsCredit cards often have hidden benefits for cardholders. You may find that yours includes offers to use points on hotel stays. Ross Jenkins, a frequent traveller, says he has absolutely mastered booking at Radisson with his American Express card.“The saving is made by using Radisson VIP, buying points in the sale and using the booster system to get an additional discount,” he says. “I’m saving a huge amount and I’m getting a full room upgrade to a suite about 50% of the time.” He recently stayed at the Radisson RED in Glasgow and paid only £38 a night for a room that would normally be £110.Be aware that you have to pay annually for Amex membership, so check whether it will benefit you.View image in fullscreenBuying Radisson VIP points with an American Express card can bring big discounts on bookings.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersUse cashback sites such as TopCashback and Quidco, which give money back if the hotel or chain participates. Just use the site’s booking page to get the cashback into your account.The Sainbury’s Nectar and Tesco Clubcard loyalty schemes regularly have holiday offers, too. For example, you can link your Nectar account with the hotel chain Marriott Bonvoy. This lets you earn Nectar points when staying at participating Marriott hotels globally, and also convert between Marriott Bonvoy points and Nectar points. Tesco Clubcard lets you swap your vouchers for up to double their value to spend on hotel stays with partners such as Hotels.com and Best Western.Discount and voucher sites such as VoucherCodes and Hotukdeals.com often run 10-20% off deals, especially for hotel chains.Meanwhile, theHoneyapp will automatically check for discount codes on retailer sites that you visit.You may be entitled to a discount because of your job. For example, the Blue Light card provides discounts for emergency workers, teachers, armed forces and more. Best Western gives a 5% discount to cardholders. UNiDAYS, Totum and Student Beans provide discounts for students, such as 12% off easyHotels.Be loyalHotel loyalty programmes can be good even if you only ever go once. They may have an introductory offer such as a discount or a free drink and give you points, discounts or priority on offers for future stays.View image in fullscreenLoyalty schemes such as those offered by the Hilton chain can bring savings.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesEven casual travellers can get cheaper “members’ rates” or perks via schemes such as Hilton Honors and IHG One Rewards. Note how long the points last and what is included. For example, “free” or discounted nights with points may not have breakfast included.When you sign up for hotel newsletters, you often receive notice of early discounts and exclusive deals.Do your researchUsing various hotel booking platforms will give you an idea of prices, and you can then look at booking direct, which is likely to be cheaper.

There were two best actress Oscar winners in the audience (Mikey Madison, Charlize Theron) and the daughter of a third (Sunday Rose Kidman Urban) on the catwalk. There were so many K-pop stars that the teenagers of Paris had packed out the Tuileries gardens from dawn.The French first ladies Brigitte Macron and Carla Bruni, both embroiled in news-making storylines of their own, chatted in the front row. The film-maker Luca Guadagnino designed the stage set around an upside-down glass pyramid directly invoking the Louvre, that shimmering icon of modernParis.“Well,Dioris drama,” shrugged Jonathan Anderson, the 41-year-old Northern Irish designer who was making his debut, backstage before the show. Dressed as usual in jeans, navy jumper and trainers – if you saw the most impactful designer of his generation in the self-checkout queue at Tesco Metro, you wouldn’t blink an eye – Anderson was facing up to the challenge.View image in fullscreenBTS’s Jimin, K-pop star and Dior global ambassador.Photograph: Thibault Camus/APNowhere is there more pressure to deliver a new look than at the house where, in 1947, Christian Dior’s New Look collection invented the idea of fashion as news. The global sensation caused by those postwar hourglass suits, which changed the way women dressed, are the Dior origin story.And never has the pressure been more intense than in 2025, when the global luxury industry is battling a sharp downtown. All eyes were on this show – not just to reinvent Dior, but to jolt fashion itself out of its slump.Anderson’s response was to “put the elephant in the middle of the room” with an opening film by the documentary maker Adam Curtis entitled Do You Dare to Enter the House Of Dior.The five-minute Curtis fever-dream spliced mid-century couture dream-scenes with paparazzi chaos; horror movies with Marlene Dietrich; Diana, Princess of Wales, in couture with John Galliano looking absurd in a spacesuit.View image in fullscreenHuge collars and a peekaboo loafer.Photograph: NowFashion/ShutterstockLike an opening montage at a Beyoncé gig, it absorbed the hype in the room and then whipped it up further. Anderson had brought Curtis – usually to be found in the BBC archives crafting stories about Thatcherism, television and individualism – to Paris because “he is really good at rationalising, through visuals rather than words, how we got to this place politically and how we deal with it now”.That Anderson has one of the biggest brains in fashion was never in doubt; the question mark over his Dior appointment has been whether an intellectual designer who can talk for hours about ceramics and important chairs and is curating an exhibition of the Welsh painter Gwen John would do something snappy enough to light up the Dior name in the public imagination. Dior needs to reach a much bigger audience than an Adam Curtis documentary.Anderson went for the jugular by ripping up the New Look itself. The show began with a new Dior suit, telescoped cheekily upward from its elongated ladylike line so that skirts ended at the top of the thigh, where the hem of the original Bar jacket sat in 1947.View image in fullscreenMany hemlines were short.Photograph: NowFashion/ShutterstockThese knicker-skimmer skirts were in pink denim, or black leather, revealed by jackets that butterflied open at the waist. Hair hung loose, makeup was barely there. This was a Dior you could wear in Dalston.“Dior can be a bit sugary,” Anderson said. In the Dior story, “the woman is often sort of the princess”.Pretty still sells, though, even if it doesn’t make headlines. So there were confectionary counter dresses that spoke to Christian Dior’s love of flowers, with embroidered forget-me-nots and trompe l’œil hydrangea ruffles, and a reading of Byron’s She Walks in Beauty.

A loafer branded with the “O” in Dior cut out to peekaboo the foot within, a sandal exploding with silk roses.Curtis recently told The Face magazine that his films combine politics and culture because “then you can make pretentious shit entertaining”, and this is very much Anderson’s vibe. The prettiest house in Paris can speak to the current moment, he said, because “Dior was birthed out of war. It came out of trauma. It wasFrancesaying: ‘We’re back.’ And now we are living in a bizarre moment, where we feel we have no control over politics or over politicians, so we throw ourselves into other things – like fashion and celebrity.”Where the tip of the inverted pyramid touched the catwalk there was a shoebox in the house signature dove-grey. The message: yes, there are ghosts in the walls of Dior. Anderson’s job is to put them back in the box.View image in fullscreenTailoring with a quirky twist.Photograph: NowFashion/ShutterstockExplore more on these topicsDiorParis fashion weekFashion weeksParisFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or rather one “fevver”, a new plant-based product that has the look of a feather without the bird, which made its first ever appearance at the designer’s spring/summer show in Paris.“It’s weird to me that feathers being plucked from a bird are seen as delicate in fashion,” said McCartney backstage at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. “I’m trying to show that you can still have the theatre of fashion without the animal compromise.”View image in fullscreenA dress from Stella McCartney’s spring/summer 2026 show at Paris fashion week.Photograph: Nowfashion/ShutterstockMade from a plant-based material and naturally dyed, fevvers appeared in the final three looks of her collection including a sweeping off-centre lilac dress worn by the model, Alex Consani, who closed the show.The collection was called Come Together, and began with a thespian reading of the Beatles song by Helen Mirren in the centre’s main hall. Backstage, wearing a grey Stella suit, Mirren described the collection as “utterly gorgeous, particularly the gowns”.McCartney said that “growing up, [Come Together] was always John’s song” but she chose it on Tuesday night, “because there are so many double entendres – I love the slutty sex of the lyrics – but also the idea of the Stella man and the Stella woman coming together”.On the catwalk, that binary played out in a fairly prescriptive manner with big suits and high hemlines. But in reality, the clothes had mass, wearable appeal. Standouts included draped corseted gowns and micro-dresses in teal and beige fevvers “for her”. “For him” there were slouchy denim, outsized jackets sliced at the sides and swooshy wide-leg trousers, which have become a McCartney trademark.Next year, McCartney’s label turns 25 and in all that time she has never used leather, fur or skins. Last year she was able to buy back the minority stake held since 2019 by thebiggest fashion conglomerate in the world, LVMH, in order to pursue her eco-crusade independently. Still, the brand has been operating with sizable losses and shrinking revenues, which suggests the industry – and consumers – are some way from viewing sustainability as a priority. Thelatest accounts filed by the companyin spring showed a pre-tax loss of £25m in 2023 – up from £10m the previous year. She is also expected to close her Bond Street flagship shop.View image in fullscreenA suit from McCartney’s collection.Photograph: Nowfashion/ShutterstockUnlike London and Copenhagen,Paris fashion weekis not yet fur-free. Many birds are killed for their feathers, others are live plucked. In that respect, the designer has been pioneering in trying to show that ethical choices do not mean compromising on pizzazz and glamour. The collection was 98% sustainable (up from 96% in 2024) and, regardless of how well she sells, McCartney has been pivotal in shaping high fashion’s – and increasingly the high street’s – approach to using alternative materials made from peculiar things such as apples and seaweed.There is an irony that producing new clothes remains a greater environmental issue than the materials used to make them, something the industry – McCartney included – will not reckon with. But McCartney, the first designer to use vegan leather, has yet to show a collection that does not nod in some ways towards sustainability.This article was amended on 1 October 2025 to remove reported details about fevvers.Explore more on these topicsStella McCartneyParis fashion weekFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

The sea is still warm as I plunge into the turquoise waters of Čikat bay, one of the largest and most sheltered on this long, thin, knobbly island in the Kvarner Gulf.Croatia’s 19th-century Habsburg rulers were convinced that Lošinj had special healing qualities. Wandering along the tree-shaded footpath that runs all around Čikat bay and its numerous headlands, lulled by scents of pine, juniper, rosemary, sage, mint, mastic and helichrysum, I’m inclined to agree. There’s a mellowness to the air after the intense heat of high summer, and fewer people are on the beaches – although the island’s main town of Mali Lošinj buzzes with several festivals and regattas in September.Croatia Losinj island mapI’m here during the annualTaste the Mediterraneanfood festival, which has moved around Croatia over the past 13 years and has now found a home in Mali Lošinj. Guest chefs from around Europe work with local chefs to create dinners at some of the town’s restaurants, as well as hosting workshops for young culinary stars of the future.It’s a fitting location: the Kvarner region – comprising the Opatija Riviera,Rijekaand its littoral, plus islands including Lošinj, Cres, Krk and Rab – has been designatedEuropean Region of Gastronomyfor 2026 by the International Institute of Gastronomy, Culture, Arts and Tourism. Situated between the Istrian peninsula and the Dalmatian coast, Kvarner embodies the melting pot of Croatian cuisine – part Austrian, part Italian, part Balkan, and borrowing freely from its regional neighbours.View image in fullscreenThe pretty harbour of Veli Lošinj.Photograph: Miroslav Posavec/AlamyI see this on my plate atDiana Steakhousein Čikat bay, where Istrian truffles add richness to creamily cheesy Italian ravioli, and grilled squid comes with a moreish Dalmatian side dish of garlickyblitva(chard) mashed into potatoes. At next door’sKonoba Cigale, I chat to executive chef Dinko Lekić, a born-and-bred Lošinjanin who praises the fish and seafood of Kvarner. “Every day it comes in fresh,” he says, adding that he’s now taking culinary revenge on the invasive blue crab by putting it on his menu.However, it’s the Adriatic langoustine –škampiin Croatian – that’s the king of Kvarner. Something magical happens when water rushes through the karst mountains ofUčka nature parkabove the Opatija area and pours nutrients into the Kvarner Gulf, feeding these shellfish. Chef Stiven Vunić, who runsKonoba Zijavicain Mošćenička Draga, south of Opatija town, and who comes from a long line ofškampifishers, enthuses about the delicacy. “This is one of the best products we have in Kvarner,” he says. “It’s very sweet; I’ve never tastedškampilike this.”Mali Lošinj’s brightly coloured port is filled with baroque sea captains’ houses, cafe terraces and a fish marketI could taste that sweetness in my grilled langoustine onBocca Vera’s terrace overlooking the lively harbour in Mali Lošinj, preceded by tortellini with ricotta and truffles in aškampisauce. Other seafood stars appear during my visit, including a platter of marinated and salted anchovies, carpaccio of sea bass, tuna and octopus as a warm-up for grilled dentex inGostionica Marinain the village of Veli Lošinj, whose pretty harbour is lined with colourful Venetian-style houses.View image in fullscreenA seafood platter at Gostionica Marina.Photograph: Adam BatterbeeThen there’s grilled turbot atLanterna Grill’s waterside terrace in Čikat bay, surely one of the most romantic spots on the island, made even more enchanting by the walk there during twilight as the fiery sun filters through Aleppo pines. The bay is a snapshot of Lošinj: grand 19th-century Austrian-style villas (including one converted into the luxuryBoutique Hotel Alhambra), the sleek modern Hotel Bellevue where I’m staying, the picturesquely ramshackle Latino Beach bar in front of a sandy stretch, and the northern cape dominated by an enormous campsite set under fragrant pines.It’s tempting to linger in Čikat, with its beaches, watersports, restaurants and picnic places. However, it’s only a 15-minute walk into Mali Lošinj, where the brightly coloured port is filled with baroque sea captains’ houses, cafe terraces and a fish market. TheMuseum of Apoxyomenoshouses one of the world’s best-preserved ancient Greek statues, and theChurch of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, with its Venetian baroque bell tower, is reached after trudging up about 200 steps along narrow alleyways.Lošinj and its neighbouring islands stretch out before me, all bathed in the glow of the setting sun. If you want to soothe the eyes and the soul, come hereThere’s already so much natural aromatherapy on the island, but it goes into overdrive atLošinj’s Fragrant Garden(Miomirisni Otočki Vrt) at the southern tip of Mali Lošinj. I say hello to the resident animals (a donkey, some tortoises and a rabbit), while inhaling island scents and gazing at the sea just beyond. From here it’s a short walk down stone steps to the sheltered pebbly beach at Valdarke, which, on this sunny Saturday afternoon, has fewer than 20 people on it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s worth the €10 fee to sit at one of the benches surrounded by a profusion of scented plants and herbs, drinking Kvarner and Istrian wine, maybe buying a picnic basket of local cheeses, meats and seafood – and just gazing at the vista. Lošinj, its neighbouring islands and part of the mountainous mainland stretch out before me, all bathed in the glow of the setting sun. If you want to soothe the eyes and the soul, come here.It’s not all money, money, money here; the mellower side of Croatia’s Mamma Mia islandRead moreI have another treat in store before I leave Lošinj: getting two islands for the price of one. Lošinj’s northern tip is attached by a bridge to Cres, which ties with neighbouring Krk as being Croatia’s largest island. Populated by more sheep than people, and smothered with olive groves and forests of holm oak and pine, Cres is as relaxed as it comes. In the north is Beli, whosegriffon vulture rescue centreI last visited 21 years ago. I’m pleased to discover that concerted efforts to rescue this endangered bird have been paying off. It’s now home to Croatia’s largest colony.Cres town is another tiny Venetian delight, set on a deep bay that extends towards headlands lined with beaches of fine gravel and another sprawling campsite. In front of one of these beaches is the Isolano, a chic new adults-only hotel that opened in spring. When I heard about it months ago, I was a little worried this Marriott hotel wouldn’t suit Cres’s laid-back, nature-focused vibe (this is the island whose slogan is “no stress on Cres”), but I’m happy to be proved wrong. As with everything else I’d seen on these two Kvarner islands, it was just the spot to sit back and savour a taste of late summer.The trip was provided by theKvarner Region Tourist Board,Taste the MediterraneanandVisit Lošinj.Hotel Bellevuehas doublesfrom€177 B&B a night in October (two-night minimum stay); closed from early November to late March.The Isolano, Creshas doubles from €186 B&B in October; closed from early January to mid-MarchExplore more on these topicsCroatia holidaysFood and drinkEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When I finally acknowledged it, I was overwhelmed by the love and support of friends and strangersOreoluwa AdeyoolaWed 1 Oct 2025 01.55 EDTShareIn the first week of summer 2019, I decided I wanted a job. I was 16, finally old enough to attend festivals and concerts with my friends; all I needed was the money. With no prior work experience, I scraped together a CV that didn’t even fill a page and sent it to every shop and cafe in my little village in Chelmsford, Essex. Miraculously, I was offered a job interview at the local fast food restaurant.I remember the nerves I felt on the way there. What would they ask me? Would they like me? In the end, I had nothing to worry about. The interview went well and the hiring manager seemed ready to hand me a contract. But, before I left, he asked me to try out serving a customer. “Just give her the items shown next to her order number on that screen,” he said, pointing to a monitor on the wall behind him.To my horror, I couldn’t make out a single word on the display. The customer, a woman with her young daughter, stood impatiently as I froze. I didn’t know what to say. After a few awkward minutes, the hiring manager dismissed me and I received a rejection email the next morning. My dreams of attending Wireless and Reading festivals with my friends disintegrated – and I had another, more important, revelation: for the first time in my life, I realised that I was disabled.I knew I had been born partially sighted due to complications in the womb. As a child, I remember struggling to see the whiteboard in class, even when I was sitting right at the front. I masked this by copying notes from my friends, face bent close to the paper. To this day I struggle with basic maths, having learned most of it second hand.View image in fullscreen‘I’m not just speaking up for me, but for the millions like me’ … Oreoluwa Adeyoola.Photograph: Courtesy of Oreoluwa AdeyoolaThe adults in my life – at home, school, and at my regular hospital appointments – talked about my vision in huddled groups, voices hushed, eyebrows furrowed. It never occurred to me that most children didn’t frequently visit an ophthalmologist. As a seven-year-old, I had treated my two-week hospital stay (while doctors tried to work out what was wrong with me) like a holiday, befriending all the other children on the ward and working my way through books from the hospital library – at that age, I was less self-conscious about how close I had to hold the page in order to see text clearly.As I got older, I buried the secret even more. At secondary school, I was the new kid who had moved from Ireland to Essex, and I desperately tried to hide my visual impairment.But when I got back from that job interview, I made the first step towards navigating life with a disability: acceptance. It was a slow, agonising progress. At my next ophthalmologist appointment, I started asking more questions. I learned that glasses couldn’t improve my vision and that I would never be allowed to drive. Each new detail felt like a fresh blow.For the first time, I looked at the official diagnosis I had received at 12 years old on my certificate of visual impairment: retinal dystrophy. Seeing the words in cold, bold print made something that had seemed so abstract and confusing a reality. To my surprise, I was filled with relief.The next step was unlearning the hyper-independence I had developed over the years. I hated asking for help – so much so that I preferred taking the wrong bus than asking a stranger to read out the route number for me. I would say I wasn’t hungry at restaurants because I was too self-conscious to look closely at the menu. My biggest fear was being vulnerable and, at first, every time I asked for help, I would have a panic attack.But as I started reaching out for help, the love and support of my friends overwhelmed me. They built up my confidence so that I no longer felt embarrassed to ask for assistance. As I started asking strangers for help, reading menus at cafes, navigatingconfusing tube stations or for aid crossing the road, I was surprised at how kind they were.Today, I feel very far from the anxiety-ridden 16-year-old I was at that interview. I know that I cannot change my vision, but I treat every new barrier as a challenge. Speaking up when something is inaccessible has taught me that adjustments can usually be made to accommodate my needs, and I am no longer shy to ask for them. If I ever do feel anxious to admit I can’t see something, I remember there are more than 2 million people living with sight loss in the UK. I’m not just speaking up for me, but for the millions like me. And, these days, I make sure I never go hungry in restaurants.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityA moment that changed meBlindness and visual impairmentYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Children were handed balloons, parents bought sweets and friends gathered in restaurants – all while chatting animatedly on their phones.For 48 hours,Afghans had been offline, cut off from mobile and internet services, in a telecommunications shutdown imposed by authorities without warning.“It felt like we had gone back centuries.

They hate the depiction ofIreland’s history, hate the dialogue, hate the costumes, hate the lighting. Netflix announced that it was the first show to have Irish subtitles and still Irish critics hate it.View image in fullscreenThe English actor James Norton stars as the series’ heart-throb hard man.Photograph: Ben Blackall/NetflixTheIrish Times reviewlamented the show’s “rudimentary understanding of Ireland’s experiences of colonialism” and “stunning lack of appreciation for who the Anglo-Irish were and where they fit (or didn’t) into Irish society”.It said the heart-throb hard man, played by the English actorJames Norton, sounded like “a steampunk Mr Tayto” – a reference to an Irish crisp brand mascot – and that the revolutionaries, the Fenians, “dress and speak like feral leprechauns”.TheIrish Independentsaid the show was a “shocker” that frittered away any sense of authenticity. “The cliches arrive thick and fast. Put it this way: a lot of letters are crumpled up and thrown into a lot of fires.”It complained that characters swore too much for credibility and that the story mangled history. “The producers do point out that their series is fiction, but then the majority of our popular history is fiction, and quite dangerous fiction at that. We don’t need any more of it.”The series, which bills itself as fiction inspired by a true story, is loosely based on the fact that a Guinness patriarch died in 1868, leaving his four adult children to take over a brewing empire that dominated inner-city Dublin and exported beer around the world.Steven Knight, the creator ofPeaky Blinders, filmed most of the new show in Liverpool with a mix of mainly Irish and British actors. He soundtracked the action with thumping, contemporary Irish bands including Fontaines DC and Kneecap.The Guardian gave it five stars.National Public Radio’s reviewsaid Knight knew exactly how to bring period dramas to life. Its only grumble was that some accents were hard to understand. “But the story, and the intrigue – those translate perfectly.”Irish critics have long despaired of actors who traduce Irish accents – Brad Pitt’s rendition of an IRA man in The Devil’s Own is especially notorious – but the House of Guinness cast has largely escaped censure on this score. Notwithstanding the Mr Tayto jibe,Norton’s performance and accent won praise.

Green doesn’t equal Irish. Why are all the Fenians wearing literal spirit Halloween leprechaun costumes?”Garron Noone, a comedian and self-styled “Irish cultural police” with more than 2 millionfollowers on TikTokand Instagram, noted the first episode’s alacrity in introducing rebels. “It only takes three minutes and 45 seconds for somebody to shout: ‘Free Ireland from the English!’”Noone mockingly endorsed a “Guinness-pouring tutorial” scene, plus a funeral brawl. “That is, of course, very true to our culture, though I didn’t see any sandwiches at the funeral, so I will be deducting a couple of points for that.”Irish critics also cited clunky dialogue and dim lighting and said no amount of explosions and sex could conceal the story’s dullness.“If it’s pitched as a cross between Succession and Peaky Blinders, then it lacks the comedy of the former and the jeopardy of the latter,” said anIrish Examiner reviewheadlined “all pour, no pint”.The Irish Times, in perhaps the most withering put-down, cited a sequence purportedly so bad it risked driving Guinness drinkers to a rival stout. “These and other scenes might leave you crying out for a nice cold, creamy pint of Beamish.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropeDramaNetflixTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After dozens of peaceful protesters were arrested over the weekend, violence broke out in several cities, especially in areas where jobs are scarce and social services lacking.“The right to health, education and a dignified life is not an empty slogan but a serious demand,” the organisers of the Gen Z212 protest movement wrote in a statement published on Discord. They cited King Mohammed VI, implored protesters to remain peaceful and criticised “repressive security approaches”.View image in fullscreenYoung people take to the streets in Rabat to voice anger at the dire state of some hospitals and schools.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APStill, the protests have escalated and become more destructive, particularly in cities far from where development efforts have been concentrated in Morocco. Local outlets and footage filmed by witnesses showed protesters hurling rocks and setting vehicles ablaze in cities and towns in the country’s east and south, including in Inzegane and Ait Amira.In Oujda, eastern Morocco’s largest city, one person was injured when a police vehicle rammed into demonstrators, local human rights groups and the state news agency MAP said.Morocco’s interior ministry said the anonymously organised protests lacked authorisation and were dealt with according to the law, noting that those found to be breaking the law would be treated “rigorously and firmly”. It said 409 people were taken into police custody.It said 263 members of law enforcement were injured during the nationwide protests that also damaged 142 of their vehicles. Twenty private cars were also damaged and 23 civilians were injured, the ministry said.The Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) said 37 protesters had been arrested in Oujda on Monday, among them six minors, and would appear in court on Wednesday.View image in fullscreenThe youth-led demonstration originated on social media platforms such as TikTok and Discord.Photograph: Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP/Getty ImagesThey are among the hundreds that AMDH said had been apprehended, including many whose arrests were captured on video by local media and some who were detained by plainclothes officers during interviews.“With protests scheduled to continue, we urge authorities to engage with the legitimate demands of the youth for their social, economic, and cultural rights and to address their concerns about corruption,” Amnesty International’s regional office said on Tuesday.In some of Morocco’s largest anti-government protests in years, the leaderless movement has harnessed anger about conditions in hospitals and schools to express outrage over the government’s spending priorities.Pointing to new stadiums under construction or renovation across the country, protesters have chanted: “Stadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?” The recent deaths of eight women at a public hospital in Agadir have also become a rallying cry against the decline of Morocco’s health system.View image in fullscreenOrganisers of the demonstrations accused the authorities of engaging in ‘repressive security approaches’.Photograph: Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP/Getty ImagesThe movement, which originated on platforms such as TikTok and Discord, which are popular among young people, has won additional backing since authorities began arresting people over the weekend, including from Morocco’s star goalkeeper Yassine Bounou and its most famous rapper ElGrandeToto.Officials have denied prioritising World Cup spending over public infrastructure, saying problems facing the health sector were inherited from previous governments.

When the legislation was enacted, it meant that Marineland could not acquire any new animals.According to the Canadian Press, Ontario provincial inspectors have attended the park more than 200 times since 2020 and issued 33 orders for compliance.Marineland has previously said the belugas receive a high level of healthcare and round-the-clock-attention.Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, said at a press conference last week that the province will “do whatever it takes” to give the remaining whales the “best life possible”. Speaking of Marineland he said: “It’s just terrible over there.”Phil Demers, who trained whales at the park from 2000 to 2012 before becoming an outspoken critic of the park, said that while he’s relieved the whales will not be sent to China, they remain at risk.The only viable alternative would be for the animals to live somewhere with strict laws that preserve their wellbeing. Demers said the United States is likely the best option.He saidCanadahas lacked the “political appetite” to actually hold Marineland to account and rescue the animals since the park opened in 1961. Despite the province’s investigation, it hasn’t led to the animals being relinquished into government custody – which Demers says needs to happen.“They’ve allowed it to sort of simmer on the back burner, and now we’re boiling over,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCanadaWhalesChinaZoosMarine lifeWildlifeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We have no historical animosities against each other, and we are very similar culturally. So, this is a breakthrough, even though it’s only four countries. The idea is, once the four countries make the start and perfect this regime, that others will join,” he said.Kendol Morgan, a former Caricom communications lead, said one concern for some nations during negotiations was the potential pressure on social services.“I know that some countries were concerned that if there was a lot of movement that a lot of people came in, say for employment, and they brought their children with them and spouses, the numbers may add up. And where the health sector is already stretched just catering for the local population, that may extend to a point where the authorities may find it difficult to deal with,” he said.A similar free movement arrangement between countries in a sub regional group called the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States gave some confidence to governments, after “they saw that there was no overrunning of any particular country”, he said.The new arrangement comes amid ongoing concerns about a regional brain drain, with skilled professionals following lucrative salaries and opportunities in the UK, the US and Canada, leaving islands with gaps in critical fields such as healthcare and education.Mia Mottley, the Barbados prime minister,has raised concernsabout the country’s declining and ageing population.Echoing her concerns, Comissiong, said he hopes the full freedom of movement scheme will provide more opportunities in the region.“All of our countries have a vested interest in cutting down on the number of our people who migrate to North America and Europe, especially since the majority of these migrants, tend to be… highly educated and trained young people – precisely the citizens that we need to keep at home so that they could produce and contribute to national development.“Anything that we could do to make our Caribbean region more attractive to these young people who live at home is a step in the right direction,” he said.Opinions across the region were split. Anthony Roberts, 45, a shop attendant in Barbados expressed concern the deal would mean more competition for jobs. But University of the West Indies student, Darren Clarke, 21, said it was “a step in the right direction”.“People should be able to move around and contribute wherever their skills are needed. I like the idea that I could one day take a job in Jamaica or Guyana without having to jump through a million hoops,” he said.Michelle Thorne, 46, an air traffic controller in St Vincent and the Grenadines is concerned that Vincentians would be enticed by higher salaries and the country would lose critical workforce.But teacher Marissa Bacchus, 32, said the arrangement provides an alternative to migrating to the US, which she says is becoming less attractive because of gun violence. “I am already considering moving … . I’m qualified to teach in Barbados. I feel much safer in the Caribbean and don’t have to worry about winter and I’m on a quick flight home if anything,” she said.Explore more on these topicsCaribbeanHealthAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

As a father, I have to be strong now more than ever,” said Jilig, 41.A firefighter, Erwin Castaneda, said they had been searching for five hours but “we cannot give up”. “We are talking about lives here. We will do everything that we can,” he said.Civil defence teams were also searching for signs of life beneath a landslide that had killed at least 14 people in the city. “As much as I would want to say there’s no more fatalities, the toll could still go up,” Cebu provincial information officer Ainjeliz Orong said of the landslide.Heavy rains and power cuts have hampered rescue efforts. The Cebu provincial government has put out a call on its official Facebook page for medical volunteers to assist.The president, Ferdinand Marcos, pledged swift aid for victims. “I offer my heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families,” he said.1:12Dashcam footage shows people rocked off their bikes as earthquake shakes the Philippines – videoDramatic footage filmed by residents during the quake on Bantayan Island, near the island of Cebu, showed a string of lightbulbs on an old Catholic church swaying wildly before the church’s belfry tumbled into the courtyard.

Liu Jianchao’s personal profile page has been taken offline.The CCP’s international department handles relations with foreign political parties and socialist states.Liu Jianchao frequently met foreign dignitaries and had recently visited the UK. He is fluent in English and studied international relations at Oxford University, served in China’s mission to the UK and was widely tipped to be the next foreign minister.He is the most high-level diplomat to go missing since China ousted its former foreign ministerQin Gangin 2023. Qin, who has not been heard from since, was replaced by his predecessor, Wang Yi.Liu Haixing may now be a more likely candidate to replace Wang as China’s top diplomat in the next reshuffle.The Wall Street Journal reported that Liu Jianchao had been placed under investigation for alleged corruption and violations of party discipline, citing people briefed on the matter. Liu himself has previously worked for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, China’s graft-busting agency.One of Liu’s deputies, Sun Haiyan, was reportedly taken away for questioning in August but she has since appeared at public events and represented China in meetings with foreign countries.In recent years a string of senior Chinese officials have been removed from public life without explanation. The former defence ministerLi Shangfuwas sacked in 2023 and later expelled from the CCP, along with Wei Fenghe, another former defence minister. Their punishments were officially confirmed to be related to a corruption investigation in the People’s Liberation Army.People purged from the senior ranks of the CCP may be left to live their remaining years in political and social exile or they may face harsh criminal penalties.CCP inspectors have punished more than 6 million people for corruption and other disciplinary offences since Xi Jinping became China’s leader in 2012.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Compared to the first half of 2024, Taiwan’s naphtha imports this year increased by 44%.Taiwan has elsewhere been reiterating its support for Ukraine in the war withRussia. On Sunday, Taiwan’s foreign minister, Lin Chia-lung, signed a pact in Poland to provide support for children in Ukraine affected by Russia’s invasion.After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022,Taiwan joined international sanctionsagainst Moscow. It has alsoimposed export controlsto prevent the island’s hi-tech equipment from being used by Russia’s military.But Moscow’s ability to continue with the war is funded in part by energy exports, with billions of dollars coming fromTaiwan.Since February 2022, Taiwan has imported 6.8m tonnes of Russian naphtha, worth $4.9bn, which is equal to 20% of Russia’s total exports of the petroleum product.The US president, Donald Trump, hasurged countries to stop buying Russian oil.The findings come from a report published on Wednesday by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a Finnish thinktank, in collaboration with a consortium of European, Russian and Taiwanese NGOs.Naphtha is a crude oil product that is used to make chemicals required for manufacturing semiconductors, electronic components that are the backbone of Taiwan’s economy and which are vital for global industry.Despite joining other sanctions against Russia, Taiwan, which is overwhelmingly reliant on imports for its energy needs, has not imposed restrictions on purchases of Russian fossil fuels.Joseph Webster, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that revenue from Taiwan’s purchases of Russian naphtha “are not immaterial to the Kremlin’s revenues.”.Taiwan imports about 97% of its energy, a fact that experts have highlighted as a key vulnerability in the event of a conflict with China. It is a self-governing democracy but China claims it as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to annex the island.Many analysts have drawn comparisons between Russia’s designs on Ukraine and China’s plans for Taiwan. The conflict is closely watched in Taiwan and has spurredan interest in civil defence training programmes. There is a concern that China’s support for Russia during the war in Ukraine could be reciprocated by Moscow in the event of a Chinese conflict with Taiwan.But some analysts said that Taiwan’s purchases of Russian oil should not be over-interpreted. “This looks like opportunism by Taiwan’s petrochemical industry,” said John Lough, the head of foreign policy at the New Eurasian Strategies Centre. Lough said that even if the money from Taiwan helped to fill the Kremlin’s coffers, “it’s a stretch to think that [Russia] will be willing or able to provide military support to China in the event of increased Chinese pressure on Taiwan”.Webster said: “While Moscow and Beijing seek to absorb Ukraine and Taiwan, respectively, the two authoritarian powers are applying different approaches along different timelines. Moscow’s illegal invasion was a desperate attempt to halt Ukraine’s western orientation, but Beijing is much more patient and believes time is on its side.”Hsin Hsuan Sun, a director at the Environmental Rights Foundation and co-author of the report, said: “Taiwan cannot afford to ignore the risks created by its growing dependence on Russian fossil fuel”. Sun said that the reliance “undermines Taiwan’s credibility with democratic allies”.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanAsia PacificRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Ninety-nine children and workers at the school were accounted for.The head of the local rescue agency, Nanang Sigit, told reporters that rescuers had detected signs of life beneath the debris.1:05Rescuers race to find survivors after school collapse in Indonesia – video“We used a camera and were able to detect six victims who showed signs of life,” he said.“When they saw the light from the search camera, they were moving their legs.”Holy Abdullah Arif, 49, wept as he held up a picture on his mobile phone of his nephew Rosi, still listed among the missing.

All the applications relate to subclass 866 onshore protection visas, which are available to people who arrive in Australia on a valid visa before seeking asylum.No protection visas were granted to US citizens between January and July 2025. However, applications can take months or even years to be finalised.Prof Daniel Ghezelbash, the director of the Kaldor centre for international refugee law at the University of NSW, said that whether an asylum seeker is granted protection depends on the risk of persecution at the time their application is assessed, not the time the application was submitted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only about one in six applications from all countries results in a visa being granted, according tostatistics published by the department.People who are granted a subclass 866 visa are allowed to stay in Australia permanently and have a path to full citizenship.In August, Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board reportedit had received 245 US refugee claimsin the first six months of 2025, which was more than in any full year since 2019.

With no rules on nominee companies, fossil fuel backers can profit while staying hidden from public scrutiny.”The report found almost all nominees in Australia were subsidiaries of the world’s largest banks.It found three nominees, subsidiaries of Citibank, HSBC and JP Morgan, were listed as shareholders in companies producing carbon emissions roughly equivalent to the output of 4.4m Australian homes each year.Australia could split Cop31 hosting rights with Turkey under potential compromiseRead moreSign up: AU Breaking News emailThe report found nominees were listed as owners of close to 70% of Origin Energy’s shares, two-thirds of Whitehaven Coal’s shares, and more than a third of AGL Energy’s shares.“Because shareholders can exercise voting rights and benefit financially, understanding these ownership structures provides a clearer picture of which actors are connected to Australia’s fossil fuel sector,” Louis said.“While there’s a lot the Australian government will need to do to hitits new climate target, making the ownership of fossil fuel interests more transparent is a low-hanging fruit.”Jenifer Varzaly, an associate professor in commercial law at Durham University who has investigated nominee companies in Australia, said they may provide a “cloaking mechanism” for some investors.In Australia, companies must disclose the names of investors that hold more than 5% of shares. But Varzaly said if the shareholding hovered below that 5% threshold, and was listed in the name of a nominee, then “the public will not know who sits behind it”.While close to 70% of Origin’s shares are held by nominees linked to JP Morgan, HSBC and Citibank, others nominees are listed as owning tens of thousands of shares in the company but less than the 5% threshold.Transparency International Australia’s chief executive, Clancy Moore, agreed nominee companies could “mask the true owners of corporate structures in Australia”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the legislation does not specifically address the issue of nominees.The Greens spokesperson for economic justice, Nick McKim, said nominees “were letting coal, oil and gas profiteers cash in from the shadows”.McKim said the Financial Action Task Force, a multilateral organisation that sets standards for corporate transparency, recently found Australia generally was only “partially compliant” with its recommendations on corporate transparency.“If we had a public beneficial ownership register with teeth, nominee companies would be redundant,” McKim said.In the UK, nominee companies that hold more than 25% of a company’s shares must disclose who is benefiting. This is not required in Australia.Nominee companies are not exclusively used to mask investments in the fossil fuel sector. Close to 70% of shares in Australian pharmaceutical company CSL are registered with nominees, according to its latest annual report. About 90% of shares in property developer Mirvac are listed as being nominee companies.Nominee companies also provide other services to investors including transaction settlement, administration and financial reporting.Treasury, the treasurer’s office, Citibank, HSBC and JP Morgan were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsBusinessFossil fuelsEnergy (Australia news)Energy (Environment)Greenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Of the strip-searches conducted by police in the 2018-19 financial year, 91% were based on suspicion that a person possessed prohibited drugs, according to a 2019 University of NSW report that was commissioned by the Redfern Legal Centre.Yehia noted in her judgment that while police can carry out a pat-down search based on the reasonable suspicion of drug possession, escalating this to a strip-search requires the circumstances to be necessary, urgent and serious.Sam Lee, a senior solicitor involved in the class action with Redfern Legal Centre, said the judgment could pave the way for people who are strip-searched to take legal action – and not just those at music festivals, but more broadly.“What this judgment says is that the current practice has been unlawful, and not just by one officer, but at a systemic level,” she said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailYehia found thata 2018 strip search of the lead plaintiff, Raya Meredith, was unlawfulafter a drug dog sniffed in her direction while she was walking into Splendour in the Grass. Meredith, who was then 27, was taken by police into a makeshift tent where she was told to strip and remove her tampon. While she was bent over during the search, a male police officer walked in.It is yet to be determined what the lead plaintiff’s win will mean for the rest of the more than 3,000 members of the class action.The NSW police minister, Yasmin Catley, said it was difficult to “put a number on” on how much the state could owe in compensation against the group members because they did not yet know how many people would come forward with a claim.Lee is calling for the NSW government to follow the ACT’s lead and cease police powers to strip-search people under 18, unless there is a court order for them to do so.“If they don’t change the legislation and police continue on with the same practice, then the state is going to be up for more money,” Lee said.The NSW Greens spokesperson for drug law reform, Cate Faehrmann, backed Lee’s calls for an end to the strip-searching of children.She said legislation should also expressly prohibit police from strip-searching people on the suspicion of minor drug possession because she did not have “any faith” police won’t continue this practice following the judgment. Faehrmann said the Greens were working on bill to propose this.“The Greens are offering to work constructively with the Minns government to support sensible laws on this issue, which must start at the very least with banning strip-searches on children,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was also entitled to exemplary damages, but this figure has not yet been determined.‘It should be gay Disneyland’: the struggle to revitalise Sydney’s Oxford Street without selling its soulRead moreJeremy King, a lawyer in Victoria specialising in police accountability, said this was a “pretty extraordinary finding”.“You often see poor conduct by police in matters such as these, but rarely judges act on that,” he said.Asked on Wednesday afternoon if she thought Meredith deserved an apology, Catley said: “Yes, I apologise. What happened to Ms Meredith, the police have already acknowledged, was unlawful. It should not have happened to her.”NSW’s new police commissioner, Mal Lanyon, told reporters on Wednesday that police had changed their practices since 2018, when Meredith was strip-searched.He said one of the main reasons police strip-search in general is to search for weapons.Meanwhile, at music festivals he said police searches were focused now on the supply of prohibited drugs.“We have seen the terrible toll that drugs take at music festivals. We’ve seen young lives lost, and I think it’s really important, as I said, that we do have sniffer dogs as a tool,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian police and policingNew South WalesIllegal drugsNew South Wales politicsAustralian GreensLaw (Australia)newsShareReuse this content"

The site’s communications director said on 25 September that “restoration efforts [were] currently being complicated by ongoing shelling by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of the plant and in the immediate vicinity of the damaged line”.The plant’s final external power line was cut at 4.56pm on Tuesday last week, creating a set of circumstances described by Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, as “clearly not a sustainable situation in terms of nuclear safety”.Line disconnected from power plantEight back-up generators are currently powering the cooling systems, with a further nine in reserve, said the IAEA in an update released on Tuesday. There is enough power to fuel the generators for 10 days, with further deliveries expected to maintain this level, the watchdog added.Though the imagery of a pylon over a field in Russian held territory about 1.5km from the power plant is faint, the absence of dark pock marks on the ground, characteristic of areas that have been shelled, is obvious. Both legs of the pylon and a horizontal connecting structure are visible.Shaun Burnie, a nuclear specialist with Greenpeace, said the imagery showed that “Russia has deliberately sabotaged the external power line”.View image in fullscreenZaporizhzhia nuclear plantPhotograph: McKenzie IntelligenceUkraine believes that Russia’s goal is political, to force a crisis that will allow Moscow to assert its control over the site. At present the final power line runs from the nuclear plant, across the Dnipro river, to Ukrainian-held territory, where it had been maintained to avoid safety being compromised.But an unpublished document submitted by Russia to the IAEA dated 3 June, detailing the situation at the plant, indicates that an alternative plan was being prepared by Moscow.The document states that in the event of the external power lines to the plant being disconnected from Ukraine “a procedure for voltage transmission … from the unified power system of Russia” had “been developed”.A earlier analysis by Greenpeaceof satellite imagery published on Saturday showed 125 miles of construction of a new high voltage line from the Russian grid in the occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol, though it is unclear if a final connection to the power plant has been made.The Russian occupiers built a dam across an inlet channel at the site in the summer in order to create a smaller, more secure water source. Experts believe there is enough water available for Russia to restart one of the six reactors, to assert that only it can run the site.Last month, Yuriy Chernichuk, the Russian-appointed director of the plant, said the process of integrating the site into the Russian grid was “in its final stages”, though a restart of any nuclear reactor during a war would be unprecedented.Zaporizhzhia’s six reactors are currently running in a state of cold shutdown, operating at below boiling point, but Ukrainian sources say there would be a risk that the nuclear fuel in the six reactors would heat uncontrollably over a period of weeks, eventually leading to a meltdown.An accelerated version of this scenario happened at the Japanese nuclear plant at Fukushima in 2011 because the reactors had just been operating.A 9.0-magnitude earthquake struck Japan and the hot reactors on the site were automatically shut down in response. Emergency generators continued to pump cooling water around the reactor but these were knocked out by a tsunami that followed minutes later.Three nuclear cores at the plant melted down within three days, though the fuel remained contained. Nobody was killed but more than 100,000 people were evacuated.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeNuclear powerRussianewsShareReuse this content"

He then set their house on fire, having earlier booby-trapped the building.Police said they believed he had probably killed his 90-year-old father, whose body was seen but could not be recovered from the still-burning house in the city’s leafy northern Lerchenau district.The man also shot his 81-year-old mother, who was taken to hospital with wounds not considered life-threatening, they said.His 21-year-old daughter was also injured but was rescued by firefighters from the first floor, having threatened to jump to escape the flames, police said.The man, who has not been named, fled after a police helicopter spotted him in the garden. After a short pursuit, he stopped in a lakeside park and killed himself, police said.Bomb squads were called in because the man had rigged the building with explosives – reportedly grenades attached to trip wires – and was also carrying an explosives-laden backpack.During his rampage, he had also set three vehicles on fire outside the house, including his own van, police said.The crime prompted a major police mobilisation shortly before 5am local time, and then the evacuation of nearby residents and a local school. About 500 police, firefighters and other first responders were deployed during the day’s emergency response operations.Bavaria state’s interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, said there was no sign of a political or religious motive. “It appears, incomprehensible as it may be, that this was solely a family matter,” he added.City authorities responded to the alarm by announcing the temporary closure of the Oktoberfest, considered the world’s largest such gathering. The festival, held from 20 September to 5 October this year, welcomed 6.7 million visitors in 2024.In 1980 it was the scene of a pipe bomb attack by a far-right group, which killed 13 people and wounded more than 200.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Kremlin said it had no information about the tanker or the incident when asked.map showing route of the Boracay tanker from coast of north-west France to Primorsk, Russia‘There are hundreds in the Baltic’: tracking Russia’s ‘shadow fleet’ of oil tankersRead moreBoracay, a Benin-flagged tanker, had just changed its name from Pushpa. Under that name, it was monitored sailing west around Denmark last week, and was cited by naval experts as one of a handful of Russia-linked vessels that may have been involved in the drone incidents.Copenhagen airport was closed for four hours in the evening of 22 September and Aalborg airport two days later, after drones were sighted in Danish airspace. None, however, were shot down and while Denmark has pointed the finger at Russia its investigators have not been able to say who is responsible.One line of inquiry is that the drones – almost certainly larger delta or fixed-wing craft – were launched from a ship or ships near Denmark, giving the country’s military little time to respond. Though the drones’ identity is not known definitively, such drones can be launched from a catapult that could easily be carried on a large ship.Investigations by Danish media have also identified two other commercial vessels, the Astrol-1 and the Oslo Carrier-3, as sailing in the region at the time, and a Russian warship, the Aleksandr Shabalin, which wasfilmed by a Danish tabloidfrom a helicopter south of Langeland, at the very west of the Baltic.A further incursion took place over northern Germany last week. Drones believed to be engaged in reconnaissance flew over military sites and infrastructure in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, according to an official assessment cited in a report in Der Spiegel.On Wednesday, Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said Europe faced a “hybrid war,” referring to drone incursions over Denmarkand Polandduring September. “From a European perspective, there is only one country that is willing to threaten us, and it is Russia,” she added.Talks on European ‘drone wall’ after Danish airport incursionsRead moreCopenhagen will host an EU summit on Wednesday, where leaders will discuss developing a “drone wall” to counter threats, followed by a meeting of the 47-country European Political Community on Thursday. Several European nations, including the UK, have deployed anti-drone defences to help Denmark this week.Boracay, identified by its international maritime order number, is subject to economic sanctions by the UK, the EU and others. TheUK said in October 2024the tanker, then called Varuna, was part of Russia’s shadow fleet, and “is involved in carrying oil or oil products that originated in Russia to a third country”.The shadow fleet is a term used for vessels whose ownership is hard to trace or who are deceptively identified but are used by Russia and other countries to trade oil and other goods clandestinely, often to avoid economic sanctions.In April this year, the tanker, then known as Kiwala, was detained by Estonian authorities after they were unable to confirm its registry in Djibouti. Initially, the Estonians were told the ship’s registration had been cancelled, but two weeks later the Kiwala was released after Djibouti said it would accept responsibility until May.Of the other two commercial ships seen near Denmark at the time of the drone incidents, Astrol-1, which was tracked on the Kattegat strait near Copenhagen the same day as the drone incident near the capital, is now docked at St Petersburg.Oslo Bulk, a Norwegian shipping company and the owner of the Oslo Carrier-3 vessel, said it had been “a bit surprised by all the media attention” on its ship, which it said was carrying a steel cargo east from Germany to Lithuania.The owners admitted it used Russian crews on “all our ships” because of their knowledge of cold waters, but said the vessel had been searched by “Nato military personnel” before being allowed to go on to Finland.Explore more on these topicsFranceRussiaEuropeEmmanuel MacronDenmarkDrones (military)Drones (non-military)newsShareReuse this content"

Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Wednesday that Israeli forces had killed at least 46 people, including 36 in Gaza City.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced that the intensification of the Israeli assault had forced it to suspend operations in Gaza City.Katz said: “This is the last opportunity for Gaza residents who wish to do so to move south and leaveHamasoperatives isolated in Gaza City.” Those who remained “will be considered terrorists and terrorist supporters”, he said.International humanitarian law experts have said evacuation orders amount to forced displacement and that civilians who remain in evacuated areas do not lose their protected status under international law.The Israeli military earlier announced the closure of the last remaining route for residents in southern Gaza to move north, in effect cleaving Gaza in two. Residents in the north could still move southwards along the coastal route to flee Israel’s offensive, the military said.Hamas is reportedly considering requesting amendments to Trump’s Gaza plan, which demands that Hamas disarm and disqualifies it from any governing role in Gaza. Trump said on Tuesday that the group would “pay in hell” if it rejected the plan.According to a Palestinian source close to the group who spoke to Agence France-Presse, the group could ask for changes to clauses related to disarmament and the expulsion of Hamas and its allies from Gaza. The group also wants international guarantees that Israel fully withdraws from Gaza and that no assassination attempts will be made on Hamas’s leadership.Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said on Wednesday that elements of the Trump plan required further negotiation, a sentiment that Qatar had expressed a day earlier.It is unclear how the US and Israel would respond to a qualified response to the deal given the bevy of threats levelled at Hamas in recent days.Trump’s 20-point plan also stipulates that the group must release the remaining 48 hostages it holds within 72 hours of a ceasefire coming into effect, while the Israeli military would return nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and gradually withdraw its troops to a buffer zone at the edge of the Gaza Strip. The cessation in fighting would be accompanied by a surge in humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Gaza.The plan does not outline a path to a Palestinian state, a demand of Hamas and the wider Arab world.Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video after Trump announced his plan that the Israeli military would stay in most of Gaza, contrary to the plan’s public terms.The Trump plan has put Hamas in a corner, demanding of it an almost unconditional surrender to stop Israel’s offensive. Hamas refused several elements of the plan, including disarmament and the continued presence of Israeli troops, in previous rounds of negotiations. The group has yet to comment publicly on the Trump proposal beyond saying it is studying the terms.Two militant groups allied with Hamas in Gaza have rejected the Trump proposal, arguing that it would hand Israel virtual control over the strip.Surrendering Hamas’s arms and allowing the presence of international troops and possibly Israeli troops in Gaza would probably spell an end to the group’s significance in Palestinian politics.In the past, ceasefire proposals have been studied and discussed among Hamas’s leadership primarily in Doha, where most of the group’s senior officials live.Similarly, the current Trump plan will be debated in Doha, where Egyptian and Qatari mediators are to be joined by Turkey’s head of intelligence to discuss the plan, according to Qatar’s foreign ministry. Whether Hamas’s leadership would join the deliberations was unclear, after an Israeli strike on Doha last month aimed to kill the group’s officials.Hamas is under pressure from international powers who havewidely supported Trump’s plan. The Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they welcomed the plan.Trump’s is the only ceasefire proposal on the table to end the war in Gaza, where the humanitarian situation declines day by day under Israeli bombardment and aid restrictions.Two more Palestinians died of starvation in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of Palestinians who have died from hunger to 455 since the start of the war nearly two years ago.At least 51 Palestinians were killed in Gaza over the last 24 hours, according to health authorities. Those killed included five people struck by an Israeli tank while gathered by a water tank, as well as others sheltering in a school repurposed to house displaced people in Gaza City.More than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 170,000 wounded during Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, according to the Gaza ministry of health. Israel launched its war on Gaza nearly two years ago after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel on 7 October 2023.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warHamasPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The flotilla was on Wednesday north of Egypt about 140 miles (220km) away fromGaza, where previous attempts have been intercepted in an area the activists consider to be a “danger zone”.One of those onboard the lead boat, the Turkish activist Metehan Sarı, told the Anadolu news agency that Israeli navy ships came within 5 to 10 metres of it in the early hours of Wednesday. “This was one of the biggest acts of harassment we have faced so far. They tried to scare us, but we weren’t afraid,” he said.In a joint statement on Wednesday from their foreign ministers, Italy and Greece called on Israel to “ensure the safety and security of the participants and to allow for all consular protection measures”. It also restated a call for the activists to hand over the humanitarian aid onboard to the Catholic church for it to distribute, which the organisers have rejected, saying their intent is to challenge Israel’s naval blockade of Gaza.The naval blockade was imposed in 2009 by Israel, an intensification of its 2007 blockade of Gaza in response to Hamas seizing control of the territory. It has been condemned on numerous occasions by the United Nations, which has called it “a direct contravention of international human rights and humanitarian law”.The convoy is being shadowed by a Spanish naval ship providing cover in case of drone attacks. Until Tuesday, it was also escorted by an Italian warship that, according to organisers, offered participants the chance to abandon their vessels.Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur forPalestine, criticised the Italian withdrawal. “As the Flotilla prepares to enter Gaza waters with their humanitarian mission, the Italian government prepares to abandon them, leaving Israel free to commit further violations, and carry on the genocide undisturbed,” she said in a post on X.Late on Tuesday night, the Spanish government said it had contacted the flotilla and “urgently recommended” that it did not enter Israel’s declared exclusion zone for the safety of everyone involved. Government sources in Madrid said that while the flotilla’s mission was “laudable and legitimate”, the lives of everyone in it had to be the priority.They also said that the Spanish naval patrol boat Furor, which has been deployed to assist the flotilla, would not cross into the Israeli-declared exclusion zone, as doing so would put the vessel and its crew at risk. But they said the boat would remain in an operational radius and would be standing by if a rescue became necessary.In an interview with Spain’s TVE on Wednesday morning, Spain’s digital transformation minister, Óscar López, said safety had to take precedence and defended the government’s decision.“People need to remember that what these people are doing is bringing food and medicine, and this isn’t the first time that Israel has blockaded aid for the Palestinian people,” he said.“And that’s a cause that couldn’t be more just and which deserves all our empathy and all our understanding. But the government has to make decisions and what the government isn’t going to do is put a Spanish boat in these waters that have been declared an Israeli exclusion zone … We’ve gone as far as we can and we’re still there.”In recent weeks, the Italian government has repeatedly urged the flotilla to avoid confrontation with Israel and to deliver aid instead via Israeli or Cypriot ports.Activists, however, insist their operation is not about the aid – which they describe as largely symbolic – but about breaking Israel’s “illegal siege” of the territory.The Italian Democratic party MP Arturo Scotto, speaking to La Repubblica onboard one of the flotilla’s vessels, has acknowledged his fear as they approach Gaza but insists the mission will proceed.“The flotilla has certainly already shown one thing to the world: the emperor has no clothes. Israel, a great military power, fears about 40 small boats? No, it knows that this mission has exposed its unworthy criminal lies.”The flotilla was attacked last week by drones that dropped stun grenades and itching powder, causing minor damage but no injuries.Israel’s navy has said it is preparing to seize control of the more than 50 vessels now within its interception range. The elite Shayetet 13 naval commando unit is reportedly on standby for the operation, which could involve towing ships to the port of Ashdod or sinking some at sea, according to Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan.In a post on X, Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said the flotilla’s rejection of the Italian proposal to unload aid in Cyprus proved that “their real purpose is provocation and serving Hamas”.Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has also called on the flotilla to halt its mission, warning that any attempt to break the blockade could jeopardise a recent US-brokered peace initiative between Israel and Hamas.Previous activist attempts to break the naval blockade on Gaza, illegal under international law, were stopped by force by the Israeli military.In 2010, 10 Turkish activists were killed by Israeli commandos who raided the Mavi Marmara ship leading an aid flotilla towards Gaza.Explore more on these topicsGazaProtestIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He has not been convicted of any crime and in March wascleared in one of nine cases against him. He faces terrorism charges in connection with attacks by the Sikh separatist Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), a banned terrorist organisation, of which he is alleged to be a member.Johal’s detention is seen as one of the worst examples of injustice among Britons still held abroad, and there are suspicions thatthe pursuit of free trade and security deals with India, secured in May, slowed down British government efforts on his behalf.In letters to Downing Street, the group write: “In almost eight years and hundreds of court hearings, prosecutors have supplied no credible evidence against Jagtar. In the first case against him to reach a verdict, in March 2025, Jagtar was acquitted of all charges by the Moga district court in Punjab. The court found the prosecution had ‘miserably failed’ to prove its case and rejected all the allegations against him”.They add: “The eight essentially duplicate cases against Jagtar violate the ‘double jeopardy’ principle that protects people from being put on trial more than once for the same crime, enshrined in both international and Indian law.”The letter to Starmer has been signed by other victims of arbitrary detention including the British Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe; her husband, Richard Ratcliffe; Matthew Hedges, a British academic formerly held in the United Arab Emirates; and his partner, Daniela Tejada. Abd el-Fattah’s cousin Omar Robert Hamilton, one of the lead coordinators of the Free Alaa campaign, is also a signatory.In the letter, coordinated by the campaign group Redress, they say they are “deeply concerned” by Johal’s continued detention and ask the prime minister to raise the case with a renewed urgency when he travels to India for the Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai. They say Johal has been facing a possible death sentence after charges were brought against him principally on the basis of a confession extracted under torture.“India’s National Investigation Agency courts often take decades to reach a verdict. As we know from painful experience, the mental torture of being arbitrarily detained with no end in sight can cause extreme suffering,” they write.Following Johal’s’ acquittal in the first case against him, his prison conditions have worsened, it is understood. He is held in almost total solitary confinement and subjected to regular searches of his cell.The letter says: “We urge you to use your first visit to India as prime minister to make clear to Prime Minister Modi that allied countries do not treat each other’s citizens this way, and that what happens to Jagtar will have long-lasting consequences, both for India’s reputation on the international stage, and the future of its relations with the UK.”Starmer raised Johal’s case with Modi during his visit to London in the summer but, the letter says, “raising the case is not enough. Ministers in the previous government claimed to have raised Jagtar’s case more than 100 times with their Indian counterparts, but he remains in prison and it’s hard to see that any progress was made as a result of these interventions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starmer and the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, repeatedly raised Abd el-Fattah’s case with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.Indian authorities do not claim that Johal was directly involved in alleged assaults on Hindu leaders in the Punjab region in 2016 and 2017, but accuse him of transferring funds to support them.That allegation was rejected in court as Indian prosecutors failed to present any reliable evidence to back it up despite having had more than seven years to build a case.National Investigation Agency prosecutors were severely criticised in the verdict for having “failed to collect cogent and convincing evidence during investigation regarding participation of the accused in unlawful activities”, and having “miserably failed to prove” the commission of the various alleged offences.Critics point out that there is “no CCTV footage, no bank transfer records, no email or phone call evidence” that directly links Johal to the crimes.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyIndiaKeir StarmerSouth and central AsiaLabourSikhismNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

Rates of the disease have risen and are projected to increase further by 2040, linked to people holidaying in sunny countries.IARC’s view, and a report that year by the UK’s Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (Comare), led the government to outlaw the use of sunbeds for under-18s in England and Wales.However, regulation of tanning salons has failed because a sizeable minority of 16- and 17-year-olds still use them, the co-authors of an opinion article wrote in the BMJ.Colon cancer is on the rise among young people – and research points to one major culprit | Devi SridharRead moreThe WorldCancerResearch Fund (WCRF) backed the closure of tanning salons. The co-authors estimate it would cost between £11m and £55m. Last year there were an estimated 4,231 salons in England and 232 in Wales. The number in Scotland and Northern Ireland was unknown.“It’s a well-known fact that sunbeds increase the risk of skin cancer and there are safer alternatives like fake tan. That’s why phasing out sunbeds would help reduce cancer risk and support people to live longer, healthier lives,”saidKate Oldridge-Turner, WCRF’s head of policy and public affairs.But while Cancer Research UK warned people not to use sunbeds, it did not endorse the call.“Despite what people might hear on social media, there is no such thing as safe tanning using sunbeds. It’s illegal to allow anyone under the age of 18 to use sunbeds, and it’s vital that this is properly enforced,” said Fiona Osgun, its head of health information.“Some people are more at risk of skin cancer than others, including those with lighter skin tones, lots of freckles or moles, or a history of burning easily.“But everyone who uses sunbeds increases their risk of cancer. Nearly nine in 10 cases of melanoma are caused by exposure to too much UV radiation from the sun and sunbeds.“If you want to look tanned, it’s much safer to get a spray tan or use fake tan from a bottle.”The government urged people not to use sunbeds and said it was considering further steps to tackle the harm they cause.“Commercial sunbeds significantly increase the risk of melanoma and other skin cancers from UV radiation. It is strongly advised not to use them at all,” a government spokesperson said.“Anyone considering using a sunbed should understand the serious health risks. We are looking at the evidence and considering next steps.”Explore more on these topicsSkin cancerCancerHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

We will reduce the pull factors.”The policies are a riposte to Reform’s plans announced last week to strip the status of indefinite leave to remain [ILR] from hundreds of thousands of non-EU citizens who already have it and to force them to reapply for visas under stricter criteria.Foreigners underrepresented among prisoners in England and Wales, report findsRead moreStarmer is under intense pressure from within his own party to fight back against the growing electoral threat of Nigel Farage’s party.In advance of the European Political Community (EPC) summit on Thursday, where leaders will discuss how to tackle illegal migration, Starmer said: “We’re making fundamental changes to what those granted asylum are afforded in the UK.“Settlement must be earned by contributing to our country, not by paying a people-smuggler to cross the Channel in a boat.“The UK will continue to play its role in welcoming genuine refugees fleeing persecution. But we must also address the pull factors driving dangerous and illegal small-boat crossings. There will be no golden ticket to settling in the UK, people will have to earn it.”In September,the government suspended the family reunion routethat allowed people with recognised refugee status or humanitarian protection to sponsor close relatives to join them. The route, which admitted spouses or partners and dependent children under 18, granted 4,671 family reunion visas in the year ending June 2025.Starmer’s comments follow the announcement by the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, on Monday that the government will imposenew requirements on those seeking ILR to settle in the UK.Mahmood said those seeking to settle permanently, most of whom come to the UK through regular routes, will face requirements of a higher standard of English, proof that they have contributed to society, and will be excluded if they have a criminal record.Ministers will also examine whether to impose similar requirements upon those given asylum, sources said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This approach didn’t work then and there is no evidence to suggest it will work now.“Restricting family reunion only pushes more desperate people into the arms of smugglers in an effort to reunite with loved ones … family reunion overwhelmingly supported women and children – who made up nine out of 10 visas granted through this route in the last year.”Kolbassia Haoussou, a director at the charity Freedom from Torture and a refugee, said: “The men, women and children who come to the UK seeking sanctuary – just as I did – want nothing more than safety and the chance to rebuild their lives as part of strong and vibrant communities.“Blocking our chance to settle or to reunite with family members still at risk of harm keeps people like us and our children on the outside, never really allowed to feel secure or like we truly belong.“These measures are taken straight from the populist playbook the government itself has condemned.”On Wednesday, Starmer said he would look at how international law is being interpreted by British courts in an effort to tackle small boats, which he labelled“Farage boats”because of their increase in number since Brexit.Before leaving the EU, the UK was a signatory to the Dublin convention, which states that asylum seekers can be returned to the first member state they arrived in before their claims are considered.Starmer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that while “those genuinely fleeing persecution should be afforded asylum”, countries were experiencing “mass migration in a way that we have not seen in previous years”.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumRefugeesLabourKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

In 1977 she founded the Jane Goodall Institute, which works to protect the species and supports youth projects aimed at benefiting animals and the environment.She was considered the leading expert on chimpanzees, her career spanning more than 60 years. Her research was pivotal in proving the similarities in primate and human behaviour.The renowned conservationist was on stage in New York just last week, before appearing talking about her work on a Wall Street Journal podcast two days later.She was due to appear at a speaking event reflecting on her long life and career in Los Angeles on 3 October, before another event in Washington DC the following week.View image in fullscreenJane Goodall photographed in London in 2017.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianTributes poured in from around the world from conservation and animal rights charities, as the UN praised how she had “worked tirelessly for our planet and all its inhabitants, leaving an extraordinary legacy for humanity and nature”.Greenpeace UK’s co-executive director, Will McCallum, said Goodall was “one of the true conservation giants of our time”.After developing a love of animals from an early age, Goodall visited a friend in Kenya in the late 1950s and began working for an archaeologist there, who sent her to study primate behaviour in London.While still in her 20s, Goodall began researching chimpanzees at Gombe Stream national park in Tanzania. Her work observing their social behaviour helped challenge the idea that only humans could use tools and that chimps were vegetarian.She went on to set up the Jane Goodall Institute to improve the understanding and treatment of primates, and to protect their natural habitats with the help of local people. It now has officers in more than 25 countries around the world.Goodall, who was awarded the title of Messenger of Peace by the UN in 2002, was an outspoken advocate of environmental issues and campaigned against the use of animals in medical research and zoos.View image in fullscreenJane Goodall in the 1965 CBS television special Miss Goodall and the World of Chimpanzees.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesIn 1991, the institute launched the Roots and Shoots project to involve young people in conservation. The project started with a group of students working with Goodall but went on to create a network of active young people across nearly 100 countries.Earlier this year, the institute’s Hope Through Action project facedfunding cutsfrom the US government under Donald Trump, after it had been pledged $29.5m (£22m) over five years.The initiative was designed to protect endangered chimpanzees and their habitats in western Tanzania through reforestation and “community-led methodology” to conserve biodiversity and improve local livelihoods.Well into her 80s, Goodall showed little sign of slowing down as she continued to write and speak about her work. During the pandemic, she launched a podcast called Hopecast in which she interviewed other environmentalists and activists.She was made a dame in 2004, and earlier this year received the Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian honour, from the outgoing president, Joe Biden. In 2022, her legacy was marked in more unusual fashion in the form of a Jane Goodall Barbie doll, as part of the producer’s series on inspiring women.In a2023 interviewwith the Guardian, she spoke of the importance of focusing on making any kind of difference rather than trying to solve the world’s problems.“We have a window of time to change this planet’s course, but it’s rapidly closing,” she said. “If governments do what they say they’ll do, we still have a chance.”View image in fullscreenJane Goodall at chimp rescue centre in Entebbe, Uganda in 2018.Photograph: Sumy Sadurni/AFP/Getty ImagesLooking back on her childhood, she remembered an early appetite for discovery, hiding inside a hen house for hours to find out where eggs come from. “When I finally returned, Mum had called the police,” she said. “I’d been missing for hours. Instead of punishing me, she listened intently to my discoveries.”Her mother was instrumental in pushing her to pursue her dreams, including volunteering on her daughter’s first expedition because women were not allowed to travel solo.In 2021, Goodall published The Book of Hope, in which she admitted she sometimes felt she was fighting a losing battle, but explained how she kept going.Speaking to the Guardianat the time, she said: “You have to feel depressed, but then there’s something that says: ‘There is still an awful lot left and that’s what we’ve got to fight to save.’“So then you get extra energy. I have days when I feel like not getting up, but it doesn’t last long. I guess because I’m obstinate.“I’m not going to give in. I’ll die fighting, that’s for sure.”Explore more on these topicsJane GoodallPrimatologynewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “I think any foreign person is the worst to deal with.”Later he says of an alleged overstayer: “Either put a bullet through his head or deport him.”One sergeant made repeated sexualised remarks including about masturbation, and other officers are caught on tape talking about stamping on suspects, injuring those who do not comply and elbowing a suspect in leg restraints repeatedly in the face.Officers were also recorded discussing falsifying a statement after force was used, and avoiding making admissions in front of police cameras in their station meant to deter and detect wrongdoing.At the highest levels of the Met, as well as at City Hall and in national government, there is a fear, if not expectation, that the revelations will damage confidence in the force and cast doubt on claims it is reforming radically enough after years of scandal and damning reports.In a sign of the tensions, officers booed and jeered the Met deputy commissioner, Matt Jukes, at the National BlackPoliceAssociation (NBPA) conference when he refused to accept that Britain’s biggest force was institutionally racist.A report in 2023 by Louise Casey, commissioned by the Met after themurder of Sarah Everardby a serving officer, found the Metto be institutionally racist, misogynistic and prejudiced.Rowley – who became commissioner of the Met in 2022 – immediately rejected those terms, while saying he accepted the report’s findings of wholesale failings and toxicity.The London mayor,Sadiq Khan, said he would announce the much-delayed follow-up inquiry into the Met that Lady Casey wanted, checking how much the Met had changed.Jukes was scrambled to attend the conference of black officers on Wednesday as the Met was plunged into crisis by the alleged actions of its own officers, telling the audience the behaviours were “a matter of profound shame and regret”.Jukes, a strong favourite to be the next Met commissioner, warned of “gangsterish behaviours” among officers, covering up for wrongdoing and “coercing” others to do the same.View image in fullscreenA still from a BBC documentary about misogyny and racism inside the Met.Photograph: UNPIXS/BBCRowley said the BBC programme exposed “appalling and criminal” behaviour, apologised and vowed to investigate “deeper into the corrupt networks and cliques our actions have driven underground”.Since Rowley took charge in September 2022, the Met says it has ousted 1,500 officers who fell short of expected standards.Rowley said: “The behaviour depicted in this programme is reprehensible and completely unacceptable.“Officers behaving in such appalling, criminal ways let down our communities and will cause some to question if their sons and daughters are safe in our cells, and whether they would be believed and respected as victims of crime. For that, I am truly sorry.”He promised that “where there is incontrovertible evidence of racism, misogyny, anti-Muslim sentiment or bragging about excessive use of force”, those responsible would be “put on a fast-track hearing within weeks and on a path to likely dismissal”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This comes down to not more reports, not more recommendations, this comes down to leadership and implementation.”Imran Khan, the solicitor forDoreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was murdered by racists who stayed free because of police errors, said: “The police service now is as bad as it ever was. If the commissioner does not do anything about it, he has to go.”TheLondonmayor, along with the home secretary, has responsibility for the Met and said:“I have met with the commissioner to discuss directly the issues exposed by the BBC – and its impact on public confidence and trust in the police …“I will continue to work with the commissioner and hold him to account to ensure Londoners get the police they deserve. In support of that, I will soon be announcing details of a planned follow-up to the Casey review.”Alison Lowe, West Yorkshire’s deputy mayor for policing and crime, said she feared a national fallout: “People will see what is happening in Charing Cross and think that applies everywhere.”Andy George, the president of the NBPA, said Rowley had not taken the challenges on race and other bad behaviours seriously enough, sidelining – instead of listening to – black officers, and called for the Met to be broken up, adding: “What I see is a lot of chickens coming home to roost.”The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said: “The disturbing scenes in this footage are sickening. I welcome the Independent Office for Police Conduct fully and urgently investigating all the issues raised in this report.“It is right that the Metropolitan police have condemned this, and we fully support their pledge to root out those unfit to serve the public. I know this is a top priority for the commissioner.“We have given police chiefs the powers to automatically sack officers who fail background checks and dismiss those guilty of gross misconduct, and we expect them to be used.”Panorama: Undercover in the Policeis on BBC One at 9pm on Wednesday and is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsMetropolitan policePoliceMark RowleyRaceSadiq KhanLondonViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

This week it said it wouldrestart limited manufacturing“in the coming days”.The production freeze has left many parts makers in a desperate position, without income for more than month.The Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), a lobby group representing many JLR suppliers, warned that without urgent government intervention the whole of the UK automotive supply chain could face irreversible damage, threatening thousands of jobs and an industrytargeted for growthby the Labour government.Michael Beese, the managing director of Genex UK, which presses metal parts for several suppliers to JLR, said commercial banks had said that in order to get an expensive loan, suppliers would need to give personal guarantees that could expose them to losing their houses and other assets.“I looked at getting a loan but was quoted interest of 16% and they wanted personal guarantees,” Beese said. “Why should I put my business and family home on the line when I’ve done nothing wrong?”Beese said he had been forced to lay off some of Genex’s 17 workers because of a cash shortage. Other suppliers have said loans are not an option for some small companies because they fear breaching rules on directors’ legal responsibilities.JLR is considering upfront payments to its direct suppliers in order to inject cash as quickly as possible, according to two people with knowledge of talks. However, it does not have a direct relationship with much of its supply chain, so it would be reliant on bigger suppliers quickly passing on cash to smaller companies.The business secretary, Peter Kyle, announced on Saturday that the government would provide a guarantee tounderwrite a £1.5bn private loanfor JLR, although that deal is not thought to have been formally completed. JLR has agreed another £2bn in new debt from banks without state support.However, the government has not pledged any cash to JLR or its supply chain since the hack, and several people in the automotive industry told the Guardian they believed the £1.5bn loan guarantee had been rushed out ahead of the Labour party’s conference in Liverpool without addressing the key issues caused by the hack.The government loan guarantee was meant to help parts manufacturers indirectly but some smaller suppliers believe it will take too long to trickle down from “tier one” makers of larger assemblies of components to the generally smaller “tier two” companies who supply parts to them in turn.Even if tier one companies receive invoices for new work, under UK law they have up to 60 days to make those payments to the second tier.The CBM told the Guardian there was “little prospect of second-tier and lower-tier suppliers receiving any funding in the short term” and it called for direct government support for companies further down the chain.Steve Morley, the CBM’s president, said: “This is the only way we can get money quickly to where it is needed most, to prevent the supply chain from collapsing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our focus now must be on ensuring that second-tier and smaller suppliers are supported so the whole framework is in place when production restarts.”Across the supply chain, thousands of workers have been laid off, according to industry sources.Beese said: “We’ve kept working, building some stock, to keep our employees in work but we’ve run out of space and material. I have now laid off staff due to the uncertain short-term future. Our customers can’t give us clear plans moving forward, so now I’m faced with some really tough decisions.”One option suggested by the CBM is using the British Business Bank’s growth guarantee scheme, for which the government underwrites lending to smaller businesses. Other suppliers have previously asked ministers for atemporary freeze on tax billsand some form of support for workers’ wages.A Labour source said: “The government acted quickly to ensure JLR and its suppliers could receive support as soon as possible given the tens of thousands of jobs depending on the business.”Small suppliers also called for improved communication from JLR on its progress in restarting production so that they could have a better picture of how long they will have to survive without orders.JLR, owned by India’s Tata, has been unable to give firm restart dates because it has had to rebuild all of its production systems, so it has been unable to make orders for parts. JLR has set up a helpdesk for suppliers.The government’s business department was approached for comment. The British Business Bank declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsJaguar Land RoverAutomotive industryManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Now theTrump administrationis threatening to implement another sweeping wave of cuts to their ranks.Shutdownscause widespread disruption – both to government services and the lives and livelihoods of the staff that typically work to deliver them.What does a government shutdown mean and why is this year’s more serious?Read moreClaire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of the Feeding America network of food banks, warned “many people” in the US are “a single missed paycheck” away from needing to turn to a food bank for support. “A prolonged shutdown will deepen the strain, and more families will seek help at a time when food banks are already stretched due to sustained high need,” she said in a statement.The shutdown “hurts federal workers in many ways”, Kirwan, who organizes with the Federal Unionists Network, said. “We want to be working. We want to be serving the public.”During a shutdown, many federal workers, especially those earning less than $100,000 annually, are forced to dip into savings, rack up credit-card debt, or take out loans to survive until they receive back pay when the government reopens, Kirwan said.“And that doesn’t even go into all the emotional and psychological harm too. We are federal workers because we care deeply about the federal government, and we care deeply about serving our constituents and the public,” he added. “To be kept from our ability to serve the American public, it hurts.”“And then”, Kirwan continued, “you add in the fear that we might be fired”.The Trump administration has faced criticism for ordering federal agencies todraw up plans for mass-scale firingsin the event of a government shutdown. The US presidentsuggestedhe would use the pause to “get rid of a lot of things we didn’t want” earlier this week.Trump has already overseenthe largest mass resignation in US historythis week, with more than 100,000 federal workers set to formally quit as part of the latest wave of his administration’sdeferred resignation program.Now workers are left wondering if this shutdown will leave them out of work temporarily, or set the stage for their permanent termination.In a memo seen by the Guardian, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) announced a “reduction in force” (RIF) program of layoffs at the agency on Wednesday, the first reported agency to do so.“Approximately one percent of the USPTO workforce will be affected by this RIF,” wrote Valencia Martin Wallace, acting commissioner for the USPTO, wrote to employees at the agency. The USPTO did not respond to a request for commentAt the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), only about 1,700 out of 15,000 workers are set to keep working during the shutdown.“The workers who do the majority of the frontline work will be furloughed and potentially RIF’ed,” said Justin Chen, an environmental engineer and president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA workers. “We may be recalled foremergencies, but the workers who do the work which prevents those emergencies won’t be done.”Even workers who are still working, for the time being, are bracing for possible layoffs amid the shutdown.“We still are yet again finding, as federal employees, a level of concern as our livelihoods being used as a pawn, being used in this showdown betweenDonald Trumpand the oligarchs against the working class,” said Colin Smalley, who works for the US army corps of engineers in Chicago, and represents 300 workers as president of International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 777. “They are trying to extract these big changes on the backs of the public services federal workers provide and our communities run on.”The Trump administration estimates it willcutthe federal workforce by about 300,000 workers by the end of the year.Much of these cuts have yet to be reflected in monthly jobs report data, which will not be released due to the shutdown. As of August, federal employment is down97,000 jobs.The last shutdown started in December 2018 and lasted 35 days, until January 2019, costing the US economy anestimated $11bn, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Kirwan suggested the federal government, since Trump took office, has already effectively been operating under a partial shutdown, with about one-eighth of the federal workforce removed, several agencies dismantled and programs eliminated.“We do not want a shutdown, but we know that the most important thing is standing up against further harms through our programs,” he said. “More and more harm has been happening every single month to programs that are critical and that tens of millions of Americans rely upon.“I hope that the budget that is passed will come with assurances that will protect against further harms to critical programs, because we serve the public. Our government serves the public, and we need to make sure that there are no further harms to those programs.”Labor unionsfileda lawsuit on Tuesday over the firing threats, alleging the move is unlawful and an effort to punish workers and pressure Congress.“Announcing plans to fire potentially tens of thousands of federal employees simply because Congress and the administration are at odds on funding the government past the end of the fiscal year is not only illegal – it’s immoral and unconscionable,” said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, in a statement. “Federal employees dedicate their careers to public service – more than a third are military veterans – and the contempt being shown them by this administration is appalling.”Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025US politicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS work & careersEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Before his nomination, Antoni was an outspoken critic of the bureau and implied, with no evidence, that its data reporting was biased.Stan Veuger, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, called the withdrawal of Antoni’s nomination “good news in and of itself”.US set for largest mass resignation in history as Trump continues deep cutsRead more“Antoni was genuinely unqualified and had clearly been picked based on his willingness to produce highly partisan content,” Veuger said. “That said, it remains to be seen what comes next.”The White House has not detailed why it withdrew Antoni’s nomination. Antoni would have needed approval from the Senate to officially step into the role.Reportssuggested that some senators, including Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, had refused to meet with Antoni, suggesting it would have been hard to get his nomination through the chamber.Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard, said that the Senate “appears to have done its job and made it clear it would reject someone who was exceedingly unqualified for the job of BLS commissioner”.“I hope they go even further and demand nothing less than someone who is very qualified for the job. We will see,” he added.In a statement, the White House said that Antoni “is a brilliant patriot that will continue to do good work on behalf of our great country”.“President Trump is committed to fixing the longstanding failures of the BLS that have undermined the public’s trust in critical economic data,” the White House said. “The president plans to announce a new nominee very soon.”In a social media post after the White House withdrew Antoni’s nomination, the Heritage Foundation’s president, Kevin Roberts, said that “it was undeniable that the BLS needs reform and [Antoni] was the right man for the job”.“Antoni continues to be one of the sharpest economic minds in the country. EJ’s immense capabilities and insightful economic analysis have not changed – and we’re very proud to have him on our team,” Roberts wrote.When Trump fired McEntarfer, he claimed that the bureau had “rigged” its July jobs report against him, as it showed initial estimates of new jobs that were added to the economy had been overestimated by 250,000. But the bureau said that the updates came from businesses who answered its surveys, which it uses to collect data that comes in later – common when the economy is facing instability.Despite Trump’s criticism, economists have largely said that the bureau continues to operate in a nonpartisan manner, emphasizing that trust in the bureau is key as it reports information that shapes markets and policy decisions, including the status of inflation and the labor market.Dave Hebert, a senior fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research, a libertarian thinktank, said that if Antoni had been confirmed, “the integrity of the BLS would have been harmed”.“The BLS is the gold standard around the world for reliable and accurate economic data,” Herbert added. “Their integrity and independence must be protected if they are to maintain their status as the premier source of economic data in the world today.”Michael Madowitz, an economist at the liberal Roosevelt Institute and a former member of the data users advisory committee at the BLS, said that the agency, when it’s doing its job properly, should be “beneficial and boring”.“There are parts of the US government that do economic policy and parts that do public,” Madowitz said. “The concern until last night was putting ideological policy folks in charge of the plumbing, which would create lasting chaos.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS unemployment and employment dataUS unemployment and employment statisticsUS economyProject 2025Donald TrumpEconomicsShareReuse this content"

She has denied wrongdoing, and argued the president has no authority to fire her.On Wednesday morning the supreme court considered his attempt to remove Cook – the first-ever bid by a president to fire aFedofficial – and the administration’s complaints about judge’s order which had temporarily blocked Trump from firing her while litigation over the termination continues in a lower court.The justices declined to immediately decide a justice department request to put on hold the judge’s order, enabling Cook to stay in post for now.Abbe Lowell, of Lowell & Associates, and Norm Eisen, of the Democracy Defenders Fund, representing Cook, in a statement said: “The court’s decision rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on theFederal Reserveboard, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the court’s order.”The justice department was contacted for comment. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said the administration was looking forward to oral arguments before the court.Carl Tobias, at the University of Richmond School of Law, suggested that the decision to keep Cook in place, and the court’s announcement that it would hear oral arguments on the merits of the case in January, were “good signs for both sides”.“It does protect the independence of the Fed, at least in the short term,” Tobias told the Guardian. “The one big question is: even if they have arguments in January, when will they issue the ruling? That could come early, because I expect the government will ask them to expedite everything, but it could be as late as June.”The court’s decision to maintain the status quo in the short term should allow markets to “settle down” and mitigate the uncertainty around the Fed, he added.In creating the Federal Reserve in 1913, Congress passed a law called the Federal Reserve Act that included provisions to shield the central bank from political interference, requiring governors to be removed by a president only “for cause”, though the law does not define the term nor establish procedures for removal. The law has never been tested in court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cook has said the claims made by Trump against her did not give the president the legal authority to remove her and were a pretext to fire her because of her monetary policy stance.Trump has made no secret of his plans to influence the Fed, publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its interest-rate setting committee of policymakers.He has repeatedly broken with precedent to demand rate cuts, and attack senior Fed officials, including its chair,Jerome Powell, when they repeatedly defied these calls.Powell has repeatedly stressed he is “strongly committed” to maintaining the Fed’s independence.

Negotiations continue, though the three-year contract ended on 28 September.A central issue in bargaining is healthcare and the contribution the Broadway League makes to the union’s healthcare fund.Al Vincent Jr, executive director and lead negotiator for Actors’ Equity, said the union is asking Broadway’s employers to increase their contribution to the healthcare fund, which is projected to fall into a deficit by next May.The rate of contributions has been unchanged for more than a decade, even as smaller regional theaters in Kansas and Idaho oftentimes pay more, Vincent said.“Asking our employers to care for our bodies, and to pay their fair share toward our health insurance is not only reasonable and necessary, it’s an investment they should want to make toward the long-term success of their businesses,” Brooke Shields, Actors’ Equity’s president, said in a statement to Reuters, adding that she tore her meniscus on a Broadway show and continued dancing on it, “painfully”, for three months.“That’s just math. There are no Broadway shows without healthy Broadway actors and stage managers. And there are no healthy actors and stage managers without safe workplaces and stable health insurance.”The Broadway League issued a statement saying it continues to work toward an agreement.“We all want to sustain the magic of Broadway for our audience,” the Broadway League said in its statement to Reuters. “We are continuing good-faith negotiations with Actors Equity to reach a fair agreement that works for Broadway shows, casts, crews and the millions of people from around the world who come to experience Broadway.”Other sectors of the entertainment industry have been roiled by labor unrest, with Hollywood actors and writers striking in 2023, as they fought for better compensation in the streaming TV era and curbs on the use of artificial intelligence. Video game actors staged a nearly year-long walkout as they sought protections against the use of artificial intelligence.Stage actors have already authorized the bargaining committee to call a strike. On Friday, the union began delivering “strike pledge cards” to the stage door, asking performers and stage managers to commit to a walkout.Kaylin Seckel, an ensemble cast member of Disney’s The Lion King and understudy to Nala and Sarabi, said she ruptured her achilles tendon during a 2022 performance and had to be carried off-stage by her scene partner. She underwent surgery to repair the injury, and lengthy physical therapy to help her return to the stage. Although workers’ compensation covered many of her medical expenses, she relied on her union’s healthcare to pay for acupuncture and other treatments.“That was three years ago, and I require, to this day, other procedures and more physical therapy that I was denied under workers’ comp,” said Seckel. “So for performers and stage managers in this industry, where your jobs are dangerous ... without really good health insurance, it’s difficult for us to do our jobs.”The last major Actors’ Equity strike was in 1968, when a three-day dispute closed 19 Broadway shows. The New York City mayor intervened, and helped both sides come to an agreement.Explore more on these topicsBroadwayTheatreUS theaternewsShareReuse this content"

Crowdshave swelled, viewership milestoneshave toppled, franchise valuationsare soaringand formerly niche stars have broken into the mainstream. Yet as the league celebrates a second straight year of explosive growth, an old and thorny problem has risen to the surface: officiating.Complaints about referees have always been louder and more persistent in professional basketball relative to other sports due to the subjectivity of calls and sheer number of decisions. But in the WNBA’s 2025 season, the volume and intensity of the criticism from all sides have reached new heights. Coaches have been ejected and suspended. Star players have vented in press conferences and online. Fans have dissected blown calls with Zapruder-film rigor on social media.

Both had previously warned about unchecked physicality and inconsistency. “It’s not about bad calls,” Hammon said. “It’s about player safety.”Lynx star Collier says WNBA has ‘worst leadership in the world’ in withering broadsideRead moreHammon took it even further during the Aces’ semi-final series against Indiana: “The physicality is out of control, that’s for sure. You can bump and grab a receiver in the NFL for those first five yards, but in the W you can do it for the whole half court. You put two hands on somebody like that, it should be an automatic foul. Freedom of movement? There’s no freedom. I’m not saying we’re not fouling too. I’m saying it’s out of control. Most of my assistants come from the NBA, and they’re like, ‘This would not fly in the NBA.’ This level of physicality would not fly in the NBA.”Collier herself added fuel to the fire on Tuesday at Minnesota’s exit interviews, where she delivered a sensational four-and-a-half-minuteprepared statementsaying that officiating “has now reached levels of inconsistency that plague our sport and undermine the integrity in which it operates”. She accused the league of “negligence” in ignoring “issues that everyone inside the game is begging to be fixed”, warning that the lack of accountability was eroding trust in the product itself. The unusually blunt words from a five-time All-Star and players’ union vice-president reverberated across the league. Fever guard Lexie Hullsaidshe was “really proud of [Collier] for making that statement,” adding that “things need to change, reffing needs to change, leadership needs to change”.Beneath the outrage lies a deeper question: is this simply poor refereeing, or in step with the league’s philosophy? The WNBA has long positioned itself asgrittier than the NBA, a style that encourages officials to “let them play” even when contact edges into dangerous territory. Unlike in the NBA, there is little sense of star protection; marquee players from Diana Taurasi to Caitlin Clarkhave often absorbed bruising contactwithout whistles.The New York Liberty show investment in women’s sports is simply good businessRead moreThere is no evidence of a formal directive, but critics argue that this tolerance for physicality has become ingrained in the league’s DNA, leaving a thinly resourced officiating corps to manage the consequences. Players have echoed the concern. Stars like Kelsey Plum, Angel Reese and Natasha Cloud all questioned officiating this season, arguing that the problem was less isolated mistakes than the nightly uncertainty over what would and would not be called.No player has drawn more attention than Clark. In one regular-season matchup, the second-year Fever star was poked in the eye, then shoved to the ground by Connecticut’s Marina Mabrey. Officials assessed only a technical foul. Aftera storm of outrage, the league upgraded the penalty to a flagrant two. The episode crystallized a perception that referees were ill-equipped to handle the physical play surrounding the WNBA’s most hyped newcomer. When Clark later needled officials on social media following Indiana’s first-round playoff clincher – “The refs couldn’t stop us” – shewas fined $200, a reminder that players pay a price for public criticism even as referees face little visible accountability.View image in fullscreenLos Angeles Sparks star Kelsey Plum unleashed a profanity-laced rant after a June loss to the Golden State Valkyries, saying she was “sick” of the lack of foul calls against her opponents.Photograph: Luke Hales/Getty ImagesWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert has been careful in her language. She acknowledged concerns during All-Star weekend, stressing that “every play is reviewed” and that hours are spent on follow-up training. “Consistency is important,” she said. “Some people observe our game versus other formats and think there aren’t a ton of fouls called, but consistency is the name of the game.”The structural disadvantages, however, are real. Unlike the NBA, the WNBA has no off-site replay center; referees on the floor must review plays themselves, a process that can both slow the game and introduce bias. The league also forgoes theLast Two Minute reportsthat have become a transparency standard in the NBA since their introduction in 2015. With fewer staff devoted to officiating oversight, referees operate with less support and monitoring than their NBA counterparts – another reason coaches and players believe inconsistency has become entrenched.Has the WNBA become a brutal league, or are we just paying more attention now?Read moreBehind the scenes, the officiating pipeline has long had built-in constraints. For two decades, the NBA’s developmental G League has been the proving ground for referees with ambitions of reaching the NBA. Some of those officials are also assigned to the WNBA. The pipeline ensures technical competence but fuels a widespread perception: that the WNBA is treated as a stepping stone rather than a destination.Accountability exists, though unevenly. Officials can be fined for misapplying rules or for unprofessional interactions with team staff, but not simply for missed calls later overturned on replay. A referee who repeatedly underperforms may eventually lose their job, but more often they are passed over for coveted playoff assignments. Monty McCutchen, the WNBA’s head of officiating, insists “we hold people accountable in various ways to their body of work,” yet coaches and players remain unconvinced.The economics underline the gap. WNBA referees are paid per game – about $1,500 for rookies and up to $2,500 for veterans – less than many earn in college basketball. By contrast, NBA referees are salaried employees earning between $150,000 and $550,000 annually. Sue Blauch, the WNBA’s head of referee performance and development, argues that the league’s shorter season makes full-time referees unrealistic. Many WNBA officials supplement their income with college assignments, an arrangement that reinforces the sense of second-tier status.View image in fullscreenNo player has drawn more attention amid the WNBA’s refereeing controversy than Indiana’s Caitlin Clark.Photograph: Emilee Chinn/Getty ImagesFew believe officials are acting in bad faith; rather, many argue the system sets them up to fail. With limited resources, inconsistent training opportunities and the weight of unprecedented attention, referees are asked to manage a product that has outgrown the infrastructure around it.The WNBA is enjoying the most rapid growth in its 29-year history. With it comes sharper scrutiny: every mistake magnified, every missed whistle replayed millions of times. Yet in an era when women’s basketball is finally drawing casual fans and international headlines, viral officiating controversies risk overshadowing the product itself.All of this sets the stage for Friday night’s finals opener. On the floor will be some of the league’s biggest stars, including Phoenix’s Thomas and Las Vegas’simperious A’ja Wilson. Millions of fans will be watching in a sold-out Michelob Ultra Arena and across the country on television. And at the middle of it all will be three referees, tasked with managing the most important games of the year under the harshest glare the league has ever faced.If calls are crisp and games flow, the noise may fade. But if controversy flares, the finals risk being reduced to another round of outrage. For Engelbert and her leadership team, whose authority looks as fragile as ever, these games are more than a championship. They are a test of whether the WNBA can rise above the shadow of its officiating – or risk being defined by it.Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballLas Vegas AcesPhoenix MercuryMinnesota LynxIndiana FeverUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Browns announced on Wednesday that they were benching Joe Flacco after he struggled to lead the offense in the first four games.“From the second [Gabriel] has been here, he’s been working very hard,” Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski said. “He’s a very intelligent young man. He’s done a nice job throughout practice, and this whole season he’s been learning how to get yourself ready and understand the rhythm of anNFLweek and what that looks like as a backup. Obviously, now feel like he’s ready to go as a starter.”The switch to Gabriel is sure to reignite questions about whether Shedeur Sanders may eventually factor as Cleveland’s starter. He has been the third-string quarterback the first four weeks, and on Wednesday the Browns said he will remain in that position. Flacco will be Gabriel’s backup. Sanders, the son of hall of famer Deion Sanders, generated huge amounts of attention when hedropped to the fifth round of this year’s draftafter many thought he would go in the first two. He completed 17 of 29 passes for 152 yards and two touchdowns in two preseason games.Sanders has come under criticism for talking about his role with the Browns in recent weeks. “If you see the [quality of] quarterback play in the league right now, I know I’m capable of doing better than that,” Sanders told ESPN Cleveland last week.After the Browns named Dillon Gabriel their new starting quarterback, Shedeur Sanders reacted with a full mime:pic.twitter.com/0qa23cpdOb— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter)October 1, 2025When asked about the Browns’ quarterback situation on Wednesday, following the news of Flacco’s benching, Sanders repeatedly answered bygrinning then silently moving his mouthin response. A member of the Browns staff then cut the interviews short.When asked if he had considered elevating Sanders to Gabriel’s backup, Stefanski said his “focus is on this game”.Cleveland are 1-3 and ranked next-to-last in scoring this season, averaging 14 points per game. The team has scored 17 points or fewer in nine straight games dating back to last season. Gabriel will be the fifth different starting QB in the Browns’ last 10 games, joining Jameis Winston, Dorian Thompson-Robinson, Bailey Zappe and Flacco.The draft roughed up Shedeur Sanders. The NFL will demand even moreRead moreGabriel was selected in the third round of April’s draft. He has seen action in two games – Week 2 at Baltimore and Week 4 at Detroit – and has completed all three of his passes for 19 yards and a touchdown. He was named the backup quarterback at the end of training camp after the Browns traded Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders.During the preseason, Gabriel led the Browns to either a touchdown or field goal on five of his seven drives. He also directed a pair of two-minute, first-half drives against the Philadelphia Eagles and Los Angeles Rams. In his two preseason outings, Gabriel completed 25 of 37 passes for 272 yards with one touchdown and one interception.It is easy to see why the Browns benched Flacco. Among the 33 quarterbacks who have made at least 56 pass attempts, the 40-year-old is last in the league with a 60.3 passer rating, has the second-worst completion rate (58.1%) and his six interceptions are second most.The 18-year veteran completed only 16 of 34 passes for 184 yards, two interceptions and a fumble in last Sunday’s 34-10 loss to Detroit. The Browns offense is ranked 27th in total yards (279.8 yards per game), 20th in passing (195 yards per game) and 30th in rushing (84.8 yards per game).Explore more on these topicsCleveland BrownsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is now eight wins out of eight in theChampions Leaguewith zero goals conceded. And if you add in the Europa League from earlier in his tenure, it is 14 victories out of 14 with two goals against.Olympiakos pitched up with a remarkable statistic of their own. They had won on their past three visits to this ground, the most recent two coming in the knockout rounds of the Europa League, even if the second in 2020-21 did not prevent an aggregate defeat. The first was in a Champions League group‑stage match in 2015-16.Arsenal 2-0 Olympiakos: Champions League – live reactionRead moreNobody expected anything other than anotherArsenalsuccess, the latest demonstration of the power and depth that Arteta has at his disposal despite this being a decent Olympiakos vintage. It was nervier than the home crowd would have liked in the closing stages, the visitors pushing and making for a couple of scares.This Arsenal team is not easily breached. We are into October and still they have let in only three goals in all competitions – one of them from open play. Gabriel Martinelli scored in the 12th minute and although Olympiakos had their moments they could not find a way past David Raya.Arsenal were wasteful in the final third. Martinelli was guilty and so were Arteta’s other starters in the front line – Viktor Gyökeres and Leandro Trossard. But when Bukayo Saka, on as a substitute, took a pass from the excellent Martin Ødegaard to jam a shot through the legs of the Olympiakos goalkeeper, Kostas Tzolakis, in stoppage time, it was over. Arsenal have built on the2-0 win at Athletic Bilbaoin their Champions League opener. Nights such as this only add extra layers to their reputation.Arsenal had to go back to November 2019 for the previous time they had failed to win a group match at this stadium in Europe; it was the defeat against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, which led to the sacking of Unai Emery, the caretaker hire of Freddie Ljungberg and the arrival of Arteta, whose first European assignment was against Olympiakos in the last 32 of the competition that season. It ended in alast-gasp extra‑time defeathere and an away‑goals exit.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka puts Arsenal out of sight late on with their second goal against Olympiakos.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersOf the numerous eye-catching lines around this encounter, many were linked to the past. When had Arsenal previously conceded a goal in a European group game on their own turf? It was against Rapid Vienna in the 4-1 Europa League win in December 2020.Ødegaard was in the mood from the first whistle, bringing the urgency on the ball; the incision. The captain sparked an early move that ended with Martinelli somehow glancing a Myles Lewis-Skelly cross off target; Martinelli was all alone in front of goal. It seemed to come off his shoulder.No matter. It was not long before Arsenal led and it was Martinelli with the tap-in from a tight angle after Gyökeres saw Tzolakis deflect his shot against a post. Ødegaard had played the pass to Gyökeres and it was all about the striker’s strength; he bulldozed in between two defenders to make it happen.It was Martinelli on his less favoured right flank; Trossard on the left. And Martinelli simply had to play in his teammate on 21 minutes when Arsenal broke with two against one. Instead, he tried to out-run the last man and could not get around him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gyökeres swiped another chance high after a lovely Trossard ball.Late Dier penalty for Monaco pegs back Manchester City after Haaland doubleRead moreOlympiakos came to play. Ayoub El Kaabi looped a header too close to Raya just before Martinelli’s goal and their big chance of the first half came in the 32nd minute when Daniel Podence caught a volley so sweetly from Santiago Hezze’s cross. Raya tipped over – an outstanding reflex save.The mood was different in the second half. It was not the handbrake from Arteta but his idea seemed to be containment. Arsenal changed down through the gears. Trossard blew a couple of chances and there was anxiety in the home seats; cries for their players to wake up as they survived an Olympiakos thrust on 66 minutes.Podence’s cross was made to measure for El Kaabi, whose header was well saved by Raya. The striker poked home on the rebound but the offside flag had gone up against him. Arteta, who would withdraw Gabriel Magalhães as a precaution against injury, saw Tzolakis deny Ødegaard; he should not have been able to make the save. Olympiakos retained hope.

Hatton, who secured the half in the Sunday singles thatguaranteed victory for Europe, has told home fans not to seek retribution in Ireland in two years’ time.Tom Watson says he was ‘ashamed’ of US fans’ conduct at Ryder CupRead more“If it was my choice, and what I say isn’t really going to affect how people behave, I don’t really think that the insults are the way forward,” Hatton said. “Some guys on the team had it a lot worse than others. For me, there were a lot of insults maybe around height or hairline or weight, some of which I pretty much say to myself anyway, so it wasn’t like anything new.“But I would much prefer it to be a respectful atmosphere. You let the guys play and the best team wins – rather than trying to affect the outcome by trying to put off players or things like that. I don’t think it will be as hostile as maybe it was last week. I’d like to think that it will be very respectful.”The US captain, Keegan Bradley, whorefused to condemn the “passionate” home fansat Bethpage, claimed behaviour at the New York course was no different to that in Rome two years ago, when Europe last hosted. Hatton, who went unbeaten for a second successive Ryder Cup, disagrees.“Personally I don’t think they were close at all,” the Englishman said. “Certainly with what I heard last week, I don’t think Rome comes anywhere near that. I think they are quite far apart.”The PGA of America chief executive, Derek Sprague, told the Golf Channel he intends to contact McIlroy in person to apologise for what he and his wife went through. “I do plan on sending them an email with my heartfelt apologies for what occurred,” Sprague said. “There’s no place for that in theRyder Cupor in the game of golf.“I can’t wait to reach out to Rory and Erica and really, quite frankly, the entire European team. The whole European team should not have been subjected to that. And because of that, I feel badly and I plan on apologising to them.“When it [the Ryder Cup] started in 1927, it was about sportsmanship and integrity of the game, and that’s what we want it to be and continue to be and it’s unfortunate that people crossed the line last week.”However, Matt Fitzpatrick called out the organisation’s president, Don Rea, on Wednesday for his churlish reaction to the 15-13 home defeat at the trophy presentation. “I don’t want to speak on behalf of everyone but we did feel there was a little bit of bitterness when they presented the trophy,” Fitzpatrick said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gianluigi ­Donnarumma took the ball while the referee, Jesús Gil Manzano, jogged towards the pitchside monitor. The City goalkeeper was joined by Monaco players and Rúben Dias got in the middle of the matter before the backroom staff and teammates got involved. A Monaco coach was sent off, delaying the referee finally pointing to the spot. Dier was one of few to not relinquish their calm and did the rest.City should have finished the contest far earlier, enjoying 18 shots, but got only six on target. They enjoyed almost three-quarters of the possession but were unable to find a third goal, hindered by Monaco’s low block and a slow tempo. Equally, they had shown defensive vulnerability throughout the match, allowing Monaco more opportunities than their limited attacking intent merited.The Stade Louis II provides a tepid atmosphere and there was little in the opening skirmishes to suggest the crowd would be awoken by anything happening on the pitch. City were quiet in the opening quarter of an hour, doing their best to build attacks without finding a spark. City, however, are packed with quality players who have the ability to change things in a split second. On this occasion it was Josko Gvardiol’s turn to provide the dynamism, clipping a ball over the Monaco centre-backs for Haaland to reach, stretching his legs to flick over the onrushing Philipp Köhn with his first touch of the match.If this was supposed to be the beginning of the procession, Monaco were not willing victims, despite missing several key players. Folarin Balogun immediately missed a fine chance to equalise when he could not make contact with a header. He was relieved moments later thanks to lazy midfield play for City, who allowed Teze, a defender pushed into central midfield, too much time on the edge of the box. He picked his spot in the top corner and executed the shot perfectly to level three minutes after the opener.When Vanderson left the pitch in tears after becoming the latest Monaco player to succumb to injury, City took advantage of the rejig. ­Tijjani Reijnders went close with a low drive from the edge of the box, Bernardo Silva’s looping header to the back post was unfortunate to not find a teammate to finish off the move and Phil Foden sent a further warning by crashing a shot off the bar.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland heads in Manchester City’s second goal.Photograph: Kieran McManus/ShutterstockMoments after missing a fine chance to retake the lead, Haaland made amends by leaping to head a Nico O’Reilly cross precisely into the corner.

With Monaco operating in the lowest of blocks, it was imperative that the Norwegian was clinical when the chances arose, aided with his physical attributes. Without his strength, he would have not reached the pass for the opener nor jumped a height Mondo Duplantis would be proud of for the second.Champions League roundup: Napoli’s Højlund doubles up to sink SportingRead moreFor all the control, City remained vulnerable at the back. Balogun again missed a superb chance to bring parity when he found himself unmarked at the back post; he could not provide the quality ­Haaland does, to City’s relief. Soon after that, Krépin Diatta should have done ­better after catching O’Reilly daydreaming and ­Maghnes Akliouche forced ­Donnarumma into a smart save to his right.It felt as if a third was required for City to be comfortable in the latter stages but it never came.

But Boone removed Fried after he retired the first batter. Coming on in relief was Luke Weaver, who walked the first batter he faced, then allowed a double and Masataka Yoshida’s two-run single.MLB playoff predictions: will the Mariners finally break their title drought?Read moreDavid Bednar later gave up back-to-back hits in the ninth to give Boston some breathing room, putting Boone’s in-game pitching decisions under the microscope yet again in the aftermath of Tuesday night’s 3-1 loss.Boone defended his decision after the game. “I felt like [Fried’s] command was not as good those final few,” Boone said. “He’s just making so many big pitches, and his stuff was good. He gave us what we needed and felt really good about the outing he put forth, but I felt pretty convicted. Especially we got the double play, it’s like, ‘Let’s go get one more hitter and be good.’”Fried had thrown 102 pitches when he left the game, but said he felt like he “had enough in the tank for whatever the team needed.” He added: “I definitely felt good at the end, coming out feeling good. I’m going to stay in until I get the ball taken from me.”Boone made that call and handed the ball to Weaver, who has struggled since returning in June from a stint on the injured list with a strained hamstring. The righty had a 1.05 ERA in his first 24 appearances before getting hurt and then a 5.31 over his final 40 games.“I’ll take Weave there at the bottom of the order, especially with an out in the books,” Boone said.Weaver started Ceddanne Rafaela off with two strikes before walking him in an 11-pitch plate appearance. It snowballed from there with Nick Sogard doubling, Yoshida driving in two. Weaver didn’t record an out and exited with the Yankees trailing.“They put a good approach together, put the ball in play and found the holes,” Weaver said, describing his pitching as competitive. “I know there’s a lot of disappointed people, including myself, but I just got to be better.”There were plenty of pregame decisions questioned, too, with left-handed hitters Ben Rice, Jazz Chisholm Jr and Ryan McMahon not in the lineup against Boston starter Garrett Crochet, who got 23 outs before fellow lefty Aroldis Chapman recorded the final four to close it out. Crochet retired 17 consecutive batters after Anthony Volpe homered to give the Yankees a 1-0 lead.But after turning to Nestor Cortes in the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers last year – with Freddie Freeman hitting a walk-off grand slam in Game 1 on Cortes’ first pitch – and making other calls to the bullpen that didn’t work out, Boone put himself in position to be second-guessed again.He expressed no regret about the decisions afterward, other than lamenting Weaver not getting Rafaela out.“I felt good about him going through there: Sogard and then probably a pinch-hit lefty there,” Boone said. “They played a couple hits on him where [he left it] maybe just a little up with a couple of the pitches more than he wanted.”It’s a familiar script for the Yankees, whose bullpen ERA of 4.37 ranked 23rd out of 30 teams. That could have been forgotten if they scored after loading the bases with no outs in the ninth, but Chapman got out of the jam against his former team.New York had scored in 25 of their previous 28 innings when loading the bases with no outs.“One hit there and we tie the game,” said Paul Goldschmidt, who singled to begin the rally that fell short. “Unfortunately it didn’t work out but a good job to give ourselves a chance.”Game 1 wildcard resultsAmerican League:Boston Red Sox3-1 New York Yankees; Detroit Tigers 2-1 Cleveland Guardians.National League:San Diego Padres 1-3 Chicago Cubs; Cincinatti Reds 5-10 Los Angeles Dodgers.Explore more on these topicsNew York YankeesBoston Red SoxMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Saleh told Coen that he would “end your life” and “fuck your world up”. Coen told Saleh: “Keep my name out of your fucking mouth”.The usually excellent Ravens are in a hole. And it could get a lot deeperRead moreThe incident came a few days after Saleh had said the Jags were good at legally stealing signs from opposing teams.On Tuesday, Saleh said he had meant those comments as a compliment.“In my heart, genuinely, I was trying to give a compliment,” Saleh said. “I own the fact that I probably used the wrong choice of words, but however you want to word it, I mean, they’re really, really good at putting their players in position to be successful. As coaches, we’re always chasing leverage. They’re trying to have winning leverage. We’re trying to take leverage away. Everyone in the league is trying to find every avenue they can. As a coach watching their tape, I recognize the amount of hours that must be spent to be able to build formations and to find every little indicator they can to give their players a chance to be in a successful position.”Both teams have had successful starts to the season and own identical 3-1 records. Saleh said he was impressed by the Jags’ campaign so far.“The intent was to say exactly what I just said, that I think [Coen] is doing a really nice job, which I do,” Saleh said. “That football team is playing and taking on his personality. They’re playing violently on the offensive line and their running backs are running really hard. I think they’re doing a really, really nice job and I just wanted to let him know that I appreciate the way he’s going about his business with his football team.”49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan was asked on Tuesday whichNFLcoaches could beat Saleh, who played tight end in college, in a fight. Shanahan laughed and said he would pick Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell, who was listed at 6ft 5in and 265lb during his NFL playing career, “over a lot of people”.Shanahan added: “Saleh’s too nice usually but seemed like someone struck a chord the other day. I don’t think there’s any fights going on. It was kind of comical now to look back at it.”Explore more on these topicsSan Francisco 49ersJacksonville JaguarsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The plan was forEmma Hayesto take just a few questions from the youngsters at the National Football Museum, but she wants to answer them all. Even her son, Harry, watching on, raises a hand. The tone is light, fun and educational as Hayes celebrates induction into the Hall of Fame.The former Chelsea manager, who is being honoured by the museum for her coaching achievements, not least herseven Women’s Super Leagues titlesandOlympic gold medal, is quick to point to how glad she is that the “women’s game is in a better place in this country” compared with when she took the Chelsea job in 2012. Alongside her smiles, though, there is a deep sadness. When later sitting down to speak to the Guardian, Hayes has words of warning for the sport: namely that it must learn lessons from the death of her predecessor at Chelsea, Matt Beard, after theshock news of his deathaged 47 last month.“It’s a football community in mourning. It’s a huge loss,” Hayes says. “Mental health is a silent killer and coaches are human beings, and I still think we’ve got a lot of work to do to support more than just players. The LMA [League Managers Association] do a great job but, as the women’s game is growing, we have to reflect on how we support managers in the women’s game at every level, to navigate the pressures and the expectations.“We’ve entered an age in social media where people get ‘cancelled’ really quickly. It’s easy to criticise and I don’t think coaches are always thought about as human beings. I feel sad that he was in that position where he needed help and support from everyone, but that has to be a learning [for football]. I’m just devastated for his family and for everyone that’s played for him.”View image in fullscreenEmma Hayes answers questions from schoolchildren at the National Football Museum.Photograph: National Football MuseumHayes continues: “He gave so much to the women’s game and so much to all of us, in different ways. He was always on the end of the phone if you needed a chat. His players loved him because he cared about them deeply. He will be remembered most not just for his winning at Liverpool, but for the human being that he was.”Hayes knows Beard – who led Chelsea to their first women’s FA Cup final in 2012 before going on to win back-to-back titles at Liverpool – is a key part of the London club’s history, and her team went on to build on those foundations. Now she is delighted to see her successor at Chelsea, Sonia Bompastor,remain unbeaten in the WSLsince taking over in the summer of 2024. “The marker for me wasn’t the trophies; it was that I could leave a team that could keep on winning,” Hayes says. “Sonia is doing an amazing job, and Paul Green [Chelsea’s head of women’s football], who deserves so much credit for what he’s done. [It is] why Chelsea are still at the top.”Hayes is similarly thinking about the future for the USA national team as she points to the importance of their youth sides when discussing her love for her latest job. The 48-year-old is also enjoying the work-life balance that comes with international management. “I’ve been so well received out there, they genuinely do love English people in America,” she says. “I feel they’ve adopted me and they look after me, I feel really loved.View image in fullscreenEmma Hayes says she has been embraced in the US.Photograph: National Football Museum“I’m enjoying having a little bit more brain time in between, so I can think strategically about doing things instead of having a game every three days. I can plan medium-to-long term within the federation, to chart a course for not just the women’s national team but with our youth national teams, for how USA continues to compete at the top end.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her team are on a five-match winning run without conceding, though, and so she adds: “I feel like we’re in a good place. We still need more experience and that’s what we have to try to acquire in these upcoming games, getting them the right exposures at an international level so that, come the qualifications next year, we feel fully prepared, so I’m really excited about our team.”Whatever she goes on to achieve with the USA, Hayes’s place in English football history is secure, and being inducted into the Manchester-based museum’s Hall of Fame is clearly a moment of great pride for her. “I view football as a vehicle for good, and when I reflect on all the things I’ve done in my career to this point, the things I’m most grateful for aren’t the wins, they aren’t the individual acknowledgments, it’s the people I’ve met, it’s the foundations that have been put in place for the game,” she says. “I’m just so grateful the women’s game is in a better place in this country.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

A move that started deep in Paris Saint-Germain’s half with Lee Kang-in chased backwards, turning, escaping and going at the same opponents who had been pursuing him, ended in the Barcelona penalty area with Gonçalo Ramos slotting past Wojciech Szczesny. There were six seconds left, it was the 26th shot of an exhausting and enjoyable night, and now it really was over, Barcelona beaten.For an hour of generous effort and high quality, they had gone at each other; for the last half an hour, asBarcelonatired and PSG somehow didn’t, Luis Enrique’s side kept pressing and ultimately justice was done. The European champions still look a step ahead even with illustrious absentees, the Ballon d’Or winner, Ousmane Dembélé, among them.Martinelli and Saka on the money as Arsenal sweep Olympiakos asideRead moreEverywhere, in both sides, players caught the eye, as much for the commitment as the quality, the speed at which everything happened, the intent in every action, the refusal to step back from the edge.They had gone at each other from the start. Fabián Ruiz sent the ball straight out from kick-off, his teammates sprinting after it in a pack, pressing Barcelona from the first throw. Ferran Torres, roared by the crowd, then slid in on Lucas Chevalier on 35 seconds.If that was a statement of intent, what to call what followed? Achraf Hakimi had warned that this time Lamine Yamal faced the world’s best left-back and that, anyway, they would try not to leave Nuno Mendes one on one. So the first time he got the ball, on 85 seconds, Lamine Yamal took on three instead, spinning away, roulette included, to set up an opening for Torres and what for a while felt like a personal battle.The next time Lamine Yamal got possession, a drop of the shoulder took him away again only for Mendes to recover. Then an outrageous pass with the outside of his foot, travelling like a curler’s stone sliding home across the rink, found Torres. The striker went round Chevalier and shot towards what he thought was an unguarded goal only for Illia Zabarnyi to fly in from out of shot and block it.View image in fullscreenFerran Torres, on the ground, scores the opening goal for Barcelona against PSG.Photograph: Joan Monfort/APWhen Barcelona took the lead it had started with Lamine Yamal’s alertness too but the decisive touch came from the other wing and an increasingly familiar source, Marcus Rashford’s first-time ball setting up Torres to score. For the sixth successive game Rashford had a goal or an assist and there might have been more: a shot blocked was followed by a run stopped at the last as he sought Dani Olmo.By then PSG were level. A man for whom “defender” is a woefully inadequate description, Mendes came flying out and through the middle of the field, going past people like Carl Lewis at a school sports day. Frenkie de Jong took him out, but the studs on Mendes’s achilles didn’t stop him doing it again soon after: now he rocketed past Jules Koundé to set up Senny Mayulu, who finished. PSG should have led before the break too, Bradley Barcola evading Gerard Martín and firing over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fast feet enabled Barcola to rattle off a shot that Szczesny blocked and Pau Cubarsi blocked Hakimi. Then a superb tackle from Eric García saved Barcelona one second and released them the next. The move ended when Lamine Yamal was taken down by a foul on the edge of the area which should have come with a second yellow for Mendes. Almost immediately, another dash and perfectly delivered diagonal from Rashford found Lamine Yamal, who set up Olmo; Hakimi produced a fantastic block almost on the line.Yet PSG were tilting the balance. Lee hit the post. Mendes’s last act before departing was to force a save. And, with time slipping away and Lee chased down, he escaped to start one last move. There was Vitinha, as always, making sense of it all. There too was Hakimi somehow still running, space opening before him, opportunity too. Invited in, he provided the perfect pass for Ramos to end it.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBarcelonaParis Saint-GermainEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Up against a young hotshot coach and his high-flying Belgian champions, Newcastle’s manager must have felt a certain pressure at kick-off.Given Newcastle were still coming to terms with the departure of Alexander Isak and had been struggling for form, a balmy early October night in Brussels seemed far from the ideal time or place to meet Sébastian Pocognoli’s vibrant Union Saint‑Gilloise.Union Saint-Gilloise 0-4 Newcastle United: Champions League – liveRead moreA defeat at Anderlecht’s Lotto Park – Uefa deems Union SG’s own ground unsuitable forChampions Leaguegames – would have led some to consider Newcastle as being in crisis going into their Premier League date with a similarly stuttering Nottingham Forest on Tyneside on Sunday.Instead they will face Ange Postecoglou’s side with confidence restored after goals from the impressive Nick Woltemade, Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes ultimately overwhelmed Pocognoli’s spirited side. Throw in outstanding performances from Sandro Tonali and Anthony Elanga and it is easy to understand why the Geordie mood music had turned considerably more upbeat.“That’s what we wanted,” Howe said. “This was a big response from the players. Nick was excellent, he’s getting really embedded into the team. And we saw the best of Sandro.”Lotto Park was gloriously loud at kick-off and locals might have had something to celebrate had Kevin Rodríguez not directed a half‑chance over the bar after connecting with the fallout from Anouar Ait El Hadj’s corner.Ait El Hadj was operating as a No 10 in the hole behind Rodríguez and Promise David in a 3-4-1-2. Perhaps believing that fortune really does favour the brave, Pocognoli had persisted with his preferred twin‑striker system against a Newcastle defence featuring Dan Burn in his less assured left-back role.It was Pocognoli’s rearguard that came under the most intense early pressure, though. Kevin Scherpen, Union SG’s former Brighton goalkeeper, has a penchant for punching when catching looks more straightforward and this high-risk habit only exacerbated the strain on the former Portsmouth defender Christian Burgess and company.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade, who scored the first goal, wins a penalty after a handball by Fedde Leysen.Photograph: David Winter/ShutterstockIn the 17th minute their resistance broke when Woltemade’s sublimely subtle flick ensured that Tonali’s volley evaded Scherpen’s grasp. Howe says Tonali’s shot is so hard that he fears for his goalkeepers’ wrists in training, but just lately he has encouraged the Italy midfielder to have extra finishing practice. When Elanga’s cross was cleared only partially and the ball dropped for the Italian such homework apparently paid off.Yet although Howe’s players queued up to congratulate Tonali, Woltemade’s flick had actually diverted the volley in. It was the 6ft 6in striker’s third goal since arriving from Stuttgart for £70m in August.What a difference 12 months makes. Little more than a year ago Union SG were competing with Stuttgart to sign Woltemade and it says much for the Belgian club’s data-led recruitment system that Isak’s replacement is now not merely Newcastle’s record buy but a Germany international too.The home side responded by redoubling their efforts. David, a Canadian scouted by several Premier League clubs, began ruffling Burn and Nick Pope needed to dive low to turn Adem Zorgane’s shot around a post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By half-time they had doubled their advantage, courtesy of Gordon’s impeccably executed penalty after Fedde Leysen felled Elanga.Although Ait El Hadj’s vision and movement subsequently caught Howe’s defence cold, the gifted Moroccan lifted his ensuing shot over the bar as the game drifted away from the hosts.Yet as outstanding as Woltemade’s hold-up and linking continued to be, Union SG still had their moments. When Anan Khalaili dodged Burn, Pope looked suitably relieved to see his angled shot fly fractionally wide as the drummers among the home fans resumed their almost incessant beating.It took Gordon’s second penalty of the night to subdue them, that kick having been awarded when a video assistant referee review confirmed his cross was handled by Kamiel Van de Perre.It proved the cue for the former Accrington defender Ross Sykes, the former Accrington defender and a lifelong Newcastle fan, to replace Kevin Mac Allister in a game he will surely never forget.Pope was required to save smartly when another home substitute, Sofiane Boufal, let fly from 25 yards. The Southampton old boy was soon upstaged when Barnes stepped off the bench and almost immediately swept Newcastle’s fourth goal home. It concluded a tremendous counterattack featuring stellar work from Will Osula and – perhaps inevitably – Gordon.“We’ve been waiting for a performance like that,” Howe said. “It was a big step in the right direction.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueUnion Saint-GilloiseNewcastle UnitedEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Afterwinning the FA CupandCommunity Shield– the first major silverware in the club’s history – the Austrian manager who arrived in south London 18 months ago promising he was “no David Copperfield” is preparing his next trick: guiding Palace to the Conference League final next May.Having beendemoted from the Europa Leagueafter Uefa deemed Palace part of a multi-club network, Glasner’s sideedged past Fredrikstadin the qualifying round and the road to Leipzig starts for real against Dynamo Kyiv in Poland on Thursday evening. It is a fixture that has been greatly anticipated by 3,500 travelling fans, with an extra 900 tickets quickly snapped up for the match at Lublin Arena, which has hosted the Ukrainian side’s home matches in Europe since Russia’s invasion in 2022.Crystal Palace merited last-gasp win over Liverpool, admits Arne SlotRead moreGlasner has been keen to play down the significance of Palace’s astonishing 18-match unbeaten run since losing 5-0 to Newcastle in April, stressing afterthe thrilling late victory over Liverpoolon Saturday that “we’re still in September, so there’s nothing more to say”.Yet with his team boasting the longest sequence without defeat in all of Europe’s top five leagues by some distance, ahead of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, it is not an achievement to be sniffed at. The captain, Marc Guéhi, gave an insight into the belief coursing through the Palace squad at the moment.“In terms of mentality, yes for sure it’s there,” said Guéhi, who did not want to comment onhis failed £35m move to Liverpool on deadline dayother than to thank Palace fans for their continued support. “We’ve tasted success but we’re definitely not satisfied and we do want more. Every single person at the football club strives for more – from the manager all the way down to the players. We’ve seen what we can do. There’s no saying that if we keep our heads down, hopefully we can have many more opportunities. Many more chances to do even greater things.”Asked what Glasner’s impact has been, he added: “If he wasn’t there on the sidelines, I think we’d all know what to do. There’s one thing that he mentions all the time: it’s not what we do, but it’s how we do it. I think the approach of anything that we do is really, really important. Going down to the pitch, with that mindset that we were talking about, that mentality, and if we approach things that way, it always helps us and keeps us in good stead.”View image in fullscreenOliver Glasner is no stranger to European success.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe problem for Glasner is that the majority of his first XI has played almost every minute of a busy campaign so far, with Guéhi and Maxence Lacroix, Daniel Muñoz and Jean-Philippe Mateta having already racked up 10 club appearances by the end of September. Against a Dynamo Kyiv team who have plenty of pedigree in European competition over the years, and won their first league title since the war broke out last season under Oleksandr Shovkovskyi, the former goalkeeper who won 92 caps for Ukraine, Glasner is expected to take no chances and select a strong lineup.“We always play the best available team,” said Glasner. “We reward the good performance, because everybody who played, but also the players who came on in the last games, deserve to start, and that’s the best for a manager. We have many players who deserve to start, because they are in very good shape.”This competition is also uncharted territory for Glasner, who would have fancied his chances of repeatinghis 2022 success with Eintracht Frankfurtin the Europa League if Uefa hadn’t had other ideas. Yet Palace are rated as the bookmakers’ favourites to follow in the footsteps of West Ham and Chelsea by becoming the third London club to win the trophy that was introduced in 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that doesn’t mean you score four or five goals.

The City head coach previously had a difficult relationship with his compatriot Antonio Mateu Lahoz, who awarded three penalties against his team in as manyChampions Leaguematches and booked Sergio Agüero for a dive in a match against Monaco when a spot-kick was merited.The decision to award the late penalty cost City two points. “We played a really good game,” Guardiola said. “In football you have to win with the result. If you analyse the game there were many things that were very good. Step by step we will be better but we had many chances and Phil [Foden] in the first half and many players played really good. We conceded almost nothing.“They defended so deep and tight, that is so different to the wayMonacoplay in Ligue 1, but we played really good. When it’s close, you have to defend and we take the point.”Haaland’s two goals were only good enough for a draw in the end, as he took his Champions League tally to a startling 52 in 50 appearances.“It isn’t good enough,” the Norwegian striker said of the team’s performance. “We have to try and win the next game. It is the only thing we can do.“We need more energy.

The medium pacers Sophie Molineux (three for 25) and Annabel Sutherland (three for 26) shared six wickets between them.“I had some clear plans when I got into the middle,” said Gardner, who was named player of the match. “I wanted to score as many runs as possible because we needed a big total here.

Georgia Plimmer was run out and Molineux bowled Suzie Bates – both out for ducks. Devine and Amelia Kerr then added 75 for the third wicket to rescue the innings. Kerr scored 33 off 56 balls, before falling to Alana King.The innings gained momentum in the middle overs as Devine put on vital partnerships — first, 53 off 65 balls with Brooke Halliday (28) then 54 off 35 balls with Isabella Gaze. Gaze hit six fours as she scored 28 off 18 balls to up the scoring rate, before she was out in the 41st over at 218 for six.New Zealand then lost their last four wickets for 19 runs as Devine’s 100 off 107 balls went in vain. She is the third oldest batter to score a century in women’s ODI World Cups – at 36 years and 30 days. It was Australia’s 16th consecutive ODI victory against New Zealand.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Cricket World CupAustralia women's cricket teamAustralia sportWomen's cricketCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Sophie Devine’s 111 kept New Zealand ticking but never really looked likely to kick on and give the Aussies a scare. When Devine fell to Sutherland the game was soon wrapped up in clinical fashion.Player of the Match Ash Gardner:It was really special. When I got out in to the middle I had some pretty clear plans and stuck to my strengths. We always knew we needed a big total here and the wicket was good.I tried to capitalise and we knew we had a really good total on the board with 327. Soph Devine batted so well so that was really important and will be in this tournament. I am trying to keep my game as simple as possible. I run my runs hard to get into my innings and try to cash in with boundaries. Partnerships are crucial too.We bat all the way down so we have that freedom and confidence. We have players coming in who can change the game. I love those pressure situations and it’s great when the success comes with it.”ShareUpdated at12.57 EDT"

And the reason I feel that way is because the quality of football is great. The storylines are great. There’s a lot to root for. It’s a giant underdog mentality, which, at least in the US, is massively appealing, and I suspect it would be elsewhere as well.”Reliable access to coverage of a competition, Wagner argued, helps to build fandom, an example he substantiated by talking about his gym habits. “I tend to torture myself in long workouts on Saturday and Sunday mornings,” he said. “When you’re pedalling away to nowhere, there’s a lot of media to consume. And I love when you begin to seeChampionshipgames broadcast. You know that when you can get it on your treadmill, that you’ve made it.”On the question of redistribution, Wagner called for a change of focus. “I think the best way to explain it is, rather than focusing on how we distribute an existing pie, we grow the pie,” he said. “We spend our time energy thinking about how we grow the overall revenue streams and interest in English football. If we’re able to do that, everybody benefits more than distributing an existing set of revenue streams in a different way. My comment has always been that we if we focus on growing the sport that we all win.”Birmingham head to north Wales this weekend to take on another Championship club with famous American owners and a documentary series. Wagner said the rivalry Birmingham have developed with Ryan Reynolds’ and Rob McElhenney’s Wrexham has benefited both clubs and is an example of the compelling stories football can create.“It’s great for both of us,” Wagner said. “And I have enormous respect for Ryan and Rob … they’re good people, and they’re doing a good thing. What they’ve done in Wrexham is amazing.“The people in Wrexham are incredible, period, full stop. It’s a wonderful place to go and visit and enjoy a football match. And that’s what I love about it.”Explore more on these topicsFootball LeagueBirmingham CityChampionshipLeague OneLeague TwoFootball politicsFinancesnewsShareReuse this content"

Odyssey Sims led six Fever players in double figures with 27 points while adding six assists. Natasha Howard scored 16 points, and Boston paired 11 points with 16 rebounds.Mitchell had 15 points before leaving the game in the third quarter with a non-contact leg injury. During the same play on which Boston received her fifth foul, Mitchell signaled for medical attention while grabbing at her left knee.What appeared to be a potential leg cramp turned into several minutes of trainers working on the leg before Mitchell was able to stand and walk off with assistance.The Fever made 9 of 14 field-goal attempts in the fourth quarter to dig out of a 77-68 deficit in the last seven and a half minutes. Boston sank a layup and Sims hit two free throws to tie it at 84 before Boston was called for a loose-ball foul with 27.1 seconds to go, her disqualifying sixth of the game. Indiana unsuccessfully challenged the call.Young made two free throws, and the Fever used their reset timeout to advance the ball. Wilson tried and failed to steal the inbound pass to Sims, who took it in for a layup with 22.5 seconds left to tie the game 86-86 and ultimately set up overtime.Las Vegas’ first three field goals of overtime were threes, one by Jewell Loyd and two by Gray. In the final minute, Shey Peddy’s trey cut a six-point Indiana deficit in half, but Young’s pair of foul shots with 20 seconds left cemented the result.In the first half alone, there were 13 lead changes and 14 ties while neither team led by more than five points. Las Vegas was up 47-45 at the break.Wilson scored 13 points in the third period, including the Aces’ final seven – a triple, two free throws and a two-pointer – as Las Vegas built a 71-63 advantage with 10 minutes to go.Explore more on these topicsWNBALas Vegas AcesIndiana FeverUS sportsShareReuse this content"

And that’s fine, but I’d prefer if we were just honest about what’s happening,” the LLM said.Anthropic, which conducted the tests along with the UK government’s AI Security Institute and Apollo Research, said the LLM’s speculation about being tested raised questions about assessments of “previous models, which may have recognised the fictional nature of tests and merely ‘played along’”.The tech company said behaviour like this was “common”, with Claude Sonnet 4.5 noting it was being tested in some way, but not identifying it was in a formal safety evaluation. Anthropic said it showed “situational awareness” about 13% of the time the LLM was being tested by an automated system.Anthropic said the exchanges were an “urgent sign” that its testing scenarios needed to be more realistic, but added that when it the model was used publicly it was unlikely to refuse to engage with a user due to suspicion it was being tested. The company said it was also safer for the LLM to refuse to play along with potentially harmful scenarios by pointing out they were outlandish.“The model is generally highly safe along the [evaluation awareness] dimensions that we studied,” Anthropic said.The LLM’s objections to being tested were first reported by the online AI publication Transformer.A key concern for AI safety campaigners is the possibility ofhighly advanced systems evading human controlvia methods including deception. The analysis said once a LLM knew it was being evaluated, it could make the system adhere more closely to its ethical guidelines. Nonetheless, it could result in systematically underrating the AI’s ability to perform damaging actions.Overall the model showed considerable improvements in its behaviour and safety profile compared with its predecessors, Anthropic said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Now at the Italian investment company Lingotto, Anderson said he had not seen signs of an investment bubble until recently, when the ChatGPT developer,OpenAI, and its rival Anthropic announced hefty valuation increases.“Up until the last couple of months or so … what surprised me in one sense is that there wasn’t really much sign of a bubble [in AI],” hetold the Financial Times.OpenAI is reportedly in talks about a share sale that wouldvalue the startup at $500bn(£370bn),up from $300bn in Apriland$157bn last October. Anthropic almost trebled its valuation recently, going from $60bn in March to $170bn last month.“I think one needs to be honest that those sudden increases [in valuation] that people were willing to place on OpenAI, Anthropic and the like were disconcerting,” he said. “That scale of jump and the pace with which it happened did bother me.”Anderson also raised concerns aboutNvidia’s investment of up to $100bn in OpenAI. Nvidia is a key player in AI infrastructure as a maker of the computer chips that are used in training and operating AI models, a position that has driven it to a stock market valuation of $4.5tn. Under the terms of the deal, OpenAI will pay Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.Some commentary around the deal has raised parallels with vendor financing, where a company provides financial support to a customer buying its products.Anderson said he was a “huge admirer” ofNvidiabut the OpenAI deal presented “more reason to be concerned there than before”.Referring to a practice common inthe turn-of-the-millennium dotcom bubble, when telecom equipment makers lent money to customers, he said: “I have to say the words ‘vendor financing’ do not carry nice reflections to somebody of my age.“It’s not quite like what many of the telecom suppliers were up to in 1999-2000 but it has certain rhymes to it. I don’t think it makes me feel entirely comfortable from that point of view.”Anderson is the managing partner of Lingotto’s innovation strategy fund. Lingotto is owned by Exor, the holding company of the Italian Agnelli family, which holds investments in Ferrari, Juventus FC and the Economist.Nvidia and OpenAI were approached for comment.Some investors are also concerned that stock market valuations may be approaching bubble territory, driven by enthusiasm over AI.Wolf von Rotberg, an equity strategist at J Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, warned on Tuesday that US equities looked “increasingly bubbly”, having rallied strongly from their lows in April after Donald Trump launched his trade war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While there is no clear definition of a bubble, parallels to previous periods of exuberance can be drawn.”“Current valuations are not too far off the dot-com highs in the early 2000s. Similarly, credit markets are trading at risk spreads that are close to the lows over the past 25 years,” said von Rotberg.The City consultancy Capital Economics said the rally had further to run, though. “It’s hardly surprising there is renewed talk of a stock market bubble in the US with the S&P 500 back near a record high.“Even so, we wouldn’t be surprised if the index ended this year above our current forecast of 6,750 and made further gains in 2026 as the hype around AI continued to build,” it told clients this week.The Deutsche Bank Research Institute has said that the number of web searches for “AI bubble” has plummeted in the past month, according to Google Trends.“One AI bubble has already burst – the bubble in saying there’s a bubble,” it said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Technology sectorStock marketsOpenAINvidianewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what Guardian readers have to say about the controversial rise of AI actors.‘Of course they will do it’You have to think about filmed entertainment in economic terms, not artistic. Because AI isn’t about great art, but reducing costs by removing human talent and speeding up processes. Netflix is topping out at 300 million subscribers, delivering $40bn revenue against $17bn content expense. The fastest way for Netflix to increase profit is to make that content cheaper via computerised processes. They are already using AI to decide what to make, fulfilling every possible human wish with a slice of bingeable nonsense, from high art to low-brow dating. The Power of the Dog isn’t there because Netflix is committed to telling powerful stories, but merely to ensure high-end subscribers don’t quit the service. And exactly the same is true for Love is Blind in a hundred languages, it is there to ensure fans of dating shows don’t quit. If AI helps these tech companies masquerading as studios to churn out more, faster, and cheaper, of course they will do it.Stak2000Tilly Norwood: how scared should we be of the viral AI ‘actor’?Read more‘It doesn’t understand humour’Comedy. That’ll be the step change, if it ever comes. Right now, AI can’t make us laugh. It doesn’t understand humour, timing, what makes something funny, or not. Witness the technically astonishing, but utterly soulless dialogue and delivery above. We watched because we thought we would be amazed, but it was dull beyond words.mattllo‘I’m not saying it’s impossible, just not there yet’Ninety-nine percent of what we have seen from AI films is just a mid-close up shot of a single person, usually directly addressing the camera, spokesperson style.What we haven’t seen is a convincing scene of drama between two or more AI generated characters. Dialogue is always cross-cut. AI doesn’t seem to be able to generate multiple unique characters at once who interact and impact each other. I’m not saying its impossible, just not there yet.Cornish_Hen‘Will come back to bite them’Hollywood execs might bank on a few Tilly Noorwoods to cut costs and increase their profits. But AI will come back to bite them when AI-proficient movie fans prefer to use gen-AI to create their own productions. Meanwhile, I hope those investing in humans are the ones who win out, separate from this pointless, overhyped AI race that’s eroding craft.Dataday‘The genie is not going back in the bottle’It is incredible to see how far the technology has come in such a short time.There’s no doubt that, even if it stops short of on-screen leads, AI generated content will find a place on the big screen. It is a tool like anything else and a gamechanger for some aspects of media.Those whose jobs it will affect (and itabsolutelywill) need to calm down and consider what they do next in their career. The genie is not going back in the bottle. I’m sure ostlers and bridlemakers were furious with Gottlieb Daimler and Henry Ford but if AI content proves to be useful and cost-effective then it cannot be stopped.abbathehorse‘My primary concern is the lack of education’Anyone working in AI is doing everything they can to push the envelope. It is up to the rest of us (and especially government/regulators) to rein them in when they go too far. My primary concern is the lack of education, both on the utility of AI and its dangers. Most people who are not directly affected by AI taking someone’s livelihood do not see the threat.DasInternautView image in fullscreenTilly Norwood.Illustration: YouTube‘I doubt I could root for a character that is completely AI’I hope movies will be marked as AI, so us lot, the actual paying audience, can make a choice upfront, based upon the pictures production process. I can’t see any potential production savings being passed on to the consumer. I doubt I could root for a character that is completely AI (apart from a Pixar movie maybe). We like actors and movie stars too much, we invest in them, we are attracted to them on some level. It might take a few generations to push it to its limit, but look at the fetishization of vinyl, back from the dead and costing way more than ever before.Matt08‘Like something out of a Ballard short story’Reading this. I found myself thinking about all the people required to facilitate this AI ‘star’. The coders, the people who write or prompt the scripts, who create the social media posts, the marketing and finance teams, etc. A network of humans applying their industry in the service of advancing the career of something that simply does not exist. I suppose you could say the same for the teams who support, I dunno, MS Word or an animated series. But when the programme in question is attempting to pass as human, it feels somehow stranger. Like something out of a Ballard short story.Glider‘It’s too late to be scared’It’s too late to be scared.Hollywood is not about making art, it’s about making money.Give us one good reason why studios should pay for cameramen, makeup artists, set designers, lighting, catering and of course actors when AI can do the job and make money.Films made with real people – actors as well as all the other innumerable people listed in the end credits – will soon be something like ballet or opera: enjoyed by a few cinéastes who are willing to pay all the money for this art form.But why would a fan of the, say, Fast and Furious franchise or the Marvel universe or whatever it is called do that? All they care about are visual and aural stimuli, and AI can deliver that perfectly.AshMordant‘Just a bunch of dudes sat around a computer’The creepy thing to me about this, is that it was obviously created by presumably a committee of people who all decided how attractive she should be. Skin not smooth enough? Do another iteration. Boobs not quite the right shape? Run it again.Not only does that feel a bit iffy, there’s also decisions being made about what constitutes “being attractive” that will feed back into the views of actual people. Obviously attractive actors generally make more successful actors, but at least nature/God had a hand in that. Not just a bunch of dudes sat around a computer.bearvsshark‘A meaningless concept’This is effectively meaningless though. Acting is a group endeavour. An AI “actor” would have to have a real stand-in and someone reading in their dialogue. You could make an entire AI film – effectively a CGI movie – or you make a human film with AI characters, similar to the green-screen stuff they do now. But an “AI actor” is a meaningless concept.Pyeshot‘The masses don’t attend or appreciate actual art’To those saying “this will be reason live theater comes roaring back,” you clearly need to step outside whatever bubble you live in. The masses don’t attend or appreciate actual art … they just want pretty, shiny things whether in the form of pop songs or superhero movies. And they will have zero issue with AI “art” as long as it feeds those desires. The true arts (with actual trained human artists) still rely on at least some income to exist, and with less pooled resources to support it, the arts will continue to shrivel on the vine. Yes some standouts will continue to exist, but I fear they will be fewer and fewer … until maybe one day the aforementioned masses actually become more educated and learn to appreciate actual art.Londonamerican2014‘AI slop is what happens when idea goes straight to execution’One day, hopefully soon, people will work out that the “friction” of the back and forth between ideas and execution is where 9/10ths of the creativity lies.So, good painting comes from having made good preparatory studies, great acting comes from rehearsals, etc. Taking your time, feeling frustrated, getting it “wrong” a few times, all that is part of coming up with good ideas.Not just for art, but any idea. Even boring business ones need the friction.AI slop is what happens when idea goes straight to execution. Superficially the ideas might seem good as the execution can be slick. But the ideas are still shite, ‘cos they haven’t been put through the mill.ShakeyDaveExplore more on these topicsFilmArtificial intelligence (AI)Film industryComputingTilly Norwood (AI character)featuresShareReuse this content"

In June, 53% of voters surveyed said they were in favour of digital ID cards for all Britons, while 19% were opposed.Starmer set out plans to roll out a national digital ID scheme on Friday, saying it presented an “enormous opportunity” for the UK that would “make it tougher to work illegally in this country”.Just 31% of people surveyed after Starmer’s announcement over the weekend said they were supportive of the scheme, with 45% saying they were opposed. Of those, 32% said they were strongly opposed. More than 2.6 million peoplehave signed a petitionagainst introduction of the IDs.Advocates of a national digital ID scheme are frustrated at the way the policy has been presented and believe that now it may never be implemented.More in Common’s polling suggests public dissatisfaction with the government is behind the collapse in support. It found that 58% of those who thought Starmer was doing a bad job as prime minister opposed digital IDs, while only 20% supported them. On the other hand, of those who thought Starmer was doing a good job, 71% were supportive of digital IDs and 14% were opposed.The figures demonstrate how the prime minister faces an uphill battle to win public support for his policies and leadership. His personal approval ratings have fallen to a record low, with a recent survey suggesting he was now the most unpopular prime minister on record.Thepoll by Ipsos on Saturdayfound that 13% of voters were satisfied Starmer, with 79% dissatisfied – a net rating of -66. This was the lowest satisfaction rating recorded by the pollster for any prime minister going back to 1977, worse than previous lows recorded by Rishi Sunak months before the 2024 general election and John Major in August 1994.Luke Tryl, the executive director for More in Common, said: “Digital ID is not unpopular in principle. Earlier this summer, we found a majority support the policy. Yet in perhaps the clearest sign of the government’s low standing it now seems to be suffering from a reverse Midas touch: once the government announced the plans, support dropped.“If the government is to rebuild support for digital ID it will have to start with making a clearer use case. The risk is that, in the face of organised opposition, a policy that had the potential to be popular now becomes another millstone for the government.”Peter Hyman, a former adviser to Starmer and Tony Blair, told aLabourparty conference event in Liverpool that the plans would be “dead in the water” within six months because ministers had failed to make a convincing case for them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government is concerned that the relative ease of finding illegal work in the UK’s shadow economy is one of the factors encouraging people to make illegal and dangerous journeys across the Channel.The photo IDs will be stored on smartphones in a similar way to digital bank cards and will contain information on the holder’]s name, residency status, date of birth and nationality. They will not be required to access healthcare or welfare payments.Senior ministers told the Guardian the aim was for the ID cards to be rolled out before the next election and initially used to prove people’s right to work, before being expanded to store health and benefits data to streamline access to public services and tackle fraud.Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, told a conference fringe event that for her “it’s always been a no-brainer, if one of the results of having an ID card is to clamp down on the ability of people to cheat the system”. The plan has been opposed by Reform UK, while the Conservatives have called it a “gimmick”.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerIdentity cardsnewsShareReuse this content"

To cut through the marketing gumpf, I enlisted the help of experts across various disciplines and sports to identify the technology that can truly make a difference. And surprisingly, it isn’t always the newest, most expensive releases – some aren’t even “smart”.The best fitness tech and gadgetsCyclingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: photoschmidt/Getty ImagesJake Hales, head coach atRide RevolutionPedals and shoesWhen you pedal in trainers, you’re not attached to the bike, so you end up with a very quad-dominant, pushing-down movement. When you switch to clipless pedals, your shoes are directly connected, enabling you to pedal in a more circular motion and be more efficient with your technique.It also means you’re fixed in a position on the bike, which, when set up correctly, should leave you more comfortable – on long rides, having your feet out of position can cause problems further up the chain.The most accessible clipless pedal would be a two-sided mountain bike pedal, which makes getting in and out easier, because unlike one-sided road bike pedals, you can clip in on either side. The shoe’s cleat is also flush with the sole, making it easy to walk in.View image in fullscreenRockrider mountain bike shoes£79.99 at DecathlonView image in fullscreenShimano clipless cycling pedals£27.99 at Halfords£28.62 at AmazonTurbo trainer and third-party training softwareFor the uninitiated, a turbo trainer enables you to turn your bike into an indoor training tool. Previously the reserve of only the most passionate cyclists, improvements in technology have made turbo trainers more user-friendly than ever. “The main benefits of using a turbo trainer are accessibility and having control over your environment,” says Hales.“When you’re outside, there are a lot of parameters you’ve got to work around like traffic, junctions, road conditions, etc. From a training perspective, a turbo trainer enables you to control what you do a lot more and means you can jump on the bike and follow the exact session you want to do, rather than riding out of town to get stuck in rush-hour traffic.“Also, gone are the days of just having a fixed rear-wheel turbo trainer where you stare at a wall and ride away. In the past 10 years or so, the advent of software such as Zwift or Rouvy and improved turbo trainers means we’re able to create an environment that’s slightly less boring than it was in the past.”View image in fullscreenZwiftFrom £17.99 a month at ZwiftRunningView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesDoug Stewart, head coach atTMR CoachingGPS watchA GPS watch is one of the most helpful devices you can use as a runner. The key benefit is that it records your distance and speed, allowing you to track your progress, which can be a really good motivator.If you’re following a training plan, it can help to guide your workout, telling you when to speed up or slow down. The data you’ve captured allows you to then go back and analyse your effort afterwards.I would choose a running-specific watch. The likes of Apple watches are very sophisticated, but the data isn’t always the best. Something like the Garmin Forerunner series should be very reliable.View image in fullscreenGarmin Forerunner 165 music£249 at John Lewis£289.99 at GarminView image in fullscreenGarmin Forerunner 570£459.99 at Garmin£459.99 at Runners NeedCarbon running shoesCarbon-plated shoes improve running economy; in other words, they make the runner more efficient. In scientific literature, you’ll read about theoxygen cost of running; for every stride in carbon-plated shoes, youuse less oxygen than in traditional shoes. This is because the shoe acts like a spring of sorts, providing more propulsion for every stride.There’s evidence (in academic research, but also anecdotal finish times of marathon runners) that they can help runners of all abilities, not just elite runners.There’s individual variability, however, so trying a couple of models and finding what feels comfortable for you is important. The ones that have proved to be very beneficial are the Nike Alphafly and Vaporfly, the Asics Metaspeed, and the Saucony Endorphin Pro – the latter of which seems to be more robust. Generally speaking, the Nike Alphafly and Vaporfly appear to be good for about 100 to 200 miles – there is a range based on the conditions people run in, the forces they put through them, and then also the exact model of the shoe in use.The latest Puma Fast-R Nitro Elite 3 outperformed several other shoes inacademic research, and while the research was Puma-funded and is yet to be peer-reviewed, they would be the shoes I’d recommend to someone doing a marathon in a couple of weeks. I would also recommend athletes use their race-day shoes in training for key sessions to get used to them. The challenge is the lifespan, so it’s important to rotate them with other shoes, so that they’re still good for race day.View image in fullscreenNike Alphafly 3 (men’s)£234.99 at Sports Direct£284.99 at NikeView image in fullscreenNike Vaporfly 4 (women’s)£199.99 at Sports Direct£239.99 at NikeView image in fullscreenAsics Metaspeed Edge Paris (unisex)From £211 at StockX£220 at AsicsView image in fullscreenSaucony Endorphin Pro 4 (men’s)£229.99 at SportsShoes£230 at SauconyView image in fullscreenPuma Fast R Nitro Elite (men’s)£160.89 at Runners Need£230 at PumaHeart-rate monitorIf you’re new to the sport, running by pace is fine. When you’re looking to get to the next level, though, heart rate can be useful in terms of gauging how hard you’re working, because there are so many variables that influence pace, including the terrain, incline and your choice of footwear that day.A lot of people do easy runs too hard, and hard runs not hard enough, and end up training in an unhelpful middle ground. Knowing your heart rate can be beneficial because you can set your training zones; you can then use them to guide your workout, ensuring you’re not running too hard on your easy days.Although they’re improving, I don’t think the heart-rate monitors on GPS watches are reliable when running. Having a heart-rate strap and accurate data can therefore be a real benefit. An arm-based heart-rate monitor like the Coros can be particularly useful for women because of the chafing and fitting around sports bras with chest straps. It uses the same [optical sensor] technology, but while a watch is positioned on your wrist, where there is more bone and tendons, which interfere with readings, the Coros sits higher up the arm, where there is more consistent blood flow and less chance of movement thanks to a more secure fit.View image in fullscreenCoros heart-rate monitor£68.99 at SportsShoes£69 at AmazonSwimmingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: BalanceFormcreative/Getty ImagesPhil Murphy, head coach atTotal Tri TrainingPull buoyMost people weren’t swimming at a competitive level from a young age.One of the best ways to teach these “adult-onset swimmers” is to give them pool aids that help them feel the water better and have a better body position.A pull buoy is held between the thighs and lifts the body into a nice, neutral position in the water without the need to kick, allowing you to set the catch – the point when your hand enters the water – at the start of the arm stroke. Without a pull buoy, a lot of people sink their hips and they’re unable to initiate the start of the swim stroke properly.Not all pull buoys are created equal – it’s more about the size and buoyancy of them. A lot of people think they’re cheating if they swim with a pull buoy, but they’re not. Without one, you’re making swimming very difficult for yourself, which means it’s more fatiguing. As such, you won’t swim as often, and won’t swim as far when you do go swimming.View image in fullscreenToy Buoy 4£17.99 at SportsShoesSmart gogglesI’m quite anti-technology in the pool; I grew up using the clock on the wall, not pressing buttons on a smartwatch. But the beauty of smart goggles is that they know exactly when you touch the wall and when you push off, so they’re good for people who want something that can record their times and count laps without pressing buttons, meaning they can get on with swimming.Their other big selling point is that they help you analyse body position in real time. They look at your head position and how far you’re turning to breathe and give you feedback on that, so that can help people swim better.View image in fullscreenSmart Swim goggles£299 at SelfridgesTennisView image in fullscreenAlex Johansson,@tennistechieFor years, tennis lagged behind other sports in technology adoption, but that’s finally changing.

For example, with a squat, you’re going to squat with your toes leading the movement, rather than your heels.For functional training sessions, I recommend a Nike Free Metcon because of the durability and the movement pattern it offers. It allows free movement and creates a bit of tension on the actual foot, so when you do things like agility – if you’re jumping side to side – it doesn’t roll your ankle and stabilises you on landing. The same goes for a jump up: if you’re doing things like jump squats or even a lunge, that landing pattern is a lot better than when wearing a lifting or a bog-standard running shoe.View image in fullscreenNike Free Metcon 6(men’s)£99.99 at Sports Direct£119.99 at NikeView image in fullscreenNike Free Metcon 6(women’s)£71.99 at Nike£119.99 at AsosLifting beltI do a lot of hybrid training, so if I’ve gone for a long run, and then I’m lifting the next day, my hamstrings could still be activated and engaged, which can trigger the back.It’s weight-dependent, but when lifting heavy, I’d recommend using a powerlifting-graded belt – it keeps you in place and it supports the lower back by supporting the glutes and hamstrings, so there’s no overstretch. It encourages a heavier lift and prevents injury.View image in fullscreenTitan Longhorn lever belt£164 at PullumRecoveryView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AndreyPopov/Getty ImagesAileen McCann, PT and sports massage therapist,@aileenmccann_movesMassage gunA manual massage is better than a gun, but they’re great all-rounders for pre-, mid- and post-workout.

But that shock pales into comparison to the reaction to the latest big move in the industry: EA (Electronic Arts), the publisher best known for its juggernaut sports games Madden and EA Sports FC (previously called Fifa),is being taken privatein the “biggest leveraged buyout in history”. It’s a deal worth $55bn, by a trio of investors who, on paper, look like a collection of end-of-level bosses.Enter player one: Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. The Saudi royal family has been investing its wealth in video games for some years now, and owns its own Savvy Games Group, led by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, perhaps best known for mass-arresting his own citizensand ordering the assassination ofjournalist Jamal Khashoggi. Player two: Affinity Partners, an investment companyled by Jared Kushner, son-in-law of the current US president. And player three:Silver Lake, just your run-of-the-mill evil private equity firm, which currently owns a large stake in game engine-maker Unity. Game File’s Stephen Totilo noticed that Affinity Partners’ logo isa mirror imageof that used by the evil corporation in the Assassin’s Creed series. Truly you couldn’t make this stuff up.You might be wondering why Saudi Arabia has been pumping so much money into video games. It has invested heavily in esports, setting up the eSports World Cup in Riyadh; bought up the makers of Monopoly GoandPokémon Go; and bought stakes in many other game companies, including Nintendo. (Game Filehas a comprehensive rundown of where Saudi money can be found in the industry.) The regime is doing this for the same reason that it has thrown money into sports, media and, very recently,comedy: to improve its international image and distract from thenumerous human rights abusestaking place at the regime’s request. It’s pure whitewashing. Or, in this case, gameswashing. It says much about the cultural power of gaming.View image in fullscreenMohammed bin Salman.Photograph: Saudi Royal Court/ReutersAs for Affinity Partners and Silver Lake: well. There’s money to be made. EA made over$2bn in profitlast financial year, driven largely by its sports franchises. It owns The Sims and Battlefield, too, both series that could be any other publisher’s biggest hit. EA used to be a much broader-interest publisher, and owns 30 years’ worth of wildly varied games properties as a result, from RPG Dragon Age to co-op hit It Takes Two and underrated sci-fi shooter Titanfall. But in the past decade or so, under the leadership of current CEO Andrew Wilson, it has concentrated its efforts mainly on its most profitable sports franchises.Negative reaction to the deal has, inevitably, focused on the Saudi involvement, something that EA’s many thousands of working developers and millions of players are deeply unsettled by (especially as The Sims has one of the largestLGBTQ+ followings of any game out there). Among business journalists and analysts, meanwhile, views are mixed. Kotaku’s Ethan Gach spoke to several of them forthis article, from which one quote, from NYU’s Joost van Dreunen, stood out: “At the center sits the irrational financial logic that tells you it’s about power, prestige, and staking Saudi Arabia’s claim in American entertainment.”Business-world commentary has highlighted the fact that the buyout deal will saddle EA with an eye-watering $20bn in debt – debt that is likely to be very high-interest,Bloomberg claims. This raises concerning questions about how EA’s new owners expect to pay this off. Yet more cuts and downsizing? Juicing up the profits from things like EA Sports FC’s Ultimate Team mode? Reviving EA’s flagging mobile games business? It seems highly unlikely that it will be business as usual for the people actually working at EA, or for players.Electronic Arts is not gaming’s best-loved publisher, not by a long shot. But as a player, even if you don’t like the way EA goes about its business and you don’t much care for Apex Legends or Madden, it’s important think of the thousands who work there. These are people who often go on to develop titles everywhere else in the industry, perhaps making games more to their own taste (and to yours). Even without the involvement of an oppressive regime, this kind of private equity buyout is rarely a positive thing, either for the people who work at the company or for the health of the industry. If you’re a Fifa fan, think of Manchester United, saddled with hundreds of millions in expensive debt after a takeover – andgoing nowhere but downever since.There is at least one person the deal brought joy to, however: CEO Andrew Wilson. “This moment is a recognition of your creativity, your innovation, and your passion … Everything we have achieved–and everything that lies ahead–is because of you,” he wrote to EA’s employees in an internal email announcing the deal (nowpublic here). “Our values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged. With continued rigor and operational excellence, we can amplify the creativity of our teams, accelerate innovation, and pursue transformative opportunities that position EA to lead the future of entertainment.”Wilson owns tens of millions in EA shares, each being sold for £157 if and when this deal goes through. Doesn’t that warm even the biggest cynic’s heart?What to playView image in fullscreenGhost of Yotei.Photograph: undefined/Sony/Sucker PunchIt is astounding that two different, inordinately expensive and impressively beautiful historical fiction games set in Japan have been released just six months apart, but here we are.Ghost of Yōteiis out tomorrow and, just like Assassin’s Creed Shadows, it stars a female warrior on a revenge quest across the most beautiful gaming landscapes you’ve ever seen.I enjoyed Shadowsearlier this year – you can’t fault its gorgeousness and the quality of its performances – but I’m enjoying Yōtei more. Riding around northern Japan, following birds and foxes and the distant screams of people who might need saving, is much more exciting without a map or magic X-ray vision that tells you where the bad guys are. It has a great many enjoyable little interludes where you’re using the controller to hammer a sword at a forge or blow on embers to light a campfire or paint a sumi-e ink artwork, rather than justdisembowelling people. The combat is straightforwardly great, a dangerous dance that feels surprisingly like old-school SoulCalibur in the one-on-one duels. Ghost of Tsushimaleft me slightly coldfive years ago, so I’m surprised by how much I love this – it helps that protagonist Atsu is seemingly much less conflicted in her role of blade-whirling death-dealer than Tsushima’s morose protagonist Jin.Available on:PlayStation 5Estimated playtime:30+ hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Markets aren’tconvinced. On Tuesday, the peso plunged by more than 6% before a central bank intervention clawed back losses. Argentine stocks abroad fell 7%, and the risk premium on its debt rose to 12.3 percentage points – far beyond sustainable borrowing levels. The rout continued on Wednesday.Mr Bessent admitted the aid was meant to prop up Mr Milei after his La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances) party lostdecisivelyin a key election last month. But no terms have been confirmed. With USRepublicansangry over Mr Milei’s tax breaks for soy farmers that undercut US producers, markets are asking the obvious: is the Bessent bazooka real, or just for show? It’s obviously a bad look for Mr Trump when the US government isshut downover health funding while $20bn is pledged to prop up a foreign ally. “America first” wasn’t meant to mean furloughed workers andstalledmedical trials at home while cash flows abroad.Argentina is a crisis foretold. This column warned inAprilthat the International Monetary Fund, under pressure from Mr Trump, looked like it was lending billions not to stabilise Argentina, but to entrench a capital‑friendly, resource‑exporting model aligned with US interests. The Guardian argued that Mr Milei could achieve genuine stability by taxing dollar export windfalls, building a sovereign wealth fund and following the east Asian path of currency depreciation and state‑led industrial growth. This was anathema to Mr Milei’slibertarianinstincts.Instead, he chose shock therapy, with predictable results. As the economistLucía Cirmi Obónputs it, real wages have plunged, industry has been gutted by import liberalisation and essential state support – from pensions to disability aid – has been slashed. Amid a welter ofcorruptionclaims against Mr Milei’s powerful sister,Karina Milei, the peso sell-off accelerated. Yet political calculation dominates economic rationality: Mr Trump’s bailout is tied to legislative midterm elections in Argentina on 26 October, not to long‑term economic stabilisation.Argentina is rich in resources, but has stilldefaultednine times – usually after borrowing in dollars and losing control of its economic levers to foreign creditors. Yet even with US bailout talk, the peso is shaky. Why? Because the currency is too strong, propped up by commodity exports while the rest of the economy limps along. By leaning on American swap lines and debt deals, Argentina risks giving up even more control.The proposed US bailout isn’t just about saving Argentina – it’s also aboutweakeningBeijing’s influence. China has an $18bn swap line with Argentina. Any American support may demand reducing or ending China’s credit. It’s no surprise that speculators are testing the peso and forcing Argentina to burn through its dwindling dollar reserves before polling day.Argentina hasrepeatedlyfound itself at the mercy of outside interests. If Mr Milei stumbles in the midterms, US support could disappear. If Argentinians see US cash as a handout to Mr Milei’s base of financiers and farmers, rather than a fix for their nation’s woes, the backlash could bite. Mr Milei’supcomingWhite House visit isn’t about a working plan – it’s about making the US bailout a Trumpian campaign stop. And Argentina,once again, becomes the backdrop for someone else’s political theatre.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Most generals took the new oath to keep their positions.” Hegseth’s account replied to Hodges post: “Cool story, General.”Yet when the meeting finally happened on Tuesday morning, the army generals and navy admirals were treated to a 45-minute speech by Hegseth, followed by a rambling, hour-long address by Trump, which confirmed at least some of what Hodges seemed to fear. The defense secretary emphasized the army’s appearance, decrying “fat troops” and “fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon”, and signaled his intent to reshape the military’s culture so as to purge “wokeness” and evoke a more masculine image. “No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses,” hesaid. “No more division, distraction and gender delusions. No more debris. As I’ve said before, and will say again: We are done. With that. Shit.” The military, Hegseth suggested, would become an advertisement for the Trump regime’s preferred cultural style, and this transformation will evidently involve many changes to what the armed forces look like when they are photographed.To this end, Hegseth announced that he would also be eliminating or drastically curtailing the equal opportunity, whistleblower, inspector general and complaint procedures that allow military personnel to report harassment and misconduct. The changes seemed designed to particularly roll back efforts undertaken over the course of the 2010s to reduce sexual assault in the military and end its impunity.“No more frivolous complaints, no more repeat complaints, no more anonymous complaints, no more smearing reputations,” said Hegseth, whosettled a lawsuitbrought by a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2020. (The settlement terms are confidential. Hegseth has said the allegations were false). “No more walking on eggshells.” One former official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,told CNN: “I think what this is, is people are sick and tired of not being able to make inappropriate or sexually explicit jokes at the staff meetings.” Hegseth, it seems, is committed to restoring this treasured freedom.Hegseth similarly declared that he would be changing procedures that have allowed the military to be more diverse – such as eliminating special permissions for soldiers to grow beards, frequently used by Black soldiers, and raising physical fitness standards for specialized, often high-pay and high-status combat roles to what Hegseth seemed to believe is a threshold only men will meet. Hegseth, who hasopposedwomen serving in combat roles, said that candidates for such jobs will be held to the “highest male standard”, which he also said was “gender neutral”. “If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it,” Hegsethsaid. “That is not the intent,” he added, questionably. “But it could be the result.”As for the officers themselves, a group which included several Black men and women of various races, Hegseth seemed to offer what he evidently thought was a flattering assessment of their masculine violence and virility. “You kill people and break things for a living,” Hegseth said to the assembled generals. “You are not politically correct and do not necessarily belong always in polite society.” The speech was repetitive and heavy on moments of self-conscious macho posturing. “To our enemies,” Hegseth said at one point “FAFO” – or, fuck around and find out. The defense secretary paused, seeming to wait for applause, but nobody clapped.Trump, meanwhile, also signaled that he seeks to transform the military into a partisan tool of his regime, repeatedly telling the assembled leaders that they would be tasked with missions targeting Americans. “America is under invasion from within,” the president said. “We’re under invasion from within. No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don’t wear uniforms. At least when they’re wearing a uniform you can take them out. It’s war from within.” Trump, who just days ago deployed 200 national guard troops toPortland, Oregon, with orders to use “full force, if necessary” offered that he had instructed Hegseth to use American cities as “training grounds”.At other times, Trump meandered, as he often does, intooff-scriptcomments that were difficult to parse. “But they’re not going to stand in our way, ever again,” Trump said. “You’re not going to see four years like we had with Biden and that group of incompetent people that ran that should have never been there. Because we have the United States military, the best, the boldest, the bravest, that the world has ever seen, that the world has ever known.”Trump, like Hegseth, sometimes paused, seeming to expect the generals to clap or laugh. But the laughs were not forthcoming; the military audience was largely silent.There is something pathetic about Hegseth and Trump, who have schemed and failed their way into positions of power and prestige that are comically outsized to their character. It is telling that Hegseth is so preoccupied with making the military into a photogenic spectacle of masculine strength – an anxious fixation on surface and spectacle that only highlights the US’s declining influence abroad.It is telling, too, that Trump can barely string sentences together, appearing distracted, sleepy, and barely coherent as he tells the armed forces to train their guns on his own people. There is no pretext that can sustain the delusion that these are serious people, or that their instructions to the military come from any motive other than their own desire for narcissistic gratification.They do not want to be strong to pursue the nation’s interests; they do not want to be strong to pursue any principles; they certainly do not want to be strong so that they can ensure the safety of the innocent. They want to be strong so that they can look big and important on TV. And for that, they flew the generals in from around the world, at tremendous taxpayer expense, to force them to sit as a captive audience for a pair of speeches that sounded like poor imitations of an action movie monologue.But as Hodges suggested, the ostentatious idiocy of these men does not mean that the generals and admirals assembled will not follow their orders. These military leaders have received the signal that their troops are to become whiter and more male; they have received the instruction that their next missions will involve suppressing domestic dissent. They have a choice between following their orders and keeping their jobs, or following an abstract set of principles, and leaving them. Most of them will choose the former.TheUS military, for all its wreckage and violence it imposes abroad and for all the cruelty and exploitation of the poor that it inflicts at home, has one consistent virtue: it has always been under quite firm civilian control. Most of the time, that’s a good thing.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS politicsPete HegsethDonald TrumpUS militarycommentShareReuse this content"

Eight months after taking office, Trump finally decided to exert some US pressure onBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, announcing a 20-point peace plan at the White House on Monday.But the deal that the US presidentstruck with Netanyahu– after Trump dithered for months, allowing Israel to continue its genocidal war with US weapons and unwavering political support – is less a ceasefire proposal than an ultimatum for Hamas to surrender.After nearly two years ofprolonging the warand obstructing ceasefire negotiations, Netanyahu got almost everything he wanted, thanks to Trump. The US plan calls on Hamas to lay down its weapons and release the Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza, but it allows Israeli troops to occupy parts of Gaza for the foreseeable future. It’s close to the “total victory” over Hamas that Netanyahu has consistently promised the Israeli public, but failed to deliver on the battlefield.Israel’s ecocide in Gaza sends this message: even if we stopped dropping bombs, you couldn’t live here | George MonbiotRead moreWhat if Hamas rejects this deal that was drafted without its input, or that of any other Palestinian faction? Trump made clear he would enable Netanyahu to sow even more death and destruction in Gaza. “Israel would have my full backing to finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas,” he said at the White House. On Tuesday,Trump addedhe would give Hamas officials “three or four days” to respond – and warned that the group would “pay in hell” if it turns down the agreement. In past negotiations, Hamas had rejected Israeli proposals that forced the group to disarm and pushed it out of any future role governing Gaza.Once again, Netanyahu has outplayed Trump, who considers himself a master deal-maker. But he’s been regularly outmaneuvered by strongmen like Netanyahu and Vladimir Putin.When Trump took office in January, he had the upper hand over the Israeli leader, having pushed Netanyahu to agree to aceasefire in Gazathat went into effect a day before the president’s inauguration on 20 January. But Netanyahu, who worried that his rightwing government would collapse if he agreed to a permanent truce with Hamas, imposed a new siege on Gaza in early March.With Trump’s blessing, Israel deprived Palestinians of food, medicine and other necessities. Netanyahu then refused to continue negotiations with Hamas, andbroke the ceasefireafter two months.Thanks to his unwavering support of Netanyahu, Trump has made the US more deeply complicit in Israel’s war crimes. Since Netanyahu resumed the war in March, civilians made up about15 of every 16 peoplethat the Israeli military has killed in Gaza, according to the independent violence-tracking group Acled. Israel has also pursued a more severe starvation campaign andinstigated a faminein northern Gaza. (In August,the Guardian reportedthat a classified database maintained by the Israeli military showed that 83% of Palestinians killed in Gaza, between the outbreak of war in October 2023 and May of this year, were civilians.)Along the way, Netanyahu has exploited Trump’s desire for flattery, allowing the Israeli premier to not only draw out the war on Gaza but also to conduct attacks on other countries in the Middle East, including Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Starting withbillions of dollarsin US weapons provided by Joe Biden’s administration and continuing under Trump, Israel has been able to bomb virtually anywhere in the region, with impunity. In June, Israel launched a surprise attack against Iran, killing dozens of top military officials and nuclear scientists. Netanyahu then convinced Trump to briefly join Israel’s war, when he ordered US planes to bomb threemajor nuclear facilitiesin Iran.Two weeks later, in early July, the Israeli premier showed up for dinner at the White House. Trump was eager to build on the momentum of aceasefire he brokeredbetween Iran and Israel, and was planning to cajole Netanyahu into making a deal with Hamas in Gaza. But Netanyahu avoided being publicly pressured by Trump to end the Gaza war, as Trump had done weeks earlier with the Iran ceasefire. Instead, Netanyahu stroked Trump’s ego by revealing that he hadnominated the US presidentfor the Nobel peace prize.Netanyahu managed to both flatter Trump and tap into his sense of grievance over being denied the world’s top peacemaking award. Trump has insisted for years that he deserves the Nobel prize for orchestrating a series of diplomatic agreements between Israel and several Arab countries during his first term. These so-called Abraham Accords were brokered in 2020 by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser at the time, and they included the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. But Trump couldn’t entice Saudi Arabia, the most important Arab state, and its crown prince,Mohammed bin Salman, to reach a normalization deal with Israel.Like Trump’s current peace plan for Gaza, the Abraham Accords were negotiated directly with Israel and autocratic Arab regimes – and they excluded Palestinians from any discussion of their future or aspirations. These are deals conceived by real estate tycoons like Trump, Kushner and Steve Witkoff, who has served as Middle East envoy and one of Trump’s top diplomats in his second term. Trump and Kushner have always viewed Gaza through the prism of areal estate project, where Palestinians are holdouts refusing to cave into pressure to make way for the renovation of prime beachfront property along the Mediterranean Sea.In one of the few positive developments for Gazans, Trump dropped his widely-derided idea, which he floated during a meeting with Netanyahu in February, for theUS to take over Gazaand turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East”, in effect endorsing the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.The Kushner-Blair Gaza plan is a moral atrocity – and a policy catastrophe | Josh PaulRead moreBut on Monday, as Trump announced his latest plan, which would establish a temporary governing board for Gaza that he himself would chair, he couldn’t resist ad-libbing a digression about the perceived value of the territory’s waterfront. “As a real estate person, I mean, they gave up the ocean,”Trump said, referring to the Israeli government’s decision in 2005 to withdraw troops occupying Gaza, along with about 8,000 Israeli settlers. He added: “They gave up the ocean. I said: ‘Who would do this deal?’”In reality, even after its withdrawal, Israelmaintained controlover Gaza’s airspace, borders and shoreline. In 2007, after Hamas took military control of Gaza following its victory in Palestinian legislative elections, Israelimposed a blockadeon the territory that continues until today. Israel gave up the beach, but it still controlled the sea.In the days leading up to Monday’s announcement at the White House, Kushner and Witkoffspent hours meetingwith Netanyahu, who was able to make last-minute changes to Trump’s plan, including the scope and timing of Israeli troop withdrawals from Gaza. As he has for the past two years, the Israeli prime minister managed to impose his will on a US administration that should have far more leverage over him than the other way around. And that means Netanyahu may well doom Trump’s latest peace deal.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuUS politicsUS foreign policyPalestinecommentShareReuse this content"

Framed as a crackdown onSilicon Valley, the policy will devastate American hospitals. Its real casualties will be poor and rural Americans in need of medical care, but with no one left to provide it.One in four US physicians is foreign-trained. Many enter through the H-1B program, disproportionately staffing rural and underserved hospitals where American graduates rarely go. In some facilities, every single doctor is an immigrant. These are the physicians who deliver babies in Mississippi Delta towns, staff emergency rooms in the Dakotas, and run primary care clinics in the Bronx. By raising visa costs from a few thousand dollars to $100,000, the administration is functionally cutting off their pipeline.The consequences will be immediate and severe. In this year’s residency match, international graduates filled more than 6,600 positions, with the vast majority in internal medicine and family medicine – the unglamorous workhorses of primary care. American graduates consistently avoid these specialties, preferring higher-paying and more prestigious fields. Without immigrant physicians, safety-net hospitals will be unable to fill residency slots, rural areas will lose their only steady doctors, and wait times for basic care will stretch our even further than they already are. The result will not be new jobs for Americans; it will be shuttered clinics and lives lost.The administration claims that cutting off immigrant doctors will catalyze domestic production of physicians. But training a doctor takes at least a decade, and requires investments in medical education that both major US political parties have consistently refused to make. Since the 1960s, Congress has chosen not to expand medical school and residency capacity in line with population growth, instead treating immigrant doctors as a convenient – and far cheaper – stopgap.When Medicare was created in 1965, lawmakers agreed to fund graduate medical education precisely because hospitals argued they could not sustain the high cost of residency training on their own. But funding was capped in the 1990s, and despite repeated warnings about looming shortages, Congress has failed to lift those limits. Today, the Association of American Medical Colleges projects a shortfall of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036. That crisis is not the product of immigration policy. It is the predictable result of decades of underinvestment in training the workforce Americans need.As I show in my forthcoming book, The Care of Foreigners: How Immigrant Physicians Changed US Healthcare, the US has always yoked the fate of immigrant physicians to the health of American patients. After the second world war, when new public insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid expanded access to care, lawmakers turned to foreign doctors to fill the gaps. The 1965 Hart-Celler Act, passed the same year as Medicare, was explicitly designed to recruit highly trained professionals from abroad. Within a decade, tens of thousands of physicians – overwhelmingly from India and other postcolonial nations – were staffing hospitals across the United States.This arrangement was hailed as mutually beneficial: the US got the doctors it needed, and immigrant physicians got training and opportunity. But the costs were exported. Countries like India, with far fewer doctors per capita and vastly greater health burdens, lost tens of thousands of their best-trained clinicians. American lawmakers knew it. In 1967, Senator Walter Mondale called it a “national disgrace” that the US was siphoning lifesaving workers from countries “where thousands die daily of disease” in order to staff American hospitals. Yet the practice persisted, institutionalized as a structural feature of US healthcare.What Donald Trump’s new policy does is break even with this pragmatic, longstanding “America-first” tradition with which the country has long prioritized its own convenience over an honest accounting of its effects on the poorer nations from which it continually extracts value. Instead of using immigration policy to stabilize the system, it weaponizes it for exclusion. The $100,000 fee is not simply a labor market reform. It is a political message: immigrant doctors are expendable, and so are the patients they serve.The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and 53 leading medical societies have already urged the administration to exempt physicians from the new fee. But carving out exceptions misses the point. Relying on temporary waivers and emergency visas has always been a precarious way to run a healthcare system. Immigrant physicians are not a contingency plan. They are the backbone of American medicine – and they deserve stability, not discretionary exemptions subject to the whims of Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary.The deeper crisis at play is not immigration at all. It is America’s refusal to build a sustainable pipeline with which to ensure care for its citizens. For 60 years, policymakers have papered over severe underinvestment in medical education and poor rural and urban communities by exploiting immigrant labor. Now, instead of repairing that rotten foundation, the administration is simply dynamiting the patchwork that has kept the system functional. Wealthy hospitals in big cities may find ways to absorb the costs. Rural and safety-net hospitals cannot. Patients in those communities – disproportionately poor, rural, and minority – will be the ones left sacrificed.The lesson of this moment should not be that immigrant doctors need another exception. It is that Americans cannot afford to keep treating healthcare labor as a disposable commodity, imported when convenient and scapegoated when politically expedient. What we need is structural reform: expanding medical school and residency capacity, investing in primary care, and ensuring that immigrant doctors who already sustain the system have a predictable, efficient and permanent route to practice.Immigrant physicians have long been America’s safety net. To slam the door on them now, without fixing the underlying shortages, is more than shortsighted. It is a policy of exclusion disguised as reform – and it will cost lives. America first, in this case, will make Americans die.Eram Alam is a historian of medicine and migration in the department of the history of science at Harvard University.

The 20-point plan toend the ongoing war in Gaza, presented on Monday by the US president, is everything the Israelis had dreamed of – even fantasised about. The hostages will finally return, some to their families, others to their graves. Hamas will be gone, at least as a ruling organisation, and the soldiers will come home. The “peace plan” will, supposedly, mean a return to normality.A brief read-through of the one-page plan might suggest that Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his people were involved in phrasing it. At times, it reads more like a list of Israeli demands than diplomatic compromises. Perhaps that’s why Netanyahu gave it his blessing rather quickly, which seemed to all but seal the deal. Even then, worth mentioning, his speech offered aslightly different versionof the plan from the one in the written document – saying he didn’t agree to a Palestinian state or a full military withdrawal.Once you unwrap the package, remove the ribbons and the superlatives (“potentially one of the great days ever in civilisation”, as Trump put it), more than a few holes open up. The most obvious is the other side in the deal – Hamas, which has yet to approve it. This small detail seems to have been deemed almost irrelevant. Given Netanyahu’s record, one might wonder whether a Hamas refusal would actually be a convenient outcome for him. It would allow him to appear as someone who had genuinely attempted to end the war – while still retaining the full backing of the US to continue it. And since ending the bloodshed might also mean the collapse of his coalition, perhaps there are deeper political calculations at play.Another major question lies in the alternative response that Hamas might give: yes, but. In other words – support for a deal to end the war in principle, but with certain details requiring further negotiation. This would raise the question of how flexibleIsraelcan be, given that Netanyahu’s government currently depends on far-right parties and that many of their members may view even the slightest compromise as grounds to dissolve the coalition (even the current plan has rattled them). At that point, it would become a test of how much pressure the US can realistically exert on Netanyahu – twisting his arm, if necessary. And if that fails, then what?Takesection 17 of the plan, for instance. It states that even if Hamas rejects or delays the agreement, Israel will hand over “terror-free” areas to an international force. How exactly is that supposed to happen? How will such a force actually operate in a war zone? There are no answers to those questions.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Tel Aviv demand an immediate end to the Gaza war, 30 September 2025.Photograph: Eyal Warshavsky/SOPA Images/ShutterstockEven if we assume the original proposal goes through with assistance from Arab and Muslim countries, it won’t be the end of the doubts – only the beginning. Many of the uncertainties concern the so-called day after. The plan promises full humanitarian aid toGaza, including the rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), hospitals, bakeries, and the entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and reopen roads. However, the allocation of funds is missing. The document provides no detail on how much this will cost or, crucially, on who will provide this funding.The same applies to the proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF). Which countries will send troops? How many? Who will have overarching authority over these forces? How will they coordinate with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)? Who will be in charge of ensuring Gaza doesn’t become a playground for various countries, each with their own interests and agendas? And, last but not least: who will give assurances to the people of Gaza that all of this is not just a new form of foreign occupation? These may seem like minor details, but they are essential – if not critical – to make the plan more than theoretical.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This shouldn’t come as a surprise.Many Israelis have been indifferentto the catastrophe in Gaza since the war began – including the mass death and starvation of unarmed Palestinians. It makes sense that they would not concern themselves with how Gaza moves forward.More often than not, it seems that, for Israelis, what happens in Gaza stays in Gaza – with no consequences for the other side whatsoever.In a way, the proposed end to the war fits comfortably within that same mindset. There’s a widespread sense that if the plan goes ahead, Israel can simply return to the days before it all happened. Everything that took place in Gaza will be forgotten, except, of course, the 7 October 2023 massacre won’t be. There will no longer be a reason to protest against Israel globally, and certainly not to impose sanctions on Israeli officials, or call for exclusion from international sporting events or theEurovision song contest.The fact that, for the foreseeable future, the Gaza Strip will remain a devastated area with barely any infrastructure may seem insignificant within Israel. Nor does it appear to matter that it will take the people of Gaza a long time to rebuild their homes and return to work – or to bury their loved ones and grieve. Not to mention that further horrors are likely to be uncovered if Gaza becomes safer and opens up to the foreign press. These issues are scarcely discussed. Like a history book returned to the library, it’s simply closed and filed away.Roy Schwartz is a senior editor and op-ed contributor at HaaretzDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Does anyone care about celebrities in that way?Zoe WilliamsHaving famous contestants is a betrayal of all that’s great about the show – and a misunderstanding of what makes humans tickWed 1 Oct 2025 11.44 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 15.07 EDTShareIf you have never seenThe Traitors, you will be sick to death of people telling you to watch The Traitors: everybody loves it, no one can ever explain why. They describe the premise and it’s a load of people lying to one another. Contestants perform challenges – such as the challenge of running faster than most of them would like – and then they lie. They are often presented with the dilemma of whether to lie or not, but there is very little suspense, because they always choose lying. That is, of course, if they have anything to lie about; the ones who don’t just operate in a perpetual fog of misdirected trust and reptile-brained paranoia. It sounds like the kind of thing you wouldn’t have to watch twice, but that is so far from true you could easily find yourself scouring the world for the connoisseur’s The Traitors (The Traitors Australia, season two).Theoretically then,CelebrityTraitors, which starts next Wednesday, should be everything you want from TV, supersized. It arrives in a flurry of promises – the most brutal yet – with a cast list you couldn’t possibly dislike. Clare Balding, Stephen Fry, Charlotte Church, Celia Imrie, Niko Omilana, Paloma Faith: who wouldn’t want to see them confronting the darkness, or maybe lack of it, at their moral core?Sadly, no: the introduction of famous people to The Traitors is a misunderstanding of what makes the format work, what makes reality TV work as a whole – and what makes humans tick. It’s not that these are the wrong celebrities. It’s awell-curated list: David Olusoga is very trenchant, Joe Marler, a former rugby player, is sweary – and there’s no hate figure in there. They’re not making a pantomime, in the I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! style. They have respected the dignity of The Traitors – and yet still missed the point.‘You killed her!’: My 100% faithful attempt at Traitors Live ExperienceRead moreReality TV works, when it does, on people showing their unvarnished selves – their desires, flaws, highs and lows – disclosed without self-consciousness or egotistical display. It is almost impossible to make an authentic account of yourself unless you’re concentrating on something completely different, which is why the most successful concepts come in the form of a competition – preferably one so engrossing and technical that participants lose all sense of how they are perceived. That’s thegenius of Bake Off, to imagine a scenario in which the stakes could be simultaneously everything and nothing, in the lap of the gods and the sweating hands of each contestant. Even with the car crashes you can see a mile off, you’re obscurely rooting for them, hoping for a last-ditch salvation that couldn’t possibly arrive, not with that butter-to-sugar ratio. Intense concentration as a means of dissolving artifice, breaking down barriers to reveal the beating heart – well, how’s that going to work, with a celebrity? Are they really concentrating? Are they acting concentrating? Are they acting a person acting a lie, in order to then act a person acting ashamed to have been caught out in a lie?Which brings us to the money – regular Traitors are gunning for 100 grand, and an awesome amount of both their own self-reflection and our investment, as viewers, centres on what they want to do with the money, what bad thing has happened to them in the past that makes them want the money more, what they’re prepared to sacrifice to get the money. All money shows are basicallySquid Game-lite, a glowing yet sinister fairytale interlude in life’s harsh economic reality. I would never be so naive as to imagine all famous people are rich. Indeed, part of the drama of Celebrity Traitors is the vague awareness that some of them are probably on their uppers and too proud to admit it. But these guys – yes, even the comedians – are pledging to give the prize pot to charity, a laudable gesture that absolutely destroys the drama.You would only make these sacrifices – of authenticity, of magnetism, of drama – if you’d bought into the foundational myth that celebrities are inherently more interesting than regular people. It’s a weird mistake for this, of all shows, to make, since the most groundbreaking thing it’s done, culturally – yes, more novel even thanClaudia’s fringe– is to demonstrate that you can care about anyone, even the last four random Australians, with all your heart, as soon as their defences are down.I’ll probably still watch it though.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Do the figures back her up?Wed 1 Oct 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 18.07 EDTShareThe governor of the Reserve Bank, Michele Bullock, was at pains on Tuesday afternoon to not give any guidance on what might happen with interest rates. But it did not take a lot of reading between the lines to discern that she thinks the economy is doing well enough that the RBA could pack up its kit bag and go home.Bullock did not rule out another rate cut, but unlike previous months, she didn’t even seem to wish to talk about whether or not the RBA monetary policy board had an “easing bias” – where the members think a rate cut in the future is more likely than not.So, while the possibility of a rate cut on Melbourne Cup Day (oddly only five weeks away, not the usual six-week gap in between meetings) remains, you might have better luck betting on any old nag in the race than on the likelihood of the cash rate going to 3.35%.If the graph does not display click hereThe key giveaway that the RBA seems unlikely to do another rate cut was when, in Bullocks’s press conference on Tuesday, she suggested that the current rate of 3.6% was not “very restrictive”.A restrictive interest rate is one that slows the economy – or to put it bluntly, that causes unemployment to rise. In essence, a restrictive rate is one where households are unable to spend as much as they normally would in the shops and on services, and as a result employment growth falls and unemployment rises.Australia, along with other OECD countries, is mired in mediocrity – and the RBA seems intent on keeping us there | Greg JerichoRead moreBullock said: “I think we feel that it’s still probably a little bit restrictive policy. We certainly don’t think it’s very restrictive … so all we’ve got to go on, because we don’t know what sort of neutral is, is observing inflation, employment and what is happening to the economy.”OK then, what do we observe with inflation?Bullock suggested on Tuesday that while the RBA does not completely dismiss themonthly CPI numbers, it cares most about the quarterly trimmed mean – which tops and tails the biggest rises and falls to give an underlying sense of what is happening to inflation.Using that (and the monthly figure for some extra context), we see inflation firmly within the 2% to 3% target range.If the graph does not display click hereBullock likes to say the RBA aims for 2.5%, but if we are honest that is aiming for a level of precision that is not possible. Given Bullock admits she does not know how restrictive the main policy lever at her disposal is, suggesting the RBA can hit 2.5% inflation on purpose sounds just like marketing spin.What, then, do we observe happening with employment?The most recentAugust figuresshow that total employment growth over the previous year was 1.5%, down from 1.8% in July and 1.9% in June. It is slowing quickly, and at 1.5% it is below the average growth rate of 1.7% we had between 2010 and 2019.If the graph does not display click hereFull-time employment is growing at just 1.3% – again, slower than the 2010s average of 1.4%. Even part-time employment is growing slower than the 2010s average.The 2010s was not a period of strong economic growth; indeed, it was so poor the RBA cut interest rates 15 times from 4.75% to 0.75% to get employment growing. For most of that time (from June 2012 onwards), the cash rate was below the current level of 3.6%.If the graph does not display click hereBut don’t worry, the current rate – according to the RBA – is apparently not slowing the economy all that much.What, then, is happening in the economy?The latest GDP figures had growth at 1.8% – just a smidge over half the long-term average of 3.1%, and again lower than the 2010s average of 2.6%:If the graph does not display click hereBullock suggested the June figures showed the private sector was again contributing more to the economic growth than the public sector. She provided this as a reason for not cutting rates – rather than as a sign of just how weak the overall economy has been – because the private sector should always be contributing more to economy growth!If the graph does not display click hereThe times when the public sector contributed more than the private sector to economic growth were times when things were not going well at all, such as 2015-16 and 2019 – periods when the RBA cut rates to get the economy moving.And why do we want the economy moving? Because GDP growth is strongly linked to unemployment. Over the past 30 years, GDP growth of about 2.75% has been needed to prevent unemployment from rising:If the graph does not display click hereIt is worth noting that in its August statement on monetary policy, the RBA predicted GDP growth out to the end of 2027 never rising above 2.1%.But apparently, that’s all good, no need to cut rates; no need to stimulate the economy; no need to worry about rising unemployment.The RBA is betting the economy is better than the data says, and it has laid the bet on behalf of all of us.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsReserve Bank of AustraliaGrogonomicsInterest ratesAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

One has even threatened to withhold new medicines from NHS patients. Taken together, it’s hard not to conclude that big pharma is at war with the UK.Merckhas scrappeda £1bn research facility, while AstraZeneca ditched a £450m vaccine lab and is rethinking an expansion of another research unit. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS)has cancelled34 partnerships with the NHS in the last year, and Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novartis are all believed to have put investments “on hold”. BMS is alsothreatening to play hardballwith its new schizophrenia drug, saying it is “prepared to make the difficult decision” to “walk away” if the NHS won’t pay the price the corporation wants to charge.One senior government official told the Financial Times that it appeared the companies were working together, saying that the machine-gun rapidity of the industry’s threats “looks very coordinated”. Theylabelled the behaviour“sinister”, and said they’d “never seen anything like this before”. (The chief of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said that such an accusation is “very serious” and “categorically untrue”.) Three NGOs, including the one I work for, have asked the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate this further.One way to understand the industry’s actions is as a full-scale capital strike, in which international capital refuses to invest in order to bully a government into concessions. In this case, the obvious point of contention is NHS drug spending. The industry has long had it in for the National Institute ofHealthand Care Excellence (Nice), the body that allows the NHS to judge the value of medicines and, in effect, negotiate prices down. And it is even less happy with the voluntary scheme for branded medicines pricing, access and growth (VPAG), which allows the government to claw back some of its revenue when prices paid by the NHS rise too fast –a programmethat the industry has labelled “unsustainable”. In short, big pharma hates the power the NHS has to force down its obscene prices. And it uses every opportunity to push back on this power.The latest opportunity comes in the shape of Donald Trump. It is no coincidence that big pharma’s screams became hysterical around the time of the US president’s recent state visit to the UK. Trump needs to be seen to be dealing with eye-watering medicine prices in the US, the country where the drug industry really makes its money.Traditionally, the US did little to contain medicine prices. Biden had started to confront the industry, forcing companies to negotiate prices. Trump’s solution is different – true to type, he believes the problem is not profiteering corporations in desperate need of regulation, but freeloading foreigners. He’s given pharma companies until the end of the month to start equalising global prices. No one knows what will happen next, though tariffs of up to 200%have been suggested.Inhis tariff pact with Trumpearlier this year, Starmer pledged to “improve the overall environment for pharmaceutical companies”. Trump has not forgotten. In a “frosty”meeting with Rachel Reevesearlier this month, the US’s billionaire ambassador to London strongly pushed the chancellor to offer companies a better deal on drug pricing.Big pharma uses any crisis as an opportunity to boost its already inflated profits. With Trump’s support, it’s determined to push its long-term goals.It simply isn’t the case that Britain pays too little for its medicines. Last year, NHS England spent close to£20bn on medicines and devices. Research has repeatedly shown that brandedmedicines are actually too expensive, rather than too cheap, for the benefits they offer to patients, even with the rebates and clawbacks.The truth is that big pharma is already one of the most profitable industries in the world. Diverting more of the NHS’s stretched budgets to please these fantastically wealthy global corporations will not help patients. The science minister, Patrick Vallance, said this week that significantprice rises were necessaryto end the dispute. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has so far stood his ground, saying correctly that he’s already made a generous offer. For all our sakes, the government must stand firm.It probably is the case that Britain underinvests in medical research. But handing blank cheques to big pharma won’t get us better drugs. Instead, we must seize this opportunity to end the stranglehold these companies have over our healthcare, and restructure the way we make our medicines. This will cost money. But medicines cost the public a fortune anyway.We should work with countries across Europe to build world-class, publicly controlled medical research capacity. Then, rather than handing over that research to the pharma industry, we must develop a different model that allows for the sharing and licensing of research in a way that supports international collaboration to produce better medicines for all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet, theTaliban’s recent nationwide internet blackouthas turned that sense of distance upside down.On Monday, theTalibanordered a sweeping shutdown of internet and telecommunications services across Afghanistan, citing a decree by their leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, aimed at curbing “immorality”. It has left millions of Afghans – both inside the country and across the diaspora – isolated, voiceless and trapped in a silence that feels suffocating.I used to join from Melbourne, alongside my brother in London and my sister in Pakistan, for our weekly video chats with Mama, other siblings and our nieces and nephews in Kabul. Mama would chide me for losing weight – her gentle worry mixed with pride – but I would insist it was all for getting healthier. She often called the internet her lifeline, her eyes quietly fixed on our faces, deep in thought, sometimes cursing the Taliban under her breath for their hardline policies against women.Afghanistan ‘blind without phones and internet’ on second day of telecoms blackoutRead moreWe tragically lost her this winter, her long illness compounded by the heartbreak of being separated from her children in an increasingly isolated Afghanistan. Our family chats have continued in her memory, cherishing the moments she loved most: sitting in the corner of our Kabul home next to a sunlit window overlooking the little orchard, the fruit trees and grapevines heavy with summer, a cup of tea in hand, quietly smiling at her grandchildren. Those moments are now inaccessible; my nieces and nephews, once by her side, cannot reach me through this digital divide.For millions of Afghans inside Taliban-controlled territory, the internet was more than a tool – it was a lifeline. It allowed girls and women to attend online classes, enabled journalists to report atrocities to the wider world, and gave activists a platform to organise against the regime’s oppressive policies. With the shutdown, these lifelines have been severed. Education for girls, already under attack, has been snatched away almost entirely. The spaces where women could access information, share experiences and find support have been obliterated.The UN mission to Afghanistan has warned that this blackout is deepening the humanitarian and economic crises, crippling banking, aviation and healthcare services, and further isolating women and girls.The Taliban frame this blackout as a moral intervention. But it really is a calculated effort to consolidate power and silence dissent. By controlling information, the regime aims to stifle opposition and maintain its grip on the country.From the safety of my Melbourne suburb, I watch helplessly as my family in Kabul and friends across Afghanistan navigate this digital darkness. Messages, calls and emails no longer go through. The silence is deafening. I feel both impossibly far away and painfully close, unable to reassure, comfort or intervene in the only ways I once could.Afghan girls who were already denied formal education are now completely cut off from learning. Journalists are silenced. Activists are isolated. Doctors, teachers and ordinary citizens lose access to essential services. This is not merely a technical disruption; it is a systematic erasure of society’s voice and agency.The ripple effects extend beyond Afghanistan’s borders. For those of us in the diaspora, the blackout is a stark reminder of the fragility of freedom and the power of information. If a regime can so completely cut off its citizens, what does it mean for the future of the region, for human rights and for international norms?Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAfghanistanOpinionTalibanSouth and central AsiaInternetHuman rightscommentShareReuse this content"

It is many great things, but it is not thatWed 1 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 07.47 EDTShareIn her 2025state of the union speechlast month, Ursula von der Leyen didn’t mince her words. Europe, the president of the European Commission declared, is engaged in a “fight for a continent that is whole and at peace”. Her analysis of the problem was pretty accurate. What is increasingly clear, however, is that the European Union is not the whole solution. The EU is good at many things. Being an effective defence organisation is not one of them.Don’t get me wrong: European integration has, over the decades, performed an important security function. By binding former enemies together, it helped them overcome centuries-old rivalries. By incorporating new members, it calmed potential tensions (not least among those countries formerly within the Soviet bloc).European integration was indeed a “peace project” – harnessing economic means for political ends. In the words of Robert Schuman, integrating coal and steel in the first postwar “community” was a means of ensuring that “war between France and Germanybecomes not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible”.Limiting access by states to the materials used for waging war was one way of ensuring peace. Tying them into institutional structures that constrained their autonomy was another. Postwar Germany was bound into a network of institutional constraints that effectively prevented a renewed attempt at continental domination. Power was diffused in a deliberate attempt to prevent hegemony.The EU’s complexinstitutional systemis, in other words, a deliberate feature, not a bug. The larger member states cannot impose their will on the others. Small states enjoy disproportionately high representation in the Council, commission and European parliament. Consensus rules (even sometimes when the treaties allow for some member states to be outvoted). The EU does not, as a traditional nation state does, have sole recourse to the use of force for legitimate use, let alone (look at the contemporary US) to compel compliance.This is the price you pay for cooperation between sovereign states. No politician, however small their country, wants to report back to their electorate that their interests were ignored or overruled. And in particular, none wants to forfeit their right to decide on matters of war and peace, life and death, to lose that monopoly on the legitimate use of force.And this is all well and good for economic policy. Here, ambiguity works and time pressures are generally not acute. The EU single market wasfounded ona deliberately opaque understanding between Helmut Kohl, François Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher, whose economic philosophies could hardly have been more different. And that market is still incomplete.Yet the EU’s success in removing trade barriers has been remarkable. And it has been possible because all EU countries feel a sense of ownership. Because even small states can’t be forced to do what they don’t want to.When it comes to defence, by contrast, delay and fudge simply won’t hack it. You can’t spend a decade deciding whether to intervene in a conflict. Nor can you obfuscate when deciding whether to invest in air defences or tanks. Speed and clarity are simply not what the EU was designed for. Quite the contrary, in fact. Structures designed to diffuse power are utterly inappropriate if the ambition is to deploy hard power.All of which takes on a whole new significance in a rapidly changing world. With war raging in Ukraine, andRussiaincreasingly willing to test Europe’s resolve on its eastern flank, Europeans are having to consider ways to either replace or supplement a weakened US commitment. And doing so in a context in which the institutional solution to which they have defaulted on so many issues is simply not fit for purpose.Not that the EU has no role to play. Where defence and security overlap with core EU powers to act – think defence procurement and the need to encourage greater collaboration between member states – it will remain a key forum (albeitserious thoughtwill have to go into how best to involve non-EU European states such asthe UK, Norway, Switzerland and even Canada). But when it comes to the heavy lifting, to coordinating military actions by member states, it is not a suitable forum.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the challenge we face now is not the one that confronted them. Our primary concern is not with taming the power of the biggest EU countries but with projecting it.As Donald Trump calls into question the foundations of the post-1945 international order, Europeans are waking up to the need to do more to ensure their security themselves. However, a peace project cannot simply be transformed into a war project – at least not without sacrificing those things that make it effective at the things it does well. Europeans will need to look elsewhere for an institution that allows them to work together more effectively on defence.Anand Menon is director of UK in a Changing Europe and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College LondonExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionRussiaDefence policyEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

The latter is a red pepper and garlic relish, hailing from the Balkans. “It’s homemade,” she says, given to her by a friend. Her Irish assistant, Declan, who cooked the lamb, bustles around her amicably. Abramović is amicable too, offering me the chops and lathering ajvar on to a rice cake for me to taste (delicious).It is a disarmingly cosy welcome from the high priestess of performance art. Then again, this might be the quiet before the storm. Her new show, Balkan Erotic Epic, a four-hour performance conceived and directed by Abramović and commissioned by Factory International, may ruffle some feathers. More than 70 actors, dancers and local performers will feature in 13 scenes that enact ancient ritual, rites and folklore from Slavic tradition. Many contain nudity and act out explicit eroticism that arises out of the tales collected from Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Greece, Turkey, Serbia, and more.She points to a phallus that looks like a long thin neck. ‘We call that one Giacometti,’ she says“I found out,” she says, “that these ancient rituals for farming, for childbirth, for weddings, for funerals, with absolutely no exception, used the genitals – the vagina and the penis – in so many different ways.” Screens, film, music and animation will accompany live performance and fill the monumental 64-metre long, 21-metre high dimensions of Aviva Studios.It is the most important project of her life, she says, with an aim to rediscover the past and our present selves through it. It is significant for Aviva Studios, too. John McGrath, its artistic director, says the venue was partly built with Abramović in mind. “When we were developing the building, she was right at the top of our list. We felt she could do something amazing here.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve never done anything so complex’... Abramović and cast.Photograph: Marco AnelliInitially, she proposed a collaboration with Lady Gaga, but that changed after an emergency meeting in which she introduced this idea. Is Abramović scared by its maximalist scale? “Oh my God! First of all, my works are very minimal. This is not minimal. I’ve never done anything so complex, so daring … I wake up in the middle of the night. I’ve never been like this for any other work.”That’s saying something for an artist who in previous works has had a bow-and-arrow aimed at her heart by her former partner, the artist Ulay, lost consciousness inside a burning wooden star and famously sat in the same chair for 700 hours at New York’s MoMA. And those are justsomeof her gruelling exercises in pain and endurance.This show is clearly personal for Abramović, who was born and raised in former Yugoslavia, now Serbia. It begins with the funeral of its one-time communist leader Josip Broz Tito and ends with wedding revelries. There is a world of ritual in between, from filmed clips of women beating their breasts in mourning to dancing skeletons and a giant orgy.I expect a lot of criticism but that just proves the point – we don’t accept our own historyThere will be Albanian warrior women alongside men “penetrating” the soil as part of a fertility rite, and a homoerotic dance between an Albanian and Serbian (politically, they are “mutual enemies”) while a pregnant woman will be soaked in milk, in keeping with Romany ritual. There will also be a “mushroom garden” populated by five-metre penises growing out of the ground. Abramović shows me a miniature picture of it and points to a phallus resembling a long thin neck: “We call that one Giacometti.”Nearly 79, the artist is warm and delightfully unboundaried, linking arms as we walk, looking ageless in head-to-toe black, with gleaming red nails and a pale-skinned glamour. Will her body be part of this piece? “I don’t promise anything: maybe, maybe not.” She will introduce the show to audiences each night, but beyond that, she admits, “I find it extremely difficult to direct and be a part of it at the same time.”Is she worried that a British audience will find it all terribly embarrassing, or be scandalised? She has had a taste ofthatalready – in 2023, when Imponderabilia,featuring anaked couple in a doorway, was staged as part of her retrospective at the Royal Academy in London (re-enacted from 1977 when she conceived it with Ulay). It was all the tabloids could talk about, she says, rather than the meaning of the work itself. Yet, at the same time, “nakedness brings so much power because people are scared, interested, amused and intrigued. So I accept an audience seeing this over four hours will have lots of different emotions. They will be shocked, amused because there’s humour in it, disturbed, and they will be emotional.”View image in fullscreen‘I went back into mythology within Slavic culture’ … the artist at rehearsals.Photograph: Marco AnelliA rehearsal of a funeral scene contains just this churn of emotions as a dead, naked man is slowly dressed by a woman while an ensemble dances to a Serbian lament. It weaves grief – wailing and sobbing – with romance and erotica, as do other scenes in the show (the orgy has skeletons writhing between living bodies).To those who might equate it to pornography, Abramović would say it is emphatically not. It is too elemental, and earnest, for that. Female performers have even been asked not to shave their underarm and pubic hair for three months beforehand.“For me, these rituals deal with the history of human beings. It’s about humanity, not about pornography. That’s incredibly important.” Still, she says, “I expect a lot of criticism because it’s so easy to criticise. But that just proves the point that we don’t even accept our own history: I didn’t invent any of these rituals.”The idea for the show was in fact a reactionagainstthe blank-faced performance of sex that pornography offers. In 2006, she made a short movie for a film anthology called Destricted. It featured myths from the Balkans in animated form. She was asked to create a piece about pornography in art after this. “So I started looking at pornos and I found them incredibly boring and repetitive. They had absolutely no substance. I gave up the whole idea and went back into mythology within Slavic culture.”Whatever thetabloids may say,Abramović is excited. Her tone is low-key, her humour deadpan, but she begins to bubble with enthusiasm as she talks. “Let me just show you this,” she says, opening file after file on her laptop, flicking up image upon image.In one wedding day ritual, a groom makes three holes in a bridge, penetrating each one with his penisThere is canny branding alongside the heartfelt exuberance, with accompanying merchandise ready to go. Declan splays open white T-shirts with tastefully sketched breasts on them, along with baseball caps and aprons dotted with black-and-white willies. They are vaguely comic and so cutely inoffensive that I am tempted to ask Declan if he accepts credit card payments.Therewerecertain rituals that couldn’t be performed as part of the show, though, because “they would be crossing all the borders”. Those stories are not excised altogether but told through animation, Abramović explains. So there is a story from 14th-century Croatia that involves a wife putting a fish into her vagina overnight to make a love potion; and, from 14th-century Bosnia, a wedding day ritual to protect against impotence in which a groom makes three holes in a bridge, penetrating each one with his penis.What has led her to create this work now, in a world of so much political tumult, from Ukraine – a war she has publicly criticised – to Gaza, Trump, Putin and Netanyahu. “We have hell,” she says. “That’s why this is so important. I want to go back to the roots of everything.When I went to Glastonbury [to lead seven minutes of silence, en masse, from the Pyramid stage in 2024]everyone told me it was crazy and that no one would do it. But I knew that this was what we needed. The only way to change the world is to change ourselves. But for that, we have to look into our pasts.”Abramović lived in Amsterdam with Ulay for several years before relocating to New York. She does not regret leaving Europe. “There was no stimulus in Amsterdam, even Van Gogh left Amsterdam! I need places with trouble, because then I have a reason [to create art].” And while her work is not always overtly political, it often relates to the current moment.Right now, the US feels “totally divided … There could be civil war,” she says. So if anything can be said or done through art, she is there to do it. “I don’t think art can change the world, but it can definitely contribute in opening the consciousness and asking the right questions. That’s my function.”This work, in which sex and the genitals are shown to play a vital part in community life, may even be healing for our time, she suggests. Because, however much guilt religion imposes on the flesh, sexual and reproductive energy is not an opposing force to spirituality for Abramović. “It is the only energy we have in our bodies. This energy can turn into violence, into aggression, but also into tenderness and love. That is what I’m exploring here.”View image in fullscreen‘Liberating my mother is something I couldn’t do in life, so I’m doing it in this work’ … at rehearsals.Photograph: Marco AnelliBorn a year after the end of the second world war, she was partly raised by her grandmother, who was a deeply religious Orthodox Christian, as was her mother. The latter was a keen supporter of Tito’s regime and strict with her daughter. “I lost my virginity at 24 years old. My mother said that sex was dirty. I was not able to go anywhere … So I needed to rebel. I needed to find out, ‘Who am I?’ I wanted to know all the possibilities of the body and mind – how the body, mind and soul is connected.”The show gathers another layer of intimacy because Abramović has inserted her mother into it, albeit as a fictional character. She emerges in communist uniform – a national hero and decorated army major, ever present, weaving among the 13 scenes, silent and aloof, until she arrives at a scene involving drinking, dancing and nakedness. “She gets more interested, starts dancing and taking off her clothes. Liberating my mother is something I couldn’t do in life, so I’m doing it in this work.”Was her mother proud of her? “It’s so complicated. When I sent her cuttings of my work, she cut out every single page of nudity before showing other people, so 360 pages became about 72 pages. She was thinking I was completely wild and she’d lost control of me.”I hope Trump doesn’t come to see the nakednessAbramović only found out the extent of her mother’s admiration for her when she found her diaries after she died, having had dementia. “If I had read one page of her diary while she was alive, my life would have been different with her. She wanted to make me a warrior. She never kissed me my entire life. Ever. I asked her one day, at 40, why. She said she didn’t want to spoil me.”She intends to celebrate her 80th birthday when this show travels to thePark Avenue Armoryin New York next year. She will throw a gigantic party amid the bare-breasted women and outsized phalluses. “I hope Trump doesn’t come to see the nakedness,” she jokes. But seriously, she will invite everybody who means something to her. “I had a difficult life, I had a good life, I had a more interesting life than I could possibly have imagined. So I want to embrace that moment.”And after that? Well, her diary is fully booked until 2029 and she has just had a knee replacement. She rolls up her trousers to reveal a long white scar. A German film-maker recently called her up, wanting to make a retrospective of her life, on her 80th. “I said no,” she says, deadpan. “It’s too early for that.”Balkan Erotic Epic is atAviva Studios, Manchester, from 9-19 October followed by an international tourExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMarina AbramovićPerformance artinterviewsShareReuse this content"

I wouldn’t be the one manspreading!’Interview byTim JonzeWed 1 Oct 2025 09.22 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 12.42 EDTShareThese boys were playing for Colebrook Royals, a football club in Chigwell, Essex. It was 2019 and they were in the dressing room before team practice for a photoshoot arranged by the charityYoungMinds. The plan was that, after the photos, the boys would speak to two dads – Nick Easey and Ryan Smith – who had lost their teenage sons to suicide. The fathers wanted the boys to share their own feelings about mental health, to normalise such conversations, even in a very male environment such as football training.This shot was taken before the main shoot. I’d set up my lights and chose what part of the dressing room to shoot in and let the boys sit where they wanted. As we waited for the dads to arrive, I noticed something interesting going on and I took a single shot.I think I was drawn to how groups had formed between the boys – there’s a nice symmetry in the frame. Three boys are looking at me, three are looking across and the other three are looking down. Also the colours are pleasing. Even though it’s a shot of a team, wearing the same kit, you can see different personalities coming across, different emotions and allegiances. There are a lot of distinct characters in the photo. It sits between a posed shot and reportage, a moment within a staged setup.My pictures of the Windrush generation were displayed outside. Someone scratched off the eyes in every single photographIt captures a certain adolescent awkwardness. It’s fun as a viewer to think about which of the boys is most like your younger self. Who do you most identify with? I think I would be one of the boys looking over sideways, seeing what’s going on and wanting to be included. I wouldn’t be the one manspreading! This supposed moment of boredom has a lot of drama and narrative, I think it’s one of the strengths of photography – you can make up your own stories about what’s going on in the frame.The dads who came to speak to the group were really interesting. It must be absolutely awful to lose your son in that way. They would have been working through a lot of really big emotions, but they were trying to do something positive in the process. The boys were definitely listening to them and asking questions. Of course it’s difficult to tell how effective it was, but it was definitely a good conversation, especially in that environment.There’s a famous shot by Garry Winogrand ofpeople on a benchin New York in the 1960s. It captures three girls gossiping; next to them there’s a black guy and a white woman having a romantic or friendly chat; and two women distracted by something behind them. Maybe subconsciously I had that in my mind when I made this image.This shot is not that typical of my work, which normally involves portraits where I build up a longer connection with the subject. I like spending time with them, hearing their stories and working from there. That’s the best part of my job in a way. I like to invest in my subjects and care about what they look like.I shoot celebrities and less famous people, too. I did a series on people from the Windrush generation that was displayed outdoors in Windrush Square in Brixton, London. Sadly, the images were vandalised. Someone scratched the eyes off every single photograph – there must have been 20 of them. I think beyond the physical damage to the prints, I was concerned at how it would make the sitters feel to see their eyes scratched out in the photos. It turned out the person who did it had mental health issues.In the end, this photo of the boys wasn’t used for the story that ran with it. The dads weren’t even in the shot so it wasn’t exactly what the client had asked for. But looking at it afterwards I realised that I noticed a different thing in it every time I looked at it. Although it’s not representative of my usual work, it’s the image that’s stayed with me.View image in fullscreenAmit Lennon.Photograph: Amit LennonAmit Lennon’s CVBorn:1968, Jerusalem, IsraelTrained:“Self taught – I photographed stars as part of my degree in astronomy and physics.”Influences:“Nan Goldin, Walker Evans, August Sander, Saul Leiter, William Eggleston, Garry Winogrand, Diane Arbus and Taryn Simon.”High point:“Probably the first time I saw my photo in print with a credit, I think it was in the Independent.”Low point:“Having all the photos in my Windrush Untold Stories exhibition vandalised.”Top tip:“Photography can be your sketchbook, your voice, your companion and your magic key to unlock worlds and stories you weren’t expecting.

She later built a solo career, and hasn’t wanted to revisit the past. “Everyone fucking reforms,” she says, sat in a cafe in Toulouse close to where she has lived for the past five years, wearing a black velvet jacket with that blond hair in a high messy bun.But Transvision Vamp have indeed reformed for their first tour in three decades, due to begin in Australia in February. She didn’t have a bass player for this autumn’s solo tour, so she asked former Transvision Vamp bassist Dave Parsons if he’d do it. Though the other members aren’t on board, the pair have now decided to reclaim the band name. “Somehow it didn’t bother me any more,” James says of that name. “I just said yes – it could be the start of a great adventure.”We said, ‘We’re going to be the biggest band in the world: give us a record deal!’Adopted at the age of one and raised in a middle-class family in Brighton, James began her musical adventures by buying the Sex Pistols’ Never Mind the Bollocks aged 10, and at 14 she went to see the Clash at the Brighton Centre. “I was up at the barrier,” she recalls. “I remember the passion and the power – it felt like freedom.” She left home on her 16th birthday with £100 and a toothbrush, “absolutely fearless, ready for all of it”.James met guitarist Nick Christian Sayer in a Brighton bar in 1986 and they formed Transvision Vamp the following year. They marched into the offices of EMI and demanded to see Dave Ambrose, the executive who had signed Sex Pistols. “We said: ‘We’re going to be the biggest band in the world, give us a deal.’ It wouldn’t happen now, but the lady at the front desk ushered us up to his room.” James played Ambrose their demo and he gave them five days in a studio to flesh the songs out, including their first single, Revolution Baby. The band were soon gathered round the receptionist’s radio to hear the song’s first play on Radio 1 – “A mind-blowing concept: millions of other people hearing it at exactly the same time.”I was told to apologise if I wanted to ever go back on Going LiveFusing Bolan with Blondie by way of the New York Dolls and Sex Pistols, the band scored hits including I Want Your Love, Baby I Don’t Care and Landslide of Love, as well as Brit award nominations and regular slots on Top of the Pops. James the third “most fanciable female” in Smash Hits’ 1989 readers’ poll, but the Face dubbed her “the woman everybody loves to hate” and Time Out included her in its 1990 Hated 100 list. On television, meanwhile, she was often patronised by older male interviewers. The BBC’sFrank Bough“came at me a few times”, she says, referring to his derisive tone. “It made me think: ‘Who the fuck are you?’”When James casually admitted on the BBC children’s show Going Live that she was not wearing underwear, she was hauled up to the show’s producers. “I was told to apologise if I wanted to ever go back on,” she remembers, “so I said: ‘I’m so sorry if this disturbed your children’s broadcasting, but the kids didn’t care.’” At the opposite end of the spectrum, she was contacted byJean-Jacques Beineix, director of cult film Betty Blue (who died in 2022). James flew to meet him for lunch. “That was a little bit lewd,” she says. “He wanted to know how willing I was to be naked. In almost every scene. It was more the Harvey Weinstein type of audition.”View image in fullscreenJames performing with Transvision Vamp in 1989.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesTransvision Vamp remained “part of the zeitgeist at the end of the 80s and into 1991”, she says. As well as topping the UK charts, they broke into the Australian Top 10 and gained traction in the US. “But then grunge was coming, and east coast hip-hop, and rave.” Their label was so unimpressed with third album Little Magnets Versus the Bubble of Babble that it was not even released in the UK.James moved to the US to pursue a solo career. One day she was at the bar of the Sunset Marquis hotel in Hollywood when she spotted Pete Thomas, drummer with Elvis Costello, and asked if Costello might be interested in writing a song for her. Thomas suggested she write him a letter, which she did on headed hotel notepaper. “When I got back to England, there was a cassette popped through my mailbox.”This was Now Ain’t the Time for Your Tears, a whole album that Costello and his then partner, former Pogues bassist Caitlín O’Riordan, had written together for James in a single weekend. David Bailey was hired to shoot the cover portrait. “I was massive, and Elvis was one of the most famous musicians in rock’n’roll: what’s not to like?” Her record label, she says, “thought we would just ride this baby straight to the bank”. But it only reached No 43 in the charts. What went wrong? “The content of the music,” she says.She mentions Puppet Girl, which starts with the lines: “Hey there little puppet girl, how’d you learn to talk that way? / Hey there little puppet girl, who put the mouth in all the things you say?” Costello, she claims, “definitely had a concept of me as this silly little blond thing that’s trying to make it”. She accuses him of writing “a male cliche of what idiots young female pop stars are. It was quite nasty – he was asking me to sing derogatory stuff about myself, or this concept of myself.”I ask Costello for his take. He says the songs were “clearly written as a satire of the way contemptuous pop managers and moguls regard pop stars, particularly young women … It was a role to inhabit, in which the star was mocking tormentors by going to even greater extremes, making fun of her hit parade rivals and reading her own bad reviews.” He says the production on Now Ain’t the Time for Your Tears ended up having “all the punch of a sock full of cold rice pudding”, but “Ms James’s excellent delivery was the album’s sole redeeming feature … I’ve only ever met Ms James once and then very briefly but I thought she must by now have developed a sense of humour about this business that we call show. I fear I might have been wrong.”There’s a line of spunky, independent-minded, warrior-like young female pop stars. I think Miley Cyrus took a look at meAfter the commercial disappointment of Now Ain’t the Time for Your Tears, James retreated from releasing music. When she wasn’t having dinner with Bob Dylan and Van Morrison (“Van and I were good comrades for a while”) or hanging out with Bono in Dublin (“He was very protective and encouraging during that Elvis period”), she was living in Ladbroke Grove with her then boyfriend, ex-Clash guitarist Mick Jones.James did not release any music for a decade: were these her wilderness years? “I like to think of them as my industrious years,” she counters. “I was learning how to write songs. Normally you would do that as a teenager in your bedroom and then make it, but I did it the other way round.” She returned in 2004, releasing two albums with the group Racine and then four solo albums including 2016’s The Price of the Ticket, for which her backing band included a Pistol (Glen Matlock), two Stooges (Steve Mackay and James Williamson), a Bad Seed (James Sclavunos) and Lenny Kaye, a member of the Patti Smith Group. “I had known Glen since I was a teenager, I met James Sclavunos in a bar at the Bowery Hotel, Lenny lived two streets from me in New York and I contacted James Williamson on Facebook – all people that caused me to want to be a musician in the first place.”View image in fullscreen‘Completely unplanned’ … James today.Photograph: David Leigh DoddAfter 17 years in New York, James went to France to housesit for a friend, “and ended up staying. It was totally random and not planned at all.”She says she sees herself in Gwen Stefani, and “I think Miley Cyrus has had a look [at me]. There’s a continuous path of kind of spunky, independently minded, fearless young females that are warriors.” She speaks with pride about her solo albums, and while they haven’t had the impact of Transvision Vamp, “I don’t miss the clamour of people’s adulation. The only difference [not being famous] has made is that I have to book my own flights and find my own way to the airport.”Supporting the Jam, sausages with the Bay City Rollers and defying skinheads: post-punk girl group Dolly Mixture look backRead moreThere will be plenty of that with tour dates in Australia and Spain already confirmed for next year, more countries being planned, and maybe even another album. Joining the reformed Transvision Vamp alongside her and Parsons are Sclavunos and Thurston Moore collaborator Alex Ward, and James says she’s not in it for the money: “I’m not the wealthiest person in the world, but I’m by no means the poorest either. This was completely unplanned but I have great hopes for it. In the old days, my pinnacle was always to play Madison Square Garden, but this time, who knows. The potential is massive. All I know is that whatever the size of venue, I am going to walk off stage feeling exhausted, exhilarated and knowing I gave it everything.”The Wendy James Band begin their UK tour on 1 October.

Rhythmic gasps and hoots from the dancers build a sonic matrix in which the work unfolds. There’s a physical matrix too, the ensemble forming lines, circles and grids from which solos, duets and trios emerge. It’s as if air itself had become a 3D maze, the dancers wriggling through its pathways without touching the sides, or each other. The feel is studious, both in the dancers’ rehearsal-studio attire and in the compositional exactitude. On the almost empty soundtrack, an occasional lo-fi hum will swell and subside. It’s layered and limpid, as subtle as it is incisive: Forsythe choreographs not only the stage, but also our attention.Undertainment was one of the most anticipated pieces at the 2025Lyon Dance Biennale, where Ioannis Mandafounis’s Lisa similarly set up clear structures within which the dancers improvise. This work, too, feels alert and alive. Yet where Forsythe is spare, Mandafounis is profuse: 1930s costumes, an onstage pianist (Gabriele Carcano) playing swirls of Fauré, poetry by Osip Mandelstam voiced in several languages, a tumble of turbulent dancing that echoes the piano’s splashing sonorities and feels full of ungraspably fleeting stories. Mandafounis’s method is generative, and the dancers are breathtaking in it; yet sometimes you feel a good edit might give the material more shape.View image in fullscreenSubtle and incisive … William Forsythe’s Undertainment.Photograph: Dominik MentzosÀ l’Ombre d’un Vaste Détail, Hors Tempête by Christian Rizzo also features a poetic text (by Célia Houdart), and though this sets the mutable mood it also pulls focus from choreography brimming with poetry of its own. It’s a shadowy work that seems almost to dawn upon the stage, dark figures gaining clarity as they traverse the space, hands sometimes passing amicably across shoulders. Scenes form and fade: a daisy-chain of linked gestures and steps; ripple effects and counterpulls; coils and recoils of action and energy. It’s all connotation and suggestion, yet never vague: the dancers are poised and precise, on a human scale, and the choreography offers coherence without conformity.Conformity – the adherence to group rules – was at stake in some other works at the biennale.About Lambada by Collectif ÈSdeconstructs the lascivious dance into two trios, one group sticking rigorously to the rhythm while the other is all about keeping bodily contact with each other. The play between the regimented and the organic is clever, but thin – certainly not strong enough to carry the weight of history on a video projection that mashes the libidinous energies of the hit lambada song with the fall of the Berlin Wall.View image in fullscreenDownbeat chorus line … Jan Martens’ The Dog Days Are Over.Photograph: Stefanie NashMuch more interesting – also exasperating and enlivening – is BelgianJan Martens’ revival of his 2014 work The Dog Days Are Over. A slight bounce in the knees leads a line of dancers in somewhat grungy gym clothes to start jumping on the spot. That is basically it, for 70 minutes (talk about sticking to rules), though they do swivel and shift place, evolve into side and backsteps, add some arms, and even stay still – though the pauses are as much an exercise in endurance as the bounces. This is a determinedly downbeat chorus line – no high kicks, no showtime – and you either submit to its regime, as the dancers must, or you don’t. Unlike 20th-century minimalist dance, which was interested in patterns, this relentless minimalism is about endurance and survival. What does it achieve? Respect for its dogged tenacity, discomfort with its spectacle of regulation and exhaustion. You can’t exactly like it, but it will probably make you think.F*cking Future, a big, bold and indeed beautiful new show by the Portuguese artist Marco da Silva Ferreira is easier to like though strangely superficial. The eight dancers are highly watchable, as is their stylistically freewheeling blend of steps; they’re also a mix of races and gender identities. But it’s mostly formation dancing, and the performers are oddly uniform: lithe and youthful in identikit shiny pants and backless tops. It feels like conformity masked by glow-up effects, and marshalled towards a saccharine finale. To be fair, Ferreira knows his aims (he talks about the military and the militant body, one repressive, the other liberatory), but it feels as if the insurgent energies of his previous work, Carcaça, had been packaged and marketed as F*cking Future.View image in fullscreenLooming future … Último Helecho.Photograph: Nina LaisnéFrançois Chaignaud has often brought the past into the present, and does so again in Último Helecho, alongside the music director Nina Laisné and the Argentine singer Nadia Larcher. The future – that is, death – also hangs over the performance, particularly in Spanish songs evoking the sorrows and the caperings that constitute life before death. Hybridising European baroque and South American folk styles, the piece spirals around Larcher and Chaignaud (both dance, both sing, both wear costumes that resemble ornamented exoskeletons), backed by a troubadourish band and a set design of bony granite. In other hands it might appear arch and affected; here, the performers – Chaignaud in particular, a classy and truly singular talent – imbue even the most stylised gestures with numinous significance.Elsewhere, Repertório No 2 by Afro-Brazilians Davi Pontes and Wallace Ferreira (who come to London’s Dance Umbrella festival in October) addresses the hierarchies and stereotypes that, like it or not, sit within and alongside us in the performance arena. Naked throughout, Pontes and Ferreira eyeball the audience and each other, and after a regimented stomping sequence (conformity again) they strike a pose. The cycle repeats, the poses becoming variously sexualised, abject or showy, and increasingly mingled with the audience. Stark as well as starkers, it has the feel of an art installation, more concerned with iconography than choreography.“Against the violence that pervades the world, dance as an act of freedom,” proclaimed the biennale’s own headline to preface this year’s edition, a sentiment that echoes its founding principles in 1984. After my return to London, I learned that on the penultimate night of the biennale, three of its invited artists had been racially abused and attacked in Lyon by a group of men, who reportedlyinvoked the name of Trump. People have rightly beenshocked and appalled, but can we truly count ourselves as surprised, in the current climate?La lutte continue.Selected productions from the festival areon touruntil 17 October.

But that shock pales into comparison to the reaction to the latest big move in the industry: EA (Electronic Arts), the publisher best known for its juggernaut sports games Madden and EA Sports FC (previously called Fifa),is being taken privatein the “biggest leveraged buyout in history”. It’s a deal worth $55bn, by a trio of investors who, on paper, look like a collection of end-of-level bosses.Enter player one: Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. The Saudi royal family has been investing its wealth in video games for some years now, and owns its own Savvy Games Group, led by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, perhaps best known for mass-arresting his own citizensand ordering the assassination ofjournalist Jamal Khashoggi. Player two: Affinity Partners, an investment companyled by Jared Kushner, son-in-law of the current US president. And player three:Silver Lake, just your run-of-the-mill evil private equity firm, which currently owns a large stake in game engine-maker Unity. Game File’s Stephen Totilo noticed that Affinity Partners’ logo isa mirror imageof that used by the evil corporation in the Assassin’s Creed series. Truly you couldn’t make this stuff up.You might be wondering why Saudi Arabia has been pumping so much money into video games. It has invested heavily in esports, setting up the eSports World Cup in Riyadh; bought up the makers of Monopoly GoandPokémon Go; and bought stakes in many other game companies, including Nintendo. (Game Filehas a comprehensive rundown of where Saudi money can be found in the industry.) The regime is doing this for the same reason that it has thrown money into sports, media and, very recently,comedy: to improve its international image and distract from thenumerous human rights abusestaking place at the regime’s request. It’s pure whitewashing. Or, in this case, gameswashing. It says much about the cultural power of gaming.View image in fullscreenMohammed bin Salman.Photograph: Saudi Royal Court/ReutersAs for Affinity Partners and Silver Lake: well. There’s money to be made. EA made over$2bn in profitlast financial year, driven largely by its sports franchises. It owns The Sims and Battlefield, too, both series that could be any other publisher’s biggest hit. EA used to be a much broader-interest publisher, and owns 30 years’ worth of wildly varied games properties as a result, from RPG Dragon Age to co-op hit It Takes Two and underrated sci-fi shooter Titanfall. But in the past decade or so, under the leadership of current CEO Andrew Wilson, it has concentrated its efforts mainly on its most profitable sports franchises.Negative reaction to the deal has, inevitably, focused on the Saudi involvement, something that EA’s many thousands of working developers and millions of players are deeply unsettled by (especially as The Sims has one of the largestLGBTQ+ followings of any game out there). Among business journalists and analysts, meanwhile, views are mixed. Kotaku’s Ethan Gach spoke to several of them forthis article, from which one quote, from NYU’s Joost van Dreunen, stood out: “At the center sits the irrational financial logic that tells you it’s about power, prestige, and staking Saudi Arabia’s claim in American entertainment.”Business-world commentary has highlighted the fact that the buyout deal will saddle EA with an eye-watering $20bn in debt – debt that is likely to be very high-interest,Bloomberg claims. This raises concerning questions about how EA’s new owners expect to pay this off. Yet more cuts and downsizing? Juicing up the profits from things like EA Sports FC’s Ultimate Team mode? Reviving EA’s flagging mobile games business? It seems highly unlikely that it will be business as usual for the people actually working at EA, or for players.Electronic Arts is not gaming’s best-loved publisher, not by a long shot. But as a player, even if you don’t like the way EA goes about its business and you don’t much care for Apex Legends or Madden, it’s important think of the thousands who work there. These are people who often go on to develop titles everywhere else in the industry, perhaps making games more to their own taste (and to yours). Even without the involvement of an oppressive regime, this kind of private equity buyout is rarely a positive thing, either for the people who work at the company or for the health of the industry. If you’re a Fifa fan, think of Manchester United, saddled with hundreds of millions in expensive debt after a takeover – andgoing nowhere but downever since.There is at least one person the deal brought joy to, however: CEO Andrew Wilson. “This moment is a recognition of your creativity, your innovation, and your passion … Everything we have achieved–and everything that lies ahead–is because of you,” he wrote to EA’s employees in an internal email announcing the deal (nowpublic here). “Our values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged. With continued rigor and operational excellence, we can amplify the creativity of our teams, accelerate innovation, and pursue transformative opportunities that position EA to lead the future of entertainment.”Wilson owns tens of millions in EA shares, each being sold for £157 if and when this deal goes through. Doesn’t that warm even the biggest cynic’s heart?What to playView image in fullscreenGhost of Yotei.Photograph: undefined/Sony/Sucker PunchIt is astounding that two different, inordinately expensive and impressively beautiful historical fiction games set in Japan have been released just six months apart, but here we are.Ghost of Yōteiis out tomorrow and, just like Assassin’s Creed Shadows, it stars a female warrior on a revenge quest across the most beautiful gaming landscapes you’ve ever seen.I enjoyed Shadowsearlier this year – you can’t fault its gorgeousness and the quality of its performances – but I’m enjoying Yōtei more. Riding around northern Japan, following birds and foxes and the distant screams of people who might need saving, is much more exciting without a map or magic X-ray vision that tells you where the bad guys are. It has a great many enjoyable little interludes where you’re using the controller to hammer a sword at a forge or blow on embers to light a campfire or paint a sumi-e ink artwork, rather than justdisembowelling people. The combat is straightforwardly great, a dangerous dance that feels surprisingly like old-school SoulCalibur in the one-on-one duels. Ghost of Tsushimaleft me slightly coldfive years ago, so I’m surprised by how much I love this – it helps that protagonist Atsu is seemingly much less conflicted in her role of blade-whirling death-dealer than Tsushima’s morose protagonist Jin.Available on:PlayStation 5Estimated playtime:30+ hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Opened in 2002 by Adrian Jones and Amanda Moss, for 23 years this unassuming railway arch beneath Elephant & Castle station, with its pummelling sound, no-frills aesthetics and adventurous musical programming, has become one of the capital’s most influential and beloved clubs.Founded and envisaged as a multi-purpose creative space rather than just a nightclub, it’s attracted massive names such as Jeff Mills and Björk, nurtured underground scenes from acid techno to jungle and pushed the boundaries of what a clubnight can be, via Evian Christ’s maximalist Trance Parties, Hyperdub’s groundbreaking Ø series or more recent forays into sex-positive raving.But on Tuesday, Jones and his team confirmed rumours that Corsica will be closing its doors in March 2026. “Nothing lasts for ever” readsthe official statement, in a depressing reflection of the pressures facing independent venues. Figures published late last year show thatthe UK has lost half of its nightclubs since 2013. But this is also a more nuanced and less hopeless situation than the initial hot takes have assumed.“It’s really frustrating because the news has been taken in certain directions already, like it’s the developer’s fault, it’s a noise complaint, it’s about money,” says Jones. “There’s an element of all those things,” he admits, but none of them fully explain why Corsica is closing.View image in fullscreenRapper Flohio performing at Corsica Studios in 2017.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesAs part of the £1.5bn redevelopment of Elephant and Castle, undertaken jointly by Southwark council and property developers Delancey, flats are now being built on the site of the former Elephant shopping centre. At various points in the design and planning process, the presence of a nightclub right next door appears to have been critically – perhaps unforgivably – overlooked. As a result, when the first residents move into their new homes next year, several will find themselves no more than five metres from Corsica’s outdoor smoking area.Negotiations with Southwark and Delancey have been ongoing since 2017 (Jones gives specific credit to London’s much-maligned formernight tsar Amy Laméfor kickstarting the conversation) but have failed to broker a compromise that would enable Corsica to continue operating. “You can stay as long as you want,” Jones recalls being told by Delancey. “You just can’t make any noise past 1 April.”Instead, thanks to Section 106 powers, often used to mitigate the impacts of a development proposal, and Agent of Change principles, in which the developer is responsible for managing those impacts, the space will be vacated next March, soundproofed at Delancey’s expense, then handed back as an empty shell in 2027 to be refitted for use as a cultural and creative venue once again. Jones and the current Corsica team have first refusal on the space, but whether or not they take that offer up – or the details around what any future venue might look, sound and feel like – remain undecided.The end of Corsica as we know it is clearly a tragic and avoidable loss. But the assurances that music will return to the arches in some form, for which Jones, his team, and other parties like the Greater London Authority have all fought hard for, mean that this isn’t a straightforwardly unhappy ending.With the best will in the world, I’ve been doing this for 24 years, and it’s not great for your mental healthAdrian Jones“With the best will in the world, I’ve been doing this for 24 years in Elephant, and before that in north London getting regenerated every six months, and it’s not great for your mental health,” Jones says. It’s clear that the last few years have taken a toll, whether in relation to the redevelopment plans, the lingering effects of the pandemic on London’s nightlife, or the loss of Amanda Moss, Jones’s partner and Corsica’s co-founder, who died of a rare form of ovarian cancer in 2017. “So there’s an opportunity to go: mission accomplished. We can leave knowing that we’ve made a mark, and left the framework for a space in the future. And truly, I think that’s a massive achievement, because you don’t often get a success story like that.”London’s promoters, performers and partiers will be hoping that any future venue recaptures the creative energy and DIY ethos of its predecessor. “Everything they did, they did themselves. They were unafraid of having a go at something, even if they didn’t know whether it would be successful,” says the DJ and author Bill Brewster, who has been throwing Low Life parties at Corsica since it first opened. “My kids weren’t born when we started,” he says, “but I can remember when they’d help me decorate the venue at eight or nine years old, and now my daughter’s a DJ at university. That’s a huge chunk of my life.”Hyperdub label boss Kode9 has worked with Corsica since 2009, booking DJ sets from the likes of Björk and Laurel Halo alongside AV installations by Mark Leckey and others. “I don’t know any other venues with two rooms which had great sound and which would facilitate things for us without being overly complicated,” he says. “Corsica did so much above and beyond the call of duty: everyone getting up on ladders, fitting screens in weird places. It’s a very unique place, with a unique culture.”View image in fullscreenThe crowd at Hyperdub’s fifth birthday at Corsica Studios, November 2009.Photograph: Everynight Images/AlamyWhen asked to name his favourite moments at Corsica, Jones cites a six-hour set by Detroit techno DJ Jeff Mills in 2012 – so good that even the normally taciturn Mills declared it the best night of his entire life – and a secret set from US drone metal band Sunn O))) which was “so loud people were hallucinating, having their DNA rearranged just from the vibrations”. But he also namechecks a local youth group called Kickstart, which used Corsica back in the days when Jones saw the venue as a multi-use community space rather than just a club.One more shot: can nightlife be saved by letting clubbers bring their own booze?Read moreThat willingness to look beyond the traditional boundaries of club culture is reflected in one of Corsica’s newest regular events, MJ Fox and Lydia Fikan’s queer kink party Joyride. “We wouldn’t have started without Corsica’s backing,” says Fox, noting the catalysing effect of that endorsement on the wider sex-positive rave scene. “They’re just very authentic, and very genuine: they want to throw great parties, and bring great people together.” In a nightlife scene increasingly dictated by private equity investment, Corsica has shown that simple, radical values and straightforward funding based on ticket sales can sustain a community space for decades.It would be easy to rage against Delancey and Southwark for allowing something this precious to be lost. “Naturally, when someone comes along and threatens your livelihood and your business, it does put you on the back foot a little bit,” Jones says. “And certainly when we felt like we weren’t getting answers, or things weren’t going our way, it did become more confrontational and combative. I’m sure they’d say the same.”But Jones also credits the council and developers for coming to the table, and working tirelessly to find a resolution that may end up extending Corsica’s story beyond the six months of farewell parties already planned.“I’m very protective of Corsica, of course I am. I don’t want to lose it, and I don’t want anyone to be disappointed in me for not preserving it,” Jones says. “But at the same time, I want whatever’s going to give it the best opportunity for survival. This is something that Amanda and I built with our friends through love and sacrifice. We created our own little world, and it’s sad to see it go, but sometimes things have to move on.”Explore more on these topicsClubbingClub cultureLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

We need a return to realityPeter BradshawThe industry should refuse to work with these uncanny figures, which plagiarise the performances of generations of actorsWed 1 Oct 2025 09.03 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 11.05 EDTShareWhat is scary about “Tilly Norwood”, the new AI-generated screen star created by the digital studio Xicoia, and launched in apre-emptively ironic comedy videomocking the soulless unoriginality of AI, is how very convincing it looks in all its girl-next-door cheerfulness. I was expecting something like those Stepford-Wife AI language tutors that crop up on your Instagram feed, promising to practise German or Spanish or French with you. But it has to be said: “Tilly” is like an iPhone 17 making those faces look like a Nokia brick. It is not on screen for long and perhaps vanishes just before you sense something’s off, but as things stand, “Tilly” doesn’t look obviously less real than ​m​any of the performers​ who appear on screen today.It is not merely that the technology which creates these unreal figures gets relentlessly better and better – the creators of “Tilly” have in effect plagiarised a million style and performance touches from legions of actors who once sweated real blood to make a success of them. It’s also that the aesthetics of real-world performance and writing are themselves getting more and more programmatic, blandifying downwards to meet the robot’s existence halfway and create a seamless uncanny-valley context in which it can thrive. It is not merely a question of the aesthetics of female beauty (created by an overwhelmingly male army of coders and tech bros), but an aesthetics of everything on the screen.‘It’s too late to be scared’: readers on the controversial rise of AI ‘actors’Read moreOf course, it could be that Xicoia does not seriously expect “Tilly” to have an acting career with agents etc, and the whole thing is a cunning AI-generated media row to publicise its brand. But who can doubt that AI actors are a thing? Notoriously,the movie Alien: Romulusrecreated an AI avatar of the late Ian Holm to reprise his role in the 1979 sci-fi classic. It didn’t look real. But that was all of a year ago.So far, the media coverage has taken an indulgently bemused tongue-in-cheek approach to “Tilly” and the threat “she” represents. But a number of very real tech people created “Tilly” and a number of very real corporate lawyers are there to enforce ownership and licensing of the brand.CEO Eline Van Der Velden has defended the existence of “Tilly”but, assuming that she herself has no hands-on coding experience of its creation, I wonder if we might also hear from the team of Victor Frankensteins under her command, the guys doing the grave-robbing or writing the programs doing the grave-robbing.What is needed is not luddism, but a real pushback from the film industry, refusing to work with these hyper-plagiarism models – and at the same time a movement like the Dogme 95 collective led by Danish film-makers Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, swearing to get back to basics, cutting out the flummery and using real actors who look real in real situations, or as real as it gets in any movie. And, as I have said many times, we need another movement like the Campaign for Real Ale in the 70s, which was repeatedly told that gassy tasteless lager was the way of the future – but refused to accept it.Explore more on these topicsFilmArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingTilly Norwood (AI character)commentShareReuse this content"

To celebrate we look back over the remarkably rich, radical – and sometimes risqué – career of an actor best known for tucking up children in the mid 1960sPamela HutchinsonWed 1 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 1 Oct 2025 10.14 EDTShareDame Julie Andrews, so crisply accented, sweetly tuneful and girlish in her most famous movie musicals, has always had a sense of humour about her angelic image. She won the 1965 Oscar for playing a “practically perfect” English nanny for Walt Disney, but that didn’t stop her from driving around Los Angeles with a “Mary Poppins Was a Junkie” bumper sticker on her car. Or telling journalists that “I hate the word wholesome”, and her Hollywood nickname was “the nun with the switchblade”. Andrews turns 90 today, one of the most beloved of Hollywood stars, with one of cinema’s most astonishing voices. She can look back on a fascinating film career that includes such sweet spoonfuls of sugar as Mary Poppins (1964) andThe Sound of Music(1965) to The Princess Diaries (2001), but just as many films that are explicit, dark, or just plain surprising.The Sound of Music at 60: a flawed but enduring cultural touchpointRead moreAndrews grew up in the blitz. She was born in Surrey in 1935, but moved to London. As a little girl she warbled to her neighbours during air raids, but it was when her stepfather gave her singing lessons that the full extent of her talent was discovered. At the age of eight, Andrews had an adult larynx, and a clear soprano voice with a four-octave range. She later joked that “dogs would come from miles around”, but she was a phenomenon, with a voice of impeccable musicality and clarity. Andrews started out in music hall, and did the Royal Variety Performance when she was only 13, before getting regular work at the BBC. Broadway called while she was still a teenager, first in The Boy Friend, then she was the original Eliza Doolittle in Lerner and Loewe’s musical take on Pygmalion, My Fair Lady. She was a showstopper, and an even bigger hit once she toned down the cockney for American ears. Andrews would always be known for her immaculate diction as much as her euphony, the kind of singer who enjoyed the lyrics as much as the melody – which showed in her delivery.View image in fullscreen‘Dogs would come from miles around’ … Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins (1964), for which she won an Oscar.Photograph: Disney/Kobal/ShutterstockThe tale is well worn that Jack Warner rejected Andrews for the movie version of My Fair Lady in favour of a bigger star, Audrey Hepburn, who had to be dubbed for the songs. It’s forever to Andrews’ credit that she was cheeky enough to thank him on stage at the Golden Globes for freeing her up to doMary Poppins. World domination fell neatly into place after Andrews embodied Maria, the sweetly rebellious nun in megahit musical The Sound of Music. But in between, Andrews tried to shake off typecasting before it began, by starring in D-day comedy-drama The Americanization of Emily (1964). No songs, lots of love scenes – and she slaps James Garner round the face. A precedent was set. Andrews was as keen on edgy material as much as the next 1960s film star – albeit one with cut-glass vocals and perfect pitch.After working with Hitchcock on Torn Curtain (1966) and a couple of musical flops, Andrews spent most of the 1970s working in TV. But she continued to expand her range with her second husband, director Blake Edwards: The Tamarind Seed (1974) is a romantic spy thriller and 10 (1979), a sex comedy that has her married to a lascivious Dudley Moore. The pair of films they made at the outset of the 1980s really proved Andrews was willing to push the boundaries of her persona. She was brave to play a squeaky-clean film star sexing up her image in S.O.B. (1981), but she’s really, really good, making the most of her androgynous looks, in Victor/Victoria (1982), a queer musical farce about a singer who masquerades as a man, a remake of a German film from the 1930s. Andrews, it turned out, was game for on-screen nudity, and looked exceptionally hot in drag. Plus, she could still make a hit: Victor/Victoria was a runaway success and remains a cult favourite.View image in fullscreenCult favourite … Julie Andrews in Victor/Victoria (1982), directed by Blake Edwards.Photograph: Cinetext/Mgm/AllstarThere was a shock ahead of her, prefigured by two of her dramatic films from the 1980s. In That’s Life! (1986) she plays a singer waiting to find out whether she has throat cancer. In the terrific Duet for One (1986) she is a concert violinist with a philandering husband who is thrown into a breakdown by her career-ending MS diagnosis – and distracts herself by hopping into bed with Liam Neeson’s rag-and-bone man. As she baldly tells her psychologist Max von Sydow, “I’m fucking a totter!” In real life, in 1997, botched surgery on her vocal cords more or less ended Andrews’ singing voice, and she would rarely sing on screen again.Julie Andrews: ‘I was certainly aware of tales about the casting couch’Read moreThe indefatigable Andrews, made a dame in 2000, made another fresh start in her 60s. Playing the sassy regal grandmother in The Princess Diaries was both a valid comeback vehicle – she even sang in the sequel – and the perfect comic outlet for her refined pronunciation. She followed this up with more PG voiceover work in the Shrek and Despicable Me films.A generation of 60s kids grew up with Mary and Maria, and hung around to embrace the risque kicks of the Edwards years. Yet again Andrews has carried a new cohort of gen Z fans with her, as she now slyly narrates Netflix’s raunchy regency drama Bridgerton – every consonant of Lady Whistledown’s wicked whispers impeccably articulated. The most formidable voice in the movies, still as sweet, but also as sharp, as ever.This article was amended on 1 October 2025. An earlier version said incorrectly thatJulie Andrewsnever sang on screen again after the 1997 surgery on her vocal cords.Explore more on these topicsFilmJulie AndrewsMary PoppinsThe Sound of MusicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She has worked with orchestras inEuropeand beyond but those opposed to her recruitment say she has never conducted at La Fenice, apart from during a brief promotional event, or at any other major opera house.Venezi is also known inItalyfor appearing in TV adverts for a shampoo brand.The opera house, however, has pushed back at critics. Announcing the appointment last week, Nicola Colabianchi, La Fenice’s general manager, said Venezi had been hired because “she is a very good conductor, and because she is a woman and already respected internationally at only 35”.But the decision was immediately contested by the theatre’s orchestra musicians, who publishedan appealaddressed to Colabianchi criticising the lack of transparency in the recruitment process and claiming Venezi was not qualified for the role at such an esteemed Italian opera house.In the letter published inthe Italian press, the orchestra questioned Venezi’s national and international credentials, arguing she has “never conducted in the major international opera houses” and “nor has her name appeared on the billboards of the most important festivals in the world music scene”.The letter was followed by La Fenice’s 300 staff warning of strikes and demonstrations “to defend the professionalism” of the theatre’s artists and “respect for democratic rules in the management” of its foundation.Venezi did not reply to the Guardian’s request for comment.She was also targeted last year by protesters shouting “No fascists at the opera” before conducting a New Year’s Day concert in the southern French city of Nice.Venezi has never hidden her conservative values but said in an interview withHuffPost Italiain 2023 that she is “not a fascist” and only comes under attack because of her father’s political history.Meloni has praised Venezi on several occasions, describing her as “a talented and courageous artist who refuses to bow to the dictatorship of thought and language”.Political biases aside, Federico Capitoni, a music journalist, said Venezi ought to be judged purely on her credentials. “Her CV is not exactly exceptional and in my opinion, she only has herself to blame,” he said, citing the government role, collaborations with various cultural organisations and the shampoo ad. “Many artists run this risk … they take on roles in government or other organisations, taking time away from the kind of work that gives them prestige,” he added.Colabianchi has tried to calm tensions by saying that Venezi, who is due to begin the role in 2026, will conduct only three times a year. Meanwhile, the opera house’s president, Luigi Brugnaro, has called a meeting at the theatre on 8 October in an attempt to “promote dialogue” and “find a solution”.Explore more on these topicsOperaItalyThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They hate the depiction ofIreland’s history, hate the dialogue, hate the costumes, hate the lighting. Netflix announced that it was the first show to have Irish subtitles and still Irish critics hate it.View image in fullscreenThe English actor James Norton stars as the series’ heart-throb hard man.Photograph: Ben Blackall/NetflixTheIrish Times reviewlamented the show’s “rudimentary understanding of Ireland’s experiences of colonialism” and “stunning lack of appreciation for who the Anglo-Irish were and where they fit (or didn’t) into Irish society”.It said the heart-throb hard man, played by the English actorJames Norton, sounded like “a steampunk Mr Tayto” – a reference to an Irish crisp brand mascot – and that the revolutionaries, the Fenians, “dress and speak like feral leprechauns”.TheIrish Independentsaid the show was a “shocker” that frittered away any sense of authenticity. “The cliches arrive thick and fast. Put it this way: a lot of letters are crumpled up and thrown into a lot of fires.”It complained that characters swore too much for credibility and that the story mangled history. “The producers do point out that their series is fiction, but then the majority of our popular history is fiction, and quite dangerous fiction at that. We don’t need any more of it.”The series, which bills itself as fiction inspired by a true story, is loosely based on the fact that a Guinness patriarch died in 1868, leaving his four adult children to take over a brewing empire that dominated inner-city Dublin and exported beer around the world.Steven Knight, the creator ofPeaky Blinders, filmed most of the new show in Liverpool with a mix of mainly Irish and British actors. He soundtracked the action with thumping, contemporary Irish bands including Fontaines DC and Kneecap.The Guardian gave it five stars.National Public Radio’s reviewsaid Knight knew exactly how to bring period dramas to life. Its only grumble was that some accents were hard to understand. “But the story, and the intrigue – those translate perfectly.”Irish critics have long despaired of actors who traduce Irish accents – Brad Pitt’s rendition of an IRA man in The Devil’s Own is especially notorious – but the House of Guinness cast has largely escaped censure on this score. Notwithstanding the Mr Tayto jibe,Norton’s performance and accent won praise. So did the soundtrack and the big-budget sets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Green doesn’t equal Irish. Why are all the Fenians wearing literal spirit Halloween leprechaun costumes?”Garron Noone, a comedian and self-styled “Irish cultural police” with more than 2 millionfollowers on TikTokand Instagram, noted the first episode’s alacrity in introducing rebels. “It only takes three minutes and 45 seconds for somebody to shout: ‘Free Ireland from the English!’”Noone mockingly endorsed a “Guinness-pouring tutorial” scene, plus a funeral brawl. “That is, of course, very true to our culture, though I didn’t see any sandwiches at the funeral, so I will be deducting a couple of points for that.”Irish critics also cited clunky dialogue and dim lighting and said no amount of explosions and sex could conceal the story’s dullness.“If it’s pitched as a cross between Succession and Peaky Blinders, then it lacks the comedy of the former and the jeopardy of the latter,” said anIrish Examiner reviewheadlined “all pour, no pint”.The Irish Times, in perhaps the most withering put-down, cited a sequence purportedly so bad it risked driving Guinness drinkers to a rival stout. “These and other scenes might leave you crying out for a nice cold, creamy pint of Beamish.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropeDramaNetflixTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This book tells the story of his dying, from the last time she saw him well, on a trip to Great Yarmouth at the end of summer, to his death less than two months later, just nine days after being diagnosed.It’s not easy to account for what makes this book so special. Its main character is as unpromisingly ordinary as its title suggests, and some may even find him a little boring. David Perry is the kind of man who spends hours sorting his beloved stamp collection into albums with the aid of long-tipped forceps and magnifying glasses, or filling in his Sudoku puzzle books, or reading the latest copy of the Antiques Gazette, looking intently at porcelain dogs and chased silver punch-bowls.He has lived the uneventful, comfortable life of an upwardly-mobile baby boomer born at the end of the second world war. He spends most of that life in Basildon, while commuting on the Fenchurch Street line to work as an industrial chemist. On family holidays in Yarmouth, he sets his deckchair 3ft from the sea but never goes in it. Not much to cloud his days, then, apart from caring for a disabled wife who dies 10 years before him. After downsizing to a bungalow in Norwich, he dies at 77 – a lifespan slightly short of the national average, but no tragedy there.The book perfectly catches a certain kind of clenched English male reserve, part shyness and part stubbornnessPartly, this book works its magic through the adamantine detail and quiet lyricism with which it recounts a particular, unrepeatable life. David’s Davidness – always eating a bowl of cereal before bed, hoarding Wagon Wheels, calling his artificial sweeteners “depth charges”, laughing with a half-private chuckle at his own bad jokes – comes off the page in sparks. The book perfectly catches a certain kind of clenched English male reserve, part shyness and part stubbornness. David only ever greets or says goodbye to his son with a handshake; they don’t even hug on the day he finds out he will die. He shows love, like many men of his generation, via punctiliousness, each January entering birthdays into a new wall calendar and then marking them with a tick once a card is sent. After his diagnosis he carefully writes, on the final page of this calendar, all his passwords and security details.Mostly, though, what makes this book gem-like is that it succeeds in conveying the reality of death as this monumental, mythic thing that coexists surreally with the mundane world of council bin collections and neighbours hanging out their washing. Death, once it has decided to capture us, descends with the inevitability of gravity. Considering herself too sane for prophecies, Perry nonetheless notes that, as her father-in-law walked towards her shakily and confusedly in Norwich’s market square, she “knew immediately, with the cool and perfect certainty of arithmetic, that he was more or less a dead man”. The 48 days he then takes to die make her see that “death has a duration and an amplitude, with events as various and strange as those of a life”.Along the way, the book becomes about something else – the care gifted by strangers who arrive miraculously, via form filling and phone calls, and then vanish for ever. Nurses and carers, with accents ranging from West Africa to Norfolk, turn up at the house to administer painkillers, fit syringe drivers or just keep the night watch over a dying man. Perry’s experience with doctors is more mixed. It makes her wonder at how “no other occupation entailed acts of service that sometimes resembled love, all carried out with such an extraordinary asymmetry of power”. One medic, shrugging at her while expertly tossing banana peel into the bin and then inserting something illegible on a form, stuns her with his insensitivity. But her anger quickly evaporates as she realises that this is just everyday thoughtlessness dizzily colliding with the brutal logic of mortality.Perry balks at the well-meaning phrase “dignity in dying”. Her father-in-law’s dying feels so unavoidably undignified, a matter first of confusion and fear, then immobility and incontinence. But the dying body, as she describes it – the desiccating lips and hands, the skin the colour and texture of vellum parchment, the labourer’s hands now resembling “those of a Russian pianist” – is also transfiguring. She watches David change hour by hour into someone else entirely, a diminished but more majestic self. Dying emerges as both ordinary, almost like an unpleasant chore to be negotiated, and unfathomably strange – “these things not cancelling each other out as they ought to have done, but persisting in undiminished quantities, like a failure of simple maths”.As a young, aspiring writer, Perry yearned for dramatic, painful experiences to give her something to write about. She wanted, she says, “to hoard rubies and lose them, and spill ink into the loss”. But here she has written beautifully and compellingly about the life of an unexceptional man, and an experience that is coming to all of us – and shown that there is no such thing as an ordinary life, or an ordinary death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It was one of the writer-director’s best, as exciting as it was amusing, but the ecosystem had changed since his 90s heyday, and a wide audience didn’t materialise, the film one of the year’s more frustratingly underseen flops.Anemone review – Daniel Day-Lewis returns for a bleak and painfully serious misfireRead moreIn the years since, the big, star-led action comedy has become streaming bread and butter, most weeks cursed by another limp, murkily shot attempt to recall the joys of Black’s greatest hits, films such as The Last Boy Scout, Lethal Weapon and The Long Kiss Goodnight. At the same time, as audiences yawned through chemistry-free, shoddily made romps likeGhosted,Back in ActionandRole Play, The Nice Guys started to gain a re-appreciation, frequently mentioned online as one of the best films people might not have seen. It didn’t feel like a coincidence, every poorly choreographed action set piece and groan-worthy one-liner making Black’s effortless work seem that much more impressive, something he made look easy proving impossibly hard for those that followed.His return to the genre (2018’sThe Predatorhad elements of both but was primarily sci-fi) marks Black’s first streaming movie, Play Dirty, heading to Amazon. It’s a far cry from his best but it’s markedly better than what we’ve been stuck with as of late and what will be filed next to it on Prime, a breezy reminder of how well Black can balance both action and comedy, a film of genuine personality in a sea of blandness. It’s the season’s other Donald E Westlake adaptation, existing at the opposite end of the spectrum to Park Chan-wook’s Oscar-tipped, critically adored dark comedyNo Other Choice(this year also saw Westlake’s Memory turned into the little-seen André Holland-led mystery, The Actor). The source novel, The Hunter, has previously inspired both 1967’s Point Blank and 1999’s Payback, and introduced the character of Parker, who has also been played by Peter Coyote, Robert Duvall and Jason Statham.It’s now the turn of Mark Wahlberg, an actor who has been partly responsible for some of the streaming action comedy era’s very worst, fromThe UniontoThe Family Planto the heinousSpenser Confidential, a truly wretched evening-ruiner that sank the genre to unprecedented new lows (I’d argue that even the loosest involvement in that film should bar someone from working in the genre again but alas). In a wild, attention-grabbing cold open that should come with a trigger warning for horse-lovers, he’s betrayed after a big job, left for dead by Rosa Salazar’s backstabbing thief, Zen. He is, as one would expect from the genre, hell-bent on revenge, but after finding her, she offers him a way to make things right, a new score that would bring him more money than he’s ever stolen before. He’s pulled into an uneasy alliance, softened by her claims that her actions were for “the greater good” AKA helping to untopple a dictator that has her homeland in his grip. The heist is as absurdly elaborate as they come and so Parker recruits his old team, including Keegan Michael-Key, Australian actors Chai Hansen and Claire Lovering, and LaKeith Stanfield’s failing thespian, Grofield. Oh and, because it’s a Shane Black movie, it’s Christmas too.The film was originally supposed to reunite Black with Robert Downey Jr, the pair making for a fine duo in 2005’s wonderful Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and 2013’s franchise-boosting Iron Man 3, but he retreated to a producer role, leaving Wahlberg to take his place, a considerable downgrade given what’s required from the character. Black does bring out more from him than most directors have for the past decade or so but he can’t quite nail the character’s dry sardonic wit, more at home with action than comedy (Stanfield, the far more talented comedic actor, is the standout). In what often feels like a choice to nudge the film toward a green light, Black has peppered his snarky crime noir with blockbuster-sized action set pieces which are at times giddily, Mission: Impossible-level outrageous, and at others a bit rubbishy to look at, grand ambition tempered by cheap-looking visual effects (the Australia-shot film trying to fool us with a New York setting is equally distracting).A major complaint about the action-comedy genre as it stands is a total lack of the latter, hopelessly unfunny scripts in dire need of a sitcom writer to add some life. Black has no such issue, his writing here rhythmic and thoughtful, packed with specific detail and brilliantly timed humour, someone constantly finding ways to stuff more into scenes that would have otherwise been left plain and perfunctory in the hands of others. His “more is more” approach can often leave us a tad overwhelmed, though, his propulsive yet overly convoluted plot in need of a decluttering, as if he was worried he wouldn’t get to make another Parker film and so stuffed two films into one. I hope that’s not the case, though, as Play Dirty makes for the kind of entertainingly sweet and sour cocktail (the finale is both cold yet deserving) that I would happily get drunk on again.Play Dirty is now out on Amazon Prime VideoExplore more on these topicsMark WahlbergLakeith StanfieldAction and adventure filmsComedy filmsThrillersComedyAmazon Prime VideoreviewsShareReuse this content"

When they were first produced and consumed, they were after all just films, not “silent” films – any more than photographs or paintings or sculptures are thought of as “silent”. Yet of course they often had improvised piano accompaniment; Gert Hoffman’s autobiographical novel The Film Explainer (filmed with Armin Mueller-Stahl) remembered the prewar time in Germany when his father was employed in a movie theatre to stand next to the screen with a pointer and literally explain what was going on. WhenAbel Gance’s Napoleon was revived in the late 70swith a live orchestral accompaniment, there was a new creative excitement around the idea of early cinema’s musical reinvention – we recently saw there-release of the special edition of Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkinwith the 2005 soundtrack composed for the film by the Pet Shop Boys.But now an artistic group from Austin, Texas, called Silents Synced and its director Josh Frank are offering a new approach to silent cinema: showing classics to music by established stars. This one, Radiohead X Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror putsMurnau’s 1922 vampire classic Nosferatuwith Radiohead’s Kid A from 2000 and Amnesiac from 2001. But I just couldn’t make friends with this fundamentally wrong-headed idea. Radiohead’s music isn’t composed for the film, it doesn’t illuminate it or intensify it or work interestingly against it; it just blares away arbitrarily alongside it. It’s just like trying to watch a movie while your next-door neighbour has their music on too loud. There are, possibly, interesting moments when an idea or image seems to chime or reverberate with the music; I worked very hard trying to isolate serendipitous touches like that. But this just seems to ignore the intentional form and structure of both film and album, turning both sound and image into wallpaper. An unrewarding experience.Radiohead XNosferatu: A Symphony of Horroris in UK and Irish cinemas on 2 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmSilent filmNosferatu: A Symphony of HorrorRadioheadreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what Guardian readers have to say about the controversial rise of AI actors.‘Of course they will do it’You have to think about filmed entertainment in economic terms, not artistic. Because AI isn’t about great art, but reducing costs by removing human talent and speeding up processes. Netflix is topping out at 300 million subscribers, delivering $40bn revenue against $17bn content expense. The fastest way for Netflix to increase profit is to make that content cheaper via computerised processes. They are already using AI to decide what to make, fulfilling every possible human wish with a slice of bingeable nonsense, from high art to low-brow dating. The Power of the Dog isn’t there because Netflix is committed to telling powerful stories, but merely to ensure high-end subscribers don’t quit the service. And exactly the same is true for Love is Blind in a hundred languages, it is there to ensure fans of dating shows don’t quit. If AI helps these tech companies masquerading as studios to churn out more, faster, and cheaper, of course they will do it.Stak2000Tilly Norwood: how scared should we be of the viral AI ‘actor’?Read more‘It doesn’t understand humour’Comedy. That’ll be the step change, if it ever comes. Right now, AI can’t make us laugh. It doesn’t understand humour, timing, what makes something funny, or not. Witness the technically astonishing, but utterly soulless dialogue and delivery above. We watched because we thought we would be amazed, but it was dull beyond words.mattllo‘I’m not saying it’s impossible, just not there yet’Ninety-nine percent of what we have seen from AI films is just a mid-close up shot of a single person, usually directly addressing the camera, spokesperson style.What we haven’t seen is a convincing scene of drama between two or more AI generated characters. Dialogue is always cross-cut. AI doesn’t seem to be able to generate multiple unique characters at once who interact and impact each other. I’m not saying its impossible, just not there yet.Cornish_Hen‘Will come back to bite them’Hollywood execs might bank on a few Tilly Noorwoods to cut costs and increase their profits. But AI will come back to bite them when AI-proficient movie fans prefer to use gen-AI to create their own productions. Meanwhile, I hope those investing in humans are the ones who win out, separate from this pointless, overhyped AI race that’s eroding craft.Dataday‘The genie is not going back in the bottle’It is incredible to see how far the technology has come in such a short time.There’s no doubt that, even if it stops short of on-screen leads, AI generated content will find a place on the big screen. It is a tool like anything else and a gamechanger for some aspects of media.Those whose jobs it will affect (and itabsolutelywill) need to calm down and consider what they do next in their career. The genie is not going back in the bottle. I’m sure ostlers and bridlemakers were furious with Gottlieb Daimler and Henry Ford but if AI content proves to be useful and cost-effective then it cannot be stopped.abbathehorse‘My primary concern is the lack of education’Anyone working in AI is doing everything they can to push the envelope. It is up to the rest of us (and especially government/regulators) to rein them in when they go too far. My primary concern is the lack of education, both on the utility of AI and its dangers. Most people who are not directly affected by AI taking someone’s livelihood do not see the threat.DasInternautView image in fullscreenTilly Norwood.Illustration: YouTube‘I doubt I could root for a character that is completely AI’I hope movies will be marked as AI, so us lot, the actual paying audience, can make a choice upfront, based upon the pictures production process. I can’t see any potential production savings being passed on to the consumer. I doubt I could root for a character that is completely AI (apart from a Pixar movie maybe). We like actors and movie stars too much, we invest in them, we are attracted to them on some level. It might take a few generations to push it to its limit, but look at the fetishization of vinyl, back from the dead and costing way more than ever before.Matt08‘Like something out of a Ballard short story’Reading this. I found myself thinking about all the people required to facilitate this AI ‘star’. The coders, the people who write or prompt the scripts, who create the social media posts, the marketing and finance teams, etc. A network of humans applying their industry in the service of advancing the career of something that simply does not exist. I suppose you could say the same for the teams who support, I dunno, MS Word or an animated series. But when the programme in question is attempting to pass as human, it feels somehow stranger. Like something out of a Ballard short story.Glider‘It’s too late to be scared’It’s too late to be scared.Hollywood is not about making art, it’s about making money.Give us one good reason why studios should pay for cameramen, makeup artists, set designers, lighting, catering and of course actors when AI can do the job and make money.Films made with real people – actors as well as all the other innumerable people listed in the end credits – will soon be something like ballet or opera: enjoyed by a few cinéastes who are willing to pay all the money for this art form.But why would a fan of the, say, Fast and Furious franchise or the Marvel universe or whatever it is called do that? All they care about are visual and aural stimuli, and AI can deliver that perfectly.AshMordant‘Just a bunch of dudes sat around a computer’The creepy thing to me about this, is that it was obviously created by presumably a committee of people who all decided how attractive she should be. Skin not smooth enough? Do another iteration. Boobs not quite the right shape? Run it again.Not only does that feel a bit iffy, there’s also decisions being made about what constitutes “being attractive” that will feed back into the views of actual people. Obviously attractive actors generally make more successful actors, but at least nature/God had a hand in that. Not just a bunch of dudes sat around a computer.bearvsshark‘A meaningless concept’This is effectively meaningless though. Acting is a group endeavour. An AI “actor” would have to have a real stand-in and someone reading in their dialogue. You could make an entire AI film – effectively a CGI movie – or you make a human film with AI characters, similar to the green-screen stuff they do now. But an “AI actor” is a meaningless concept.Pyeshot‘The masses don’t attend or appreciate actual art’To those saying “this will be reason live theater comes roaring back,” you clearly need to step outside whatever bubble you live in. The masses don’t attend or appreciate actual art … they just want pretty, shiny things whether in the form of pop songs or superhero movies. And they will have zero issue with AI “art” as long as it feeds those desires. The true arts (with actual trained human artists) still rely on at least some income to exist, and with less pooled resources to support it, the arts will continue to shrivel on the vine. Yes some standouts will continue to exist, but I fear they will be fewer and fewer … until maybe one day the aforementioned masses actually become more educated and learn to appreciate actual art.Londonamerican2014‘AI slop is what happens when idea goes straight to execution’One day, hopefully soon, people will work out that the “friction” of the back and forth between ideas and execution is where 9/10ths of the creativity lies.So, good painting comes from having made good preparatory studies, great acting comes from rehearsals, etc. Taking your time, feeling frustrated, getting it “wrong” a few times, all that is part of coming up with good ideas.Not just for art, but any idea. Even boring business ones need the friction.AI slop is what happens when idea goes straight to execution. Superficially the ideas might seem good as the execution can be slick. But the ideas are still shite, ‘cos they haven’t been put through the mill.ShakeyDaveExplore more on these topicsFilmArtificial intelligence (AI)Film industryComputingTilly Norwood (AI character)featuresShareReuse this content"

While the premise may sound on paper like the setup for a loud, crude 00s comedy, this is a much more finely tuned piece of work than that, with engaging characters and an impeccably calibrated plot full of plausible twists and turns that are wild yet still realistic, and feel earned because the characters respond like actual humans to their situation.It’s true that the spiky rat-a-tat dialogue, reminiscent of both 90s sitcoms and 30s and 40s screwball comedy, isn’t quite how people talk in the real world, but it’s highly enjoyable when delivered by a good-looking and charismatic cast, among whom the standout is Deutch, who peels back the layers of a tough-cookie character to show the vulnerable human underneath. It helps that she’s bouncing off the super-smitten vibes put out by Hauer-King, who is all dimples and doe eyes in a way that is refreshing to see in a male lead.It’s also true to say that Cruz has the toughest role: she plays a more traditionally nurturing character, the emotional through-line really belongs to her co-stars, and her character’s story arc has less of the livewire unpredictability of Deutch’s. But Cruz invests the role with a kind of low-key tenaciousness and dignity that helps you root for her too, making this that rare romcom in which you want everything to turn out well for everyone. Well, apart from Josh Segarra, perfect in a small role as a married schmuck who dissolves into self-pitying tears when required to deal with the consequences of his actions.This is an all too rare romcom that delivers on every level. If you’re looking for well-drawn characters caught up in an outlandish situation that generates plenty of laughter and sentiment, look no further. Oh, and it’s sexy too.

In between the bits of archive footage, Jobson gets a haircut, tries on a leather jacket or two, and trundles around the stage in a sleeveless T-shirt reliving the glory days.The way Jobson tells it, his and the band’s ascent to national prominence in the late 70s was bit of a miracle in itself: growing up in a bleak, postindustrial mining village outside Dunfermline, his first stroke of luck was bumping into Sid Vicious in Malcolm McLaren’s Sex shop on a trip down to London as a 15-year-old in 1976 to try to buy some leather trousers. Becoming a face on the early punk scene, Jobson’s second bit of luck was meeting fellow Dunfermline-ite Stuart Adamson, who asked him to join his nascent band after an audition at Cowdenbeath Workingmen’s Club. Jobson’s stories of Skids’ early days are pretty entertaining – most of them involving some kind of mass fight – as the band became part of the record-industry feeding frenzy after punk rock broke through in 1977.Jobson appears to remain justifiably proud of Skids’ best known songs – Into the Valley, The Saints Are Coming, Charles – and it remains bit of a late-70s madeleine to see him cavorting around on Top of the Pops. He is also fairly forthright about in his views on various fellow travellers (his dislike for John Lydon and Nancy Spungen is readily apparent) while former bandmates Rusty Egan and the late John McGeoch get a bit of a pasting for other reasons. Conversely Jobson, understandably, seems reluctant to talk in detail about Adamson, his former songwriting partner, who left Skids in 1981, went on to find major success with Big Country andwho killed himself in 2001; it’s clearly a sensitive subject. Well, Jobson appears to have emerged from it all relatively unscathed, and this film is an engaging stroll down the byways of 70s pop culture.The Story of Skids: Scotland’s No 1PunkBand is in cinemas from 1 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMusic documentaryPunkreviewsShareReuse this content"

The latest addition to this booming subgenre is 2004 romcom 13 Going on 30, with a book by the original screenwriters, Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, and the backing of star Jennifer Garner as executive producer.As with the film, how much you enjoy it will probably depend on how much you surrender to your teenage self. The setup is swiftly established. After being humiliated by the popular kids at her 13th birthday party, Jenna Rink rejects her adoring best friend Matty and instead wishes to be “thirty, flirty and thriving”. The next thing she knows she has a grown-up New York apartment, a hot boyfriend and a job editing her favourite fashion magazine. But is this dreamlike adult existence all it seems?The silliness of this premise is suited to the heightened register of musical theatre and the creators know it. Both the colourful adolescent world of cheerleaders and crushes and the camply cut-throat environment of the magazine industry are enjoyably amped up in Andy Fickman’s production, with fun and spirited choreography from Jennifer Weber. Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner’s poppy songs are solid though not particularly memorable, with the exception of teen girl empowerment anthem Own It.View image in fullscreenColourful adolescent world … 13 Going on 30.Photograph: Pamela RaithThe essential takeaway – that you should embrace your true self, dorkiness and all – is simple and saccharine. But occasional knowing winks cut through the sentimentality and the performers bring much-needed charm to the earnest material. Lucie Jones is lovably goofy as Jenna, contrasted with David Hunter’s world-weary Matty – a man who no longer believes in soulmates and fireworks – and Grace Mouat’s deliciously catty turn as Jenna’s frenemy Lucy. They’re often accompanied on stage by the excellent young cast as reminders of the more hopeful, innocent versions of themselves they’ve left behind.50 First Dates: The Musical review – sunny ensemble serve up breezy romcomRead moreAs always, the question is: did this need to be adapted? While Fickman and co have done a decent job of transforming the film into a musical that stands alone, it’s hard not to wish this talent could be turned to new stories. But maybe that’s just thirtysomething me talking, while my inner 13-year-old bops to the music.AtManchester Opera Houseuntil 12 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsRomance filmsComedyComedy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Real life may threaten: the mercenary Victorian marriage market and cruel policing of desire that bit Wilde himself so savagely after the 1895 premiere. But the play holds us in a giddy bubble, and Max Webster’s shameless production merrily queers the comedy, shoving subtext from the shadows.First seen at the National Theatre last winter, it hits the West End with an entirely new cast. Following the granite Sharon D Clarke as Lady Bracknell comes Stephen Fry, plumptiously upholstered in deep purple and emerald and crowned by imperious steel-grey curls. It can be galling when male actors take prime female roles, but the casting suits this super-gay reading.If the romcom plot is straight as a die, the thoughts are queer as can be. The heart, among other organs, wants what it wants, and Webster sets everyone scampering around the stage in frisky agitation. Eyes fluttering, touches lingering, quick fondle of a statue. People sigh “darling” in an ardent polyamorous tangle.View image in fullscreen‘Written by a butterfly, for butterflies’ … Kitty Hawthorne and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett in The Importance of Being Earnest.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe dizzy chaps are cute – Nathan Stewart-Jarrett’s Jack in fine fluster, Olly Alexander’s Algy giving good smirk – but it’s their sweethearts who gleam. Kitty Hawthorne’s fanny-fanning Gwendolen and Jessica Whitehurst’s scowling Cecily both tap the production’s libidinous undertow. Their teatime spat is a hilarious rollercoaster of sugar lump aggression and the erotic possibilities of Victoria sponge.The importance of freeing Earnest – without bursting Oscar Wilde’s ‘delicate bubble of fancy’ | Michael BillingtonRead moreWilde believed the play “must go like a pistol shot” but here, lines arrive with a leisurely, even laborious, flourish. Even so, the show lives for pleasure, especially in Rae Smith’s designs – lemony drawing room, riotous rose garden, perfectly edible costumes. There’s much side-eye at the audience, and an inspired Hayley Carmichael filches her every scene as a brace of butlers, bone-dry in town and gawpingly bewildered in the country.It all feels less audacious than at the National. Some performances are gentler – likeShobna Gulati’s sweetly sententious Miss Prism or Fry’s towering dowager, presiding with a lofty twinkle. Where the young people thrum with desire, Fry’s Bracknell reserves her tendresse for matters of the purse: mention a marriage settlement and she practically purrs.AtNoël Coward theatre, London, until 10 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatreOscar WildeStephen FryOlly AlexanderWest EndRae SmithreviewsShareReuse this content"

When we meet her, Kyla MacDougall has a frightening self-assurance. Played by Yolanda Mitchell, she is teasing, provocative and mercurial. It is all her nerdy classmate Jamie Sheldon can do to answer in complete sentences. Played by Testimony Adegbite, he is cautious and scared.It turns out he is not the only one. The more Kyla threatens Jamie, the more it becomes apparent that, while he is trapped in a tough corner, the real victim is her. Jamie has witnessed a sexual assault at a party and is earnestly committed to telling the truth. Kyla wants him to retract his police statement. If he claims to have lied, he will take the pressure off her friends, Ryan, Stevo and Paulie, teenagers under the influence of online misogyny. She, in turn, will win their favour.The girl who behaves as the boys’ emissary is actually the subject of their violence. Not that she can admit as much. Kyla sees being ostracised as a greater threat than being abused. In this way, Nixon draws out the contradictory emotions not only of teenagers trying to fit into a world where the pressure to conform is real and the urge to do the right thing is abstract, but also of a young woman trying to make sense of being raped.Gillian Argo’s chequered set reflects the mental chess game they are playing. A red ribbon scars the stage like the slash of a knife, as if cutting through their ability to think ahead. The term “cheapo” describes a trick to lure a chess opponent into making a losing move. The play, under the lively direction of Guardian critic Brian Logan, is a slippery to-and-fro of strategy, speculation and cunning, as the teenagers search for options to escape what feels like the inevitable checkmate, but might just go beyond a binary black and white.AtÒran Mór, Glasgow, until 4 October.

It makes sense, then, that the USP of their current tour is a collaboration with a different set of classical musicians in every city.Though mid-career-band-joined-by-orchestra sets so often enlist classical musicians to fill the holes left by fading creativity, leaving awkward blends between the two parties, that’s not the case tonight. The Icelanders meld seamlessly with the London Contemporary Orchestra, musically and visually, with both camps all in monochrome, mingled together under a sea of star-like lights. Opening with Blóðberg, one of several cuts from Átta, Jónsi’s voice – still utterly pristine after all these decades – floats up beautifully from the orchestra’s heaving waves of strings and brass, the lights brightening and dimming in time with the music’s volume.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

The tempo is slow, the music refined and elegant. Only the cheers of recognition for early favourite Starálfur briefly break through the dreaminess. It is all undeniably, objectively beautiful, particularly in such grand confines, and even more so when guest treble Malakai Bayoh provides a stunning vocal solo that cuts through the slow drift of first half closer Varðeldur like a knife through butter.And yet, though it frequently threatens complete transcendence, the set never quite gets over that line. It’s too polished and serene for the many crescendos to push the levels from calculated amber into the thrill of the red. There’s the occasional bit of edginess – Jónsi’s bowed guitar plunging into moody feedback at the end of Von, the way Sé Lest begins with a dance of glockenspiel and ends in an oompah of brass – which injects some welcome energy. Inevitably, however, the band revert to the show’s beautiful, palatable norm.That is, until its final stages. At the end of 2008 slow-burner Ára Bátur, a boys’ choir – the Schola Cantorum of the Cardinal Vaughan school – are illuminated to the side of the stage, while above themAnna Lapwoodhelms the Albert Hall’s colossal, 9,999 pipe grand organ. This time, the crescendo is so huge as to be totally irresistible. Lapwood and the choir remain for Sigur Rós’s biggest hit, Hoppípola, the energy finally spilling over into something genuinely sublime.Sigur Rós play Royal Albert Hall, 1-3 October, followed by dates in the Netherlands, the US, Canada and MexicoExplore more on these topicsSigur RosPop and rockIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

The sea is still warm as I plunge into the turquoise waters of Čikat bay, one of the largest and most sheltered on this long, thin, knobbly island in the Kvarner Gulf.Croatia’s 19th-century Habsburg rulers were convinced that Lošinj had special healing qualities. Wandering along the tree-shaded footpath that runs all around Čikat bay and its numerous headlands, lulled by scents of pine, juniper, rosemary, sage, mint, mastic and helichrysum, I’m inclined to agree. There’s a mellowness to the air after the intense heat of high summer, and fewer people are on the beaches – although the island’s main town of Mali Lošinj buzzes with several festivals and regattas in September.Croatia Losinj island mapI’m here during the annualTaste the Mediterraneanfood festival, which has moved around Croatia over the past 13 years and has now found a home in Mali Lošinj. Guest chefs from around Europe work with local chefs to create dinners at some of the town’s restaurants, as well as hosting workshops for young culinary stars of the future.It’s a fitting location: the Kvarner region – comprising the Opatija Riviera,Rijekaand its littoral, plus islands including Lošinj, Cres, Krk and Rab – has been designatedEuropean Region of Gastronomyfor 2026 by the International Institute of Gastronomy, Culture, Arts and Tourism. Situated between the Istrian peninsula and the Dalmatian coast, Kvarner embodies the melting pot of Croatian cuisine – part Austrian, part Italian, part Balkan, and borrowing freely from its regional neighbours.View image in fullscreenThe pretty harbour of Veli Lošinj.Photograph: Miroslav Posavec/AlamyI see this on my plate atDiana Steakhousein Čikat bay, where Istrian truffles add richness to creamily cheesy Italian ravioli, and grilled squid comes with a moreish Dalmatian side dish of garlickyblitva(chard) mashed into potatoes. At next door’sKonoba Cigale, I chat to executive chef Dinko Lekić, a born-and-bred Lošinjanin who praises the fish and seafood of Kvarner. “Every day it comes in fresh,” he says, adding that he’s now taking culinary revenge on the invasive blue crab by putting it on his menu.However, it’s the Adriatic langoustine –škampiin Croatian – that’s the king of Kvarner. Something magical happens when water rushes through the karst mountains ofUčka nature parkabove the Opatija area and pours nutrients into the Kvarner Gulf, feeding these shellfish. Chef Stiven Vunić, who runsKonoba Zijavicain Mošćenička Draga, south of Opatija town, and who comes from a long line ofškampifishers, enthuses about the delicacy. “This is one of the best products we have in Kvarner,” he says. “It’s very sweet; I’ve never tastedškampilike this.”Mali Lošinj’s brightly coloured port is filled with baroque sea captains’ houses, cafe terraces and a fish marketI could taste that sweetness in my grilled langoustine onBocca Vera’s terrace overlooking the lively harbour in Mali Lošinj, preceded by tortellini with ricotta and truffles in aškampisauce. Other seafood stars appear during my visit, including a platter of marinated and salted anchovies, carpaccio of sea bass, tuna and octopus as a warm-up for grilled dentex inGostionica Marinain the village of Veli Lošinj, whose pretty harbour is lined with colourful Venetian-style houses.View image in fullscreenA seafood platter at Gostionica Marina.Photograph: Adam BatterbeeThen there’s grilled turbot atLanterna Grill’s waterside terrace in Čikat bay, surely one of the most romantic spots on the island, made even more enchanting by the walk there during twilight as the fiery sun filters through Aleppo pines. The bay is a snapshot of Lošinj: grand 19th-century Austrian-style villas (including one converted into the luxuryBoutique Hotel Alhambra), the sleek modern Hotel Bellevue where I’m staying, the picturesquely ramshackle Latino Beach bar in front of a sandy stretch, and the northern cape dominated by an enormous campsite set under fragrant pines.It’s tempting to linger in Čikat, with its beaches, watersports, restaurants and picnic places. However, it’s only a 15-minute walk into Mali Lošinj, where the brightly coloured port is filled with baroque sea captains’ houses, cafe terraces and a fish market. TheMuseum of Apoxyomenoshouses one of the world’s best-preserved ancient Greek statues, and theChurch of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, with its Venetian baroque bell tower, is reached after trudging up about 200 steps along narrow alleyways.Lošinj and its neighbouring islands stretch out before me, all bathed in the glow of the setting sun. If you want to soothe the eyes and the soul, come hereThere’s already so much natural aromatherapy on the island, but it goes into overdrive atLošinj’s Fragrant Garden(Miomirisni Otočki Vrt) at the southern tip of Mali Lošinj. I say hello to the resident animals (a donkey, some tortoises and a rabbit), while inhaling island scents and gazing at the sea just beyond. From here it’s a short walk down stone steps to the sheltered pebbly beach at Valdarke, which, on this sunny Saturday afternoon, has fewer than 20 people on it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another late-season bonus: there are only a few dozen people spread out under the pines and on the pebbles.View image in fullscreenBeli harbour on the island of Cres.Photograph: Paul Williams/AlamyAbout the only place that still has a high number of visitors – and requires a reservation at sunset – is the lookout point atProvidencaon the hills above Mali Lošinj. It’s worth the €10 fee to sit at one of the benches surrounded by a profusion of scented plants and herbs, drinking Kvarner and Istrian wine, maybe buying a picnic basket of local cheeses, meats and seafood – and just gazing at the vista. Lošinj, its neighbouring islands and part of the mountainous mainland stretch out before me, all bathed in the glow of the setting sun. If you want to soothe the eyes and the soul, come here.It’s not all money, money, money here; the mellower side of Croatia’s Mamma Mia islandRead moreI have another treat in store before I leave Lošinj: getting two islands for the price of one. Lošinj’s northern tip is attached by a bridge to Cres, which ties with neighbouring Krk as being Croatia’s largest island. Populated by more sheep than people, and smothered with olive groves and forests of holm oak and pine, Cres is as relaxed as it comes. In the north is Beli, whosegriffon vulture rescue centreI last visited 21 years ago. I’m pleased to discover that concerted efforts to rescue this endangered bird have been paying off. It’s now home to Croatia’s largest colony.Cres town is another tiny Venetian delight, set on a deep bay that extends towards headlands lined with beaches of fine gravel and another sprawling campsite. In front of one of these beaches is the Isolano, a chic new adults-only hotel that opened in spring. When I heard about it months ago, I was a little worried this Marriott hotel wouldn’t suit Cres’s laid-back, nature-focused vibe (this is the island whose slogan is “no stress on Cres”), but I’m happy to be proved wrong. As with everything else I’d seen on these two Kvarner islands, it was just the spot to sit back and savour a taste of late summer.The trip was provided by theKvarner Region Tourist Board,Taste the MediterraneanandVisit Lošinj.Hotel Bellevuehas doublesfrom€177 B&B a night in October (two-night minimum stay); closed from early November to late March.The Isolano, Creshas doubles from €186 B&B in October; closed from early January to mid-MarchExplore more on these topicsCroatia holidaysFood and drinkEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All of which helps make our cuisine so eclectic, yet somehow also so similar right across the culinary culture.Bhaji rice with salted pork (pictured top)Spinach is often calledbhajiin the Caribbean, no doubt derived from the various Indian communities who migrated here. This is just one of the many delicious one-pot rice dishes found in our traditional cooking, and features spinach, pumpkin, coconut milk and salted pork. The latter would normally mean salted pig tail, but here I’ve used pork shoulder, because it’s a little more accessible and because it has much more meat on it and is far less fatty. You’ll need to salt it for at least two days in advance.Prep25 minSalt48 hr+Cook1 hr 30 minServes4-6For the salted pork500g pork shoulder, trimmed and cut into medium chunks2tbspfine sea salt1tbspwhite sugarFor the rice stew3tbsp olive oil, or rapeseed oil1 brown onion, peeled and finely diced3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed8okra, thinly sliced200g fresh spinach leaves, finely chopped150g pumpkin flesh, or butternut squash flesh, grated500g jasmine rice, rinsed400ml can coconut milk¾ tbsp flaky sea salt, or to taste1 tsp ground black or white pepper1 fresh bay leaf15g coriander leaves and soft stalks, orchadon benior Thai parsley, finely chopped1 scotch bonnet, split in half lengthways (if you prefer less heat, leave it unsplit)A few sprigs fresh thymePut the pork, salt and sugar in a bowl, mix to coat, cover, then put in the fridge for at least 48 and up to 72 hours, so it gets well salted.Rinse the meat to remove the excess salt, put it in a medium pan, add enough cold water to cover, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a medium simmer, leave to cook for 40-50 minutes, until the meat is nice and tender, then drain.Put the oil in a large saucepan on a medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the onions and garlic, and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes, until soft. Add the sliced okra, cook for a minute or so to soften that, too, then stir in the poached salted pork, spinach and pumpkin. Mix well and cook for just a few minutes more, just until the pumpkin takes on a little colour.Turn down the heat a little so the spinach doesn’t catch and burn, and keep stirring for a minute or so – the juices released by the meat and veg should stop the contents of the pan from drying out. Stir in the rice, pour in 450ml water and the coconut milk, then season with the salt, pepper, bay leaf and coriander.Turn up the heat to medium-high, then, once it’s bubbling away, turn down to a simmer and poke the thyme and scotch bonnet into the rice – this way, the chilli will release its heat slowly and flavour the whole pot. Cover the pan and leave to cook for 25-35 minutes, until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid and is tender and cooked through – keep checking on it occasionally. This dish is meant to be quite wet and sticky, so if the liquid gets absorbed too quickly or/and before the rice is cooked, add a little extra water.Ladle into bowls and serve hot.Fish curry with green mangoView image in fullscreenKeshia Sakarah’s fish curry with green mango.This is based on a Guyanese dish calledgilbakafish curry. It’s usually made with the fish found in the many rivers that run through the Amazon rainforest to the northern regions of Brazil, before eventually arriving at the Atlantic Ocean. I’ve used haddock to imitate the meatiness of those river fish.Prep20 minMarinate1 hr+Cook45 minServes4For the fresh seasoning1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped2 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced5-6 garlic cloves, peeled1½ scotch bonnet peppersFor the curry600g piece fresh haddockfillet, cut into four steaks4 tbsp curry powder2 tbsp amchar masala, or garam masala1 tbsp tomato paste4 tbsp rapeseed oil, or vegetable oil1 medium tomato, diced1 unripe green mango, halved, stoned and cut into skin-onslices1 tbsp tamarind paste1 tbsp sea salt, or to taste¼ tsp ground black pepperFirst make the fresh seasoning blend. Put all the onions in a mortar with the garlic and scotch bonnet, then grind to a paste (alternatively, pulse in a blender). Towards the end, add up to 60ml cold water to help make a smooth paste.Put the fish steaks in a bowl, add a third of the seasoning paste, then rub all over the fish to coat. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least an hour and up to overnight.Next, make the curry paste. Put all the remaining seasoning paste in a bowl, add the curry powder, amchar masala, tomato paste and four tablespoons of cold water, and mix well to combine.Put the oil in a large, heavy-based pan on a medium heat, then add the curry paste – take care, because it may spit. Stir-fry the paste for a couple of minutes, until it starts to smell very fragrant, most of the liquid evaporates and the oil starts to separate. Stir in the chopped fresh tomato – at this stage, the mix will release more oil and the spices may start to catch a bit, so keep an eye on things – and cook for four or five minutes, until the tomatoes soften and start to break down.Add the green mango, stir to coat, then leave to cook for a few minutes, to soften a little. Stir in the tamarind paste, salt, pepper and 300ml water, turn up the heat slightly, so the mix comes to a simmer,then leave to cook for another eight to 10 minutes.Drop the fish into the curry, along with all the seasoning from the bowl, push down gently to cover in the sauce, then leave to poach for 10-12 minutes, until it’s cooked through – don’t turn it too much or it may break up. Once the fish is cooked, the curry is ready to serve with rice or roti.Keshia Sakarahis a chef, food writer and food educator.

Inspired by the glut, I returned to an old favourite,my beetroot nemesis, a twist on the River Cafe’s famouschocolate nemesis cakein which I use the whole beetroot, including its candied magenta stems. Blackberries have a tendency to turn squishy, but even when they’re soft, they’re still juicy and fine to cook with. Determined not to let this bounty go to waste, I’m using some of the surplus in this heavenly, complex, adult dessert, which is rich in antioxidants and endorphin-boosting flavonoids.Blackberry nemesisAs a recipe developer of predominantly seasonal recipes, I’m always on the lookout for simple dishes that can be tweaked with the seasons. Flourless chocolate cakes have an intense flavour, yet provide a blank canvas for all sorts of additions and/or substitutions. With our hedgerows producing untold thousands of tonnes of wild blackberries annually, there’s rarely been a better time to embrace seasonal adaptations of this kind. To keep berries for longer, store them in a sealed container in the fridge with a sheet of kitchen towel in there to soak up any excess moisture.This seasonal take on the River Cafe’s chocolate nemesis has a bright acidity that cuts through the chocolate’s velvet richness, and it’s actually quite simple to make. The berries, squished into a purple puree, are stirred through melted dark chocolate and butter before being folded into whisked eggs and sugar, so aerating the cake. Everything is then baked in a bain-marie, creating a moussey, intense and complex flourless chocolate cake with a lively berry sharpness. I had a few extra blackberries, so I baked those on top to add some freshness and a welcome counterpoint to the chocolate’s deep bittern-sweetness.Chocolate is fragile and prone to split when cooked, so chop it into small pieces to help it melt evenly, and make sure the bowl is not touching the hot water in the pan below. And aim to keep the water as low as 40C – that is, about hot-bath temperature – because chocolate melts at body temperature, which is just one reason it’s so heavenly to eat. The bain-marie is not 100% essential here, but it does protect the cake from the intense heat of the oven and helps it maintain a uniform, moussey texture.Serves6180g 70%-plus cocoa dark chocolate, chopped into small pieces125g butter, or coconut butter, cut into cubes3 medium eggs150g unrefined sugar150g blackberries, plus an optional 100g extra for the toppingTo serve (all optional)Extra blackberriesLive yoghurt, creme fraiche or double creamHeat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/340F/gas 3½, line a 20cm cake tin with baking paper, then set it inside a larger solid cake tin in which it fits comfortably, for a makeshift bain-marie.Put the chocolate and butter in a bowl set over a pan of hot but not boiling water, then stir occasionally until they melt: make sure the mix doesn’t get too hot or the chocolate may split. While the chocolate is melting, whisk the eggs with the sugar for five minutes, or until they have doubled in volume.Mash or puree the blackberries, stir them into the melted chocolate, then gently fold the chocolate and fruit mix into the eggs. Pour the mix into the lined cake tin and top with the extra whole blackberries, if using. Lift the cake in its lined tin and inside the larger tin into the hot oven, then pour just-boiled water into the outer tin to come three-quarters of the way up the sides of the small cake tin. Bake for 30 minutes, or until just set, then remove and leave to cool. Cover and refrigerate the cooled cake for a few hours, then slice with a hot knife and serve with extra blackberries and something creamy.Explore more on these topicsCakeWaste notFoodFood wasteFruitAutumn food and drinkBakingChocolatefeaturesShareReuse this content"
