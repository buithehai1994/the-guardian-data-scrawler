He targeted me for being Jewish – and it hurtPeter EttedguiNow that my former classmate has finally spoken about the allegations of his behaviour at school, I feel compelled to address his points directlyTue 25 Nov 2025 14.38 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 18.31 ESTShareIhad thought my Dulwich days were well behind me and that I’d never again have to think about the antisemitic taunts I suffered fromNigel Farageat school. Then at some point in the late 2000s, a friend sent me a YouTube video of the then Ukip leader haranguing EU commissioners.The instant I saw Farage, my blood froze. All I could think of was his 13-year-old self sidling up to me, growling the words “Hitler was right” and other odious remarks (“To the gas chambers”, “Gas them – ssssssssss”) which he now refers to, rather quaintly, as banter. The verb “trigger” is perhaps overused, but it’s the only word I can think of to describe the stomach-churning emotions I felt in that moment I laid eyes on him again on YouTube.As Farage became an increasingly ubiquitous figure on the public stage, I would tell friends and strangers alike of my experience of him at school. It was alarming to me that all people seemed to see was Farage the entertainer, the nonconformist political figure, overflowing with bonhomie – a straight-talking man of the people, holding up his pint glass.One of my friends with whom I shared my recollections of that darker side of Farage urged me to speak out about my experience in 2013 and put me in touch with the Channel 4 journalist Michael Crick, who was then compiling his report of Farage’s alleged racism at school.I felt deeply ambivalent. I didn’t want to expose what happened to me on national TV, and I wondered if it was even fair to do so, given that we were only 13 to 14 at the time. But of course I followed the reporting closely, and it was Farage’s response to Crick’s questions that made me regret not having participated: “I said some ridiculous things, not necessarily racist things.” My anger at what I saw as blatant dishonesty meant I would not be quite so reluctant in the future.I have seen Farage’s denials of the allegations made in the Guardian and I listened on Monday night to Farage’s response in a broadcast interview. I heard only more dishonesty. I would like to address the points he made directly.Farage has said that this happened so long ago that people could not possibly remember such experiences. I ask, how could I not? It was the first time that I had encountered the “oldest hatred”, the one that claimed generations of my family. I had assumed that such views were a thing of the past – but he taught me otherwise. Maybe he cannot recall what he did. If so, such memory loss is perhaps not a great selling point for a potential leader of a country. But as the victim of his verbal abuse, I can assure you that I do recall it all vividly. His words, the tone of his voice, his physical posture, these are all intensely ingrained, as was the emotional impact – degrading, humiliating.Twenty people allege he has a racist past. He denies it. Who’s telling the truth about Farage’s schooldays?Read moreFaragesuggests that he has never “directly” abused anyone, or at least he did not do so with any intention to hurt. He has said that those who have claimed otherwise are not telling the truth. Well, he did directly target me and I can tell you that it did hurt. How did he think it would make me feel? How does he think those who were called Pakis or told to “go home” felt? His aides have said it is “one person’s word against another”. The Guardian has spoken to about 20 people who witnessed or experienced racist behaviour, including a number who have corroborated my account.A third strand of Farage’s explanation of events is that he may have simply “misspoken” as a child. How very woke of this culture warrior to use that term. He was not a child. He was 13 to 14 years old when he “misspoke” to me. The age when many cultures and religions encourage teenagers to face adulthood. I was doing barmitzvah classes during the year Farage was frequently misspeaking to me. His words made me feel conflicted about my Jewish heritage, ashamed even. Ridiculous, really. According to the allegations in the Guardian’s reporting, racist abuse of other pupils continued through to when he was aged 18. That is a lot of misspeaking.Finally, there is the suggestion from Farage that this was somehow normal 1970s banter that is being wrongly reinterpreted today to fit a contemporary narrative. The cruelty of Farage’s words transcended typical schoolkid banter even back then in the 1970s. Racist attacks are becoming normalised once again in the UK, fuelled by the rise of populism and the far right across the world, and, of course, the anti-immigration agenda. Given Reform UK’s policies, it is even more pressing that questions about Farage’s own “banter” and “misspeaking” are raised.I’d like to know why he has never shown the slightest contrition for the deep offence these allegations caused me and many others. And I’d like to know if what I view as his early racist mindset has truly changed with the passing of time. Because when I hear Mr Farage talking about rounding up and deporting hundreds of thousands of human beings, and threatening those with leave to remain or settled status, I cannot help but think of the schoolboy sidling up to me and telling me that “Hitler was right”.Peter Ettedgui is a Bafta- and Emmy-winning director and producer.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Will the returning Anthology project and Sam Mendes’s planned biopics create new arguments?Stuart MaconieTue 25 Nov 2025 07.26 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 17.44 ESTShareThe early notion of the Beatles as “four lads that shook the world” has been subject to many shifts in emphasis over the decades. They have been valorised, vilified, mythologised, misunderstood and even ignored. The release this month of the new Beatles Anthology – an expansion of the original mid-1990s compilation with CD, vinyl reissues and the documentary series streaming on Disney+ – is testament not just to their enduring appeal but also to how the constant reframing of their story reveals as much about our changing tastes. The 2025 edition arrives as a full-scale revisitation of the original project, bringing with it a remastered, expanded documentary series and a substantial reissue campaign.What is more likely to reshape the way we see the band, though, is the addition of a brand-new ninth episode to the original TV series, built from recently excavated footage of Paul McCartney,George Harrisonand Ringo Starr working together in 1994–95. Far more intimate and informal than the original broadcast, this material captures the three surviving Beatles rehearsing, reflecting and simply spending time as old friends rather than cultural monuments, albeit still with the “kid brother” tensions between Harrison and McCartney. They work on Free As a Bird and Now and Then, jokingly speculate on a stadium reunion tour and generally talk about their history, loss and their unfinished musical ideas. It’s a rare, humanising coda to the well-worn story. With new material like this, and with more than that axiomatic 50 years of distance since the Beatles dissolved in a blizzard of lawsuits and “funny paper”, are we finally approaching a unified theory of everything fab?View image in fullscreenOld friends rather than cultural monuments … Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in the 90s.Photograph: PROf the estimated 2,000-plus books about the Beatles – shelves groaning with both slavish hagiography and angry debunkings as well as whole volumes on their hair, their shoes and the Soviet mind-control programme they were allegedly involved in – Erin Torkelson Weber’s 2016 book The Beatles and the Historians, academic historiography written by a tenured professor at Newman University in Kansas, may seem less sexy than, say, Turn Me On, Dead Man: the Complete Story of thePaul McCartneyDeath Hoax; or Communism, Hypnotism and the Beatles. Among Beatles maniacs however, her “four narratives” theory has become much celebrated and discussed.View image in fullscreenA still from Anthology depicting the Beatles’ transformation from a five-piece to the Fab Four, which digitally altered an image of the group in Hamburg.Composite: PRFirst came the “Fab Four” narrative, prevailing during their lifetime. Breezy and celebratory, this foregrounded the positive, emphasising the joyous collective charm and energy of the early Beatles and glossing over drug use, sexual peccadilloes, Brian Epstein’s homosexuality and even John Lennon’s marriage to Cynthia. Hunter Davies’ authorised biography of 1968 is key here. Davies has a seasoned Fleet Street denizen’s enthusiasm for facts and detail – the £32,000 Ringo paid for his house in Weybridge in Surrey, the £17 a week Pete Best was earning in a bakery when Davies met him – rather than florid musings from the underground press.The “Lennon Remembers” narrative takes its name from a 21 January 1971 magazine interview and later book by Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner. With Lennon in a raw and corrosive frame of mind just three weeks after the dissolution of the Beatles, his bitter, self-pitying diatribe was either a planned purging of the suffocating Beatle myth or, as the comedian and Beatles fan Mitch Benn has tartly summarised it, John in full “messianic smackhead” mode (though in the interview Lennon claims to be no longer “hooked”). Here, he swipes at Harrison and McCartney and traduces loyal associates such as Neil Aspinall, Derek Taylor and George Martin. When the latter plaintively asked him in 1980 “What was all that shit about, John?” Lennon sheepishly replied that he was “out of me head”.Out of this grew what Torkelson Weber calls the “Shout!” narrative, a viewpoint named for Philip Norman’s 1981 biography wherein that author recasts the drama with Lennon as sainted rebel, McCartney a slick vaudevillian of industrious mediocrity and Harrison and Starr callously consigned to cameos as makeweights and tagalongs. It peddles the myth of genius versus craft, updated for the post-punk conscience and the sense of loss in the wake of Lennon’s murder. McCartney referred to it, with some justification, as “shite”.View image in fullscreenSainted rebel … John Lennon at a press conference in New York in 1968.Photograph: John Lindsay/APMore recently, we arrive at the “Lewisohn” narrative. Mark Lewisohn is generally regarded as the world’s pre-eminent Beatles authority and his approach is forensic, impartial, archival and driven by love of the music. He is deep into the research and writing of All These Years, his huge and magisterial three-volume Beatle biography, the second instalment of which is now in production, 12 years on from the first. Our knowledge of Shakespeare’s life is sketchy, opaque and hugely unsatisfactory. Lewisohn, often at his desk in Kent from 6am till the small hours, is determined that the same does not happen to our other great cultural export.“My interest is solely in getting the story right while there are still first-hand witnesses to what happened, to get at the truth if I can and let the rest fall away,” he tells me. “I have no agenda of any kind. I’m attempting to tell the story as neutrally as possible and to put down anything that I consider is relevant and interesting and propels the story forward. I’m taking my job seriously, but the Beatles were very funny people, so I want to be entertaining and reflect that. But I’m approaching it seriously in the sense of trying my very best to get it as right as possible while it’s still possible.”View image in fullscreenLong and winding story …Photograph: PRHis commitment is absolute; he has spent more than a year trying to have corrected one single sentence in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography’s entry on a Beatles associate, a Trinidadian calypso musician called Lord Woodbine, which inaccurately states the fledgling Beatles were once dubbed “Woodbine’s Boys”. (I’ve just checked and, sadly, it’s still there.)Times change. The “Beatle fatigue” of the early 70s calcified into something more openly hostile with the advent of punk: the group were viewed as bulwarks of irrelevant and toothless pop-lite and queasy nostalgia. “No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones” snarled the Clash in 1977, while Glen Matlock was said to have been sacked from Sex Pistols for daring to like the scouse moptops.Then, in the wake of Lennon’s murder, he became lionised at the expense of his peers, particularly McCartney, and (wrongly) seen as the group’s experimentalist and creative engine. This, as Lewisohn says, has now begun to swing the other way. “Post-assassination, we lived in a Lennon world and I guess that lasted about 15 years or so, during which Paul was diminished unfairly. I think that’s been corrected. If you stopped eight people in the street now and asked them to name a Beatle, they would say Paul first, I think – the result of him still being around and engaging in any number of projects which keep his name at the forefront.”Times change again. Happily in recent years, many more women such as Torkelson Weber have entered the realm of Beatles scholarship, scrutinising gender roles and masculinity in the music. Questlove, Nelson George and Yaw Owusu have written about the Beatles in relation to Black artists and Liverpool’s colonial history. In his brilliant documentaryThe Beatlesand India, Ajoy Bose examined how the culture of the Indian subcontinent changed – and was changed by – the band.View image in fullscreenNew wave band … (l to r) Harris Dickinson (John Lennon), Paul Mescal (Paul McCartney), Barry Keoghan (Ringo Starr), and Joseph Quinn (George Harrison) at a photocall for Sam Mendes’ forthcoming Beatles films.Photograph: John Russo/REX/ShutterstockThe Beatles magical history tour shows no signs of slowing. On the ceaseless tide of Beatle worship, scrutiny and scholarship, new waves break every day, and we can only speculate how they will shift the Beatles historiographical landscape. Philip Norman’s forthcoming biography of Epstein promises to refocus attention on the band’s earliest professional years, potentially reassessing his role not only as manager but as the architect of their public persona and their development into global cultural icons.Meanwhile, Sam Mendes’ ambitious plan for four interconnected biopics, each told from the perspective of a single Beatle, suggests a further decentralisation of that traditional “fab four” narrative. Early casting and production details indicate that the films may also give greater weight to the band members’ partners and familial relationships, foregrounding the women whose influence has often been marginalised in previous retellings. Maybe this will reshape how audiences understand individual motivations, creative dynamics, and the fluxes and pressures that eventually sundered the group.So, have we reached a “grand unified theory” – or are we simply in a period where certain interpretations feel temporarily settled? Lewisohn,Peter Jackson(and it must be said, Disney’s) imperious, authoritative perspective would suggest that but, as the lesson of Francis Fukuyama reminds us, those who confidently predict “the end of history” can wind up with egg on their faces. The constant arrival of new material, new perspectives and new technologies suggests that the band’s story remains fundamentally open-ended.Rather than closing the book, these projects may encourage us to see the Beatles not as fixed historical figures but as subjects whose meaning continues to evolve with each retelling. Philip Norman’s Shout! narrative may have fallen from critical favour, but at least two assertions in it still ring true. That the Beatles are “the greatest engine for human happiness the entertainment world has ever seen”, and that when you hear that word, a small black insect is the second thing you think of.This article was amended on 25 November 2025 to clarify that an image used was a still taken from Anthology which had digitally altered an old photograph.Explore more on these topicsThe BeatlesJohn LennonPaul McCartneyGeorge HarrisonRingo StarrfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Take it from this Brit: sometimes laughter is the only optionTue 25 Nov 2025 07.59 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 12.40 ESTShareLiterally nothing on this earth takes itself as seriously as American journalism. There are rogue-state dictators it’s more permissible to laugh at than the endlessly hilarious pretensions of newsmen and newswomen in the United States. The crucial difference between the British press and US press is that at least we in the British pressknowwe’re in the gutter. The Americans have always imagined – and so loudly – that they are involved in some kind of higher calling. Guys, I love you and stuff, but get over it, because you’re missing one of the great jokes of the century. Yourselves.I don’t deny that everything’s bigger in America. Our former health secretary had a knee-trembler up against his office doorin the pandemic; their current oneapparentlywrote felching … poetry, is it … felching poetry? … to a superstar journalist who was worrying about his brainworm, yet the story is being written up like it’s Dante, instead of X-rated Italian brainrot.We are, by the way, talking about the tale of Olivia Nuzzi, Ryan Lizza and Robert F Kennedy. If you’ve missed this one, you havea great treat in store. Olivia and Ryan were hotshot political journalists (and a couple) covering presidential campaigns and writing a joint book about the 2020 one, when Ryan discovered last year that Olivia had had what is primly described as a “digital affair” with wingnut presidential candidate RFK. It all blew up, there was some legal hokey-cokey, they lost their jobs, she fled to LA, RFK became health secretary. He’s gotbigger brainwormsto fry; the other two are now “breaking their silence”.And everything – everything – about it is darkly hysterical. It should obviously be being written as comedy. Instead, the story is being chronicled with maximum portentousness by its own protagonists. First, in Nuzzi’s forthcoming memoir/state-of-the-nation something-or-other, which isactually entitledAmerican Canto. And second in Lizza’s Substack, which isgenuinely calledTelos. I can’t.No, hang on – I can. Like so many of the self-regarding big-hitters of the US fourth estate, this sundered pair very much need you to know that serious prose is occurring. Both of them adore a sledgehammer metaphor. With Lizza, it’s bamboo. The bamboo in the couple’s apartment courtyard “had become a metaphor for our decade-long entanglement”. Righto. “If not tamed, [it] would march through the entire courtyard and kill everything.” Thanks for flagging, mate. “I spent hours hacking at the sprouts to keep the bamboo at bay, just as I had with all the secrets that Olivia and I shared.” Is there much more of this? Yes, would seem to be the answer. “I should have known that it was futile and that, at some point, the bamboo would take over the garden, and that’s all anyone would see.” Come on Ryan, batter me round the head with the bamboo analogy one more time – I’m so close to getting the point.With Nuzzi,it’s wildfires. She flees to LA after the RFK story breaks, staking down seemingly dozens of signposts to where we are going as the burning takes hold. “10:30 a.m., 10 acres burning. 10:50 a.m., 20 acres burning … 2 p.m., 700 acres burning. 3 p.m., 1,300 acres burning … 12:30 a.m., 3,000 acres burning. 9 a.m., 5,000 acres burning. 11:45 a.m., 12,000 acres burning. 1:30 p.m., 16,000 acres burning … 9 p.m., 20,000 acres burning. 8 a.m., 22,000 acres burning. 4 p.m., 24,000 acres burning.” OK GOT IT. Luckily, because we’re literary dumbos, Nuzzi has already explained: “You cannot outrun your life on fire.” Makes u think. Could we have some crossover metaphor event where the bamboo catches fire? Maybe for Black Friday.With heavy heart, apparently, the wider US mediamust cover the tale, yet not even America’s dainty journalese can rob the story of its full-spectrum trash merriment. In fact, in some cases it adds to it. Nuzzi’s lawyertold the New York Timeshis client would “not dignify efforts to impugn her character with any future response”. Dialling in from an Edith Wharton novel, there. I believe the felching poetrydropped a couple of days later.It’s so sad that, across American newsrooms, hankies must be overtly pressed to noses about all this, while refresh keys can only be covertly pressed to see if any more has dropped. Pretty much the only splashy thing Vanity Fair has done under its new editorship was hire Nuzzi as West Coast editor and run her book extract, so it should be absolutely zero surprise to learn that, as a result of something they read in Telos – again, “Telos”!!! – the magazine is reviewing the appointment. “We were taken by surprise,” intoned a Vanity Fair spokeswoman, “and we are looking at all the facts.” For heaven’s sake, buck up and stop being so absolutelywet. This sort of thing is why you hired her. Just own it and allow yourself a bit of fun.Alas, they seem bent on playing it like they’re in the midst of some boring ethics crisis, when you can’t help feeling that ship has sailed. May we humble outsiders offer a word of advice? Guys, you just need to stop being so American and serious about it all. And, indeed, about America. God knows we lesser countries have put some ghastly people in charge ourselves, but you do have to allow your international underlings the occasional cackle at the fact that in your great nation, Donald Trump has now become president, twice. When you lot shit the bed, the whole world has to lie in it – so do at least have the delicacy to realise that once dignity has gone, a good laugh is how the rest of us get by.

But who cares when the work is so sublime you can hear the squelching and smell the river?Adrian SearleTue 25 Nov 2025 10.14 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 14.38 ESTShareTurner or Constable: who’s the boss? Tate Britain’s exhibition of work by the two artists, subtitled Rivals and Originals, fudges the question. Born a year apart and both alumni of the Royal Academy schools in London, each was keenly aware of what the other was doing, in a British art world that was as febrile and competitive, if immeasurably smaller, than it is today (although you should try the Italian Renaissance if you want full-blooded rivalries and enmities). Sometimes, they sought the same collectors and painted the same subjects. Turner was encouraged from an early age by his father, a Covent Garden wigmaker and barber; Constable was the son of a Suffolk mill owner and grain merchant who wanted him to take over the family business.As well as their contrasting backgrounds, their temperaments could not have been more different. A scene fromMike Leigh’s 2014 film Mr Turner, starring Timothy Spall as Turner and James Fleet as Constable, plays in the show, presenting the two painters bickering on Varnishing Day at the Royal Academy in 1832. Turner added a touch of red, in the form of a buoy, to his seascape Helvoetsluys; the City of Utrecht, 64, Going to Sea in order to upstage Constable’s The Opening of Waterloo Bridge, on which the painter had been working for more than a decade. But whatever their rivalry entailed, it was hardly the odd-couple bromance between Van Gogh and Gauguin depicted in the 1956 Vincente Minnelli movie Lust for Life (Gauguin: “You paint too fast!” Van Gogh: “You look too fast!”). It is worth remembering that Constable once wrote in a letter: “Did you ever see a picture by Turner, and not wish to possess it?”View image in fullscreenTurner’s Dolbadern Castle, North Wales, 1800.Photograph: Royal Academy of Arts, LondonThe last time these two paintings were brought together was at the Royal Academy in 2019, and Helvoetsluys, owned by the Tokyo FujiArtMuseum, is not included in the current show. But we do have Constable’s folding sketching chair and sections of Turner’s fishing rod and a reel as well as various palettes, paintboxes and other paraphernalia belonging to each artist. And painting after painting after painting, watercolours and sketches from throughout their careers.Compare Turner’s Dolbadern Castle, North Wales, 1800, with its looming tower silhouetted against a boiling evening sky and its allusions to 13th-century struggle for Welsh independence (and the threat of the French Revolution spreading across the Channel), and Constable’s diploma work submitted to the RA 29 years later, which shows a man opening a lock to allow a boat passage upriver. This is a painting of two men and a dog, a view across the meadows beside a working river, some trees, a distant church and a tremendous sky with a passing rain shower. Turner’s painting is extraordinary and portentous, while Constable’s celebrates an everyday, although now vanished world. I can almost smell the river.View image in fullscreenA Boat Passing a Lock, 1826, by John Constable.Photograph: Heritage Image Partnership /AlamyConstable invites the eye to wander from the squelching underfoot to a distant lowland horizon, and to imagine things that cannot be seen as the river bends out of sight. Turner has you cowering in the gloom beneath the castle on its promontory. His “sublime” becomes a predilection for drama and vaporous emptiness, whereas Constable’s paintings are filled with stuff: carts, posts, locks, windmills, cottages, churches, cathedrals, river boats, horses, donkeys, sheep, bargees and people fishing; reeds, burdock, willows, cornfields, hedges, elms, oaks, weather, rainbows and clouds. Constable was drawn to “the sound of water escaping from Mill dams, Willows, old rotten Banks, slimy posts, & brickwork. I love such things … As long as I do paint I shall never cease to paint such Places.”Turner, who travelled further, gives us mountain passes, wild seas, steamboats and coal barges and the atmospheric pollution ofLondonand the Black Country. He paints the burning of the Houses of Parliament, disasters at sea and incomprehensible painted storms. He painted Noah’s ark on the evening of the deluge and a mashup of Goethe’s theory of light and colour with Light and Colour (Goethe’s Theory) – the Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis, depicting Moses sitting in a sort of bubble, floating in the ether. Turner paints figures that are as inept as those of his beloved Baroque landscape painter Claude Lorrain. Turner’s all over the place. His 1832 Staffa, Fingal’s Cave, has the sun like a billiard ball resting on the horizon, the basalt rocks far on the left picking up the last rays, as the rain moves through, along with the steamboat’s trail of smoke. This is great, but then he goes and paints The Golden Bough, an absurd concoction with figures in a hazy landscape, and decorous pines planted hither and thither, and the little votive sculpture in its blue niche in the rock.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner, Keelmen Heaving in Coals by Moonlight, 1835.Photograph: Studio A/National Gallery of Art, Washington, Widener Collection.When Turner paints Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps in 1812 he pictures Hannibal sitting on his elephant on the horizon, a tiny detail in the huge canvas. The distant animal, with its trunk raised, looks as threatening as a teapot. And what of the lumpen extras in the bottom right-hand corner? It is like a high fantasy CGI scene from a movie, more Lord of the Rings than Gladiator, though Turner was thinking of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was often compared to Hannibal. I gawp but don’t care. Where’s my popcorn? Even the title reads like a bit of superimposed text in a movie.Turner liked the specificity of the titles he gave some of his more grandiose, clamorous scenes. They lent a certain veracity to all that painted chaos. In 1842 he painted Snow Storm – Steam-Boat Off a Harbour’s Mouth Making Signals in Shallow Water, and Going By the Lead. It is inscribed: “The Author was in this Storm on the Night the Ariel left Harwich.” We are lost amid the brown filth from the smokestack, the spume and snow, and heaving sea, the flag signalling how lost we are. Somehow, we have to negotiate all this. When he is specific, Turner is great.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another contemporary, the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich might have coveted this little scrap of unstretched canvas. Constable’s skittering, glittering highlights in his later paintings, those little scrapes and spots and flecks of white that seem detached from any object aerate his worked and reworked canvases and make something entirely fixating of the passing world.View image in fullscreenHampstead Heath With a Rainbow, 1836, by Constable.Photograph: TateBut this feeling was already there in Constable’s cloud studies, painted in the early 1820s. Birds wheeling, clouds billowing and sagging, layered banks of greenish, greyish and bluish cloud, clouds flaring and underlit by the setting sun, rain-heavy clouds and others almost dissolving, clouds with luminous edges and clouds reduced to a few pattering, indistinct marks, massing in gradations of lighter and darker touches. I prefer these small and almost casual studies (yet how specific they are!) to almost anything else in the entire exhibition. They feel suspended in the here and now as much as they record a particular day almost 200 years ago. At his best, Turner could be just as exact, especially at his most offhand, but Constable touches me more.Turner & Constable: Rivals & Originals is atTate Britain, London, 27 November to 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtJMW TurnerJohn ConstableExhibitionsTate BritainLondonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Can sledding and survival skills cure their social media-induced anxiety?Philip OltermannTue 25 Nov 2025 11.19 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 12.40 ESTShareNineteen-year-old Hege is stricken by all the common anxieties of her generation. She spends too much time scrolling through socials on her phone, and as a result she is obsessed with how other people perceive her, and highly stressed when it comes to interacting with real humans in the flesh. “I think a lot about what people think about me,” she says. “You get tired of it.”The young adult from Sandnes in the south-west ofNorwayis one of the three teenage protagonists of Folktales, a new documentary that proposes a refreshingly simple remedy for zoomer angst: “Give yourself a fire, a dog, and the starry sky above you.”So says one of the teachers at the educational establishment where Hege and her classmates are packed off to for 12 months: a “folk high school” in Pasvik in the northernmost corner of Europe, 200 miles above the Arctic circle. Here the students don’t sit in classes, they “wake up their Stone Age brains” by learning how to pitch a tent, keep themselves warm at minus 30C, and drive dog sleds across the icy landscape.Hege may still be overthinking things when she dons a pair of RayBans at her first campfire, but soon she goes hours without even remembering to check her mobile, and eventually there is nothing greater in the world to her than dashing through the snow on the back of a dog sled, her body racing but her mind finally standing still.View image in fullscreen‘The experience of complete self-reliance’ … RomainPhotograph: Magnolia Pictures/Everett/ShutterstockFolktales’ directors, the US film-makers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, say they became fascinated with the Scandinavian folk high school concept because its philosophy was so at odds with the priorities of the American education system. “I think the United States is very focused on data and outcomes,” says Ewing. “You take a test and you get graded and put on some kind of curve of how you did, and therefore many high school students are just studying for the tests.Dashing through the snow on a dog sled, Hege’s body is racing but her mind is finally standing still“At folk high schools like Pasvik, there are no tests, written or otherwise. They are about building character, becoming a more enhanced adult, and challenging yourself internally and socially. The idea that you should do something that may never contribute to your chances of earning a living in the future was really attractive for us.”In Europe, the folk high school philosophy may sound more familiar. Its founder, the 19th-century Danish pastor and poetNFS Grundtvig, may not be as much of a household name as other reformist educators such asMaria Montessorior the kindergarten inventor Friedrich Fröbel. But the legacy of Grundtvig’s core ideas – that education should be for everyone and not just the social elite, fostering not just abstract enlightenment but lived “enlivenment” – can be seen across the continent.In German-speaking Europe, it fuelled the spread ofvolkshochschulen,publicly funded adult education centres, while in the UK its philosophy lives on in the Duke of Edinburgh’s award scheme. There are folk high schools scattered across the Baltics, Poland and throughout Scandinavia. The concept caught on big time in Norway, where there are still 85 of them, hosting approximately 7,000 students every year. They are fee-paying – a year at Pasvik costs the equivalent of about £10,000 – but most Norwegian students get a study loan, 40% of which is covered by the government if they complete their course.Grady and Ewing first made a name for themselves withJesus Camp, their controversial 2006 documentary about an evangelical Christian summer camp. It outraged secular audiences with its unflinching depiction of what appeared to be the indoctrination of minors with radical Christian ideas (in one scene, children are urged in prayer to join the fight to end abortion in America). Folktales, by contrast, is less likely to inflame tensions. Shot in a Netflix-compatible style, with an abundance of drone shots and an awe-instructing soundtrack, the film in fact has a tendency to shave the edges off the folk high school experience. Much is made of the invigorating baths in the icy Barents Sea, the age-old wisdom of trees, and campfire husky cuddling – less so of themoose-shooting coursesthat Pasvik’s website also advertises. Norse mythology is woven through the film, though 40% of Norway’s folk high schools are Christian establishments. And the film inadvertently shows, but doesn’t comment on, something the Norwegian government bemoaned in arecent report: that folk high schools struggle to attract students from immigrant backgrounds.But the film does capture the kind of learning experiences that conventional schools simply aren’t designed to create. We follow Romain, an 18-year-old Dutch high-school dropout who is taught to make his own camp in the wilderness. Night is drawing in, the temperature is dropping fast, and Romain goes to the teachers’ camp to ask if he can use their fire to boil his water. “If we let you use our fire, we wouldn’t be helping you,” says the teacher. “I think you can do it”.It’s hard not to root for Romain as he struggles to hide his frustration in front of the camera: “You think I can do it, or you want me to do it?” he asks, politely but pointedly. But in the end, the young Dutchman manages to light his own fire, and towards the end of the film there is a suggestion that the experience of complete self-reliance unlocks in him an ability to improve his connection with other young people in his class. It’s evident that he has lived through something more than a glorified gap year.Folk high schools stress community and social interaction, in a world where there’s great emphasis on individualism“We knew that Romain and the other students were capable of making their camp,” Iselin Breivold, Pasvik’s dog-sled instructor, tells me. “But the conditions were harsher than when we practiced, and some of the students wanted to take shortcuts. And they don’t learn anything from taking shortcuts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But then they can’t, and they have a really big downfall.” The job of Breivold and her fellow teachers isn’t to solve problems for the young people but to encourage them to solve them themselves. “These are challenges you might never have accepted in life outside a folk high school. But there are challenges that make you develop as a human being, both personally, but also in how you see the world and the people around you.”View image in fullscreenStudents are encouraged to ‘wake up their Stone Age brains’ … Bjorn.Photograph: Magnolia Pictures/Everett/ShutterstockFolktales may make instructive viewing in Norway, where folk high schools have recently fallen out of favour with political decision-makers. The government is currently debating a change to a system that, up to now, credits folk high school graduates with two points they can use on their university applications. In a drive to boost the popularity of the Norwegian army, these extra points may in the future be given exclusively to those doing military service. A cut in scholarships, from 40% to 15% of the study loan, is also being debated.The Norwegian research centre Norce has embarked on a five-year project into whether this would all amount to the country dropping a powerful tool for social inclusion. “Like many countries across the globe, we have a growing problem with young people who are losing trust in society, and fall out of work,” says senior researcher Vigdis Sveinsdottir. “And in a world where there’s great emphasis on individualism, folk high schools stress community and social interaction in a way that often goes under the radar in mainstream education.”The kids of Jesus Camp, 10 years later: ‘Was it child abuse? Yes and no’Read moreHege’s story has an ambiguous ending in the film. While a year in the wild seems to have strengthened the young woman’s personality, her return to her home town comes with new frustrations, and she eventually opts to retreat back to the high north to train as a dog handler. The line between character-building adventures and escapism looks like a fine one.Do these young people come out of their folk high school experience better equipped to cope with the challenges of the modern world, I ask the directors? “It’s a tricky question, because of course part of the point is to evade the modern world,” says Ewing. “They’re definitely not better at managing ChatGPT or using AI. But they’re better equipped to be decent human beings who can maybe not shrink under pressure in the future.”Folktales is in UK and Irish cinemas and on digital platforms from 5 DecemberExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsYoung peopleNorwaySchoolsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Prevent all crimes from being committed? Or finally develop skills beyond that of a trainee copywriter? Here are television’s finest depictions of our imminent future…Stuart HeritageTue 25 Nov 2025 11.25 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 12.03 ESTShareThere aren’t many television shows yet about how AI affects our daily lives. After all, there isn’t much dramatic potential in shows about creatively flaccid people using ChatGPT to write woeful little Facebook updates. But that is not to say we haven’t come close.For years, fiction about AI tended to be exclusively about killer robots, but some shows have taken a more nuanced look at how AI will shape our lives over the next few years. Here are the best of them.8. HumansView image in fullscreenHorrifyingly prescient … Mia (Gemma Chan), Max (Ivanno Jeremiah) and Flash (Ritu Arya) in Humans.Photograph: Colin Hutton/Kudos/Wild Mercury/Channel 4As this Channel 4 sci-fi wore on, it headed more and more towards the killer robot trope, as the synthetic humans gained consciousness, realised how shabbily the human race had treated them, and sought revenge. But in the more contemplative first season, Humans revolved around the idea of how humanity and AI interact. In an age in whichpeople fall in love with their chatbots, andparents are suing OpenAIfor ChatGPT allegedly encouraging their children to kill themselves, this element of the show is starting to look horrifyingly prescient.7. Person of InterestView image in fullscreenA race to the bottom? … Michael Emerson in Person of Interest.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyAnother slightly lazy thing for creators to do is to use AI as an all-knowing bogeyman, as the last two Mission: Impossible films proved. Jonathan Nolan’s Person of Interest narrowly avoided falling into this trap, even though it was about an artificial intelligence program designed to prevent crime before it is committed. Person of Interest became more relevant when it introduced a second, less scrupulous program that was determined to destroy the first. If you’ve ever looked on aghast at what seems like AI’s race to the bottom, this will resonate.6. DevsAlex Garland’s banger of a series took a leap when it predicted what AI could achieve by using machine learning to analyse every piece of data in the universe to map the entire past, present and future of human history. Given that today’s AI has roughly the same skills as a trainee copywriter, this may still be some years away. However, the culture that brought the technology into being – which favoured progress over ethics – does feel quite contemporary.5. NextView image in fullscreenDeeply unsettling … John Slattery in Next.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThis short-lived Fox procedural was about a superintelligent AI that broke out of its confines and thrust havoc on the world. Obviously this hasn’t happened yet (give it six months), but it did a very unsettling job of showing how easy it would be, since every single thing we own seems to be connected to the internet. Emails were faked. Phones went down. Wifi-connected cars went haywire. I can’t remember if someone’s smart fridge ended up killing them, but frankly it’s only a matter of time.4. Years and YearsView image in fullscreenThings can only get worse? … Emma Thompson as Vivienne Rook in Years and Years.Photograph: Album/AlamyRussell T Davies wrote his dystopian thriller more than half a decade ago, but with every passing day it feels as if he is getting more and more right. The show predicted the Ukraine war, the pandemic, Trump’s second term and a populist rightwing leader keen to dismantle the BBC. Another running theme of the show is having characters who are forced into low-paid service work after their jobs are taken by AI. Which is depressing, but given that the show also features bombings and death camps, it could always get worse.3. Mrs DavisView image in fullscreenPlanet ravaging stuff … Betty Gilpin in Mrs Davis.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyOn the surface, Vince Gilligan’s new show Pluribus has a lot in common with Damon Lindelof’s 2023 series Mrs Davis. Both feature a woman determined to save the world from a force that seems to have united the rest of the world against her. In the case of Pluribus, an alien virus destroys individuality, replacing all of humanity with a single inanely cheerful consciousness. But in Mrs Davis, the threat was an all-knowing AI that people had willingly signed up for – even though it was ravaging the planet – because it made their lives marginally easier. Sound familiar?2. The CaptureView image in fullscreenFar more frightening than any killer robot … Isaac Turner (Paapa Essiedu) and DCI Rachel Carey (Holliday Grainger) in The Capture.Photograph: Ray Burmiston/BBC/Heyday/Universal International StudiosA BBC drama with a premise that becomes more and more relevant by the day; what if you could no longer trust your own eyes? The Capture depicted AI as a tool of propaganda, where governments could use deepfake technology to depict anyone doing anything, and the results were indistinguishable from reality. Again, this isn’t impossible to imagine – there are already TikTok deepfakes of Queen Elizabeth II having a tantrum in Greggs – but the thought of AI being used as a way to control the truth is far more frightening than any killer robot.1. Black MirrorView image in fullscreenCould our chatbots destroy us? … Be Right Back: Black Mirror.Photograph: Channel 4Clearly the daddy of dystopian AI nightmares.Black Mirrorhas been around so long, and is so full of ideas, that you can essentially use it to predict any given combination of ways that AI will destroy us all. Non-consensual deepfakes? Joan is Awful. People unquestioningly forming destructive bonds with chatbots? Be Right Back. Authorities using AI to commit atrocities to keep their hands clean? Hated in the Nation. Literal killer robots? Metalhead. When the end comes, as it surely will, it’s depressing to think that your final thought will now probably be: “Oh, I think I saw this on Black Mirror once.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBlack MirrorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He targeted me for being Jewish – and it hurt | Peter EttedguiDaniel Boffey,Henry Dyerand Mark BlacklockTue 25 Nov 2025 15.58 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 19.10 ESTShareThree more school contemporaries who claim to have witnessed Nigel Farage’s alleged teenage racism have rejected the Reform UK leader’s suggestion that it was “banter”, describing it as targeted, persistent and nasty.One former pupil, Stefan Benarroch, claimed that people emerging from a Jewish assembly at Dulwich college had been in the sights of Farage and others for taunts while a second, Cyrus Oshidar, described as “rubbish” the claim that the Reform leader did not act with intent to hurt.“Being called a Paki isn’t hurtful?” Oshidar asked. A third, Rickard Berg, told the Guardian: “He’s now in a position where he shouldn’t be denying this. He’s straight up lying.”The Guardian has spoken to more than 20 people who alleged racist or antisemitic behaviour by Farage at school, including seven people who say they recall the targeted abuse of Peter Ettedgui, who is now an Emmy- and Bafta-winning director.The alleged abuse spanned six years, from age 13 to 18.On Monday night, Farage broke his silence over allegations that he had targeted fellow pupils for racial and antisemitic abuse, nearly a week after the Guardian published an investigation into his alleged conduct.His aides previously said that “the suggestion that Mr Farage ever engaged in, condoned, or led racist or antisemitic behaviour is categorically denied”.In his broadcast interview, Farage changed tack and appeared to admit to saying things that could be construed as prejudiced today. But he denied any “intent” to inflict hurt on people due to their race or religion.He said: “Have I said things 50 years ago that you could interpret as being banter in a playground, you could interpret in a modern light today in some sort of way? Yes.”He went on to admit that he “probably” had “misspoken in my younger days” and that he hoped he had not said anything that could be construed as racist but that his recollection was imperfect after more than four decades.He denied directly abusing anyone, which he defined as “taking it out on an individual on the basis of who they are or what they are”.He suggested that those who had spoken out were politically motivated and were not “telling the truth”.In a further statement on Tuesday after the Guardian put fresh allegations to him, Farage appeared to change his stance again. “I can tell you categorically that I did not say the things that have been published in the Guardian aged 13, nearly 50 years ago,” he said.He claimed the Guardian wanted to “smear anybody who talks about the immigration issue”.Writing for the Guardian, Ettedgui, who alleges that Farage as a 13-year-old classmate would say “Hitler was right” or “gas them” to him, claimed: “Well, he did directly target me and I can tell you that it did hurt. How did he think it would make me feel? How does he think those who were called Pakis or told to ‘go home’ felt?”Benarroch, who is Jewish and was two years below Farage at school, said he did not get personally targeted by him but that he recalled the abuse allegedly meted out to Ettedgui.“He was such a gentle soul and Farage – Farage made his life a fucking nightmare,” he said.“They could only identify us, because we had to go to this stupid Jewish service in the science labs school. I mean, none of us were remotely religious. They would hang out there. Farage would hang out with his minions. And then they would taunt us as we would leave.”Of Farage’s claim that those who had spoken out were not telling the truth, he believes “this is the oldest of the antisemitic tropes”.He said he considered this was akin to claiming there is a “worldwide Jewish global conspiracy, and in order to have a conspiracy, you have to lie. That is what Reform are accusing us of. It couldn’t get more personal.”Berg,who was in the same year as Farage during O-levels, said he also recalled the abuse of Ettedgui as being direct and designed to hurt.He said: “He definitely had a go at Peter and there were a couple of others he would also have a go at. Me being foreign, because I’m Swedish, he sort of made the point that I was foreign, but didn’t have a go at me, because for a start, I stood up to him. The other guys didn’t. Peter Ettedgui never reacted to him. Farage was a bully, typical, picked on the soft guys who wouldn’t stand up, rise to the bait. That’s the way he worked.“He was nasty, there was no question. [The song] Gas ’em all, I heard him singing it to Ettedgui. I didn’t get it at the time, because Peter didn’t react. Back in the day, you thought it was for him to react.”Oshidar, who was in the same year as Farage, said he recalled the constant name calling, including the use of antisemitic and racial slurs. “The same sort of noise that came out of him every day,” he claimed, adding that he recognised that it was “the language of that time”.He claimed: “He wasn’t the only one saying it. But he was the only one in Dulwich saying it regularly.”Responding to Farage’s denial that he abused anyone directly, he claimed: “No, that’s rubbish. I mean, that’s absolutely rubbish. There’s no question that this happened … Because of who he is now and where he is he will try to deny it. But he can’t. I mean, it’s undeniable.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Putin “will congratulate” and will say: “Mr Trump is a real peace man,” he said.a map of Russian-controlled territory and Russian advancesThe heavily criticized28-point proposalwould require Ukraine to cede the entire Donetsk region to Russia, including areas currently under Ukrainian control. Russia has not fully captured Donetsk.Those territories would become a demilitarized buffer zone internationally recognized as Russian, and the plan would also grantRussiacontrol of Luhansk and Crimea while freezing current battle lines in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.Putin said this month he believed the US plan could serve as the“basis for a final peaceful settlement”, though the Kremlin maintains it has not discussed the proposal in detail with Washington.The revelations come as Trump said on Tuesday he was sending Witkoff to meet with Putin in Moscow, and the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, to meet with the Ukrainians – ahead of a possible White House meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on Friday.“I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages,” Trumpsaid in a Truth Socialpost.The US has pushedUkraineto accept the framework as the foundation for ending the nearly four-year conflict, though Ukrainian officials have insisted they will not recognize Russian control of occupied territories or accept limits on their military forces.The phone conversation took place as Trump’s stance toward Moscow appeared to be hardening. On the same day as the Witkoff-Ushakov call, Trump voiced frustration with Putin’s unwillingness to end the war, saying: “I don’t know why he continues with this war. He just doesn’t want to end that war. And I think it’s making him look very bad.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

And they exceedthe courts minister Sarah Sackman’s interview with the Guardian last week, where she set out a plan to stop criminals “gaming the system”.The MoJ document, circulated in Whitehall earlier this month, reports that crown courts are facing record backlogs, with more than 78,000 cases waiting to be completed.Leveson recommended the government should end jury trial for many serious offences that could be dealt with by a judge alone or sitting with two magistrates. The former judge suggested they would preside over a new intermediate tier of criminal court, which has been called the crown court bench division (CCBD).The deputy prime minister’s decision, according to the leaked MoJ document, is to “go further than Sir Brian’s to achieve maximum impact”.The document,first disclosed by the BBC, said Lammy wanted to “introduce trial by judge alone for cases involving fraud and financial offences – if the judge considers the case to be suitably technical and lengthy. Exclusions for rape, murder, manslaughter and public interest”.The CCBD would be introduced “as a lower tier of the crown court which hears cases likely to receive a sentence of up to five years by a judge alone”, the document said.This means that, while jury trials would be guaranteed for murder, manslaughter and rape, almost all other defendants facing serious offences would be tried by a judge alone.The document was distributed among ministers as part of the write round, when ministers obtain final signoff from other government departments before going public with a policy.The Law Society of England and Wales’s president, Mark Evans, who represents thousands of solicitors, said the proposals were an “extreme measure” that go “far beyond” Leveson’s recommendations.“This is a fundamental change to how our criminal justice system operates and it goes too far. Our society’s concept of justice rests heavily on lay participation in determining a person’s guilt or innocence.“We have not seen any real evidence that expanding the types of cases heard by a single judge will work to reduce the backlogs,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The cause is the systematic underfunding and neglect that has been perpetrated by this government and its predecessors.”The proposals represent a U turn on Lammy’s past views. In a social media comment posted five years ago, he said: “Trials are a fundamental part of our democratic settlement. Criminal trials without juries are a bad idea.”An MoJ spokesperson said: “No final decision has been taken by government. We have been clear there is a crisis in the courts, causing pain and anguish to victims – with 78,000 cases in the backlog and rising – which will require bold action to put right.”The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, also criticised the plans. She said: “It is a short-term decision that risks fairness, undermines public trust, and erodes the very foundation of our justice system.”The Liberal Democrats’ justice spokesperson, Jess Brown-Fuller, described the reports as “completely disgraceful” and accused ministers of dismantling the justice system and failing victims.Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justiceDavid LammynewsShareReuse this content"

But if they exceed this limit, even by as little as 1p, they must repay that entire week’s carer’s allowance.Under the “cliff edge” earnings rules, this means someone who oversteps the threshold by as little as 1p a week for a year must repay not 52p but £4,331.60, plus a £50 civil penalty.Liz Sayce, a disability rights expert and the author of the review, called the DWP’s handling of the carer’s allowance a “longstanding injustice” and said the scale of the problem, and the repeated failure to heed warnings or fix issues, was “entirely unacceptable”.New DWP statistics published by the review show that 180,000 carers ran up overpayment debts of £300m between 2019 and 2025, despite promises to fix the system. “The DWP has failed to act systematically … and take actions that could have stemmed these overpayments,” the review concluded.One in five carers who claimed carer’s allowance and worked part-time were hit with an overpayment between 2019 and 2024, the report found. More than 852 carers who ran up overpayments were passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for criminal sanction.Sayce highlighted the human impact of the failures on carers, mainly women on low incomes who care for disabled children or elderly parents. Evidence found carers contemplated suicide, and felt shame and mental distress. Sayce said being caught in the system was like being “at the whim of a faceless machine”.Sayce added: “This shame is experienced as the polar opposite of the recognition carer’s allowance aims to offer to unpaid carers who are regularly described by the government as ‘unsung heroes’.”She cited an unpaid carer who described the predicament faced by carers trying to navigate the carer’s allowance system as “like playing a game where only one side knows the rules”.The review was triggered after aGuardian investigationrevealed how carers had been unfairly hit with draconian penalties of as much as £20,000 after unknowingly running up overpayments of the carer’s allowance.Although the government has announcedit will carry out a reassessmentof a decade of overpayments to identify instances where debts can be cancelled or reduced, politicians and carers on Tuesday demanded the DWP formally apologise and compensate carers whose lives were shattered by the scandal.The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said: “The government and Conservative ministers should apologise to the tens of thousands of carers who were treated so disgracefully in the last parliament, having ignored all the evidence that this was a failing, broken system, out of step with the law.”Andrea Tucker, a former unpaid carer who successfully had her£4,600 overpayment quashedby a social security tribunal earlier this year, said: “I’m concerned there has been no official apology. The stress and anxiety the DWP put many unpaid carers through warrants compensation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They included:The writing off and refunding of potentially hundreds of millions of pounds of overpayments that were issued as a result of flawed and unclear DWP guidance.An end to the criminal prosecution for fraud of all but the most serious cases.Ministers should consider a full review of carer’s allowance, an outdated benefit that is “ever less fit for purpose”.Sayce paid tribute to the “invaluable” role of carers, carers’ charities, DWP whistleblowers, and journalists in bringing the carer’s allowance scandal to the policy forefront.The review will heap pressure on Sir Peter Schofield, the DWP permanent secretary whotold MPs in 2019he would fix carer’s allowance problems, promising that the introduction of then new data-matching technology would stop overpayments “in some cases before they happen”.However, Sayce found the technology heralded by Schofield was underoptimised and understaffed, its main use being to hit benefits spending reduction targets and other internal DWP performance measures rather than prevent overpayments. The number of people with outstanding overpayment debt actually rose 71% between 2018 and 2024.It said the DWP had failed to “grip” the problem of overpayments. “The … DWP has failed to demonstrate the ministerial and senior focus needed to resolve these persistent injustices and reform carer’s allowance to implement its core purposes in the modern world,” it said.The review highlighted how the “cliff edge” design of carer’s allowance penalties resulted in carers rapidly and unwittingly building up big overpayments. Sayce urged “quick, imaginative and fair solutions” to the problem.A spokesperson forCarersUK said: “It’s absolutely right that the government has taken the bold move of owning up to the mistakes of the DWP, which it largely inherited from the last Government.“Liz Sayce OBE, who led the independent review has really listened to us and to unpaid carers, and delivered an incredibly detailed report.“We also want to pay tribute to the work that the Guardian and other media outlets have done in bringing this issue to public attention.Explore more on these topicsCarersCarer's allowance crisisSocial careConservativesWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

The corporation has already received complaints about the decision.“TheBBChas decided to censor my first Reith lecture,” he said. “They deleted the line in which I describe Donald Trump as ‘the most openly corrupt president in American history’.“This sentence was taken out of a lecture they commissioned, reviewed through the full editorial process, and recorded four weeks ago in front of 500 people in the BBC Radio Theatre. I was told the decision came from the highest levels within the BBC.”The BBC isunder pressure from the White Houseafter Trump threatened tosue it for up to $5bn(£3.8bn) overan edit of one of his speechesby an edition of Panorama. A row over the edit ultimately led tothe resignationsof its director general, Tim Davie, and the BBC News chief, Deborah Turness.The BBC has apologised for the edit, which spliced two parts of Trump’s speech on the day of the Capitol riots in January 2021. However, it is arguing that it did not defame the US president and is not seeking to settle the case with him.Bregman said he was told a week ago that the claim was being examined by US lawyers, before being told on Monday it would be edited out. The BBC confirmed it removed the comment after seeking legal advice. The lecture is broadcast in the US on the BBC’s World Service.Davie faced immediate calls to run the full version of the speech.“At a moment when the defence of free speech and democratic norms is more important than ever, we need the BBC to demonstrate that it will not be cowed by the White House’s bullyboy tactics and tantrums,” wrote Anna Sabine, the Liberal Democrats’ culture spokesperson, in a letter to the outgoing director general. “I am therefore asking you to broadcast Mr Bregman’s speech in full.”View image in fullscreenA BBC spokesperson said the corporation made the decision to remove one sentence from the lecture on legal advice.Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/ShutterstockBregman, who has previously said the US could be on the verge of an “authoritarian breakthrough”, said the edit of his speech had been made “against my wishes” and left him “genuinely dismayed”.“Not because people can’t disagree with my words, but because self-censorship driven by fear (Trump threatening to sue the BBC) should concern all of us,” he said. “It’s especially ironic because the lecture is exactly about the ‘paralysing cowardice’ of today’s elites.“About universities, corporations and media networks bending the knee to authoritarianism. I share this with respect for the many excellent journalists at the BBC. And with the hope that transparency helps strengthen, not weaken, our democratic culture.”A BBC spokesperson said:“All of our programmes are required to comply with the BBC’s editorial guidelines, and we made the decision to remove one sentence from the lecture on legal advice.”Approached by the Guardian, Bregman said: “I’m really sad about it. The whole team behind the Reith Lectures was incredible.“And it was such an honour to deliver them, especially because the first Reith Lectures in 1948 were delivered by my intellectual hero Bertrand Russell, who was a huge advocate of free speech.“I still hope lots of people will listen to the lectures. Because it seems to me that the message, about the cowardice of today’s elites, is more relevant than ever.”Bregman, who sprung to prominence in 2019 witha speech at the World Economic Forumin Davos in which he challenged attenders over tax avoidance, had been invited to give a series of lectures entitled Moral Revolution. They were recorded in London, Liverpool, Edinburgh and the US last month.He later challenged the BBC over its explanation for cutting the corruption remark. “The edit was made at the last minute, after editorial approval and four weeks after the live recording,” he said. “A standard editorial edit doesn’t require days of high-level legal review or the involvement of many people at top level.“The truth is that the sentence wasn’t inaccurate – it was removed because of legal fears. And that’s exactly the concern my lecture raises: when institutions start censoring themselves out of fear of those in power.”Explore more on these topicsBBCRutger BregmanDonald TrumpFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

On average, their lives were 4.6 years shorter, he said.Every decade has its list of stars whose lives were bright but brief: the 2010s alone count Amy Winehouse, Whitney Houston, Prince, George Michael and Keith Flint. But when famous singers die young, the media attention is fierce. For this reason, examples came easily to mind, Dufner said. “What about the rock stars who live quietly until their old age?”To investigate whether fame had a bearing on the risk of early death, Dufner and his colleagues identified 324 famous soloists or lead singers and matched them with less famous musicians of the same age, gender, nationality, ethnicity and musical genre. To ensure a reasonable number of deaths, they focused on artists who were active between 1950 and 1990.Most of the singers were white male rockers from the US. Only 19% were black and 16.5% were female. The oldest was born in 1910 and the youngest in 1975. More than half were in bands.When the researchers looked at who had died, and at what age, a clear trend emerged: famous singers typically reached the age of 75, while their less famous counterparts, on average, lived to 79. Band membership was linked to a 26% lower risk of death compared with going solo, but overall, famous singers were still 33% more likely to have died in the years studied than their less famous matches.The greater risk of death emerged only after singers had shot to fame, reinforcing the suspicion that fame itself was a cause of early death. Details are published in theJournal of Epidemiology & Community Health.Dufner said more work was needed to understand how fame could drive singers to an early grave. The endless public scrutiny, the loss of privacy, the pressure to perform and the normalisation of drink and drug abuse were likely to have an impact, he said. But there may be other factors, such as temperament or bad experiences in childhood driving people who were already at risk to seek out fame.Asked what the stars of today should do, Dufner said it was important to appreciate how unhealthy the touring lifestyle could be, with readily available drugs and deep isolation from close friends and family. He said: “A good measure against these could be to take a step back regularly,” meet family and old friends, and “critically evaluate one’s lifestyle”.Dr Sally Anne Gross, a reader at the University of Westminster and co-author of the 2020 book Can Music Make You Sick?: Measuring the Price of Musical Ambition, said the work spoke to the hyper-competitive world of music production, which was now dominated by social media and where fame “operates to isolate the individual”. She added: “Fame, it would seem, is toxic.”“We can certainly do better, but that doesn’t mean it is easy,” she said. “There are many people working within the music industry, from music managers to music executives, who are genuinely trying to improve the working conditions and environment. However, fame presents different challenges. You can’t just go to rehab to give up the habit – it is not in the control of the artist themselves.”Explore more on these topicsScienceCelebrityDrugsMusic industryAlcoholnewsShareReuse this content"

Play our interactive budget gamePhillip InmanTue 25 Nov 2025 10.21 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 15.11 ESTShareEvery chancellor likes to float ideas before a budget to test how they might land with the public.However, the sheer volume of policy ideas floated – and in some cases quickly jettisoned – through the media in the run-up to Wednesday’s Westminster set-piece has set Rachel Reeves’s second budget apart.The speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, called it“the hokey cokey budget”in blasting the chancellor for keeping parliament in the dark while what was likely to be in the budget was debated in the press.Could you do better than Reeves as chancellor? Play our interactive budget gameRead moreHere are the main announcements expected to make the final cut.The financial positionHow much money Reeves can spend without increasing borrowing levels has become a crucial test in this budget. The chancellor wants to borrow cheaply and that means keeping the bond markets onside.With aspending gapestimated between £20bn and £30bn, and no recourse to extra borrowing, closing it will demand some hefty spending cuts or tax rises.Reeves will be guided by the estimates for economic growth provided by the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).Tax and total government receipts chartTax and total government receipts chartIt is understood that a review of investment and productivity by the OBR across the private and public sectors has resulted in a downgrade of the UK economy’s capacity to grow in not just one, buteach of the five years in its forecast.Reeves has tried to persuade OBR officials that her measures to increase investment will turn the situation around. However, the OBR is likely to say the chancellor’s actions are not enough to fully reverse the downgraded trend.Income tax, national insurance and VATThere was a moment when Reeves appeared to have No 10 on side with a plan to increase income tax by 2p, offset by a 2p cut in national insurance to raise about £6bn from higher rate taxpayers.But a backlash from Labour MPs concerned about the chancellor breaching a manifesto promise to leave the main tax rates untouchedscuppered the plan.The aftermath of this row leaves Reeves on courseinsteadto freeze income tax thresholds for a further two years when the current four-year hold lapses next April.Critics argue this move would also effectively be a manifesto breach, but less noticeable in monthly pay packets. Itcould raise £7.5bn a year.The Treasury has also been examining potential changes to VAT. An across-the-board rise would be inflationary and has therefore been ruled out.A cut to VAT applied to household energyfrom 5% to zero had been widely expected as part of a package to tackle thecost of livingbut Reeves has reportedly decided against it, instead opting to remove some levies from electricity bills.Cost of livingThere will be measures to bring down inflation and reduce the cost of living. The chancellor will hope the Bank of England reacts by bringing down interest rates at a faster pace.Reeves is also expected to remove some social and environmental levies from household electricity bills. Those levies would instead be transferred to general taxation.Regulated rail fares – including season tickets – will be frozen, saving commuters on more expensive routes more than £300 a year. Fuel duty will be also be frozen.Living standards will also get a boost at the bottom of the pay scale. The chancellor willraise the national living wage by 4.1% next Aprilto £12.71 an hour. More controversially, the minimum wage for 18-20-year-olds will increase by 8.5% to £10.85 per hour. Businesses and the Resolution Foundation thinktank have argued that will price younger workers out of the jobs market.Property taxesSince the hurried introduction of council tax in 1991, successive governments have been urged to overhaul Britain’s property taxes.View image in fullscreenReeves is expected to revalue about 2.4m of the highest-value homes in the UK.Photograph: Kathy deWitt/AlamyReeves has hinted that she could be the first chancellor in more than 30 years to bite the bullet. First in line is council tax.A complete overhaul has been ruled out. Instead,the chancellor is expected to propose revaluing the top three bands– F, G and H – to bring in extra tax revenues, raising about £400m to £450m for the Treasury.This move – dubbed a “mansion tax” and applicable to home worth more than £2m – will involve revaluing about 2.4m of the highest-value homes.Council tax bands chartCouncil tax bands chartMore than 100,000 of themost valuable properties would be subject to the charge, which is expected to use an escalator with different bands depending on the value of the property, the Times has reported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last year, Reeves changed the inheritance tax rules to bring pension payments within its scope. Farmers and business owners were also taxed on their inherited assets for the first time in more than 40 years.The chancellor is expected to go further by capping the value of gifts, which are now unlimited. The level of the cap is not known, but is expected to include a shortening ofthe seven-year rule.At the moment, there is a sliding scale of tax rates from zero at seven years before death to 40% at death. Shortening the taper to three years could bring in millions of pounds of extra revenue.The standard IHT rate is 40%, and it is charged only on the part of the estate that is above the tax-free threshold – now £325,000 for an individual.It is also possible that an extra £175,000 for those inheriting property assets, which is added to the £325,000 IHT threshold, could be scrapped. At the moment, this allowance can be applied to those leaving their main home to a direct descendant.A long-mooted tax on those who sell their UK assets before leaving for foreign shores – a settlingup charge – could raise £4bn when combined with an end to the practice of forgiving estates due to pay capital gains tax on assets that have increased in value.PensionsIt is understood Reeves has backed away from reducing or scrapping the pension lump sum, which allows savers to withdraw a quarter of their retirement savings tax-free up to a limit of almost £270,000.There is likely to be a cap on salary sacrifice schemesthat allow workers to make tax-free pension contributions, which could raise as much as £4bn.The employee and employer would need to pay national insurance on direct purchases above a £2,000 cap from their net salary, making the scheme less attractive.Savings and investmentsAdults are now allowed to put up to £20,000 a year in a tax-free Isa, but Reevescould cut this to £12,000, allowing her to tap some of the £300bn Isa market.The chancellor could also reduce the tax-free allowance on dividend income and increase the tax applied to dividend income.Dividends held outside an Isa could suffer a rate increase and a cut to the £500 tax-free allowance. Company directors who supplement a minimal salary with dividend income, which is taxed at a much lower rate, would be a target.Other possible tax changesFor some time, the Treasury has examined a tax on electric car drivers, witha 3p a-mile tax on EV driversmooted to be in the budget.View image in fullscreenElectric car drivers could face a new 3p-a-mile tax.Photograph: William Barton/AlamyGordon Brown has lobbied foran increase in gambling taxes, arguing that the extra revenue should be used to remove the two-child benefit cap. The former prime minister said higher taxes on slot machines and other parts of the gambling industry could raise £3bn. In response to warnings ofbetting shop closures and job losses, Reeves isexpectedto favour a more modest £1bn to £1.5bn increase.A taxi tax on private hire vehicles is also expected to feature in the budget, raising up to £750m.The government has already confirmed amilkshake taxto bring milk-based products into the sugar tax regime from 2028, adding about £100m to tax receipts.Local councils have also beengiventhe green light to levya tourism taxon hotel stays and Airbnb-style rentals in England, matching similar taxes in Scotland and Wales.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025EconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That compared with a 38.6% rate in Frankfurt and 27.9% in New York.Bosses also argued that a tax rise could force them to curb lending andcancel out the benefits of the chancellor’s Leeds reforms, which were launched this summer with the aim of spurring growth by cutting the regulatory burden for banks and the UK’s wider financial sector.Banksfelt they had largely won the argumentuntil it emerged earlier this month that the Treasury had abandoned plans to increase income tax rates in what would amount to a breach of Labour’s manifesto pledge. The Guardian understands that as recently as last week, the Treasury had left some banks fearing a sector-specific tax was back on the cards.A story overnight by the Financial Times, suggesting the Treasury had asked for positive soundings in the budget amid expectation they would be spared a tax raid, has again eased those fears.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Positive Money said it had gathered 68,749 signatures supporting a windfall tax on bank profits. It claimed that a 38% charge, on par with the windfall tax applied to energy companies, could bring in more than £14bn for Treasury coffers.Simon Opher, the Labour MP for Stroud who is helping deliver the petition to Downing Street, said:“This week’s budget is an opportunity to restore the public services that form the backbone of our society, but are no longer working for ordinary people after years of being cut to the bone.“Recouping the huge payments that are being made from the public to the banking sector is a fair and commonsense way to fund this, and will only strengthen our economy by allowing us to invest more in health, education and communities.“I urge the government to listen to the thousands of members of the public who have signed this petition and are calling to make our economy fairer.”Explore more on these topicsBankingStock marketsBudget 2025Tax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, the fact that we are told the existence of gambling firms is on a financial knife-edge, while they simultaneouslyplough billions into advertising, does not come as a surprise.”The gambling industry has been lobbying the Treasury in an apparent effort to persuade Rachael Reeves to shy away from announcing large rises in a range of betting duties during her set-piece speech to the Commons on Wednesday.The industry has the backing of some powerful supporters, with the Sun running a campaign calledSave Our Bets. Last week, the tabloid reported that Joanne Whittaker, the chief executive of the bookmaking chain Betfred, had argued that even a modest increase tomachine games duty– levied on machines located in premises that give cash prizes such as slot and quiz machines – would have a“devastating impact”and significantly cut the industry’s tax contribution, rather than contribute more revenue to the Treasury.Betfred has said it wouldclose all 1,287 of its high street betting shopsif Reeves raised taxes on the gambling industry. Evoke, the company behindWilliam Hill, also said last month it was consideringclosing up to 200 betting shopsif the chancellor raised taxes on the sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The number of AGCs fell slightly during the year from 1,451 to 1,415, while the total number of premises – which include betting shops, bingo halls and casinos – edged down from 8,328 to 8,234.The Betting and Gaming Council warned that the regulator’s latest figures masked “a mixed picture” in the sector, where high street operations such as betting shops had reported more than 30 closures during the current quarter.A spokesperson for the industry body said: “These statistics also do not capture recent regulatory changes, which will have a major impact on growth and jobs, including a new £100m levy to fund research, prevention and treatment to tackle problem gambling and gambling related harm, and new financial vulnerability checks introduced in February.“BGC members generate £6.8bn for the economy, contribute over £4bn in tax and support 109,000 jobs, while sustaining local economies and sports.

It describes how some felt so “overwhelmed”, ashamed and criminalised they considered killing themselves.One even investigated whether their fine would be cancelled if they died, only to find the government would still chase their family.The year-long independent review, sparked by a Guardianinvestigation, describes in brutal detail how those who have selflessly given up their lives to care for loved ones – saving the state anestimated £184bna year – have been criminalised by a policy riddled with “systemic flaws” and a culture that assumed “negligence as a default”.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has vowed to review a decade’s worth of carer’s allowance overpayments as a result. There was, however, no official apology or offer of compensation. Here are the key takeaways from Sayce’s report.Devastating impact on carersIn interviews with the Guardian over the past 18 months, unpaid carers have described how they were made to feel like criminals by the DWP, shamed into accepting responsibility for an error that – as made clear by theSayce report– was not their fault.Nearly three-quarters of the 1 million people who claim £83.30 a week in carer’s allowance are women. Claimants are disproportionately in poverty and 40% are struggling with their own mental or physical health while caring for their loved one. In other words, they are highly vulnerable.One carer told the inquiry team they “lost weight, I couldn’t sleep” after being told to pay back money to the DWP; another didn’t tell their own family. “I felt so shocked. I felt shame,” they said. Another felt like the government was “kicking them when they are already down”.This had a direct effect on the health of the carer and those they look after. Some felt so pushed to breaking point that the local authority had to take over the care, at a cost to the state.It damaged family relationships, Sayce said, citing one carer who said their mother “began to feel like a burden”. Those being looked after “still felt this weight of worry up to the point of their death”, she added.The ‘benefits trap’ ruthlessly designed to hit internal targetsOne element of carer’s allowance was ruthlessly efficient. Officials had access to near real-time alerts – known as the verify earnings and pensions (VEP) alerts service – that pinged whenever a carer breached their weekly earnings allowance.In an effective system, these would be investigated swiftly and the carer notified and the breach brought to an end. But inside the DWP, officials calculated they only needed to investigate half of these alerts in order to hit their internal targets for preventing fraud. So the decision not to act on these alerts was deliberate, not a policy flaw.In real terms, this meant that 230,400 unpaid carers who earned more than the weekly allowance between 2018 and 2024 – and were therefore at risk of unknowingly amassing an enormous debt – were not notified until months or years later. One carer had been on the VEP database for five years without any action.Peter Schofield, the DWP’s most powerful civil servant,told MPs in 2019that the department was solving the problem of these overpayments. Yet until recently, still only half of these alerts were being checked.One of the most shocking elements of carer’s allowance is the brutal “cliff edge”, whereby those who overstep the weekly earnings limit by as little as 1p must pay back the entire week’s benefit. This means someone who oversteps the threshold by as little as 1p a week for a year must repay not 52p but £4,331.60, plus a £50 civil penalty.Sayce was unequivocal that ministers should “remove or reduce the impact” of the cliff edge urgently. The DWP is considering ways to do this, but warned that any policy fix would take time.How unpaid carers were treated as criminals by defaultThe review illustrates how unpaid carers were “disproportionately” treated by the DWP as guilty before being proven innocent. “Rather than being penalised where negligence is demonstrated, the approach assumes negligence as a default,” Sayce found.Sayce, by contrast, found the overwhelming majority of overpayments were a result of official error rather than “wilful rule-breaking”. This echoes a report by MPs six years ago, which concluded that for the most part unpaid carers were being penalised for “honest mistakes”.The report reveals how claimants of carer’s allowance are hit with more £50 civil penalties than recipients of any other benefit including universal credit, despite there being eight times fewer unpaid carers than the number receiving that benefit.In total, 852 unpaid carers were referred by the DWP for criminal prosecution in the six years to 2024, with a further 1,510 landed with fines of up to £5,000 (which they must pay in addition to their overpayment). Sayce said these should end for all but the most serious deliberate contraventions.Outdated and disjointed: a failing system laid bareFirst introduced in 1976, carer’s allowance is the benefit that time forgot. It is, Sayce said, “an outdated benefit [that] has become ever less fit for purpose” – incompatible with an era of zero-hours jobs and irregular working patterns, and at odds with a time when millions more people provide unpaid care for a population that is both ageing and living longer due to medical advances.Set this against the “inconsistent and unclear” way the DWP treats carers’ earnings, with “outdated” technology being used by a disjointed department, and you have what one carer described as a “benefit trap”.Even DWP officials appeared unclear on the rules; when one civil servant was asked by a carer whether private pensions contributions were allowed as an expense, they reportedly replied: “Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. Depends who you get.”What the DWP will – and won’t – change as a resultIn its37-page responseto Sayce’s report, the DWP promised to review decisions relating to approximately 185,000 unpaid carers spanning 10 years to 2025. These will, however, be limited to those in which the carer might not have been penalised had the government assessed their average earnings.The department, still led by Schofield, said it was “considering longer-term reforms” to modernise carer’s allowance – including replacing the punitive “cliff edge” with a fairer system tapered towards a carer’s earnings.Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, said the DWP had accepted the vast majority of Sayce’s 40 recommendations. He added: “We inherited this mess from the previous government, but we’ve listened to carers, commissioned an independent review, and are now making good for those affected. Rebuilding trust isn’t about warm words – it’s about action, accountability, and making sure our support works for the people who need it most.”Explore more on these topicsCarersCarer's allowance crisisBenefitsWelfareSocial carenewsShareReuse this content"

They were a gift toRichard Dannatt, the former head of the British army, who a few months earlier had introduced the company’s executives to the minister for Africa. It was a move they hoped would smooth the way for the fledgling company’s grand plans to build a £500m hydroelectric dam.With support from the UK government, the company had a better chance of getting the dam built. The dam, they said, would bring much-needed cheap electricity to many people in Sierra Leone. But it could also bring profits to the company, and Dannatt was not only to receive flowers and upmarket produce, he was also given shares.The energy company was not the only firm for which Dannatt had greased the wheels. After 40 years of armed service, during which he was awarded the Military Cross at the age of 22, the former general set himself up as a consultant, offering his services to clients that include a US defence contractor, a lobbying company advising the Armenian government and a bidder launching a takeover of a fertiliser factory.At issue though is that, freshly decommissioned in 2009, Dannatt had also taken up two new posts. The first was the largely ceremonial role of constable of the Tower of London. That gave him the Queen’s House, a grace-and-favour apartment in one of the most iconic buildings in London.The second, a peerage awarded by David Cameron, gave him a seat in parliament for life.No doubt, for Dannatt, the roles meant that even in retirement he could continue to serve his country. They also gave him access to those in power – access, the Guardian revealed, he has been all too happy to use.After an eight-month investigation, the House of Lords committee made a remarkable ruling earlier this week. The man who told the Guardian he had “always acted on my personal honour” has been found to have broken the rules four times since 2022 and will besuspended from parliament for four months.The punishment, according to the Lords’ watchdog, was justified not only because he had broken the rules repeatedly, but also because a peer who had sat in parliament for a long time had failed to understand one of its code’s key principles – a peer cannot lobby for payment.View image in fullscreenLord Dannatt at his former home, the Queen’s House at the Tower of London, his grace-and-favour residence.Photograph: Chris Winter/ShutterstockFlowers in the towerIt was January 2011 when Dannatt, robed in ermine, was introduced to a hushedHouse of Lordsas Baron Dannatt. Within the year he was using his position to help Joule Africa, the Anglo-American company selected to manage the £500m hydroelectric project.He set up the meeting with company executives and the minister for Africa in September 2011. The minister heard from the company about its work and asked them what more the government could do to help. They said they were looking at Cameroon. The minister put them in touch with the British high commissioner there. A few months later, in December, Dannatt was invited to join the advisory board, and was given shares in the company rather than a salary.Introductions, it would seem, are what the former general has to offer.Years after the meeting with the minister for Africa, Joule had been acquired by another company, Blue International, and in January 2024, it had a problem with its goldmine in Ghana. In stepped Dannatt again. He wrote to thetop British official there to ask for her help“on a commercial matter that, although beneficial for the company concerned, is in the UK national interest”. In turn, according to Dannatt, the high commissioner raised the matter with the Ghanaian government “with a satisfactory outcome”.Now the Lords’ commissioner for standards has found that Dannatt’s recent intervention on behalf of Blue International was exactly the sort of special access to government the House of Lords rules prohibit. And it was what Dannatt brazenly offered to two undercover Guardian reporters earlier this year, after being approached to be a paid member of a fake company’s advisory board.Speaking from his home office, his arms tightly crossed, Dannatt bragged how he could “easily rub shoulders with people” in Westminster and how he would find the right person for the fake property developer to lobby. “Without any guarantees that I could magically open doors,” he said, “one could probably help facilitate a conversation”.Lords rules and culture make it easy for peers to abuse privileged positionRead moreThe property developer’s work would have to align with the best interests of the country, he was keen to stress. The problem was he was also keen that it aligned with his interests too, pressing upon the undercover reporters he was not intending to make introductions for free. An offer of between £1,800 and £2,800 a day was, he said, “a ballpark I recognise”.His statements to the undercover reporters, ruled the Lords watchdog, broke the fundamental principle of the house: that peers should “always act on their personal honour”. It is not just the spirit of the rules Dannatt has trampled on. Though he was found not to have broken lobbying rules by offering his services to the undercover reporters as he did not receive a payment, it was a different matter when it came to the useful conversations he had facilitated for many of his clients.View image in fullscreenDavid Cameron awarded Dannatt a seat in the House of Lords.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAn honourable manWorking for a consortium, UK Nitrogen, seeking to take over a factory facing closure in 2022, Dannatt stepped in. The consortium needed the government to provide £10m in financial support.His plan of attack was simple.First, he contacted a minister he knew in the business department to ask if he could be put in touch with the relevant minister. An introduction was made.Next, he contacted a senior official in the department to seek a meeting. He made clear in an email his “intervention is to elevate the discussion to ministerial level”. The meeting was organised.Then he met the minister, bringing his business partner in the consortium.Though the government ultimately refused to support the bid and the deal collapsed, Dannatt received four payments, which he described to the Guardian as “honorariums”, refusing to say how much they were. It turns out he was paid a total of £8,000, payment the commissioner found in all likelihood took into account the access “undoubtedly facilitated by Lord Dannatt’s status as a parliamentarian”.Of arms and the manThey attacked the factory with sledgehammers, paint and smoke grenades, clad in red boiler suits, and unfurled their banner: Palestine Action. The December 2022 protest was at a factory in north Wales operated by a subsidiary of the US defence company Teledyne.Earlier that year, Dannatt had joined Teledyne’s advisory board. Palestine Action’s attack gave the old warhorse an opportunity to show them his worth in defending the company.In January 2023, at the instigation of a senior US Teledyne executive, Dannatt wrote to the home secretary,once again in breach of the rules. The letters were grandly headed: “General the Lord Dannatt GCB CBE MC DL”, addressed from the House of Lords.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ever aware of the chain of command, he said he had “undertaken to brief the Teledyne main board in the United States that the threat from Palestine Action in the UK is being suitably addressed”.After further attacks on Teledyne facilities, Dannatt contacted ministers again in September 2024 at the behest of company executives.Both times, he said in his letters to ministers that he was a member of Teledyne’s advisory board. But the rules do not permit lobbying even if you have said you have been paid to do so.What are the House of Lords rules – and what happens if they are broken?Read moreWhen the activists who had attacked the Teledyne factory were prosecuted, the court heard a concerning allegation: that the peer had sought to influence the criminal investigation into them.The court heard that shortly after the protest, the police officer in charge of the investigation had emailed his superiors to say that a senior Teledyne executive had “spoken to Lord Richard Dannatt about Palestine Action”.The officer wrote: “Essentially there have been an indication that he wants this case to be explained and he wants to have some input on it. They haven’t explained exactly what he wants, however I have told them that it would not be wise to have a member of the House of Lords poking around in a live criminal case.”Under cross-examination from a defence barrister, the officer was asked if he was concerned that Dannatt was seeking to have some input into a live criminal investigation. He replied: “Yeah, to a certain extent, yes.”The barrister then asked: “And you thought that that was inappropriate … and you told [Teledyne] as much?” The officer replied: “Yes.”Dannatt said he was completely unaware of the exchanges in the trial and said the allegations were “baseless”. These allegations were not considered by the Lords commissioner.Fool me once …Dannatt’s work for Joule Africa, Teledyne and UK Nitrogen clearly demonstrates the value of having a lord on the board, especially one prepared to use the position to open doors for those clients.But something else lingered over the meeting with theGuardian’s undercover reporters, from his defensive opening, arms crossed, to his closing remark: “I don’t expect to see any of this in the Sunday Telegraph on Sunday.”In 2012, a few months after he was sent flowers and a hamper by Joule Africa, two more visitors came to his grace-and-favour apartment in the Tower of London, a house steeped in history: Anne Boleyn was led out to execution from those rooms.They were undercover journalists from the Sunday Times. They wanted him to join their advisory board to promote a new defence product. They secretly filmed the peer as he suggested it sounded like “an intelligence-gathering role and connection-making role”.For this, he would be paid £100,000-a-year for one to two days a month. In exchange, he would speak to officials in charge of procurement. He told them of a specific example he had lined up to have dinner with his old school friend at a banquet. That old friend happened to be the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence.When the story was published, the result was outrage and an investigation by the Lords standards watchdog. On the basis there was no evidence he had used his parliamentary role to actually lobby, he was cleared of wrongdoing.The problem for Dannatt is, this time, the Lords commissioner for standards has not cleared him.Responding to the report, Dannatt said: “I deeply regret the commissioner’s findings regarding my personal honour and I decided that the honourable course of action was not to waste the conduct committee’s time by appealing against the findings but to accept the appropriate sanction.”He added: “I also understand that acting in the national interest in good faith … is not an excuse or justification for breaching the code of conduct. At nearly 75 no one is too old to learn lessons and I hope that these activities will be placed in the context of my 56 years’ public service.”In recommending a four-month sanction – a hefty punishment – the conduct committee said: “The sheer number of Lord Dannatt’s improper interactions with ministers or officials, and their duration over a period of two years, justify a significant sanction.”Additional reporting: Rob DaviesQuick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The independent committee, which advises ministers, is under pressure to allow testing to begin of those men at highest risk: black men, those with a family history of prostate, breast or cervical cancer and men who carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.What is prostate cancer, what are its symptoms and which groups are most at risk?Prostate cancerdevelops in the prostate gland.It is thesecond most commoncancer in the UK, after breast cancer, with about 55,300 new diagnoses and 12,200 deaths every year. It is the most common male cancer. Almost 80% of men diagnosed with it survive for at least 10 years.It often does not have any symptoms in its early stages. But changes in men’s urination habits – for example, needing to pee more often, including overnight – can indicate its presence, as can erectile dysfunction.It mainly affects men over 50. But three groups of men are most at risk: black men; those with a family history of prostate cancer, or breast or ovarian cancer in female relatives; and men who are carrying the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene variants.Black men are twice as likely both to get it and also to die from it. A quarter of black men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetimes, compared with one in eight of the general male population.Black men in England are alsomore likely to be diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer than their white counterparts. Socioeconomic circumstances and genetics are believed to be contributing factors for that greatly increase risk.How is prostate cancer detected?All men over 50 can request a PSA test to check if they have prostate cancer. Those men, and those in the higher risk groups, can talk to their GP about the pros and cons of having the test.GPs no longer need to assess a man’s prostate via a rectal exam. Men deemed at a higher risk have historically been offered a biopsy, in which a needle was inserted into their prostate.A PSA test checks the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. Other conditions can cause a raised PSA level, including an enlarged prostate and prostatitis, not just prostate cancer.Unlike smear tests for cervical cancer and mammograms for breast cancer, the PSA test is not a test per se for prostate cancer. It is useful, but not definitive.Although any man can ask their GP for a test, and GPs will usually refer anyone over 50 who requests one, routine PSA testing is not offered on the NHS. This is because blanket PSA testing could lead to overdiagnosis of prostate cancer and result in men undergoing unnecessary biopsies and invasive treatment, including surgical removal of the prostate.For example, some studies have shown thatblack men may have higher PSA levels than their white counterparts, and that using the PSA test in men with no prostate symptoms does not reduce the number of prostate cancer deaths.Why doesn’t the NHS screen men for prostate cancer?The UK routinely screens people for breast, bowel and cervical cancer, but not prostate cancer, despite its prevalence.Screening for it is not as straightforward as for the other cancers because of the historic weaknesses in the PSA test – the likelihood of both false positives and false negatives – and historic lack of alternative methods of screening.The UK national screening committee (NSC), independent experts who advise ministers, is due to decide on Thursday if the NHS should start screening either all men, or those in some or all three of the higher-risk groups, for the disease.It has come under intense pressure in recent months to rethink its position on screening. It has spent months collecting and analysing evidence.Charities such as Prostate Cancer UK and Prostate Cancer Research say the NSC should approve at least targeted screening of men in the three higher-risk groups. Doing so would detect more cases and thus save more lives, they say.Lithuania (2006), Kazakhstan (2013) and Sweden (2020) have already introduced screening for many or all male citizens aged at least 50.What are the arguments for and against targeted prostate cancer screening?Prostate Cancer Research insists recent advances in diagnostic testing mean that screening could be introduced with far fewer risks than those the PSA test involves.Men could be safely screened using a PSA test, followed by a pre-biopsy MRI scan – “which rules out cancer in a large proportion of cases” – and then, if needed, a transperineal biopsy, thus sparing many of them the rigours and risk of a traditional biopsy.“The core safety objection to screening has fundamentally been engineered out of the system,” it says.Prostate Cancer UK says it will respect the decision of the NSC's evidence review, but that medical advances had made screening safer than ever before.“We believe the evidence shows that screening men at highest risk is safe and more beneficial than the harms that might come from the screening programme,” said Chiara De Biase, its director of health services, equity and improvement.“Pre-biopsy MRI improves the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer and reduces the risk of diagnosing cancers that don’t need treatment. We hope the committee agrees and we urgently await the outcome,” the charity says.However, others, notably Cancer Research UK, maintain that there is still too much “conflicting evidence” around screening to justify even a targeted programme. “The evidence is still very unclear on targeted screening,” says CRUK’s Naser Turabi.What could a prostate cancer screening programme look like?TheTRANSFORM prostate cancer screening trialmay provide the answer. The £42m trial is the biggest and most ambitious prostate cancer screening trial for 20 years.It is intended to discover the most effective and least harmful methods to screen the UK’s adult male population and catch the disease in its early stages. Three hundred thousand men will be recruited to the trial.It is led by Prostate Cancer UK and is due to report in 2027. The NSC has agreed to look again at prostate cancer screening in the light of TRANSFORM’s findings. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is covering £16m of the £42m cost.The study will also look at how current testing methods, including PSA blood tests, genetic spit tests and MRI scans, can be used more effectively when screening for the disease.Dr Sam Merriel, of the Centre for Primary Care and Health Services Research at the University of Manchester, said: “Better evidence using modern approaches to prostate cancer screening that incorporate the latest tests, including prostate MRI and genetic testing, is urgently needed to find better ways to screen for prostate cancer than relying on PSA alone.”Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerCancerHealthexplainersShareReuse this content"

The menu also features the right buzzwords, such as “small plates” and “wood grill”.But first comes “snacks”. There are classics: focaccia, olives, anchovies on toast. But more creative options include potato flatbreads with creme fraiche and trout roe, mangalitsa saltimbocca with quince, and what became (and has stayed) the Hackney restaurant’s signature dish since around 2012, Isle of Mull cheese puffs: plump, gooey croquettes filled with Scottish cheddar and comté, deep-fried until crisp and topped with yet more grated cheddar. Only two other dishes have never left the menu: fried potatoes with aïoli and cheesecake.View image in fullscreenThe beloved Isle of Mull cheese puffs at Elliot’s in Hackney.Photograph: Harriet LangfordThe puffs were a “happy accident”, says co-owner Samantha Lim. The head chef at the time was experimenting, and decided to chuck the cheesy balls into the deep-fryer. “They bring so much joy,” Lim says. “They’re gooey, a warm hug as soon as you open your mouth and take that first bite oozing with cheese.”View image in fullscreenSamantha Lim of Elliot’s.Photograph: Matthew EadesElliot’s isn’t alone. Today, no self-respecting restaurant opens without a snack menu. Once the preserve of pubs (to keep drinkers drinking) and Michelin-starred restaurants (to show off with tweezery canapes), the modern chef is putting as much effort and creativity into a meal’s opening morsels as the main course – and going far beyond bread and olives. After all, a dinner can be love at first bite.Carbone, a glitzy new Mayfair arrival from New York, offers bowls of bread, charcuterie and crudités.

AtMaré in Hove, meanwhile, you’ll find toasted brioche with liver parfait, preserved cherries and winter truffle.View image in fullscreenYeast puffs at Pip in Manchester.Photograph: Memphis MediumForexperimental psychologist Charles Spence, there are several reasons a restaurant might lean on snacks. It might be that the Ozempic generation doesn’t want full meals, but still wants to dine out. It might be a continuation of the shift towards informality. Or it might just be that fried snacks help waft delicious scents around the dining room. Salty things such as anchovies make us thirsty. Snacks can also grab attention and are associated with socialising.“Snacks have a more informal vibe compared with starters and small plates,” says Zak Hitchman, chef and co-owner of Other. “Although the term has fallen out of fashion, they are perhaps more in line with a canapé.”Informal, small-plates restaurants andwine barshave taken over Britain’s restaurant scene. At these spots, snacks are imperative. And they’re not merely a smaller small plate, Lim says: “In my mind, a snack is a one- or two-bite situation; you can easily pop it in and get the whole essence of it in that one bite. A small plate is a bit more of a discovery, with different components.” Another good signifier is that snacks can be handheld.View image in fullscreenEmma Lyons, co-owner of Bristol’s Other, proffers some plates.Photograph: Seb JJ PetersAlmost every table at Elliot’s orders a snack, and Lim has noticed the trend expanding since Covid. “People are eating more in group settings, and snacks are a fun ice-breaker, particularly for groups who don’t know each other well.” Hitchman, who previously worked at now-closed Michelin-starred Bristol restaurantCasamia, witnessed a similar shift in appetite from formal to informal. As purses have tightened while appetites haven’t, “snacks exist as a way of trying lots of different, interesting flavours and textures, but are usually at the cheaper end of the scale”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

Other is more casual than Hitchman’s previous restaurant, but he believes his background creating extensive tasting menus is suited to one-bite dishes. A current favourite is tempura grey mullet with miso-cured scallop, harissa, fresh blood plum and blood-plum syrup. Certainly cheffy and, while not a typical combination, it offers contrast between crunch, smooth raw scallop, savoury miso, hot harissa and sweet-and-sour plum. Snacks have replaced starters at Other – the menu jumps straight to “bigger plates” – and, according to Hitchman, are many guests’ highlight.View image in fullscreenPotato flatbread with creme fraiche and trout roe at Elliot’s.Photograph: Matthew EadesRestaurants once stuck to the starter-main-dessert formula, but snacks provide flexibility. Everyone we spoke to welcomed guests just for snacks, though many said at peak times they prefer diners to eat a full meal. But at quieter times, restaurateurs would much rather have some customers enjoying a glass of wine and a couple of bites than none at all. And while the ideal guest orders a snack, starter, main, side and dessert, the reality is that many don’t. Being able to offer a range of options therefore makes sense, and can be a chance to upsell: many who order oysters or cheese puffs might still eat a full meal.Snacks can be high margin, too, providing vital income in precarious times. That can come from using cheaper ingredients or offcuts. Elliot’s buys a pig roughly every six weeks, and cuts not used for larger dishes can go into snacks such as pork crackling. Hitchman sources whole crabs for his crab cakes, with the leftover brown meat used for the hot-and-sour brown crab mayonnaise served with the chicken and sesame toast.View image in fullscreenToasted brioche with liver parfait and preserved cherries at Maré in Hove.Photograph: David CharbitOther will soon install a snack-focused bar area, while at Maré bar guests are welcome to have just snacks: “It has been a nice way for people in the neighbourhood to get a feel for us, because we’re still new in the area,” says owner Rafael Cagali. Snacks can also be great advertising. I had never eaten at Elliot’s, but after trying its cheese puffs and potato flatbread, I’ll certainly be back. Ultimately, however, snacks are designed to be fun, Hitchman says: “They can just be a great and enjoyable way of trying a restaurant’s food.”Explore more on these topicsFoodChefsRestaurantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That was loosely based on Gregory Maguire’s 1995 novel, which was a reimagining of L Frank Baum’s 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its 1939 film adaptation starring Judy Garland.I noticed– it’s hard not to. No spoilers, please, I might see it.It’s certain to be massive. And reviews,including the Guardian’s, have largely been positive. But we’re less concerned with its artistic merit, more with the wardrobe department, and one item in particular …Go on.Elphaba’s “sex cardigan”.Who’s calling it that?The internet.Isn’t sex cardigan, like, an oxymoron? And why am I suddenly thinking about my grandparents? Ew …Old people can – and do – have sex too. But again, we’re not concerned about them here.Who’s Elphabathen?The Wicked Witch of the West, played byCynthia Erivo, who has a massive crush on Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey), as has Elphaba’s former-bestie-now-arch-enemy Glinda the Good Witch (Ariana Grande).And Elphaba getsher man?[Warning: bit of a spoiler alert]. She gets him, takes him up to her treehouse hideaway, and … you know …Sexy time?Afraid so, while singing a song called As Long As You’re Mine.And wearing a cardie?[Close your eyes, kids], there is some black lingerie involved, but the cardigan goes on top.Almost as if to say: you can open your eyes again, children?Well, there has been some speculation that that was what Chu was thinking, and a PG rating means more bums on cinema seats and so more money at the box office.Or just tapping into thetrend for winter knitwear?Elphaba’s doesn’t have a lot in common with any ofVogue’s seasonal choices(primary-coloured jumpers, stripes and argyle). It’s kind of pinky grey, chunky, holey, straggly. Put it this way: I don’t think Tom Daley would be proud if he’d knitted it, and if you saw it on the beach, you’d probably think it was a discarded fishing net.And yet strangely alluring when loosely wrapped aroundErivo.True. Kurt Cobain also looked pretty hot in a chunky greyish cardie, which went onto sell for $334,000 at auction, 25 years after his death.Howis Elphaba’s going down?It’s proving a hit –certainly a talking point– on social media.Memetastic?Oh yes. For example, the Instagram account@bravohistorian posted a pictureof Anne Hathaway as assistant Andy from The Devil Wears Prada in a garment that looks like it’s been knitted from cobwebs. The caption read: “Are you wearing the –” “Elphaba’s sex cardigan? Yes, I am.”Do say:“Excuse me while I slip into something a little more … woolly.”Don’t say:“Why can I only think of Mrs Doubtfire?”Explore more on these topicsWicked: For GoodPass notesWickedCynthia ErivoSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

So I gritted my teeth through hours of contractions, and when I finally told the nurses I was ready, the anesthesiologist was with another patient.Another unbearable hour passed before I finally got the medication. But by then, I was minutes away from pushing. I went through the final stage of labor feeling almost everything.When I had my second baby, I got my epidural right away, but it made me incredibly itchy. Throughout 24 hours of labor, I scratched and wiggled so much that the epidural catheter, which administers the numbing medication, fell out, was put back in, fell out again, and wore off by the time I was ready to deliver.Do women’s periods actually sync up with each other?Read moreDuring my third birth, the epidural provided a welcome numbing sensation on one side of my abdomen, but I still had sharp, intense pain on the other.After this experience, I was frustrated. Were my anesthesiologists doing something wrong? Was I?I’ve talked to dozens of mom friends over the years. Most say their epidural was like a magic wand that eliminated their pain in minutes. Some recalled napping or watching a movie through most of labor. I was envious and dumbfounded.But epidural failure isn’t necessarily the fault of the medical provider or the patient.“Epidurals are complex; it’s not like when you order something from a vending machine, it falls down and that’s what you get,” says Dr John W Patton III, director of regional anesthesia at Ronald Reagan Medical Center at UCLA. “Every patient is different, and a patient could have a different experience each time they receive an epidural, for various reasons.”Here’s what you should know before getting an epidural – and why it might not work as expected.What is an epidural?An epidural is a form of regional anesthesia used for surgeries, traumatic injuries, chronic pain relief and childbirth. A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into the epidural space, a narrow corridor just outside the spinal cord. The catheter connects to a bag containing pain-relieving medication, administered through the tube to numb the connecting nerves. This continuously provides pain relief to the abdomen, pelvic region, lower back, and sometimes legs.The main ingredient in epidural bags is the local anaesthetic, says Julie Steele, a certified registered nurse anesthetist and assistant clinical professor in the Nurse Anesthesia Program at Northeastern University; common ones arebupivacaine, chloroprocaine, lidocaineandropivacaine. Some hospitals add low-dose opioids, such as fentanyl or morphine; others add a small amount of steroid, which can also help reduce pain.Decades of researchshow that epidurals are one of the safest forms of pain medication for labor. “Studies have consistently found no long-term effects on babies’ health, development or bonding, and no increased risk of birth defects, autism or developmental issues,” says Dr Ashraf Habib, chief of the women’s anesthesiology division at Duke University. “Furthermore, epidural analgesia has an excellent safety profile for the mother, with serious complications being very rare.”However, experts say they can sometimesdecrease a patient’s blood pressure, which, if not treated, could put the fetus’s health at risk. In rare cases, an epidural can causepostdural puncture headaches, which are treatable but uncomfortable.Why might a labor epidural not work?There’s a chance an epidural may provide only partial relief, or in very rare cases, none at all.“Epidurals aren’t foolproof,” says Steele. In her experience, epidurals don’t work as expected about 10% of the time, though studies report epidural failure rates range from8% to 23%.“You can’t get a 100% success rate with any medical procedure, including epidurals,” says DrMichael Bottros, an anesthesiologist with Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California. “Someone might have a great experience with their epidural one time, and then it doesn’t work at all another time. But that doesn’t mean anyone did anything wrong.”He says there are many variables to consider.The epidural catheter might not be in the right spot:If the tip of the catheter isn’t in the correct location, the medication may not reach the intended areas. If this happens, it might not provide adequate pain relief, or there may be patchy coverage, experts say.Correct placement can be difficult “because everyone’s anatomy is so different”, says Steele. For one thing, the distance from a person’s outer layer of skin to their epidural space can vary. Plus, epidural spaces themselves are uniquely shaped and sized. Other factors include body type, past surgeries, injuries, tissue structure, whether or not a person has scoliosis and nerve placement.Even if the catheter is placed well, it can migrate during labor. “The patient may be getting in different positions, going on all fours and standing, squatting, then lying back down,” explains Steele. “Sweat can get in between the tape and the skin, and the epidural catheter may move around.”Luckily, fixing placement issues is generally quick and easy. Gentle adjustments to the tube or helping a patient change position may help, says Steele. Otherwise, the provider may take the catheter out and start again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Patients “may require more medication as labor progresses and contractions become stronger and more frequent,” says Patton.In addition, people metabolize medicine differently. “Some people metabolize numbing medicine very quickly, and need higher than normal doses,” Bottros says.Some notable studies have found this is true forpeople with red hair. The gene mutation that causes red hair can also cause variations in pain perception and medication metabolism. “Because of this, higher doses of local anaesthetics may be required for redheads,” says Steele.The patient responds poorly to a particular formula:Each hospital has its own unique epidural formulation, created in response to its anesthesiology team’s experience, published evidence or data, and patient feedback. “Anesthesiology teams often develop a standard mix based on what’s worked best for their patients and clinicians,” says Habib.Patients may respond differently to the various epidural components. Opioids improve pain relief and allow for lower doses of numbing medications, but some people experience side effects, such as itchiness, says Habib. Plus, some patients may be allergic to a particular anaesthetic or preservative, points out Bottros.Generally, patients don’t know if they’re going to have a reaction to any of the ingredients until after the fact. For my second delivery, I didn’t know the fentanyl in my epidural would make me so itchy. (I didn’t even know this hospital’s formulation contained fentanyl until I asked.)If patients know they shouldn’t have a particular ingredient, providers can have a custom formulation prepared – but this requires time.The timing is not optimal:Experts say some patients mistakenly believe that epidurals will “run out” – as a result, laboring parents try to put it off until they feel they really need it. Some then find themselves in pain for hours, and risk delivering their baby before the epidural has time to kick in. (This is what happened during my first delivery.)But this is a myth, says Steele. The epidural slowly administers medication through the catheter, she explains, and when the medication bag is empty, the provider can simply attach a new one. The whole point of epidurals is to provide a steady stream of relief for an extended time, says Steele, and it can remain in place for multiple days. “Fortunately, labor epidurals are rarely needed for that long,” she adds.Where did this belief in the limited epidural originate? In the early 2000s, it was recommended to wait until the cervix is 4cm to 5cm dilated, partly due to concerns that early epidurals might slow labor or increase the risk for a C-section, says Habib: “However, well-conductedstudieshave shown that this isn’t true.”So, there isn’t any particular stage of labor you need to wait for. “If you’re uncomfortable and feel ready, you can safely request an epidural,” Habib says.What will give you the best chance of an effective epidural?Preparation and communication can help. Pregnant people should carefully prepare a birth plan with their doctor and discuss potential options ahead of birth, including whether or not they want an epidural, Patton says; some providers offer options for communicating with the obstetrician anesthesia team ahead of labor. If this is an option, they can ask questions about pain relief when they’re less anxious, says Steele.When it comes time for delivery, Steele recommends laboring patients call the anesthesia professional as soon as they get to the hospital.“The earlier you can talk to anesthesia, the better,” says Steele, “Some people worry that if they call anesthesia, that means they have to get an epidural right away. And that’s not the case at all.”Calling the team earlier means they have more time to learn about any requests and get consent for the epidural, making for a much smoother process.“Every epidural is different, and they, like babies, don’t always follow the book,” says Steele.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyChildbirthHealthWomenPregnancyHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not AI, but it might as well be. This is Zootropolis 2, which is named Zootopia 2 on its home turf in the US. (Is the reference to lefty ideas such as “utopia” too dangerous for the all-important foreign territories?) If this is the second in what promises to be a continuing series, perhaps Z3 will be cautiously hailed as a return to the franchise’s “dark” roots.We are back in the magical wonderland of Zootropolis, in which all animals live together, big and small, prey and predator; a place, in fact, where the comedy lion can lie down with the hilarious back-talking lamb, and all the animals provide undemanding voiceover work for comedy talent such as Alan Tudyk, who makes a minor vocal appearance. As before, our heroes are an odd couple of cops in the ZPD or Zootropolis Police Department: idealistic young rabbit Judy Hopps (geddit?), voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, and sly fox Nick Wilde, voiced byJason Bateman, a creature once on the wrong side of the law but now a supposedly reformed character who has joined the police.Together, Hopps and Wilde must tackle an apparent crime by a snake, the one kind of animal not welcome in Zootropolis. This serpent has apparently stolen a journal belonging to the aristocratic family of lynxes who are the city’s founding fathers, a journal that details the creation of the “weather walls” that provide for so many different climates within the city, allowing different animals to live there. But their investigation uncovers secrets, lies and a conspiracy which goes, of course, to the very top.There are a few laughs in Z2: of course there are. But they are algorithmically generated and corporately approved. It’s the kind of movie you put on an iPad to keep the children quiet on a long plane or train journey; nothing wrong with that of course, but the heart and soul are lacking.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Dinuka Liyanawatte/ReutersStill largely viewed as a peaceful philosophy, across much of south-east Asia, the religion has been weaponised to serve nationalist goalsBySonia FaleiroTue 25 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTShareIn the summer of 2023, I arrived in Dharamshala, an Indian town celebrated as the home of theDalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader. The place hadn’t changed much since my last visit almost two decades ago. The roads were still a patchwork of uneven asphalt and dirt, and Tibetan monks in maroon robes filled the streets. Despite the relentless hum of traffic, Dharamshala had a rare stillness. The hills seemed to absorb the noise. Prayer flags flickered in the breeze, each rustle a reminder of something enduring.But beneath the surface, theBuddhismpractised across Asia has shifted. While still widely followed as a peaceful, nonviolent philosophy, it has been weaponised, in some quarters, in the service of nationalism, and in support of governments embracing a global trend toward majoritarianism and autocracy.In countries such asSri Lankaand Myanmar, where the conservative Theravada strain predominates, monks have emerged as central figures in movements that promote sectarian hatred, abandoning the teachings of the Buddha in favour of a more common and earthly goal: political power. My journey to Dharamshala and across other parts of the Buddhist world was driven by a need to understand how this transformation had occurred.The question wasn’t just what had happened to Buddhism in these places, but what Buddhism had been before the transformation. One principle, above all, has come to define Buddhism in the eyes of the world: the foundational precept ofahimsa, or non-harming. The Sri Lankan monk Walpola Rahula, who taught at Northwestern University, defined the Buddha’s ahimsa as an injunction not only to avoid harming another person but to prevent violence committed by others.Mahatma Gandhi embodied nonviolence in modern times. He responded to British colonial exploitation and violence with nonviolent non-cooperation. Gandhi’s methods included a 240-mile walk against unjust taxation and a 21-day hunger strike. In the 1950s, Martin Luther King Jr embraced Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolent resistance for the US civil rights movement. “Christ showed us the way, and Gandhi in India showed us it could work,” King declared in 1956 during the Montgomery bus boycott.Around the same time, events in Asia were bringing Buddhism into sharper focus for the west. In 1959, as Chinese occupying forces tightened their grip on Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama made a dramatic escape on horseback across the Himalayas into India, capturing the world’s attention and highlighting Tibet’s struggle. By the 1960s, Buddhist monks were showing Americans how to sit still. Meditation and chanting, once viewed as esoteric practices, became stand-ins for Buddhism itself in the western imagination. The Dalai Lama’s peaceful response to China’s aggression, boosted by high-profile advocates such as the actor Richard Gere, cemented Buddhism’s reputation as a philosophy of nonviolence and inner peace.For many disillusioned by materialism and in search of a more meaningful existence, it was exactly what they were looking for. But as the feminist writer and Buddhist bell hooks would later note, the western embrace of Buddhism often centred on the comforts of the materially secure. Soon enough, Buddha statues were being sold next to crystals, incense, scented oils and mindfulness apps. What had once been a radical philosophy of renunciation and interdependence began to resemble the very consumerism it was supposed to critique.As for nonviolence, certain historical complexities were ignored. Few new followers knew that a previous Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, had reformed the Tibetan army in 1913, or that rivalries between monasteries in Tibet occasionally led to monks taking up arms. Even the distinct traditions within Buddhism – Mahayana, Theravada and Tantric – were smoothed into a single, marketable idea: Buddhism as balm.This is partly why the notion of Buddhist militancy comes as such a shock to many in the west. Yet by the 2000s, in Buddhist-majority nations such as Sri Lanka andMyanmar, nationalist groups were adopting strikingly similar tactics: fearmongering, militant organising and inciting violence. A strategy of communal division, rooted in colonial-era policies, was adapted to contemporary anxieties and used to terrorise fellow citizens.In Sri Lanka, the saffron robes of Buddhist monks have become a fearsome symbol for the country’s Muslim minority, as groups including the Bodu Bala Sena rally followers under the banner of “protecting” Buddhism. In Myanmar, similar robes adorn figures such as Ashin Wirathu, who incited hatred of the Rohingya. The monks leading these violent movements seem driven not by a pursuit of nirvana in the afterlife, but by a quest for dominance in this one. Their actions, I came to understand, were shaped in part by historical forces such as colonialism, which introduced racial hierarchies and privileged certain religions over others. Economic inequality compounded these tensions, compelling the public to seek solace in religion and, in turn, granting monks disproportionate social and political influence. What emerged was a pattern that mirrors other parts of the world: violent nationalist movements gaining momentum at the expense of minorities, with those in power weaponising a sense of victimhood to consolidate control.These monks also illuminate a lesser-known dimension of Buddhism: its patriarchal structure. Across south and south-east Asia, particularly within the Theravada tradition, male monks enjoy privileges systemically denied to women. Figures such as Wirathu, lionised by their followers and legitimised by their robes, make visible the hierarchies: who is elevated, who is heard, who is silenced. Their rise shows how nationalism entwines with masculine ideologies to reinforce male dominance. Partly in response, Buddhist nuns have emerged as some of the most courageous challengers of political repression and religious patriarchy. In Tibet, many have protested against Chinese rule at great personal risk – some to the point of self-immolation, while others have disappeared.At the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives in Dharamshala, the scholar Geshe Lhakdor offered a stark assessment of the moral crisis confronting the Buddhist clergy. Paraphrasing Martin Luther King Jr, he said: “I don’t feel sad when bad people do bad things. I feel sad when good people don’t do anything.” The real danger, he explained, wasn’t just the extremists – but the deafening silence of the majority.View image in fullscreenTibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in Dharamshala, India, in July.Photograph: Anushree Fadnavis/ReutersIn Dharamshala, I met Lhakpa Tsering, who had gained international attention in 2006 when, as a 23-year-old, he had set himself on fire outside the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai. A Tibetan refugee, Lhakpa timed his act of protest to coincide with a visit from Chinese premier Hu Jintao. Now in his 40s, Lhakpa is a married father running a small cafe high in the hills of Dharamshala. His resistance has taken on a different shape: he writes and directs plays about Tibetan refugee life. The fire hadn’t visibly disfigured him, but he told me that he sometimes still felt a twinge of pain where his skin had burned. As we sat in his cafe eating dumplings, he asked if I knew the story of the Buddha and the starving tigress.In the story, the Buddha, as a prince, encounters a starving tigress and her cubs. Seeing that the tigress is too weak to hunt, the prince leaps from a cliff, offering his body as a sacrifice. “I will kill my miserable body by casting it down into the precipice, and with my corpse I shall preserve the tigress from killing her young ones and the young ones from dying by the teeth of their mother.” The moral of the tale is clear: though the Buddha abhorred even self-inflicted violence, such sacrifice could be justified if it served the greater good. “To sacrifice your body for the wellbeing of another,” Lhakpa told me, “is the highest form of nonviolent action.”For Lhakpa, self-immolation wasn’t only an act of protest: it was the living continuation of an ancient Buddhist tradition of profound sacrifice. His willingness to surrender his body echoed the transcendent generosity the Buddha showed the starving tigress. Yet, I was conscious that stories such as this had also become ammunition for violent Buddhists who justified aggression by claiming their actions were similarly motivated by the greater good – to protect Buddhists, and Buddhism itself. As I left, Lhakpa stacked our teacups and wiped down the table. The prayer flags kept fluttering above the hills. In the town below, the monks walked as they always had. But something had shifted. The silence no longer sounded like peace.Later that summer, I drove south from the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, to meet Fazeena Fihar, a Muslim tutor who had survived a harrowing ordeal. Her village, Adhikarigoda, was a breezy hamlet of whitewashed houses and fragrant trees. Fihar, a tall woman of 41, wore a hijab and had sharply defined cheekbones. As she ushered me into a living room where the sofa was still wrapped in plastic, I noticed that the walls were conspicuously bare – no family photographs, no academic certificates, none of the proud displays so common in Sri Lankan homes. I didn’t have to ask why.In 2014, a mob had ransacked Fihar’s house, tramping through the family’s mango orchard, torching their tuk-tuk and setting fire to all their belongings. Beds, tables, crockery and curtains, photo albums and schoolbooks, even a doll’s house were reduced to ashes. Everything around me, from floor to ceiling, was new, rebuilt over many difficult years.Fihar brought me tea in a delicate white cup but refused to sit. She stood with her gaze fixed on the open window overlooking the empty road. “Did you see the videos?” she asked. “It was purely against Muslims. ‘Don’t go to their shops. Don’t eat their food.’”Fihar was referring to a speech by a Buddhist monk named Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara. By 2023, Sri Lanka had no shortage of controversial clergy, but Gnanasara stood apart. His exploits were legendary: he’d been in hit-and-runs, pleaded guilty to drunk driving and flaunted luxury cars and coteries of bodyguards.View image in fullscreenPolice attend the aftermath of anti-Muslim rioting in Digana, near Kandy, Sri Lanka, March 2018.Photograph: MA Pushpa Kumara/EPAUnderstanding Sri Lanka’s complex religious landscape is critical to making sense of Gnanasara’s rise. In this island nation of 22 million, Buddhism is not merely a faith but a cornerstone of national identity for the Sinhalese majority, who make up more than 70% of the population. The constitution itself grants Buddhism “the foremost place”, creating a delicate balance – or imbalance – between secular governance and religious preference, and often making the country’s religious minorities, including Tamil Hindus (12.6%), Muslims (9.7%) and Christians (7.4%), feel like second-class citizens.The reverence afforded to monks explains why figures such as Gnanasara are allowed to remain in the clergy despite committing repeated transgressions that, according to the Vinaya – the monastic code of conduct established by the Buddha himself – should automatically result in disrobing.Gnanasara has a talent for reinventing himself. Born in 1975 in Galle, on Sri Lanka’s south-western coast, he came from a family of very modest means. He has several siblings and remains close to his elderly mother. He says he began his monastic life as a forest monk, living in cave-like dwellings in the dry tropical forests, devoted to rigorous mental and moral discipline. Anyone familiar with the man he later became may find this origin story hard to credit. According to Gnanasara, within a few years he had exchanged the solitude of the forest for the bustle of Colombo, where he enrolled at a monastic university. In Colombo, a different story about Gnanasara’s past circulated. Rather than being called to religion, he was, people said, a small-time thug who had donned the robes to avoid prison time.In the mid-00s, Gnanasara joined the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), the world’s first political party formed entirely of Buddhist monks. He stood for parliamentary elections, which he lost. Over time, he developed a close relationship with Sri Lanka’s most powerful and polarising political dynasty, the Rajapaksas. “Regardless of who is in power,” Ambika Satkunanathan, the former commissioner of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, told me, “all the Sinhalese parties are a little bit scared of the monks. Before announcing a new policy, they always go to the monks to explain it to them and get their support. Whatever power the monks have is what politicians have given them.”In 2012, Gnanasara cofounded the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), or Army of Buddhist Power, which claimed to protect the Buddhist majority from threats posed by minority religious groups. Among its key demands were preferential treatment for Buddhist students, and a ban on Muslim practices such as the slaughter of cattle for religious rituals and the certification of products as halal. Gnanasara and his BBS cohort hosted rallies that drew thousands and leveraged their social media following to spread their message. Their rhetoric escalated. At one rally, Gnanasara declared: “This country still has a Sinhala police, a Sinhala army. After today if a single [Muslim] or some other [minority] touches a Sinhalese … it will be their end.”This rhetoric didn’t emerge in a vacuum. Sri Lanka had been torn apart by a 26-year civil war that had only ended in 2009. The war had pitted the government against Tamil separatists fighting for an independent state. While often framed as an ethnic conflict, with most Tamils being Hindu and most Sinhalese Buddhist, the war left deep scars and heightened tensions among all of Sri Lanka’s diverse communities.Most people I met told me that, despite his divisive positions, Gnanasara was all but above the law. Sri Lanka’s president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who would later be forced to flee in a helicopter amid mass protests, had appointed the monk to lead a taskforce charged with making legal amendments that were clearly anti-Muslim. Gnanasara received all the attendant privileges of a politician in south Asia, including armed guards and sycophantic deference. Rauff Hakeem, a member of parliament and leader of the country’s largest Muslim political party, told me: “The yellow robes are untouchable.”When confronted about his actions, Gnanasara once told the press that it was his duty to act against any threat to Buddhism. “Attaining nirvana,” he declared, “can wait.”On 15 June 2014, Gnanasara arrived in Aluthgama, a town on the west coast of Sri Lanka, ostensibly to support a monk who had argued with some Muslim youths on a busy road. The young men had already been forced by police to kneel before the offended monk and apologise. The monk had slapped them across the face; his supporters then attacked some Muslim-owned shops.News of Gnanasara’s arrival had spread quickly across social media, where his already sizable following was growing by the hour. A stage was set, and the media invited. By the time he emerged from his chauffeur-driven car, looking more aggrieved than usual, a crowd of 7,000 had gathered, many of them robed monks, all eager to hear their guru speak.Forty minutes away, Fihar was at home, still recovering from the birth of her third child just days earlier. As her older children played nearby, she nursed the baby and chatted with her husband, Muhammed. Soon, their phones began pinging with WhatsApp messages showing clips of Gnanasara’s speech. “Enough is enough,” he declared, urging the cheering crowd to “fight” the country’s minorities. When the speech ended, Buddhist mobs surged through Aluthgama, torching Muslim homes and shops.The violence escalated swiftly, and it wasn’t long before the mobs reached Fihar’s village. She stood at the window, her newborn pressed to her chest, listening to the rising cries as they drew closer. Her body was rigid with fear. “We phoned the police,” she told me. “They said, ‘We are coming, we’re coming,’ but they never did.”Also absent were her Sinhalese neighbours, whose children Fihar had taught for many years. “That day,” Fihar said, “they forgot about me.” When the mobs reached the gates of her home, Fihar and her family had vanished into the dense jungle. All they took with them was the deed to their house and some gold jewellery.Over the next several hours, Sri Lanka descended into its worst episode of religious violence in decades. Muslims were beaten in the streets. Their shops were smashed and looted, their homes engulfed in flames. Even mosques were set ablaze.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of rioting in Kandy, Sri Lanka, in March 2018.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesOn the night of the violence, when reached by CNN, Gnanasara said that he was unavailable to comment. Dilanthe Withanage, the chief executive of the monk’s anti-Muslim group, told the news channel: “It is true our priest spoke in strong words. He blessed the people after chanting verses. He preached to them to conduct themselves peacefully.” The allegations against the BBS, Withanage said, were “an attempt to bring disrespect to Buddhist clergy and Buddhism”.When the violence ended, three people were dead – a small number, given the size of the mobs and the police’s failure to intervene over nearly 24 hours. Fihar returned with her family the following day. Her house was still standing, but the roof had collapsed and the walls were black with soot. It took them a year to rebuild their home, she told me. Not only did she refuse to leave the neighbourhood, she still teaches the children of the Sinhalese families who live nearby. When I asked why, she told me that she didn’t have a choice. But, she added, grimly, neither did they. “They need me to teach them,” she said. “And I need them to pay me. We need each other.”One likely reason for the low death toll in 2014, said Satkunanathan, the former human rights commissioner, was that the attackers were driven less by a desire to kill than by “economic envy”. Most Muslim families, like Fihar’s, owned their homes and travelled by tuk-tuk or motorcycle. They were seen as ambitious, successful in business and upwardly mobile.This economic dimension adds another layer to the country’s religious tensions. In Sri Lanka faith remains inextricably linked with politics, but also commerce. The perception that certain minority communities enjoy outsized economic success has long fuelled resentment among segments of the Sinhalese majority – resentment that nationalist rhetoric and militant monks eagerly exploit.Ifirst visited Sri Lanka in the early 00s, during the final years of the civil war. By then, the north of the country was largely under the control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the armed separatist group formed in 1976 in response to decades of state-led discrimination against Tamils. When I visited, only the Jaffna peninsula remained outside LTTE control.The Tamils I spoke to despised the Sri Lankan army and government and yearned for a country of their own. Not all agreed with the LTTE’s tactics – suicide bombings, the recruitment of children as soldiers – but they called the LTTE “our boys”. They described them as heroes. Meanwhile, most of the Sinhalese I met wanted the LTTE crushed by any means necessary. They were frustrated with the government’s inability to defeat the group, despite military aid from India and Israel and the broad condemnation of the insurgents by western governments.One might have expected the Buddhist clergy to play a pacifying role. Instead, many high-profile monks pushed for intensified military action, leading the national media to coin the term “war monks”. Among them was Athuraliye Rathana Thero, a leading figure in the creation of the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), or the National Heritage party, which Gnanasara would later join. In 2004, the year it was founded, the JHU won nine seats in the general elections. For the first time, Buddhist monks sat in parliament alongside career politicians.The JHU is widely viewed as the mother ship of modern Buddhist nationalism, fostering anti-minority sentiment in Sri Lanka much as the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had done in India. “Talk can come later,” Rathana told the Telegraph in 2007. “We need war.” Today, he is a four-time member of parliament who continues to deliver inflammatory speeches and stages hunger strikes to push his agenda.After the war ended in 2009 with the government’s victory over the LTTE, militant monks, with the backing of Sinhalese nationalist politicians, turned their gaze toward Sri Lanka’s Muslims. They cast Muslims as outsiders whose religious and cultural practices posed an existential threat to Sinhala-Buddhist identity – just as they had once claimed of the Tamils.Muslims were as integral to the island as any other religious group. Arriving as Arab traders in the seventh century, they had built deep-rooted communities. But for nationalists eager to consolidate power, Muslims served a different function. By portraying them as aligned with a global Islamic order rather than the Sri Lankan state, nationalists suggested they could never truly belong. In doing so, groups such as Gnanasara’s BBS helped stoke a moral panic, recasting Muslims as the ultimate “other”. Between 2012 and 2015, according to state agencies and human rights groups, Muslims were targeted in hundreds of violent incidents.How Hindu supremacists are tearing India apartRead moreThis narrative of Muslims as the “enemy within” sat uneasily beside the Buddhist ideal of ahimsa, or non-harming. Monks are meant to embody this principle. Yet in Sri Lanka, the militant monks who stirred up anti-Muslim hatred were not outliers – they were expressions of how completely Buddhism had been conscripted to serve the ambitions of the state.By the time I returned to Sri Lanka, more than a decade after the civil war ended, a new set of divisions had taken hold. The violence no longer resembled a single conflagration, but a series of smaller, smouldering fires, each capable of flaring out of control. Sometimes, between interviews, I would stop at a Buddhist temple or shrine. You didn’t need to be religious to feel moved by the rituals: lighting incense, offering fresh flowers or turning a prayer wheel. Though I couldn’t follow the mantras, I felt the peace they invoked. In moments like those, I struggled to reconcile Buddhism’s promise of compassion with the hostility unfolding around me.As a Catholic, I’ve wrestled all my life with the stain of complicity within my own faith. In Europe, many churches stand tall not only as monuments to devotion, but to empires built on the backs of enslaved people and stolen lands in the Americas, Asia and Africa. Marble pillars and gilded altars were often paid for with blood money. Those reminders were never far from my mind in Sri Lanka where I found myself returning to a familiar question: are Buddhist monks so different from priests and clerics who vow to serve a higher purpose, yet sometimes lose their way? They are expected to be better than everyone else. But in a world shaped by conflict and fear, perhaps no vow, no matter how sacred, is entirely safe from the pull of politics.Three months after the 2014 mob attack in Aluthgama, Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara hosted a special guest in Sri Lanka: Ashin Wirathu. At the time of his visit, Wirathu was already the world’s most notorious Buddhist monk. In 2013, he had appeared on the cover of Time magazine with the headline The face of Buddhist terror, highlighting his role in inciting deadly riots in towns such as Meiktila, where dozens of Muslims were hunted down and killed. Despite this, the Sri Lankan government not only approved his visa but also gave him a security detail.At a stadium packed with tens of thousands of monks, nuns and laypeople eager to hear him speak, Wirathu announced that his 969 movement would collaborate with Gnanasara’s BBS to “protect Buddhism around the world”. He offered no further clarification, leaving his message open to interpretation. “It’s the responsibility of monks, as Buddha’s sons, to teach bad and uncivilised people to become good and civilised,” he said.The rally marked a major success for Gnanasara, boosting his profile among Sri Lanka’s growing rabble of militant monks. With his rising influence, his speeches became increasingly inflammatory. He expressed disdain for women in hijab and made false claims about the Qur’an permitting Muslims to acquire the wealth of non-Muslims through fraudulent means. When Muslim leaders challenged his fabrications, he issued the chilling threat of “another Aluthgama”.Then in late February 2018, an incident in Digana, a small town in Sri Lanka’s Central Province, sparked exactly this. A group of Muslim men assaulted a Sinhalese Buddhist truck driver, who later died from his injuries. Mainstream media and social networks amplified the story. On Facebook and WhatsApp, people called for revenge. One widely shared post quoted a monk telling his followers: “The sword at home is no longer for cutting jackfruit – sharpen it and go.”View image in fullscreenProtesters in New Delhi burn images of Ashin Wirathu, a hardline Buddhist monk in Myanmar, June 2015.Photograph: Money Sharma/AFP/Getty ImagesAmong the militant monks, Sinhalese nationalists and angry young men who converged on Digana was Ampitiye Sumanarathana Thero, a notorious social media personality and ordained monk. Sumanarathana enjoyed filming himself threatening minorities. In one viral video, he marched up to a man and bellowed: “Every single Tamil will be cut into pieces! They will all be killed!” In another widely circulated clip, he slapped a Christian clergyman whom he accused of missionary activities in a Buddhist area.In Digana, Sumanarathana stormed into a police station to demand the arrest of the Muslims responsible for the assault on the truck driver. Gnanasara also came to town, ostensibly to offer condolences to the dead man’s family. Within hours of his arrival, a Muslim-owned grocery store was looted and set on fire. Later, a mob of several hundred descended with sticks, stones and gasoline.By the end of the violence, over 300 homes, more than 200 shops, dozens of vehicles, 20 mosques and two Hindu temples had been destroyed. A 27-year-old man named Abdul Basith was dead. “The state failed in its duty to protect the Muslim minority during attacks; hold perpetrators to account; and deliver justice,” declared Amnesty International.The international outcry finally prompted action. The government arrested more than a hundred people, including prominent Sinhalese nationalist leaders. Yet the monks Sumanarathana and Gnanasara were not approached by the police.In Colombo, after days of waiting, Gnanasara finally agreed to meet me. When the time came, his armed guard led me into a dim room that reeked of stale incense. The militant monk sat at the far end, hunched over his phone. He was larger than I had expected, and his neon orange robe kept slipping off his shoulder, exposing loose, pale flesh. He didn’t bother fixing it. A group of monks filed in, smiling blandly. One of them started lecturing me about Buddhism. “You have to practise it,” he droned. “Don’t do bad things.”Gnanasara finally looked up, scowling. “Enough,” he barked.His spokesperson, Withanage, translated with an apologetic smile. Withanage was an odd character. Armed with an electronics engineering degree from Tbilisi, Georgia, he dedicated his time in Sri Lanka to defending Gnanasara’s hate speech. In an interview with a news magazine, he had accused Christian evangelicals of luring Buddhists to convert with promises of material reward. “They come, they preach, they tarnish the image of Buddhism here,” he said. “And they offer jobs, they offer positions, if they convert to Christianity. And jobs are offered, houses are offered.”During my time on the island, I had noticed a shift: the hostility once directed at Muslims was now turning toward Christians. Newspapers carried reports of pastors attacked, churches vandalised and worship obstructed. It was as if the monks had decided they had taken their campaign against Muslims as far as it could go, and now needed a new enemy to remain relevant and keep their audience engaged. Far from being guided by scripture, these men seemed to be working to an algorithm.View image in fullscreenGnanasara with fellow BBS members, in Kandy, 2019.Photograph: Dinuka Liyanawatte/ReutersI asked if Gnanasara saw himself as a political leader. Withanage translated with a beaming smile, as though he knew the question would flatter.“That’s how people choose to see me,” Gnanasara said with a smirk, before slipping into a well-worn tirade about the need to defend Buddhism from foreign contamination. He waddled towards a plush armchair, tucking his phone into his robe; each notification lit up his belly like a lantern. “We must protect our culture,” he declared. “But we never use violence.”Who exactly was he protecting it from, I asked. He didn’t hesitate. He pointed to the Easter bombings of 2019 – carried out by domestic Muslim extremists who targeted churches and luxury hotels – as evidence of what he called a broader Muslim conspiracy to destabilise the country. He alluded grimly to an “organised network” operating in the shadows.When I suggested his own rhetoric might fuel violence, he snorted. “The media twists everything,” he said. “They even claimed I threatened to slice up a Muslim politician. How could I say such a thing?” He broke into loud laughter. The monks around him followed instantly, their laughter swelling as if it were a joke. They sipped tea and chewed cashew nuts, urging me to help myself. Then they turned their attention back to their phones, scrolling casually.Withanage continued to translate Gnanasara’s staccato Sinhalese. The monk’s historical revisionism painted a picture of a Ceylon united by Buddhism until the British arrived with their divisive Christianity. Now, Gnanasara declared, the BBS was on a crusade to rectify this colonial meddling. As our conversation unfolded, Gnanasara’s demeanour oscillated between smug self-satisfaction and barely contained aggression. He spoke of “fighting” for Buddhist values with unsettling frequency, all the while insisting on the BBS’s commitment to nonviolence.As I stood up to leave, Gnanasara tried to soften things. “We may have made mistakes,” he admitted, walking me to the door. Then, grinning: “But we always serve tea to visitors.”View image in fullscreenAdapted fromThe Robe and the Sword: How Buddhist Extremism Is Shaping Modern Asia, published byColumbia Global ReportsThe best stories take time.

So it was striking that Nigel Farage was absent for Keir Starmer’s statement on the G20 summit and the Ukraine peace process.You might have thought the man who has spent the last six months telling anyone who will listen that he will be the next prime minister might take some interest in geopolitics and Britain’s global standing. Apparently not. Only Richard Tice from Reform stayed for the session. Lee Anderson scarpered the moment it started. So brave. Maybe he had an urgent appointment with his lunch.There again, Nige has never really cared much forUkraine. When Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, Farage was adamant that Ukraine was to blame. The Ukrainians should never have dared express a desire for their own sovereignty by wanting to join Nato. So they deserved everything they got. And it was only last week that Nathan Gill – one of Nige’s old muckers from his European parliament days and at one stage the Reform party’s leader in Wales – was banged up for a 10-year stretch for taking bribes to make statements in favour of Russia. It’s almost as if Putin appeasement is party policy.Nor was Nige in any hurry to correct this appearance. Here was his chance to speak out about his newfound love for Ukraine. To distance himself from the convict. Only he wasn’t anywhere to be seen.His only public comment has been that he is sure Gill was just a lone wrong ’un. And he knew this because he had done a forensic investigation. He had asked a couple of Reform members if they had ever taken bribes from the Russians. And guess what? They had all said no. So that was an end to it. If only the police were that thorough. The clear-up rate would be doubled in days.It has also turned out that Nige hasn’t had that much to say about the allegations of racism while he was at school that were published in the Guardian last week. Other than to first suggest the 20 witnesses must have suffered from simultaneous amnesia and that only his recollections were accurate.Then he shape-shifted a little. Now he came to think of it, he might have done a little bit of racism when he was at school, but if he did it would have been a very mild form of racism. Racist non-racism. Racism without any intent to be racist. Just words coming out of his mouth over which he had no control. Inside Big Nige there had been a little Baby Nige who had taken over his voice and started saying things that were … were actually just normal.Mmm. So perhaps it wasn’t so surprising Nige was otherwise engaged for the statement on Ukraine. He could sense this might be an hour where the Commons would unite in a Reform pile-on. Let Dicky Tice suck it up. That was the point of him. To do the jobs that are too hard for the party leader. Nige’s transformation from the self-appointed man of the people who wasn’t afraid of difficult truths to just another mediocre politician whose first instinct is to protect his own skin is almost complete.So the Commons was left to discuss Ukraine without the benefit of Nige’s pro-Russian input. The BBC board member Robbie Gibb would have been appalled at such a lack of impartiality. But this was Keir at his most content. Some have christened him Never Here Keir because he spends so much time abroad. And who can blame him? He’s far more appreciated outside the UK than he is in it. The EU and the “coalition of the willing” think he’s a top bloke. Someone who can be trusted to get the job done. A welcome change from some of the other halfwits who masquerade as world leaders.You could even make a case for Keir doing a job swap with Mark Carney. Keir would like it in Ottawa. Life would be a little slower but there would be plenty of upsides. A chance to get away from the malcontents in his own party and elsewhere. No drip-drip feed of bad news. The Canadians would also come to appreciate the fact that he gets on better with Donald Trump than Carney. So he might magic away some tariffs. And we Brits could get used to Mogadon Mark. While he was over here as governor of the Bank of England, his USP was to do as little as possible at all times. That would make a change.Keir’s statement itself was largely free from controversy. He had managed to steer The Donald away from trying to force Ukraine into a 28-point ceasefire plan that had been drafted by the Russians. And he had allowed the Orange Man Child to think it was all his own work. Job done. So now it was just a matter of sitting back and hoping for the best. Ukraine was on board with the Geneva agreement and now it was just a matter of waiting to see if the Russians would play ball. It was a start.Kemi Badenoch looked wrongfooted. She is always primed for starting a fight, and now she had to bite her lip. She supposed – through gritted teeth – that Keir had done a decent enough job under the circumstances. She could have done a lot better, obvs, but credit where credit was due. Instead she reserved all her anger for Reform. They were nothing but Putin apologists. They should be ashamed. Where was Nige?This was something on which everyone could agree. MP after MP stood up to kick Reform as Keir also added his own condemnation. That just left Dicky Tice to stand up for his party’s record. No one loved Ukraine more than him, sobbed Dicky. He had personally donated a five-figure sum to the country’s war effort and had driven a pickup truck full of aid to the country. He had Ukraine in his DNA. So much so that he had changed his name by deed poll. Meet Dickyy Ticeskyy.Much to Dickyy’s obvious disappointment, no one was particularly impressed with his largesse. Instead Keir offered some home truths. You couldn’t be pro Ukraine and pro Russia. This was a war and Reform had to choose sides. And Reform had voted with its feet by choosing not to launch an official investigation into whether any other of its members had taken bribes. Almost as if they were afraid of what they might find.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageThe politics sketchReform UKKeir StarmerHouse of CommonsUkraineRussiacommentShareReuse this content"

But with voters becoming more and more concerned about the firm’s surveillance tech, could that relationship affect his chances?Tue 25 Nov 2025 10.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 14.39 ESTShareThe US is the land of the free and the home of the world’smost expensive, and most excruciatingly drawn-out, elections. In most democracies, the election cycle lasts justa few weeks or months. In most democracies there are strict laws regulating how long politicians can campaign, and how much money political parties can accept. But the US is not most democracies.Which is why, despite the fact we’re not even a full year into Trump 2.0, there’s already chatter about 2028. Assuming Donald Trump doesn’t find some sort of legal loophole that lets him run again (notunthinkable!), JD Vance is widely seen as his heir apparent, with Trump saying a presidential ticket with Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio would be “unstoppable”. Meanwhile, Rubio, it was recently reported, is telling his inner circlehe’d support Vance for president.In his role as vice-president, Vance is already under constant scrutiny. But, as 2028 approaches, he will be put under the microscope. And if he wants to get the top job there are a few liabilities that he should probably sort out.His personality is one of them: Vance can come off assmug and obnoxious. But that’s something he can work on. This is a man, after all, who haschanged his namemany times; a former atheist who converted to Catholicism in 2019, a few years before running for political office. A man who once called Donald Trump “America’s Hitler” and now calls him boss. Vance is adept at shape-shifting.A liability that might be rather harder to shake off, however, is his ties to the shadowy $450bntechnology company Palantir. Vance would not be where he is today were it not for the mentorship of Peter Thiel, the company’s billionaire co-founder. Thiel encouraged the hiring of Vance at his investment firm Mithril Capital in 2016, then spent$15m on Vance’s senate campaign. Some people see Vance as a sort ofavatar for Thielin the White House. Which is worrying because Thiel hassaid he doesn’t“believe that freedom and democracy are compatible”.It’s hard to explain exactly what Thiel’s firm does in non-buzzwordy language, but here are a few examples. The company has a multimillion-dollar contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help improve “deportation logistics”, and has been building an “ImmigrationOS” that, according to a contract seen byBusiness Insider, will include “near real-time visibility into instances of self-deportation”. Palantir, which hasbeen called“the AI arms dealer of the 21st century”, also works very closely with Israel’s military.A June reportfrom the UN special rapporteur Francesca Albanese says there are “reasonable grounds to believe Palantir has provided automatic predictive policing technology” to Israel – which is as dystopian as it sounds – as well as “core defence infrastructure”. When the Palantir co-founder Alex Karp was heckled by a pro-Palestine protester in May and accused of killing Palestinians, he shrugged it off with: “Mostly terrorists, that’s true.”Many potential Vance voters don’t give a damn about Palestinians. But they are suspicious of big tech and the surveillance state – and they are very wary of the Trump administration’sdeepening ties to Palantir. The podcast bros who helped get out the vote for Trump in 2024, for example, have repeatedly voiced concerns about the company. On a 9 September episode of his podcastJoe Roganreferenced anarticlefrom the financial news site Benzinga about the Trump administration employing Palantir to gather the “personal data of American citizens” and called it “kinda creepy”. Rogan went on to quote the article’s comments about Palantir creating “detailed profiles of American citizens” and asked, alarmed: “Who signed off on this?” Over adozen other rightwinginfluencers, includingTucker Carlson, have worried aloud about Palantir’s capabilities and its objectives for the US.All this is a big problem for Vance because, as herecently acknowledgedwhile speaking to university students: “I get asked about Palantir a lot because there’s this internet meme out there that somehow I am super in bed with Palantir.” Meme or not, it’s hard to ignore the links between the two, which are,increasingly, generating headlines. You’ve made your bed, Vance; now you’ve got to lie in it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Such distortion of facts from a public body should alarm us allTue 25 Nov 2025 10.54 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 13.03 ESTShareThe latest strike by resident doctors began on Friday 14 November. That morning, the headline of the lead story on the front page of the Times proclaimed: “Five days of NHS strikes opposed by most doctors”.The story began: “Most junior doctors do not support Friday’s strike, a poll has revealed as Wes Streeting attacked the British Medical Association for going ‘against the wishes’ of its members.” The trouble is that the poll showed no such thing.It was conducted by Savanta, a reputable survey research company. Question nine, which asked doctors whether they supported or opposed the strike, found that as many as69% backed it, while only 12% were opposed.However, those figures appeared nowhere in the Times story. It reported a different question, question 10, which asked whether the British Medical Association should call off the strike if theNHStrained thousands more doctors, prioritised graduates with NHS experience and covered the costs of various training fees.Had both questions been reported, Times readers would have been given a significant insight into thecurrent angerof the striking doctors, set against the prospect of a future settlement based on proposals advanced by the health secretary. Indeed, it was arguably a bigger and better story.So why did the Times not tell it? Because the poll was commissioned by the Department ofHealth– another unpublished fact – and the department wanted a propaganda win as the strike started. So it gave the Times the results for Q10 and withheld the results for Q9.Fortunately, the truth came out, six days too late. Like all the well-known survey research companies, Savanta is a member of the British Polling Council. I helped to set up the council 20 years ago when Ichaired YouGov. Its rules are based on the principle of transparency. It requires members to correct publicly any client that distorts the findings by publishing only the results it likes.The results for Q9 were eventually published the following Thursday evening. But this should be only an initial skirmish in the far greater battle to insist on government departments telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.For a start, the Department of Health should come clean on who took the decision to brief the Times the way they did. Did junior or middle-ranking officials act independently, or did ministers or senior officials take the final decision? Was everyone involved aware that two questions were asked about doctors’ views of the strike, not just one? If not, why was this information held back from the final decision-makers? Did anyone challenge the decision to suppress Q9? If so, why were they overruled? Were any codes of conduct broken? If so, did anyone point this out?These questions are well worth answering because, unusually, we have clear evidence of something specific going badly wrong inside a government department. One need not be a rabid cynic to suspect that other government stories in recent years have also fallen short of the standards of candour and rigour that citizens of a democracy should have the right to expect.There is a wider point. Most statistics published by the government come from independent agencies, such as the Office for National Statistics. They are rightly respected for presenting their data in a standard, comprehensive form. Cherrypicking figures that put the government in a good light would be alien to the way they work and, indeed, to their very purpose.It’s different when Whitehall commissions research from private polling companies – Savanta, YouGov and many others. These days, there’s a lot of it. Some is published in full. Some is kept confidential and used internally by departments to shape policies and track how well or badly government actions are going down with the wider public. And there are those such as Savanta’s poll of doctors: some results are published and others held back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When I chaired YouGov, there was nothing I saw in our government work that really needed to be kept completely confidential. Occasionally, a case could be made for deferring publication while ministers were confidentially exploring options ahead of a public announcement (such as the budget). Maybe some research, involving defence or national security issues, should be held back much longer, even years or decades.However, the general rule, subject to clearly defined exceptions, should be that what the government knows about what we think, we should know too. After all, in a free society, we have the right to speak out as individuals. It seems odd to regard the record of our collective views as state secrets.I wish I weren’t writing this. I had hoped the Times story was right. In my view, the doctors are wrong to strike. But in an era when populism feeds on distrust of mainstream politicians, we should object when the truth is twisted, even in favour of a cause we agree with.Peter Kellner is a former president of YouGovDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As Covid swept in, and with horrific images of Italiantemporary morguesin tents,he went on holidayand took no calls. With the NHS bracing to be “overwhelmed” by the virus, he rode his new motorbike, walked his dog and hosted friends at Chevening.Nothing is surprising about that: he was ejected from Downing Street and later stepped down as an MP largely for partying and lying toparliament about it. Everyone knew he was a self-aggrandising fantasist with a “toxic and chaotic culture” around him. But this is not just about one narcissistic politician. It’s about his entire rightwing coterie of libertarians and their lethally dominant creed in the UK media.They have a long history of rejecting things that save lives – seatbelts, speed limits, smoking restrictions, sugar taxes, vaccination, benefits, sewers, clean air, the NHS itself and, of course, stopping climate breakdown. Recall that during the 1980s and 1990s, the Sunday Times under the editorship of Andrew Neil promoted the strangestgay plague theory, publishing pieces suggesting that Aids wasn’t caused by HIV, and that it was almost impossible for heterosexual people to contract it. (Neil has said he regrets certain aspects of the paper’s coverage, but does not take personal responsibility for it.)That anti-science tradition is alive and well today.Lockdowns are the quintessence of everything rightwing science-sceptics abhor: what misfortune that a tribe least equipped to cope was in power during the pandemic. In the circumstances, the interventions from those in charge were “too little, too late”. Hard to imagine, but Covid in the UK could have been even more deadly, had unavoidable facts about the pandemic not eventually overwhelmed their fact-free ideologies.Naturally, lockdown sceptics are out in force to demolish thelatest module of the Covid report chaired by HeatherHallett, the former high court judge appointed by Boris Johnson. From the start they had proclaimed lockdowns worse than pointless. On the recent fifth anniversary of the first lockdown, they were contesting who denounced it first: Daniel Hannan in the Sunday Telegraph boasted he wasthe only oneto “stand in the way of a stampede”. “What the hell were we thinking? Five years ago, we were sliding towards the most expensive mistake ever made by a British government, a mistake that led to our financial ruin, the annihilation of our basic freedoms and the obliteration of public trust,” he went on.Toby Young in the Spectatordashed to outdoHannan: “I’m happy to name myself as one of the first journalists to oppose the lockdown policy, along with Peter Hitchens, Allison Pearson, Ross Clark, Julia Hartley-Brewer and a handful of others.” The Daily Mail, Telegraph, Sun, Express and Spectator, joined mid-pandemic by GB News, were among those who kept the extremist libertarian flag flying, with no relenting since. The public needs reminding constantly of those 23,000 deaths, as Nigel Farage and Richard Tice were among lockdown’s fiercest opponents, hastily rebranding their Brexit party as Reform UK tocampaign against all restrictions. None of this can be called “populist”: the public always favours precaution, as they did in lockdown.Now with this report, virulent attacks by this cadre rain down on Hallett’s statisticsand reasoning.The Telegraph conteststhe numbers. Toby Young’s outlet,the Daily Sceptic(successor to his Lockdown Sceptics blog), ison the attack. Shamefully, Johnson himselfsmeared the inquirythat he himself complied with as “hopelessly incoherent”, in the Daily Mail.Maybe 23,000 is too many or not enough: but it’s an informed estimate. Sweden is the country constantly quoted by the right, as it relied entirely on a voluntary advisory approach, never compulsory lockdowns. In terms of deaths per capita, many fewer Swedes died than Britons: case proven? Hallett trounced? Alas, we are not Sweden in social structure, national wealth, vulnerable deprivation, health or social care, mainly due to the longterm malign influence of the right fighting tooth and claw against Swedish-style social democracy. But here’s the most telling research, comparing the socially and economically similar Norway with Sweden. Norway implementedlockdownswhile Sweden refused. Many moredied per millionin Sweden (2,759) than in Norway (1,050).The precautionary principle, putting safety first when the science is uncertain, is as alien to these ideologues as risk registers. To them, safeguarding regulations and public protections are comical, while officials who shield society are laughable blobs and plods. Johnson took a witty swipe at me back in 2006 exemplifying the great chasm between our sides. Hesaid that I incarnate“all the nannying, high-taxing, high-spending schoolmarminess of Blair’s Britain” as “the high-priestess of our paranoid, mollycoddled, risk-averse, airbagged, booster-seated culture of political correctness and ‘elf’n’safety fascism’”. Fair enough and funnily enough, I wear the badge with pride; public wellbeing is a serious matter.Johnson and his world were never serious: they play games and affect jocular mannerisms because they don’t actually believe in government. Brexit was another of their political games, with direst consequences. The report quotes Johnson saying, “let the bodies pile high” at the prospect of large numbers dying in care homes (he has denied saying it). More than 45,000 of themdid indeed die, as hospitals tipped untested patients into care home beds.That was an outrageously flippant and deeply revealing attitude, so objectionable that it instantly shuts down discussion. His faction are using their own bogus figures to reject Hallett’s and “prove” lockdowns don’t save lives, as so often decadently rejecting majority scientific opinion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How many QALYs – quality adjusted life years – ie years of good quality, were preserved and at what price?Bereaved families are painfully clear in their view. But the gigantic cost has to be weighed in the balance,estimated by the House of Commons libraryat £310bn to £410bn. A Benthamite felicific calculus seeking the greatest good for the greatest number might compute how many more lives could be saved one way or another, how much more happiness could be created and unhappiness avoided if the chancellor now had that vast extra sum for her budget this week.Understandably people are torn by such questions. It’s not easy, but it needs serious thought that will never be had from these extremist dilettantes.Future modules of Hallett’s inquirywill look at the terrible harm done by keeping children out of school for extended periods; leaving old people to die alone; domestic violence; loneliness; and the crippling blow to the economy, commerce and public services. Those life and death trade-offs need to be faced truthfully in the next pandemic. But always beware the deranged right’s predilection for “freedom” over even the most basic lifesaving health and safety measures.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCovid inquiryOpinionCoronavirusInfectious diseasesBoris JohnsonNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

Rather, Kingfisher noted “softening market conditions” and added: “We continue to be mindful of inflation, uncertainty ahead of the autumn budget and the softening labour market.”In other words, the group is saying its improvement in the profits department is a self-help job, which is fair. Like-for-like sales in the UK in the last quarter were up 3%. It is winning market share in the UK (where it helps thatHomebase went into administration a year ago), grabbing a bigger slice of the professional “trade” market and improving its e-commerce game. The slick Screwfix operation continues to be streets ahead of its direct rivals. Meanwhile, the recently troubled French operation (Castorama and Brico Dépôt) is being restructured, which helped slightly to off-set local “weak consumer sentiment” that sounds several degrees worse than in the UK.Take a step back and Kingfisher’s progress can be regarded as a parable of the retail scene in two ways. First, it is proof that a basically well managed operator in a strong competitive position can prosper even under subdued economic conditions. For other examples, think Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Next. All have been great shares to own in the 12 months since Rachel Reeves’s last budget, never mind the increase in employers’ national insurance and the rest of it.The other aspect is more nuanced. On one hand, the ridiculously long and chaotic build-up to the budget has plainly sapped consumer confidence – a CBI distributive trades survey on Tuesday confirmed what we already knew. On the other hand, there still remains a basic level of resilience if Kingfisher is a guide. “Softening” is not the same as outright soft. For that, give thanks for four cuts in interest rates since last October’s budget. Lower mortgage costs matter particularly in DIY businesses for big-ticket items such as kitchens and bathrooms.So one can – just about – sketch out an optimistic scenario for consuming-facing companies in which Reeves avoids inflation-raising howlers such as last year’s NICs rises and clears the way for the Bank of England to cut interest rates faster. The gilts market has half-bought that story in recent weeks as yields have fallen from their scary September highs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The prospect of rate cuts is virtually the only big-picture factor running in their favour as they contemplate pressure on wages and fixed costs. Remove lower borrowing costs and there’s little to stop softening conditions turning soggy very quickly. Kingfisher, to repeat, can handle most outcomes.

We talk a lot about strategies for keeping anti-liberal, nationalist populists out of power, but Donald Trump’s daily wielding of a wrecking ball shows that it’s equally important to reinforce your democracy so it can withstand a period of populists in power.Germany has a concept calledwehrhafteDemokratie,often weirdly translated as “militant democracy” but actually meaning a democracy capable of defending itself. Under this motto, some in Germany areproposing to banAlternative für Deutschland (AfD), now one of the most popular parties in the country. That’s the wrong way to go. It would only reinforce the far-right party’s supporters in their conviction that the democratic state itself is a kind of liberal elitist conspiracy, and impart to the AfD the nimbus of martyrdom. The French experiment of a “republican arc”, in which virtually all the other parties agree only on keeping out Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, is also visibly backfiring. Such a wide range of parties unsurprisingly fails to agree on urgently needed reforms and the National Rally can go on criticising from the sidelines. So it’s worth contemplating the example of the Netherlands, where the party of the inflammatory populist Geert Wilders was allowed into power in a coalition government, failed to deliver, brought that government down bywithdrawing from the coalition, andlost the subsequent election(albeit only narrowly) to a liberal party led by the young, dynamic Rob Jetten.But if you’re going to take the risk of letting populists into government, you need first to reinforce the defences of your democracy – otherwise they will use democracy to dismantle democracy, as Viktor Orbán has done in Hungary and Trump is trying to do in the US. Salami slice by salami slice, these once liberal democracies become what political scientists call an electoral authoritarian system. There are still elections, but they are not free and fair.Here are a few things to look at, if you want to populist-proof your democracy.Proportional representationA winner-takes-all two-party system, such as the US has – and the UK largely still has in Westminster, despite the recent fragmentation of its party landscape – may be helpful until a nationalist populist takes over one of the two big parties, as Trump has done. Then it’s worse. Better to have proportional representation, so the populists will be constrained by coalition partners, as in the Netherlands and much of continentalEurope.Electoral administrationA little nerdy perhaps, but this matters. The absurdly archaic US system, in which each of the 50 states has its own different procedures, is a standing invitation to partisan gerrymandering, voter suppression and all the other dirty tricks on which Republicans are plainly hellbent in advance of next autumn’s midterm elections.Public service broadcastingThe shared public sphere we need for democracy is everywhere being eroded by the simultaneous fragmentation and polarisation that results from the US capitalist version of the digital revolution. There are few easy remedies. If, however, you have a trusted public service broadcaster, as in Britain, Canada, Australia, Germany or Scandinavia, you should hang on to it for dear life, further ringfence its editorial independence, double its budget and increase its presence on social media. That Britain is doing the precise opposite byundermining the BBC, probably the world’s most widely respected public service broadcaster, is just another example of the country’s seemingly endless capacity for national self-harming.Media ownershipCensorship issoold-fashioned. The modern authoritarian controls speech through ownership. In Turkey andHungary, the leaders’ oligarchic cronies own the key media. At first glance, it may look like perfect media pluralism; behind the mask, the reality is entirely different. It’s almost impossible to formulate a general rule on this. Foreign ownership, for example, has been a curse of British newspapers (think Rupert Murdoch) but a blessing for the defence of democracy in some post-communist countries (the broadcaster TVN in Poland, for example). It’s horses for courses.Independent judiciaryObvious, but so vital. The judicial chaos in Poland today, where the governing coalition isdisputing the legitimacy of judgesappointed by the previous populist government, shows what happens when the rule of law has been lost. Germany recently saw a disastrous incident in which the candidacy of a left-liberal legal scholar for a seat on the constitutional court, already approved by the relevant cross-party parliamentary committee,was derailedby a group of rebel conservatives. Like the attacks on the BBC, this is precisely the wrong thing to do when you have populists at the gate. Unlike the US supreme court, the UK supreme court has kept its reputation for impartiality. But when the shadow justice minister, Robert Jenrick, waves a judge’s wig in front of his party conference while denouncing leftwing activist judges, we see that the Trumpian threat is not far away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps most worryingly, this is already happening in the US department of justice, where hundreds of officials have either beensacked or have resigned. Indictments of outspoken critics, such asJohn Bolton,James Comey and Letitia James, have followed.Constitutional monarchyYou laugh? But asked by Yascha Mounk on his The Good Fight podcast how we can best defend liberal democracies, the leading American comparative constitutionalist Tom Ginsburg unexpectedlysingled out the advantagesof having a constitutional monarchy. Anti-liberal populists claim to speak on behalf of the nation, but if you have a constitutional monarch who is the undisputed, non-partisan top representative of the nation, that space is at least partly occupied. I’m not suggesting that the US should bring back one of the heirs to George III (although a British royal spare is available in LA), but if you happen to have a constitutional monarchy, like Britain, Sweden or the Netherlands, do preserve it – for in practice it is, quite paradoxically, a bulwark of democracy.I could mention many other areas, such as security services, the military, universities, and the incestuous, neo-oligarchic relationships between big money and politics. In each case, the specific national answers will differ, and none of them will be easy. It helps to have detailed provisions in a hard-to-change constitution, but what James Madison inFederalist Paper 48memorably called “parchment barriers” are no guarantee in themselves. It needs us, the people, to mobilise to protect them. When I was in Prague last month, my Czech friends were preparing to defend their public service television and radio, on the streets if need be.For what’s painfully clear is that once you’ve lost any of these essential checks and balances, they are very hard to restore. Destruction is so much easier than construction. Just look at the mess Poland is in today, and the US will be tomorrow. For liberal democracy, as for health, prevention is better than cure.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionProportional representationCivil serviceEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

While Labour has begun to make improvements, there is still no single senior civil servant with overall responsibility for solving problems that have been in the public domain for years.Labour deserves credit for ordering this review, and forraising the earnings thresholdso that claimants can now earn £196 a week after tax before losing the allowance, which is paid to people who spend at least 35 hours a week caring for a disabled relative. But ministers and officials have a great deal more work to do. Detail of how outstanding debts totalling £250m will be dealt with has not been announced. Reform of the benefit’s cliff-edge design – which means that claimants whose earnings exceed the limit lose their entire weekly allowance – has yet to be proposed, let alone introduced. Then there is the issue of whether hundreds of people who were taken to court at the DWP’s urging, andprosecuted for fraud, should have their convictions wiped, or receive some form of compensation.Alongside such practical and policy decisions there is thequestion of what to do about the DWP. It issix yearssince the National Audit Office and MPs on the committee for work and pensions both published highly critical reports regarding overpayments, and the system for dealing with them. But despite assurances given at the time that problems were being dealt with, the situation did not improve.Last year, the Guardian revealed that despite the DWP having access to earnings data, meaning that claimants could have been warned when they broke the limit,only around half of automatic alerts were followed up. Other claimants were left to work it out for themselves or rack up debts sometimes totalling thousands of pounds (a year’s worth of overpayments adds up to £4,000). In addition to this, the review finds that guidance issued to claimants in 2020 was so flawed as to be invalid. Rules around the averaging of earnings, to take into account fluctuations, were impossible to follow.The human suffering caused by this unjust system was enormous, particularly for the unfortunate minority of claimants who were prosecuted. Some of them have describedlife‑changing experiencesof debilitating shame and fear, as well as indebtedness. At a time when ministers are eager to proclaim the benefits for public services of new artificial intelligence tools, it is chilling to learn that the algorithm used to select alerts for investigation was part of the problem. Rather than increased automation, the review highlights the use of phone calls as good practice, and says staff should be trained to deal compassionately with claimants.This review is an important step forward. But it is not the first examination of these issues, and the real test is how change is implemented. It is disgraceful that clearly documented flaws in the operation of carer’s allowance were not sorted out by the last government. Now it is up toLabourministers to ensure that outstanding debts are reviewed swiftly, and outdated rules swept away.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But councils need to be given financial sustainability and enabled to move beyond crisis managementTue 25 Nov 2025 13.31 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 17.32 ESTShareIn a soberingreporton public services published last month, the Institute for Government (IfG) struck an almost lyrical note when recalling the performance of England’s councils before they were kneecapped by austerity. “When [Labour] last left office, in 2010,” the report notes, “local authorities provided many services beyond their statutory duties that supported people to live better lives. Authorities ran more Sure Start centres and operated many more libraries. Youth clubs, and youth services, were a common feature of neighbourhoods up and down the country.”It was a different era, and one with priorities that the present government is committed to reinstating. Since returning to power, Labour has been making laudable incremental moves to that end. Last week, the local government minister, Alison McGovern,outlineda funding shake-up intended to redirect resources towards more deprived areas, where councils suffered disproportionately from austerity cuts. Multi-year financial settlements will give councils more certainty and control, while cities will welcome new backing for a modesttourist levyon overnight stays.This is much more than tinkering at the edges, but it is not nearly enough. Though this year’s real-terms funding increase will befollowedby above-inflation rises for the next three years, councils remain cash-strapped and burdened by challenges that they are in no position to confront. The statutory provision of adult social care now eats up more than two-thirds of council budgets, as the government refuses to grasp the nettle of reform. Thedelayedpublication of the schools white paper on special educational needs and disabilities (Send) means another fiscal crisis has been kicked down the road.Accordingto the County Councils Network, 59 councils would be immediately obliged to declare themselves bankrupt, were it not for a “statutory override” that allows them to keep Send debt off their main books.Such pressures have led to modern local authorities being described as overstretched “adult social care factories”. And as the losing battle on core obligations is fought, council capacity in other areas has been hollowed out. As the government pursues an ambitious target of building 1.5m homes in the next three years, the Royal Town Planning Institute haswarnedthat budget cuts are leading to an exodus of the public sector planners vital to overseeing the process.Collateral damage to the kind of placemaking services that contribute to communal wellbeing is also spreading. One recentsurveyof English councils found that 60% are now planning to sell off assets, with many having already tapped deep into financial reserves. Social clubs and sports centres are on the list of targets. These are the kinds of closures that corrode the fabric of places, heightening a sense of community decline and political disillusionment.Ms McGovern has suggested that Labour’s ongoing reforms will allow councils to assume a “new role … as agents of renewal”. But the IfG’s analysis of future funding suggests local authorities could still be poorer overall by the end of this parliament than they were in 2010. Responsibility for the gutting of municipal England lies squarely with the Conservative governments that vandalised the public realm for over a decade. But true renewal will require proper financial sustainability, and offering the kind of fiscal headroom that will allow local government to expand its gaze beyond the day‑to‑day anxieties of crisis management.Explore more on these topicsLocal governmentOpinionPovertyInequalityConservativesLaboureditorialsShareReuse this content"

Their son was in a third in A&E, also with Covid, but survived. Six months later my father, who was in hospital recuperating from major surgery, was rushed out of the building late at night because of a fear of Covid on the ward. Within two weeks, he died of Covid. On the day he died, my mother tested positive and spent the next two weeks grieving in isolation. I could not visit as I lived 200 miles away and respected the travel ban.At his funeral, we followed the rules, so a very small number of people could attend. My father was such a part of the local community that people lined the roads around the cemetery, everyone respecting social distancing. I could not hug my mother at the funeral because we were not in the same bubble.His funeral was at the timeBoris Johnsonand his government were raising a glass to each other and partying in Whitehall. To say that they should be ashamed of themselves for their incompetence and the unnecessary deaths they caused would be an understatement. I hope they never show their faces in public again.Prof Andrew MoranSaffron Walden, EssexI shall never forget arriving at Gatwick on 19 March 2020, having been in Mexico since January. My wife and I expected to see and hear advice about avoiding Covid as soon as we arrived, but there was nothing – not even a poster. No social distancing and no face coverings. People were behaving as normal for London, pushing past to get on escalators. By contrast, in Tulum, social distancing had become the norm and hand-sanitising gel was prominently displayed in shops and restaurants. This should be an indictment of Britain, a country where too much power is concentrated in the hands of too few people in Westminster. Why are we so dependent on the actions (or inaction) of one flawed individual?Bryan PreadyOrmskirk, LancashireThe nation is right to speculate how a more serious prime minister might have handled the Covid crisis in its early stages (Boris Johnson took four days off as NHS warned Covid could ‘overwhelm’ system, 22 November). Perhaps one answer might come from Damian McBride’s 2013 book Power Trip, about his time working as a special adviser to Gordon Brown. In it, the author recounts the story of Brown’s short-lived holiday to Weymouth in August 2007. Having just arrived at his holiday cottage, Brown was alerted to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. His reaction was to immediately call the chief vet and then Hilary Benn – then cabinet minister for farming and rural affairs – announcing that he’d be back at Downing Street the following morning to chair a Cobra meeting.Having dealt with the press that evening, McBride notes how he returned to the cottage at 5am for the drive to London. Asking Brown whether he’d slept much, he replied, “No, I was reading all this stuff”, pointing to a 187-page report into the government’s handling of the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak and the Royal Society’s report into the science of that outbreak. Every page of both printouts, McBride recalls, was covered in scribbles. Brown also had 20 pages of notes consisting of an action plan for the next 24 hours.The 2007 outbreak is little remembered, mostly because it was so decisively addressed. Brown may have had his faults, but riding around on motorbikes when he should have been attending to brewing national crises was not one of them. Fewer people would no doubt have died if a similar politician had been in charge during Covid.Dr Paul JacksonCharlbury, OxfordshireYet againI find myself writing to the Guardianabout Boris Johnson and his actions during Covid. We all knew that he partied, broke his own rules and lied to the nation and parliament,later provedby the House of Commons privileges committee report in June 2023. Most of us knew during the pandemic that he was unprepared, chaotic and, except for the vaccine rollout, lacking in both capability and leadership requirements. Sadly, we didn’t know the half of it.Baroness Hallett haslaid outin devastating detail his ineptitude as a leader and prime minister. British prime minister. Her report is a long litany of Johnson’s incompetence, failings and lack of awareness of the chaos he was overseeing. He in particular, but also his leading support team of Matt Hancock, Dominic Cummings and Rishi Sunak, must surely have now lost the right to play any part in public life in this country. Johnson’s taxpayer-funded annual allowance should be withdrawn, as should any public honours or awards that he has received. Then, hopefully, there will be no need for anyone to write again to the Guardian about this pathetic, destructive man.John RobinsonLichfield, StaffordshireTheCovid inquiryreport confirms what many of us knew at the time of the pandemic, thanks in part to the Guardian’s assiduous reporting from professionals such as Anthony Costello of University College London, Devi Sridhar of the University of Edinburgh.I am not a scientist, nor a senior civil servant, yet ordinary citizens like me saw a virus emerging from China from January 2020 – and the devastating impact, and WorldHealthOrganization warnings regarding its nature. We watched the warnings from Italy amid the decision to cut off part of the country to stop the spread. We saw people on ventilators fighting for their lives in such distressing conditions in Italian hospitals, and fear began to build.Despite our anxieties, no action was taken in the UK. Our borders were open; our airports were welcoming visitors. Indeed, our prime minister, who had failed to attend Cobra meetings to discuss the pandemic, was on holiday at the government’s Chevening country retreat. The Cheltenham race meeting went ahead, with government spokespeople saying outdoor meetings were safe. To the contrary, ordinary citizens were thinking: “Were they not queueing at food stands? Or for indoor toilets? How could it be safe if people were mingling?” Similarly, the fateful Champions League football event in Liverpool, which saw Covid rates rise exponentially, went ahead.Thousands of people, family members and neighbours died unnecessarily. It is important, therefore, that this report is not received as “new” information.Lynne CaddickCorscombe, DorsetI admire your leader’s aspiration (Editorial, 21 November) that we must learn the lessons from the exacting Covid inquiry to prepare better for the next “major crisis”, but we are doomed to disappointment. There was nothing we didn’t know in advance of the arrival of Covid. A virus would travel fast, care homes would bear the brunt, contingency plans must be stress-tested, PPE must be procured and stockpiled, accurate information must be provided to frontline workers and the rest of us and politicians should model good behaviour. Also, semi-independent government agencies should do their job of protecting the public from lying and incompetent politicians. It is hard to imagine Boris Johnson, DominicCummings or Matt Hancock setting an example in self-abasement as a warning to their successors. So where is the sanction that will protect us better? I regret that I just don’t see it.Dr John BeerVice-president, HourglassAnyone who has read Johnson at 10: The Inside Story by Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell will not be at all surprised by anything that has come out of this latest report.Eric BushElche, Alicante, SpainHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

While liberal arts institutions do have intrinsic value, that doesn’t mean they are entitled to be socially favoured or economically exceptional for ever.A particularly stubborn myth is that liberal arts education has a monopoly on cultivating critical thinking. This belief not only discounts the intellectual rigour demanded in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields but also perpetuates an outdated hierarchy of disciplines. Critical thinking is not the sole attribute of literature and philosophy departments. Instead, it is embedded in science, engineering and other hardcore technical disciplines, where logic and problem-solving are non-negotiable.Rather than worry about funding cuts or condemning their threat to academic purity, liberal arts institutions should embrace a market-oriented mindset. Some of the most adaptive models can be found in so-called “schools of professional studies” at major universities such asColumbia, which offer real-world, business-relevant programmes with flexible formats. They thrive not because they adhere to tradition but because they respond to market needs.As a result, they deliver strong outcomes in enrolment, reputation and revenue. Fears about “dumbing down” degrees or commodifying education can be addressed through market accountability and employer feedback.Jianyang GengEdgewater, New Jersey, USHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Each taught hour may take days of preparation that is not accounted for in the pay formula. I have developed material including work plans, assessments, reading lists and tutorial tasks for three different modules, requiring much more time than I was paid for. If I were able to reuse these materials, my time investment would pay off. Budget cuts and hiring freezes meant that I delivered these modules once. There is simply no incentive for someone to invest time in a module that they may teach only once on a precarious contract.Successive governments’ refusal to invest in higher education has created a situation where the price of quality teaching is paid by teachers.Dr Talia HussainLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The accolades have come his way but it was different at Stamford Bridge.Lamine Yamal was barely given a kick by Marc Cucurella, who delighted in neutralising his international teammate, and was unable to do anything to make his first meeting with Estêvão Willian live up to expectations.Estêvão outshines Lamine Yamal to show why he is Chelsea’s rare diamond | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThe battle between two of the best youngsters in the world could hardly have been won more emphatically by Chelsea’s boy from Brazil. This was Estêvão seizing his opportunity to prove that the hype is justified.The 18‑year‑old, who is three months older than Lamine Yamal, tore Barça to shreds and it is not an exaggeration to say that the Brazilian looked like Lionel Messi when he scored a goal that will surely go down as one of the most captivating solo efforts inChampions Leaguehistory.No wonder Enzo Maresca did not hesitate to start Estêvão against the champions of Spain. This was the teenager’s fourth goal in his past four starts for Chelsea. Talk about fearless. Talk about making an impact. Estêvão, remember, moved to England only last summer. It would not have been surprising if Chelsea had eased him in gently. Sometimes, though, exceptions have to be made.Chelsea have bet big on Estêvão, paying £52m to sign him from Palmeiras, and they must have felt smug when he put them two up against Barça by rounding off a spectacular run with a firecracker of a shot at Joan García’s near post.It all happened so quickly. Pau Cubarsí was left with twisted blood and Estêvão had the strength to hold off a challenge from Alejandro Balde. Barça did not know where to look. The ball was glued to Estêvão’s feet, even though he was moving at blistering speed, and the shot with his weaker right foot was unloaded before anyone had time to react.Not that Estêvão becoming the third teenager – after Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappé – to score in his first three Champions League starts was the only highlight for Chelsea. They delivered another convincing performance without the injured Cole Palmer and are up to fifth in the standings after putting three past Barça without reply.View image in fullscreenLiam Delap slots home Chelsea’s third goal from close range.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMaresca is building something. Driven on by another outstanding midfield display from Moisés Caicedo, Chelsea overwhelmed Barça. Hansi Flick’s side lost their captain, Ronald Araújo, to a red card at the end of a torrid first half and look increasingly unlikely to finish in the top eight after taking seven points from their first five games.Barça were pallid. An early miss from Ferran Torres, who shot wide after a defensive mix-up, was the best they had to offer. The 37-year-old Robert Lewandowski was ineffective up front, Cucurella relished the task of dealing with Lamine Yamal’s runs down the right and there was never any point when Barça looked capable of dealing with Chelsea’s prowess at dead balls.There was frustration for Enzo Fernández, who had two goals disallowed from set pieces when the game was goalless. Chelsea just had to trust themselves, though. They recovered from a loose start and dominated midfield. Caicedo, Fernández and Reece James were simply too physical for Frenkie de Jong, Fermín López and Eric García.Much of Maresca’s plan was modelled around targeting Barça’s high‑wire offside trap. He deployed the busy, bustling Pedro Neto as the central striker – a surprise move given that João Pedro and Liam Delap were available – and the plan almost worked when Estêvão released the Portuguese forward, whose shot went over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They took a short corner on the right, Alejandro Garnacho found Cucurella and the left-back’s cutback ended with Jules Koundé bundling Neto’s flick into his own net.The concession summed up Barça’s half. They had faded as an attacking force and played with an air of entitlement. The outrage when play was waved on after Lamine Yamal tried to buy a free-kick off Cucurella was absurd. Araújo was booked for dissent and was soon sheepishly removing the captain’s armband after receiving a second yellow for fouling Cucurella just before half-time.Estêvão’s delight at ‘perfect night’ after Chelsea teenager helps see off BarcelonaRead moreBarcelona could not live with Chelsea’s controlled aggression. Marcus Rashford came on for Torres at the start of the second half but nothing changed. Chelsea remained dominant. Andrey Santos came on for Malo Gusto, who was on a booking, and soon had a goal disallowed for offside. Barça had accepted their fate. The challenges were feeble and they were in trouble when a turnover in midfield in the 55th minute led to Chelsea doubling their lead.The record books will, of course, show an assist for James got an assist. Really, though, it was all about Estêvão. He took the ball from James, ran at Cubarsí and wriggled into the tiniest of gaps. Balde came across but Estêvão is stronger than he looks. Stamford Bridge erupted when his shot flew into the top corner.Barça were beaten by sheer brilliance. It was 3-0 when Fernández unselfishly squared for Delap and the substitute clipped home his first goal since June. Chelsea cruised. They host Arsenal on Sunday and will know anything is possible with Estêvão in this mood.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueChelseaBarcelonamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Eddie Howe had cautioned his players that Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang was “as good as ever” and would need to be “controlled” but, ultimately, the visitors proved powerless to prevent the 36-year-old transforming both the match and Marseille’sChampions Leagueambitions.While Aubameyang fulfilled the soaring expectations of a raucously loud audience at a stupendously designed, incredibly atmospheric arena, Howe’s team started brightly before taking a wrong turn. They ended up mugged in the manner of naive tourists who had wandered into the wrong arrondissement of this beguiling yet sometimes brutal city.Estêvão wonder goal lights up Chelsea’s statement win over 10-man BarcelonaRead moreAlthough Newcastle retain genuine hopes of advancement into the knockout phase, their persistent travel sickness – they have won away once since April – dictates that unwanted playoff involvement may yet be required.“That was particularly painful,” Howe said. “We’d worked ourselves into a strong position but 10 minutes at the start of the second half cost us. It’s a big disappointment because we played so well in the first half. There’s a big feeling of frustration. We dealt well with the hostile atmosphere but we didn’t react well to their first goal. It was a concentration lapse. We’re bruised but we’ll come back better.”Harvey Barnes is far too talented to have spent so much of his Newcastle career warming the bench, but here Howe hit upon a solution as to how to force two into one and accommodate both his left wingers, Barnes and Anthony Gordon, in the starting XI.It involved that duo morphing into a front two in a 3-5-2 formation lacking the £70m Germany striker Nick Woltemade. Yet if Howe was happy to rotate the initially benched Woltemade, Sandro Tonali enjoys virtually undroppable status on Tyneside.Sure enough, the Italy midfielder soon proved his worth by accelerating forward and breaking theMarseillelines before watching Gordon nudge his cut‑back in the direction of Barnes. All that remained was for Newcastle’s man of the moment to score his third goal in two games by lashing a 10‑yard, left-foot shot beyond Geronimo Rulli.Barnes’s double had undone Manchester City in the Premier League last Saturday and now he had Roberto De Zerbi’s team firmly on the back foot as Newcastle initially pressed their hosts high and hard. Marseille’s Pierre-Emile Højbjerg performed wonders to clear Malick Thiaw’s header off the line.Howe’s only problem was that, not for the first time, his players could not possibly sustain such intensity and, almost incrementally, their hosts began dominating possession.View image in fullscreenMason Greenwood gets off a shot in his first match against a Premier League team since leaving Manchester United.Photograph: Guillaume Horcajuelo/EPAMarseille also started creating chances. One of the more notable involved Mason Greenwood, the Manchester United outcast turned Ligue 1’s leading scorer, playing in Aubameyang. The former Arsenal striker controlled the ball on his chest before swivelling imperiously and forcing Nick Pope into a decent save.Greenwood was facing Premier League opposition for the first time since leaving Old Trafford and his increasingly clever attacking link play represented a key reason why Newcastle’s lead always seemed fragile.Suddenly Howe’s team were playing on the counterattack but that was not necessarily an entirely bad thing for an XI possessing such petrifying pace on the break. As if to prove that point, Gordon showed Argentina’s Leonardo Balderdi and his co-defenders a clean pair of heels before forcing Rulli into a fine save following a through ball from the recalled, and impressive, Joe Willock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionNot that Willock or his teammates would prove exactly flawless. An extraordinary opening to the second half from De Zerbi’s side ruthlessly exposed Newcastle’s defensive fault-lines as the Stade Vélodrome dared to dream of springtime European involvement once more.First, just 18 seconds into the new half, Aubameyang connected with a long ball from the 17-year-old Darryl Bakola and the soon to be heavily criticised Pope was left stranded after inexplicably rushing off his line.Aubameyang duly delighted in rounding the visiting keeper and shooting expertly into an empty net but the extreme tightness of the angle underlined the sheer, and undimmed, quality of his finishing ability.If that was a sublime equaliser, Aubameyang was not quite done yet. Having taking the briefest of breathers while Barnes saw another “goal” disallowed, correctly, for offside, the veteran resumed his rescue mission.This time the Gabon forward received some constructive help from Timothy Weah – son of George – down the right. More specifically he made the most of Weah’s cross courtesy of an instinctive near‑post half‑volley past Pope.Although Willock’s drive subsequently stretched Rulli – his head now swathed in enormous white bandages after Dan Burn accidentally stood on his skull – to the limit Newcastle had been thoroughly dissected by a striker threatening to redefine the term “evergreen”.“I’m feeling great, even if I’m 36,” Aubameyang said after ambling off to a standing ovation. “I want to play more Champions League games and score more goals.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueMarseilleNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Seeing the result, they played not to make mistakes instead of doing what we had to do. They tried to do it. Maybe with the players who played regularly, maybe they would have had [more] confidence.”The defeat leaves City on 10 points with Real Madrid up next. “Now it’s Leeds and we have still three games [in theChampions Leaguephase] and we will see what happens,” Guardiola said.Beyond his tinkering, the wider truth is that City are no relentless winning-machine as they once were. He offered the normal platitudes about Leverkusen being tough opponents, then retained only Nico González as the No 6. Guardiola’s formation had Tijjani Reijnders and Rico Lewis as the attacking midfield pair behind a frontline of Oscar Bobb, Omar Marmoush, and Savinho.It was a centre-back – Nathan Aké – who went close when torching a shot at goal from a Reijnders corner on the left: Mark Flekken somehow beat the ball away from bulging the goalkeeper’s top left corner.This outing of the many contenders to be Guardiola’s first-choice next featured the understudy defender Abdukodir Khusanov, who skipped forward from right-back and curved the ball in for Marmoush who could not convert.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Grimaldo fires Bayer Leverkusen into a surprise lead.Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersThe ongoing absence of Rodri means City are too easily got at via attacks the peerless midfielder often spies and stops at infancy. So it was that Leverkusen cruised along their left, pinged the ball over, and Ernest Poku unloaded – Rayan Aït-Nouri’s sliding block was heroic and City were warned. As they were, again, when one moment Khusanov was nabbing the ball from Malik Tillman before Reijnders dawdled in Leverkusen’s area, and the visitors broke.Suddenly Poku was being grappled to the ground in City’s box by Aït-Nouri, in what looked a case for a penalty – yet while Kasper Hjulmand and his men were convinced, the referee, João Pinheiro, was not.Now, however, Guardiola’s near‑wholesale reshuffle of the team backfired.City were caught, centrally, before the ball was swept right, again, to Ibrahim Maza. The cross twisted the rearguard around, Christian Kofane touched back to Alejandro Grimaldo, and the captain drove past James Trafford into the right corner.Any side can concede anytime and the play to do against Guardiola’s City has always been the counter-surge. Yet since last season it has occurred too often for his liking, while there is a bluntness in front of goal when Haaland does not score or is on the bench as he remained at the break. Factor in how Foden’s paltry four goals are second to the Norwegian’s 19 and him being a replacement as well and you could see how their manager might consider introducing one or both soon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bobb and Reijnders each ran in and shot and each time Flekken repelled. They offered a glimmer of what was required – but only that.For the second half, Guardiola made his move. On came Nico O’Reilly for Aït‑Nouri, Jérémy Doku for Bobb, and Foden for Lewis. But it failed miserably, as Leverkusen scored again due to further iffy defending.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Grimaldo scores the opener for Bayer Leverkusen.Photograph: Philip Bryan/ShutterstockFrom the right, Maza again had copious time to spiral the ball over, Patrik Schick rose and got ahead of the dozing Aké and directed a header beyond Trafford to the keeper’s left.Instantly the camera moved to Haaland who, warming up, was dismayed and, after Savinho spooned over and a Foden effort went for a corner, Guardiola signalled for the striker and Rayan Cherki to strip off.They entered on 65 minutes for Marmoush and Khusanov, cheered on as the cavalry the City faithful hoped they would prove. Instantly Haaland was rising to head at goal: he missed but you felt, at last, those in blue were potent.Further evidence was a classic Haaland stampede forward that had Flekken diving at his feet. City dominated the closing phase – a Cherki dribble claimed a corner but though Haaland was found he, as with his teammates all evening, could find no answer.“We are so happy with this win but also the character we showed,” Hjulmand said. Leverkusen’s head coach was right to be proud.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityBayer Leverkusenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

According to the seeding arrangements announced by Fifa on Tuesday, seeding will be split into four pots, with the three host countries – the US, Mexico and Canada – taking a spot in pot one.From there the pots are decided by Fifa rankings, with the six as‑yet‑undecided victors of the Uefa and international playoffs in pot four.This ranking system means the world’s top countries will not face each other in the group stage, and the new measure will keep the very best sides apart even further.“To ensure competitive balance, two separate pathways to the semi‑finals have been established,” Fifa said in a statement.“This will ensure that, should they win their groups, the two highest-ranked teams will not meet before the final.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This creates the prospect that England could be drawn against Scotland, who have been placed in pot three, or alternatively Wales or Northern Ireland shouldthey come through the playoffs. No more than two European teams will be in any group.One day after the draw, on 6 December, Fifa will announce the match schedule for the finals tournament. This will determine who plays where and at what time. According to Fifa, this process will be undertaken “to ensure the best possible conditions for all teams while, where possible, enabling fans all over the world to watch their teams play live across different time zones”.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaWorld CupUS sportsAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

And somehow we’re still more than a week out from the second Ashes Test. It’s a hefty gap bound to be filled by rage, moving from the defeat in Perth to the preparation for a pink‑ball affair in Brisbane.England’s first-stringers could pass the time with a day‑night knockaboutagainst a prime minister’s XI in Canberra. Instead, as planned, it will be a Lions side that plays this weekend, joined by Josh Tongue, Matt Potts and Jacob Bethell, unused squad members in Perth. It is understandable why this has annoyed many, why Michael Vaughan’s soundbite – that it would be “amateurish” not to play the fixture – carries some substance.Mitchell Starc has got England’s number as Ben Stokes faces a dirty dozen in BrisbaneRead moreThe day-night Test is a regular part of Australia’s calendar, their record standing at 13 wins from 14. England haven’t played one in nearly three years and have won just two of their seven. Mitchell Starc, chief destroyer at Perth, has more pink-ball Test wickets than anyone else, at an average of 17. Taking in some match practice with an unfamiliar pill would be of obvious value, even if it is against a long-retired Peter Siddle, six years since the end of his Australia career, in conditions that are unlikely to mirror the Gabba. For fans there would probably be more comfort from a scorecard: hard, undeniable proof that the boys are hard at work.Nonetheless, England’s decision to skip the fixture – adding further scrutiny to their methods – is hardly a surprise, keeping in line with Brendon McCullum’s and Ben Stokes’s refusal to play to the gallery. There is a stubbornness – sometimes admirable, other times deeply questionable – that has powered this whole movement since it began three and a half years ago. It was there in the comments after the two-day defeat in Perth, with McCullum stating that “we’ve just got to keep backing our approach”. It is in their continued selection of Zak Crawley when the returns say: are you sure?For McCullum, the focus now will be “making sure that camaraderie is tight and morale doesn’t drop”. It is easy, after a crushing defeat, for some eye‑rolling, to retreat to the hellscape that is the BBC comments section – “bring them home if they can’t be bothered to act like professionals”, reads one entry – and petition for the abolition of golf.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook’s wild style resulted in the second-highest score of the first Test.Photograph: Dave Hunt/EPABut there is a case for avoiding a sudden vibe-shift, validity in not cramming when that hasn’t been your way all this time. This is a four-year project, a response to the misery of England’s last Ashes visit to Australia.A squad has been finely tweaked and built for this series, and the mantras have stayed consistent: have a bit of fun and“run towards the danger”. They play the professional game but with the enjoyment of an amateur. This is an experiment that has produced exhilarating cricket and, while it hasn’t resulted in pedigree series wins against India and Australia, its successes meant England entered this tour with lofty expectations. Along the way, they haven’t played many warm‑up games. Why change now?It is worth seeing this whole thing through before offering judgment. Even after a pair, they should continue with Crawley for the second Test because he has been their man for this cycle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Harry Brook should not, and will not, turn suddenly into a nuggety grinder; his wildness still resulted in the second‑highest score of the first Test and has taken him to an outstanding record after 31 games.This side has been pulverised in the past. After beginning with four consecutive victories in 2022, England were undone inside three days at Lord’s against South Africa with two sub‑200 totals. The response was a comprehensive win at Old Trafford, powered by a couple of grown-up tons by Stokes and Ben Foakes, indicating some adaptability even as their innings moved at close to four runs an over.England will hope for a similar response this time round. If it doesn’t come in Brisbane, then the collapse is well and truly on. Should it go the way of previous tours, resulting in the embarrassment of a thumping, then the natural responses will surely follow, English cricket doing its thing: inquests and departures, a revamped team for the first Test of next summer at Lord’s against New Zealand. County Championship averages could become fashionable again. Accountability will come. For now, though, let them test the limits of this grand idea.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26England cricket teamAustralia cricket teamThe AshesCricketAustralia sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

So far in the Frauen Bundesliga, Germany’s top flight, there have been a reported seven ACL injuries 10 games into the current campaign. In the men’s Bundesliga, meanwhile, there have been three such injuries.WSL concerned by Sky broadcast slots after low TV audience figures for derbyRead moreAmong those to have suffered the injury is the Bayern Munich midfielder Lena Oberdorf. The Germany international recovered from an ACL injury to start this season and played six matches before rupturing the same ligament in the same knee. The DFB has implemented several measures to try to limit the amount of ACL injuries sustained by male and female players, including “training formats for medical staff and content on injury prevention in coach education” and “a scientifically supervised test battery with individual training recommendations”.ACL injuries are prevalent across the women’s game with a reported seven players enduring one in England’s Women’s Super League already this season. Among them is Michelle Agyemang, whoruptured an ACLduring England’s 3-0 friendly win over Australia last month. And according to ACL Women Football Club, a social media account that collates information on the injuries in the sport via research and club announcements, France’s Première Ligue has recorded six ACL issues and Italy’s Serie A Femminile two so far this season. None have been recorded in Spain’s Liga F.ACL injuries have become more common in the women’s game than in the men’s, leading to studies into the reasons. Fifa is funding research into discovering if hormonal changes impact the likelihood of the injury occurring in women.Saket Tibrewal is a consultant trauma and orthopaedic knee surgeon at Cromwell hospital in London. He conducts three to four ACL surgeries a week and says medical professionals do not yet have answers regarding the higher rate among female players.View image in fullscreenKatie Reid will miss the rest of the season for Arsenal after rupturing an ACL.Photograph: Izzy Poles/AMA/Getty Images“We are still in the infancy of really understanding this,” Tibrewal said. “I think the reason for that is women’s football has exploded on a professional level over the last few years. Five years ago there were probably the same amount of injuries but people weren’t aware of it. I think that it is now so much more mainstream we are seeing it a lot more.“The biomechanics of women are very different to men, in terms of muscle strength and landing mechanics. Women’s bone anatomy is also smaller than men’s. Where the ACL goes in, it is in the middle of the knee; we call it the notch. Women seem to have smaller notches; is that a reason to cause impediment or [more] force through it? We don’t know, but it’s something we are looking at.”The Chelsea and England midfielder Keira Walsh recently said the increasingly busy schedule that female players have to adhere to could be another factor. “Maybe sometimes we do play too many games in a congested fixture schedule. There’s not enough recovery time,” said Walsh. “You can do the research, but ultimately you need to listen to the ones going through it and how we can best find the solutions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After taking England to the World Cup final in 2019, Jones’s contract wasfurther extended in early 2020through to 2023 by Sweeney before he was sacked in late 2022.Before Jones, Stuart Lancaster wasinitially appointed on an interim basisbut was appointed full-time after the 2012 Six Nations on a four-year deal. In October 2014, however, Lancaster was given anew long-term contract until 2020, only for England to bomb at their home World Cup in 2015, prompting his exit.Borthwick’s stock has never been higher as head coach after finishing 2025 with victory over Argentina on Sunday. The 46-year-old came under pressure in 2024 after a series of narrow defeats left England ranked seventh in the world but having won every match since beginning 2025 with a defeat in Dublin, there is optimism he will end England’s five-year wait for a Six Nations title next year.“We obviously back this coaching group and are really happy with it,” said Sweeney. “We haven’t had those conversations now, and we are not planning to in the foreseeable future, no. His contract goes through to 2027. We are obviously delighted with the direction it is going in.“We actually saw it in 2024. It’s easy with hindsight now, but those narrow losses in 24, we knew the trajectory the team was on. Narrow loss to Australia, the loss to New Zealand that could have gone the other way. I think what you’ve seen this year with the depth that the squad is building, the style of play he is developing, we are really happy with that. We haven’t got into any discussions about post-27.”Sweeney was speaking after the release of the RFU’s latest annual report which shows a net loss of £1.9m for the financial year after generating the second-highest revenue in its history. The accounts show a far more secure picture than the previous year’s which reported losses of £42m – largely due to fewer home fixtures because of the World Cup. Last year’s report prompteda scandalover Sweeney’s £358,000 bonus thattook his earnings to £1.1m. The latest accounts show that Sweeney was paid £702,000, down £40,000 on his previous basic salary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He insisted that staying remains the RFU’s “plan A” but again warned other options are on the table if ­Richmond council rules against the union. Wembley is understood to be among those options while ­Birmingham City haveunveiled plans for a new stadiumand expressed an ­interest in hosting rugby.The RFU’s preference is to stay at Twickenham but,as revealed by the Guardian, the union was dealt a blow when Richmond council decreed that the limit of three non-sporting events – and only one not on a Saturday – must remain. Licensing and planning applications are run in parallel and the RFU will still make a planning application next year and, if successful, reapply for a new licence.“I met with Richmond a couple of weeks ago,” said Sweeney. “Good conversations, good dialogue. Very positive. They want to support us in terms of the direction we’re going in but it’s a process that’s on track. We’ve laid out very clearly for them what it means for us. Those events are essential for us if we’re to reinvest in the stadium and the stadium needs reinvestment to keep pace with other stadiums. It’s not a grandstanding negotiation tactic.“And our plan A is to stay. We contribute over £90m to the local economy and well over £100m to the greater London economy. They want us to stay here but purely from a financial validity point, it’s essential we get those extra events. I’m confident. You can’t put all your eggs in one basket, so you have to have a plan B and even a plan C and D which are viable.“We’re confident with the plans that we’ve got in place. We’re confident we can attract all the rugby events we want here and sufficient entertainment events as well. If we get those 15, it’s a very financially viable model.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickRugby Football UnionSport politicsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Bolsonaro has been living under house arrest since August and was taken into preventive custody on Saturday afterunsuccessfully trying to cut off his electronic ankle tag with a soldering iron.Jailhouse shock: Brazil coup monger Bolsonaro finally faces life behind barsRead moreBolsonaro’s six co-conspirators were also ordered to start their sentences.The former defence minister Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, and the former minister for institutional security Gen Augusto Heleno were arrested and imprisoned in the Planalto Military Command in Brasília. They received sentences of 19 and 21 years respectively.The former navy commander Adm Almir Garnier Santos, who received a 24-year sentence, was reportedly arrested by navy officials and held on a navy base.Bolsonaro’s former defence minister, Gen Walter Braga Netto, who received a 26-year sentence, was already in custodyhaving been arrested last December.The former justice minister,Anderson Torres, who received a 24-year sentence, was expected to be sent to a penitentiary for police officers and other “special” prisoners in Brasília called Papudinha.The former spy chief Alexandre Ramagem received a 16-year sentence, but recently fled to the US to avoid jail.Bolsonaro’s incarceration has sparked jubilation among progressive Brazilians who remember his four-year government as a calamitous spell of environmental devastation, international isolation and hostility to minorities. Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians died during a Covid outbreak Bolsonaro was accused ofcatastrophically mishandlingwith his anti-scientific stance.Mustafa Baba-Aissa, the owner of a Rio de Janeiro record store, has marked the historic occasion by decorating its facade with a white banner announcing: “Bolsonaro’s in jail!”“He’s a contemptible man who has done nothing with his life apart from living off public money …I’ve no idea how he was elected,” said the business owner, who plastered his shop’s windows with homemade posters celebrating Bolsonaro’s downfall.Bolsonaro supporters condemned the jailing of their leader, a paratrooper-turned-politicianwho was elected in 2018and posed as South America’s answer to Donald Trump.“He’s been kidnapped,” complained Ronny de Souza, a 43-year-old Bolsonaro activist, as he stood outside the federal police base where the politician was taken last weekend after being arrested amid suspicions he was about to abscond to a foreign embassy.Lenildo Mendes dos Santos Sertão, a politician​ from the Amazon who uses the nickname Delegado Caveira (“Police chief Skull”), claimed his ally was the victim of a witch-hunt. “He fought against the system and now the system has unfairly and illegally incarcerated him,” Sertão said.Bolsonaristas vowed to battle on, even with their movement’s helmsman in prison and out of the political game. “He represents millions of people in our country,” said Souza, predicting that large numbers of followers would flock to Brasília to protest Bolsonaro’s plight.But so far there has been no sign of mass protests or unrest, with only small groups of Bolsonaristas demonstrating and praying outside the federal police compound where he has spent the last three nights.Experts say the former president’s influence has waned dramatically in recent months, particularly after Bolsonaro was arrested for tampering with his ankle tag.Camila Rocha, a political scientist who studies Brazil’s new right, said recent polls revealed a clear decrease in support for Bolsonaro – both in the streets and social media. One study found that only 13% of voters now supported Bolsonaro “no matter what”. Last month, a rally in Brasília organized by Bolsonaro’s family drew about 2,000 people – far smaller than the huge crowds the former president mobilized when at the peak of his powers.“Could there be more protests? Sure. But I think this declining trend is established,” said Rocha, who saw Bolsonaro in “a dead-end situation”.Rocha believed Bolsonaro’s arrest was good news for the rightwing politicians hoping to inherit his votes, as well as for voters hoping to see “a reduction in anti-democratic extremism” in Brazil.Not all of the pro-Bolsonaro schemers sentenced over the coup could be imprisoned on Tuesday. Ramagem, the former head of Brazil’s intelligence agency, Abin, recently skipped the country despite having his passport cancelled.“I’m safe in the US,” Ramagem announced in a social media video on Monday, urging Bolsonaristas to take to the streets to defend “our greatest leader”.On Tuesday afternoon, as the plotters began to serve their sentences, there was no immediate sign citizens would heed his call.After visiting his father earlier in the day, Carlos Bolsonaro told reporters: “He’s psychologically devastated.”Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The bodies were not found until 2022, when an unsuspecting family pried open the contents of an abandoned storage locker they bought in an auction.Lee, who had long since changed her name and fled the country for South Korea, was extradited to face trial in New Zealand.The sentencing hearing on Wednesday heard how the murders had left deep emotional scars on Lee’s family.“If she wanted to die why didn’t she die alone?” Lee’s mother Choon Ja Lee said in a statement read to the court.The trial hinged not on whether Lee had murdered her children - which she had confessed to - but whether she knew her actions were morally wrong. Her lawyers had argued she was not guilty by reason of insanity and that the death of her husband in 2017 sent her into a depressive spiral.A forensic psychiatrist testified for the defence about Lee’s mental state - describing depression, suicidal thoughts, guilt, and a belief that killing her children was the right thing to do.But the prosecution had argued she knew what she was doing, pointing to her efforts to hide the bodies before fleeing the country.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The remaining 24 were all saved, according to a statement from the Nigerian president, Bola Tinubu, though no details were released about the rescue.“I am relieved that all the 24 girls have been accounted for. Now, we must put as a matter of urgency more boots on the ground in the vulnerable areas to avert further incidents of kidnapping,” the statement said.The attack in Kebbi was amonga spate of recent mass abductions in Nigeria, includinga raid on St Mary’s schoolin north-central Niger state on Friday, in which more than 300 students and staff from the Catholic school were abducted. Fifty students escaped over the weekend.Musa Rabi Magaji, principal of the primarily Muslim school in Kebbi, told the Associated Press that all of the girls had been released but that they were still in the custody of authorities. He had no immediate details of their condition.Abdulkarim Abdullahi, whose two daughters, aged 12 and 13, were among those abducted, said authorities told him the girls were being taken to the state capital of Birnin Kebbi.“I am excited to receive the news of their freedom. The past few days have been difficult for me and my family, especially their mother,” Abdullahi said in a telephone interview. “I will wait to see from the government about their wellbeing, but I can’t wait to see them in good health.”Meanwhile, 38 worshippers kidnapped during a deadly church attack in central Nigeria’s Kwara state have regained their freedom, Kwara Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq said in a statement on Sunday. Gunmen had attacked the Christ Apostolic church in Eruku on 18 November, killing two people and taking the others hostage.No group has claimed responsibility for the recent abductions, but analysts and locals say gangs of bandits often target schools, travellers and remote villagers in kidnappings. The gangs have used kidnapping for ransom as one way of dominating remote communities with little government and security presence.Authorities say the bandits are mostly former herders who have taken up arms against farming communities after clashes between them over strained resources.School kidnappings have come to define insecurity in Africa’s most populous nation, and armed gangs often see schools as strategic targets to draw more attention. At least 1,500 students have been seized in Nigeria sincethe infamous kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls more than a decade ago, and many of the children were released only after ransoms were paid.The kidnappings are happening as the US president, Donald Trump, hasclaimed that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria, although attacks have affected both Christians and Muslims.Arrests are rare and ransom payments are common in many of the hotspots in northern Nigeria.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The observations led to the notion of dark matter, a material that neither emits nor absorbs light, but exerts an unseen gravitational pull on the galaxies it surrounds.Scientists have searched for dark matter particles ever since, but so far ground-based detectors, space-based telescopes and vast machines such as the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva have drawn a blank.One of the many theories of dark matter postulates that it is made from so-called weakly interacting massive particles, or wimps, which are heavier than the protons found inside atoms, but barely interact with normal matter. When two wimps collide, they can annihilate one another, releasing other particles and a burst of gamma rays.To search for potential dark matter signals, Totani analysed data from Nasa’s Fermi Gamma-raySpaceTelescope, which detects the most energetic photons in the electromagnetic spectrum. He spotted a pattern of gamma rays that appeared to match the shape of the dark matter halo that spreads out in a sphere from the heart of the galaxy.The signal “closely matches the properties of gamma-ray radiation predicted to be emitted by dark matter,” Totani told the Guardian. Details arepublishedin theJournal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics.If Totani has seen dark matter at work, the observations suggest it is made from elementary particles 500 times more massive than the proton. But far more work is needed to rule out other astrophysical processes and background emissions that could explain the signals.Totani said the “decisive factor” would be detecting gamma rays with the same spectrum from other regions of space, such as dwarf galaxies. According to Prof Justin Read, an astrophysicist at the University of Surrey, the lack of significant signals from such galaxies strongly argues against Totani having seen gamma rays emitted from dark matter particle annihilation.Prof Kinwah Wu, a theoretical astrophysicist at UCL, also urged caution. “I appreciate the author’s hard work and dedication, but we need extraordinary evidence for an extraordinary claim,” he said. “This analysis has not reached this status yet. It is a piece of work which serves as an encouragement for the workers in the field to keep on pressing.”Explore more on these topicsScienceAstronomySpacePhysicsnewsShareReuse this content"

At the very least, the court should provide a clear and credible explanation for such a change.”The chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, who is hearing criminal cases of people alleged to have shown support for Palestine Action, said recently that Chamberlain had told him he was expecting to reach a decision in the judicial review by Christmas. Despite the change of trial judges, Chamberlain has still been presiding over application hearings this week in relation to the judicial review.The three judges who will now hear the case are the president of the high court’s king’s bench division, Dame Victoria Sharp, Mrs Justice Steyn and Mr Justice Swift.A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries, which has organised demonstrations against the proscription of Palestine Action, said Chamberlain was “widely respected for his fairness and independence” and “had been consistently confirmed as the judge presiding over this judicial review – in court documents, correspondence, and in related criminal hearings involving peaceful protesters arrested for holding signs.“If Dame Sharp believed a panel of judges was necessary, the usual process would have been to add judges to sit alongside him, not to remove Chamberlain entirely – especially as he is one of the most senior judges on the high court bench, so this cannot be explained on grounds of seniority.“In a case of such national significance – determining whether [more than] 2,350 peaceful protesters will continue to be criminalised as ‘terrorists’for holding cardboard signs[saying ‘I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action’] the public deserves transparency, not backroom manoeuvres to cherrypick judges, threatening the fundamental principle of judicial independence.”In the F-35 exports judicial review, Chamberlain was replaced by Steyn and Lord Justice Males. They found that Britain’s decision to allow the export of F-35 fighter jet components to Israelwas lawful, despite accepting they could be used in breach of international humanitarian law in Gaza.Emily Apple, the media coordinator for Campaign Against the Arms Trade, called Chamberlain’s removal from the Palestine Action case “deeply alarming” and urged the court to explain the reasoning behind it.“This raises serious questions around the lack of impartiality and transparency in our judicial system, and whether this is now a pattern in significant legal cases concerning Palestine,” she said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They had been stuck there for more than 12 hours, dozens of ministers representing 17 groups of countries, from the poorest on the planet to the richest, urged by the Brazilian hosts to accept a settlement cooked up the day before.Tempers were short, the air thick as the sweaty and exhausted delegates faced up to reality: there would not be a deal here in Brazil. The30th UN climate conferencewould end in abject failure.The sticking point was fossil fuels. As science has told us for well over a century, the carbon dioxide that burning them produces is heating up the planet, now to dangerous levels.But in more than 30 years of annual climate meetings, the need for that to halt has been mentioned only once – in aresolution made two years ago, at Cop28 in Dubai, to “transition away from fossil fuels”. Delegates from the Arab Group of 22 nations, from Russia, and from a sprinkling of others, were determined it would not happen again.A growing number of countries, however, were equally determined that progress on this was urgently necessary. They had come up with a plan, which was gathering more and more support, and they made it clear they were prepared to dig in.Meanwhile, developing countries desperately wanted to move forward on securing the money that would help them cope with the already disastrous impacts of extreme weather.By the early hours of Saturday, some delegates were ready to walk out and force a collapse. “It was on the edge for us,” said Ed Miliband, the UK energy minister. “I was prepared to walk away.”The breakthrough, when it came, was with Saudi Arabia. Soon after 6am, Miliband and the EU climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, split from the main group to hold a private conversation with the chief Saudi negotiator, Khalid Abuleif. They pressed on him wording that would obliquely recognise the global commitment to “transition away from fossil fuels” made two years ago in Dubai. Rather than explicitly namecheck fossil fuels, it would refer to “the UAE consensus”, the name given to the Cop28 deal.Khalid agreed to take it away and reflect. Ministers around the room held out little hope – Saudi had been obdurate all night.An hour later, he returned. To great surprise, the wording was accepted. The room collapsed into relief. Applause rang out. The deal was done.With the “Belém political package”, the worldtook another small step towards the phaseout of fossil fuels– a faltering, inadequate step, and one that will barely interrupt the climate’s steady march towards catastrophe. But asignificant departure from total inaction nonetheless.Alongside the oblique commitment in the legally agreed text of the deal, countries will begin work on a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels, but this will be largely a voluntary initiative, led by Brazil, that will report back next year. Addressing the cuts in greenhouse gas emissions needed in order for the world to stay within the 1.5C limit was also put off to next year. Developing countries secured a tripling to $120bn of annual finance to help them adapt to the impacts of extreme weather, but that sum will not be delivered in full until 2035. Workers will benefit from a “just transition mechanism” to help people working in high-carbon industries to shift to the clean economy, but commitments to include “critical minerals” – needed for renewable energy components, but whose extraction has been dogged by human rights abuses – were excised, at the behest of China and Russia.As the world teeters on the brink of climate“tipping points”that could destroy ecosystems and plunge whole regions into chaos, it wasnot the “giant leap” needed. “Cop30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion,” warned Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank.This flawed deal might have been all that was possible, given thegeopolitical headwinds– a US president who shunned the talks and is wedded to oil and coal, the rising tide of rightwing populism, conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, intolerable levels of inequality, and global economic uncertainty.“The climate arsonists – the fossil fuel giants – were finally in the crosshairs atCop30,” says Louise Hutchins, convener at the Make Polluters Pay coalition. “There is no turning back on that. The political space is open. Now we must turn it into a real fire escape to a safer world.”But while nations were able to applaud the gavelling through of the deal, Cop30 also revealed deep fissures in the only global process for tackling the climate crisis. “Cops are consensus-based, and in a period of geopolitical divides, consensus is ever harder to reach,” said António Guterres, the UN secretary general. “I cannot pretend that Cop30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”If the world is to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown, the UN climate talks alone will not be nearly enough.In search of a roadmapView image in fullscreenBrazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.Photograph: André Penner/APWhen Brazil set out tohost Cop30, it had one key objective: to“send a strong signal that multilateralism is working”. Multilateralism means taking a global approach, seeking collective action to solve pressing problems. The UN framework convention on climate change, signed in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, is one of the few remaining multilateral enterprises, acknowledging that all countries have an equal say in the future of the planet, the poor and vulnerable as much as the rich who historically caused the problem.But around the world, this equitable approach is faltering. Trump rejects all forms of it, preferring to strike his own deals with favoured nations and issue tariffs and other threats seemingly on a whim. He has taken the US out of the Paris climate agreement for a second time and, though still entitled to take part in the annual talks, the US sent no delegation to Cop30.The absence was constantly felt. At first, the conference halls buzzed with the worry that the US would take the bullying approach – “thuggery”, was how Andrew Forrest, the Australian billionaire, described it to the Guardian – thatforced small countries to back down on a hoped-for carbon levy on shipping at International Maritime Organisations talksthis autumn.In the end, the US did not interfere in any overt way at Cop30. Perhaps it did not need to: Saudi Arabia, an ally of Trump, was an effective blocker.All countries agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels” at Cop28 in 2023, which was presided over by an oilman –Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the United Arab Emirates’ national oil company, Adnoc. Perhaps only an oil executive could have pulled off the coup that was including fossil fuels in the text. Yet as soon as that commitment was signed, some countries sought to unpick it, with Saudi Arabia claiming it was only one of a menu of options, and by the time the next Cop rolled round –in another dictatorship dependent on oil exports, Azerbaijan– the petrostate had marshalled allies to ensure attempts to build on the resolution failed.For some, that should have been the end of the story. One negotiator from the Middle East told the Guardian: “The [resolution] was passed at Cop28. We should not need to return to it. Now it is for every country to interpret it in their own circumstances – bringing it up again at Cop is trying to impinge on national sovereignty.”Those in favour of the phaseout, however – including scientists, who have said clearly it is needed if the world is not to stray further into the climate danger zone – argued that the “UAE consensus” was only a first step. At Cops, it is common to agree a step forward in principle one year, and then in future years “operationalise” the commitment through an agreed course of action.The way forward, many experts decided, was for a “roadmap” to the transition to be drawn up. Johan Rockström, professor of earth systems sciences at the Potsdam Climate Institute, said: “The truth is that our only chance of keeping 1.5C within reach is to bend the global curve of emissions downward in 2026 and then reduce emissions by at least 5% a year. [That] requires concrete roadmaps to accelerate the phaseout of fossil fuels and protection of nature.”Such a roadmap would have to be approached delicately in order to keep every country onboard. It would have to be open to all, but contain nothing that would force any country to act or set timetables for their fossil fuel production or use. Everything would be voluntary. Laurence Tubiana, an architect of the Paris agreement, now chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, dismissed claims from oil-producing countries that such a process would infringe their national sovereignty. “Every country has to imagine for itself what policies they want, what role they have to play, and what ambition they have,” she said.Long before Cop30, more than a year ago, Brazil had already set out its intention for a phaseout of fossil fuels, in itsnational climate plan under the Paris agreement, known as anationally determined contribution (NDC).The linchpin was Marina Silva, Brazil’s charismatic environment minister. Ahead of Cop30, she expressed support for a phaseout, and took the idea to the UN general assembly in September. It was at her urging that Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, referred to a phaseout at least three times during the summit, while she addressed several high-level ministerial meetings on the subject. In anexclusive interview with the Guardian during the first week of Cop30, she urged all countries to find the courage to make the move.View image in fullscreenMarina Silva speaks during Cop30.Photograph: Mauro Pimentel/AFP/Getty ImagesBut Lula holds together a fragile coalition government. Itamaraty, Brazil’s foreign ministry, was known to be against commitments on fossil fuels, preferring to emphasise the country’s newfound role as a major oil and gas exporter. And Silva was not made president of the Cop talks, as some had expected. Instead, that job went to André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran diplomat. Tall, handsome and genial, do Lago is much admired among fellow negotiators. He joked with them during the first week of the talks that the sessions should be considered “therapy”, and invited them to send him “love letters” expressing their negotiating positions. But no one gets through two decades of Cops without a core of steel, and do Lago has been, nearly his entire career, an Itamaraty man.Though do Lago insisted to the Guardian that he “hoped” a fossil fuel phase-out could be included, some people within the negotiations tell a different story. “He was against the fossil fuel phaseoutbeing on the agenda, being in the text, throughout,” one insider told the Guardian. “It was do Lago who wanted it out [of the text],” said another delegate. “He only listened to the Arab Group,” said a third. He was accused of overstating the opposition to text on the phaseout, and trying to railroad through text with fossil fuel commitments excised.Do Lago told the Guardian he had tried hard to retain wording on the transition away from fossil fuels in the text. “It is incorrect to say I did not want it,” he told the Guardian after the conclusion of Cop30. “I not only wanted it, I put it in there. This was President Lula’s very clear message. But unfortunately, my job as president to have a document that can fly. I can’t propose something that I know is dead from the start.”He said “a large number of countries’ had made known they would not accept it. “This is the problem with consensus,” he said. “Everyone has a veto.”Aware of Brazil’s divisions, supporters of the phaseout had spent months quietly recruiting developing countries to their cause. Colombia was the originator, but others including Kenya, Sierra Leone and even oil-rich Nigeria came onboard, as well as the coal-dependent Philippines, and coal-producing Mongolia. The European Union, once a leader on climate action, was less clearcut and ministers arrived in Belém without an agreed position, but came onboard with a bang in the second week.The following day more than 80 countries issued their call for the roadmap in adramatic intervention. More than 20 ministers crowded the platform, standing in two rows as Tina Stege, climate envoy of the Marshall Islands, exhorted: “Let’s get behind the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, let’s work together and make it a plan!” NGO Greenpeace described the event as “the turning point” of the conference.But the Brazilian presidency remained downbeat on the plan. Though hetold the Guardian that the divide over the issue could be bridged, do Lago kept insisting 80 countries were against the plan, though these figures were never substantiated. One negotiator told the Guardian: “We don’t understand where that number comes from.”A clue came when Richard Muyungi, the Tanzanian climate envoy who chairs the African Group of Nations, told a closed meeting that all its 54 members aligned with the 22-member Arab Group on the issue. But several African countries told the Guardian this was not true and that they supported the phaseout – and Tanzania has a deal with Saudi Arabia to exploit its gas reserves.In the short time remaining – just three days to go before the official deadline of Friday evening – delegations worked feverishly behind the scenes. China, having demurred on the issue, indicated it would not stand in the way; India also did not object. The anti-roadmap position crystallised: Saudi Arabia, the Arab Group and Russia were the prime movers, steadfastly blocking any mention of the roadmap.An early draft of text that would be the main outcome of the conference included wording on the phaseout. It was replaced on Wednesday with a new draft that removed it. In response, as the Guardian revealed,29 countries wrote to the presidency late on Thursday night– just hours after afire in the conference centre forced a full evacuation– all but threatening a walkout if the issue was not included in the text.By then, however, it was very late in the Cop process. Typically, big ideas need months, if not years, of careful preparation, floating the concept, gathering allies, working out where obstacles lie, wooing neutral countries. Attempting to foist a whole new idea on to the agenda in the late stages was regarded by some as unacceptable – one person close to the Arab Group told the Guardian the Cop had been “hijacked”.At 5pm on Friday, the presidency called ministers into its offices for the final take-it-or-leave-it talks. At that point, the text was barren of references to fossil fuels in any form, and movement was looking almost impossible. Cop veterans settled in for a long night.A political compromiseWhile ministers were stuck in the sweaty conference room in the Brazilian presidency’s private suite within the sprawling Cop30 complex, thousands of miles away in Johannesburg a separate set of meetings was taking place.South Africa hosted this year’s G20 talks, which coincided with the final hours of Cop30.Brazil’s Lula da Silva, fresh from an appearance in Belém, used his meetings with world leaders in South Africa to push for a stronger settlement at Cop30. His key goal was the pursuit of a side deal with the EU that would transform the outcome of the climate conference for the developing world. Lula’s charm won the day – the EU made a U-turn on the key issue of adaptation.Developing countries’ central demand at Cop30 was atripling of the finance available, from publicly funded developed country sources, to help them adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. Adaptation is now crucial: some countries are already spending up to a 10th of their national budgets on coping with the impacts of droughts, floods and storms, soaking up money they could otherwise spend on health, education or public services.Only a few days earlier, a senior EU minister had told the Guardian that the tripling was not going to happen. But when Lula spoke to Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the immovable became a possibility.Even a tripling to $120bn falls far short of the $300bn a year developing countries are estimated to need by 2035, and countries were denied the 2030 deadline they wanted – as well as for the money to be additional to the $300bn in public funds developed countries have already promised. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, Bangladesh’s environment adviser, said: “The tripling is a political compromise position, not one that displays the urgency required.”Within the final text, the commitment is couched in slightly ambiguous language: the text “calls for efforts” rather than insists on the tripling. But developed and developing countries have assured the Guardian that they regard it as a firm target, and for many campaigners it was a highlight amid otherwise frustrating talks.This compromise on adaptation funding, according to several insiders, was a spur to Saudi Arabia agreeing the final Cop30 text. The kingdom feared looking isolated, and being blamed if the talks collapsed. At 7.15am on Saturday, Khalid finally agreed that a reference in the text to “the UAE consensus” – an oblique nod to the “transition away from fossil fuels”, which was the key part of that consensus – could be retained.‘A roadmap to a roadmap’View image in fullscreenTechnicians install solar panels at a factory in Nairobi, Kenya.Photograph: Luis Tato/AFP/Getty ImagesA legal text that refers only obliquely to the “transition away from fossil fuels”, and a non-binding side agreement to report back to a future meeting on a forum to discuss an eventual phaseout – a “roadmap to a roadmap” as one campaigner put it – may sound like a dangerously weak deal.But many observers and parties to the talks told the Guardian that the roadmap idea would dominate future Cops. And the convoluted Cop process can be its own strength – the report that is produced on the roadmap could be “adopted”, “recognised” or “welcomed” by a future Cop, giving it legal standing within the process.Claudio Angelo, the head of international policy at Brazil’s Observatorio do Clima thinktank, said: “This conversation has become inevitable, and we must ride this wave now.”“A week before this Cop kicked off, the idea that a hugely diverse group of over 80 [developed and developing] countries would actively push for a formal way forward on the global phaseout of fossil fuels was right at the limits of even the most optimistic expectations,” added Leo Roberts, of the E3G thinktank. “Of course the best outcome [would have been] a formal universally agreed text. But the signal from this Cop is clear: a big and growing number of countries recognise that a managed, collectively navigated route to fossil fuel phaseout is preferable to the chaotic absence of planning we currently have. The Cop is finally showing it can be a place in which the transition away from fossil fuels can be openly discussed. You can’t put that back in the box.”Outside the windowless negotiating rooms of the sclerotic UN process, the real world is moving fast.Renewable power surpassed coal this year, and investment in clean energy, at $2tn a year, is now double that going into fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency.More than half of China’s power generation capacity is now low-carbon, and half of its new cars electric. India has met its renewable targets five years early, solar panels this year became Pakistan’s largest power source, and at last Africa – with the world’s biggest capacity for solar generation, but long overlooked when it came to investment – isseeing a surge.For many, it is this progress in the real economy, rather than the negotiations, that is now the major source of hope. Al Gore, the former US vice-president and veteran climate campaigner, pointed to the revolution already under way. “Just as we have passed peak Trump,” he said, “I believe we have also passed peak petrostate. They may be able to veto diplomatic action, but they can’t veto real world action... the rest of the world is fed up with delay and denial.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Fossil fuelsClimate crisisBrazilEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

It warns that 2,955 other terrestrial or freshwater species are at serious risk because they are confined to five locations or fewer.TheSpecies in Peril reportis billed as the first in the UK to identify the rarest species based on how geographically limited they are.Some of those at risk are beloved creatures and plants such as black grouse and the high brown fritillary butterfly. On the list are 25 bird species, five fishes, six mammals and one amphibian – the natterjack toad.View image in fullscreenA natterjack toad is another of the creatures said to be at risk.Photograph: Natural Resources WalesMammals in peril include five bat species, such as Bechstein’s bat, confined to the Wye valley in south-east Wales, and the Skomer vole, which lives onlyon the island of Skomeroff the south-west coast. There are also more than 2,000 invertebrates, 309 fungi and 321 lichens on the list.Prof Steve Ormerod, of Cardiff University and NRW, said the climate emergency and agricultural intensification were key pressures in the wider environmental crisis.But he said that in the case of species with very restricted distribution, the pressures were often more local: woodland management in which trees or deadwood were lost, changes to water levels in peatland or pollution in ponds, lakes or streams.Can mountain lions make a comeback in the US north-east? One group hopes soRead more“This report is a stark reminder that nature in Wales is in a precarious position – both in the large number of species in peril, and in the trajectories they display,” said Ormerod.But the report includes a glimmer of optimism. It says for most species in peril, safeguarding and enhancing of populations comes at relatively little financial cost. It says it could be achieved, in many cases, by tweaking existing management such as strimming vegetation to provide more open conditions.Ormerod said: “We can glimpse hope through the conservation actions under way: scrub clearance, the remobilisation of sand dunes, positive habitat management for invertebrates, captive rearing and release, enhanced biosecurity on islands.”One example of a relatively simple change that has proved beneficial is the introduction of goats to graze at Stanner Rocks in Powys, which is helping preserve plants such as the Radnor lily.View image in fullscreenThe Radnor lily thrives on the igneous slabs of Stanner Rocks in Powys.Photograph: Natural Resources WalesOf the 2,955 species the report highlighted, almost half – 1,262 – are restricted to single locations. It flags up some remarkable conservation hotspots, such asNewborough Forest and Warren on Anglesey (Ynys Môn), which is supporting 130 species judged to be in peril.Analysis shows that woodland, parkland and scrub is the most important of the ecosystems for species in peril, with nearly a third (1,076 species) restricted to this ecosystem, followed by grassland (531) and peatland (356).Mary Lewis, the head of natural resource management policy at NRW, said: “This report makes it clear that we aren’t simply at risk of seeing species going extinct in Wales, it’s already happening. As a country, we need to take the threat seriously.“Despite this sobering reality, it’s encouraging that we can do a lot to protect these species through surprisingly modest investment and changes to how we manage our landscapes. With three-quarters of these species on protected sites, we have the framework to act.”The Welsh government said it was working hard to address the climate and nature emergency.It said its Nature Networks and Natur am Byth [Nature Forever] programmes were tackling the crisis head-on by restoring habitats and taking targeted action to support the country’s most at-risk species.The environment (principles, governance and biodiversity targets) (Wales) bill, introduced in June, was a crucial piece of legislation that would empower it to safeguard its environment, the government said.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeConservationWalesBirdsButterfliesMammalsInvertebratesnewsShareReuse this content"

Across the country, 450 locations have bathing water status and are tested during the summer season, from May to September. Last year a record number of areas – 37, or 8.2% –did not meet the minimum standardsfor bathing waters and were classified as poor.Rivers, lakes and seas are polluted by agricultural run-off and sewage pollution dumped by water companies. This makes up almost all of the pollution in England’s waterways, but the Environment Agency has also blamed “birds and dogs” for the poor results.Feargal Sharkey, the former Undertones frontman and water campaigner, told the Guardian: “The EA has started this thing of blaming seagulls and blaming dogs for pooing on beaches, because if they blame water companies at all it’s a failure of regulation and that’s their fault, whereas they don’t regulate seagulls shitting. It is an act of gross incompetence, much like its regulation of the environment, to blame seagulls for the failure of water companies.”View image in fullscreenThe water quality at Bognor Regis, West Sussex, was also rated ‘poor’.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianFewer waterways are likely to be granted bathing status in future. Ministersrecently announceda feasibility test on any waterway where a community is seeking a bathing water designation. If water bodies are deemed too polluted to improve to at least “sufficient” water quality, they will not be given a designation.River campaigners have said the restriction is very likely to exclude river sites from being granted bathing water status. No single stretch of river in England is in good overall health and the rivers that have bathing water status at the moment all record poor water quality as a result of sewage and agricultural pollution.The UK is still using the EU’s bathing water status framework to measure the quality of lakes, rivers and seas. Butrecent researchfound England’s waterways with bathing status are five times more likely to be polluted than those in the EU.People swim and boat in far more waterways than are designated for bathing. A recentgovernment analysisof the ways that England’s waterways are used for recreation found 3,347 “water recreation locations” in rivers, lakes and seas around the country.

Now, after international climate talks spluttered to a meagre conclusion, the US finds itself grouped with unflattering company – an “axis of obstruction” that has stymied progress on the climate crisis.Donald Trump’s administration opted to not send anyone to the UN climate summit in Brazil thatculminatedover the weekend – a first for the US in 30 years of these annual gatherings and another representation of the president’s disdain for the climate crisis, which he has called a “hoax” and a “con job”.But even without the administration touting “drill, baby, drill” at the grey conference center in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon river, 194 other countries were unable to bring down the curtain on the era of coal, oil and gas. The words “fossil fuel” were not mentionedin the agreementtext after fierce opposition led by Saudi Arabia, which has previously been cajoled by the US to take a more moderate line at climate talks.Michael Jacobs, of the thinktank ODI Global and the University of Sheffield, said that theCop30summit revealed “an increasingly bitter conflict at the heart of global climate politics: between those who accept the scientific fact that to deal with climate change the world must wean itself off fossil fuels over the coming decades; and those who are actively resisting this in pursuit of their short-term energy interests”.The US can now be considered in the latter group, along with Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Russia, according to Jacobs. “I think today we have witnessed what the three countries have agreed,” he said of Trump’s separate dealings withSaudi ArabiaandRussiaover the past week.“Geopolitically, this is the creation of a new axis of obstruction – actively promoting fossil fuels and opposed to climate action.”The US now finds itself ranged against a loose coalition of about 90 countries, including much of Europe, that demanded a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels – the root cause of the worsening climate crisis – in Belém.This group will convene in a separate summit in Colombia in April to further this goal, amid impatience with the ponderous, consensus-driven UN framework on the climate crisis that barely held in place at Cop30.“Even without the Trump administration there to bully and cajole, petrostates again shut down meaningful progress on a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels with necessary funding for poorer countries,” said Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity.If a world of petrostates and “electrostates” is forming, the Trump administration is adamant the US remain in the first group. Over the course of Cop30, the administration busied itself with some stark counter-programming in the US – stripping protections from streams and wetlands, making it harder to prevent species from becoming extinct andusheringoil and gas drilling into more than 1bn acres of US waters.This last measure includes new drilling in pristine areas of the Arctic and, in a sort of trollish move timed for the visit of the California governor, Gavin Newsom, to Cop30, the prospect of oil rigs off the coast of California (Newsom has said this will happen “over my dead body”).“President Trump has been clear: he will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman. “President Trump serves the American people, not radical climate activists who have fallen victim to the biggest scam of the century.”But while Cop30 ended in frustration, there was recognition from observers that the world is still moving away from the age of fossil fuels, withdoublethe amount, globally, invested in renewables like wind and solar than traditional energy sources last year.And while China didn’t fully step into the leadership vacuum in Belém, it is certainly leading as a clean energy superpower, even outstripping its antediluvian competitor – China is nowmaking more moneyfrom exporting green technology than America earns from exporting fossil fuels.Even in the US, there is little appetite for Trump’s climate revanchism. Two-thirds of American votersopposethe president’s decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, while clear majorities want action to slash planet-heating emissions and are worried about the heatwaves, floods, storms and other climate-driven calamities that arepushing up insurance ratesand harming Americans’health.If there is an axis of obstruction, it may be able to slow the transition down but is unlikely to halt it altogether. “The rest of the world is fed up with delay and denial,” as Al Gore, the former US vice-president, put it in the wake of the Cop30 outcome.“Ultimately, petrostates, the fossil-fuel industry, and their allies are losing power. Just as we have passed Peak Trump, I believe we have also passed Peak Petrostate. They may be able to veto diplomatic language, but they can’t veto real-world action.”Explore more on these topicsCop30US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We are not saying that we’re expecting any of those to exit in a disorderly way imminently,” she said.The committee heard that smaller institutions were at greater risk. Of the 50 identified, 30 were described as “smaller” while the rest each had in excess of 3,000 students. “So we think about them as large in this context,” Lapworth said.As well as universities, a range of smaller higher education institutions that are often specialist providers are registered with the OfS. “The pattern generally is that the smaller ones are those that we are more worried about,” Lapworth added.The committee heard that a number of providers had already exited the market, including Schumacher College in Devon, which closed its degree-awarding courses with immediate effect last year, plus the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts (ALRA),which closed in 2022.Of the 24 institutions revealed to be at risk of exiting the market within 12 months, 17 were described as small and the remaining seven each had more than 3,000 students. By way of context, England’s biggest universities have tens of thousands of students.The committee chair, Helen Hayes, said MPs had been told during a confidential roundtable discussion with universities that an unnamed provider could collapse before the end of the year. “Given that we are in late November now, that was a warning of a potential imminent collapse of a higher education institution.”The universities minister, Jacqui Smith, who was also giving evidence, was asked if that was her understanding of the urgency of the situation facing some universities. Smith replied: “I don’t think I would necessarily say before the end of the year that there is an imminent collapse, no.”She accepted however that the government needed to bring financial sustainability to the sector, which is why it had agreedto allow an increase in domestic tuition feesin line with inflation.Smith defended the proposed introduction of a levy on international student tuition fees, details of which will be outlined in Wednesday’s budget, saying it would fund maintenance grants for disadvantaged students.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “This government inherited a university sector facing serious financial challenges, with tuition fees frozen for seven years.They added: “We have taken action to put the sector on a secure financial footing, including committing to raise the maximum cap on tuition fees annually and refocusing the OfS to support universities to face the challenges of the future.”Explore more on these topicsUniversitiesUniversity fundingHigher educationOffice for StudentsTuition feesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

We’ve got a 200-metre perimeter around the scene. We’ll make sure that everyone keeps away.“It’s going to be a very, very busy scene of operations for the foreseeable future, certainly overnight.“So, we would ask members of the public to keep away, keep a safe distance and allow the fire brigade to do their job.”0:39Huge fire breaks out in west London warehouse – videoCrews from Southall, Heston, Ealing and surrounding fire stations were responding to the blaze, the LFB added.Three turntable ladders had been deployed previously to allow crews to fight the fire from height, but firefighters have since withdrawn for safety reasons.Earlier, Pat Goulbourne, the brigade’s incident commander said: “All firefighters have withdrawn to a safe distance and are now fighting the fire from a greater distance to ensure crew safety.“Firefighters are working hard to bring this fire safely under control. Due to the complex nature of the site, and the size of the fire, this will be a protracted incident with crews continuing firefighting operations through the day,” he added.View image in fullscreenThe fire at the two-storey warehouse in Southall, west London.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesGoulbourne said the fire was producing a large amount of smoke, and advised residents to close their doors and windows until the fire was put out.

No one knows’: six-seven meme invades UK classroomsRead moreBefore long, other members of the class are joining in and laughing hysterically.“That was a bit wild,” Starmer says as he exits the classroom, before he is swiftly reprimanded by the school’s headteacher, Jo Anderson. “You know children get in trouble for saying that in our school?”The prime minister, who was visiting the school along with the education secretary,Bridget Phillipson, apologises as he walks down the corridor, adding: “I didn’t start it, Miss.”The phrase “six-seven” appears to originate with the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla’s 2024 track Doot Doot (6 7), in which it’s either a reference to police radio code, or 67th Street.But it really went viral when the song was repeatedly used to soundtrack video clips of the NBA basketball star LaMelo Ball, who is 6ft 7in.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerChildrenSocial mediaBridget PhillipsonnewsShareReuse this content"

But sometime in September – according to satellite images of the site – the vast mountain of waste was dumped.The EA said that after officers became aware of continued activity on the site they were granted a court order to close it on 23 October.Last week, the agency said its officials visited the field and agreed a plan for deploying additional protective barriers to stop the waste polluting the river.The EA said: “They will now be working with urgency to get these in place to help minimise the movement of waste moving into the River Cherwell if heavy rainfall or flooding occurs, and protect the environment.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Gaza health ministry said on Monday that at least 342 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli fire since the start of the truce. Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed by militant gunfire in the same period.Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a smaller allied militant faction, said on Tuesday that they were preparing to hand over the remains of another Israeli hostage in line with the terms of the ceasefire deal. A spokesperson for Islamic Jihad said the body of the hostage had been found on Monday during search operations in central Gaza.Israel said the delay in handing over the remains was a violation of the ceasefire.There is little clarity about how the challenges of implementing the more immediate requirements ofDonald Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza will be met, let alone longer-term questions of reconstruction.The two-year war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 during a surprise incursion into Israel on 7 October 2023. More than 69,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in the ensuing Israeli offensive and in strikes since the ceasefire. The bodies of thousands moreremain under the rubble.Road network damage in GazaConditions in Gaza, which has been effectively split since the ceasefire with Israeli military forces controlling just over half of the territory,are extremely difficult.In its most recent update, the World Food Programme (WFP) said most households in Gaza were unable to afford basic food items. It said prices had dropped steeply in recent weeks, but the quantity of food consumed daily was still well below pre-war levels.Diets are dominated by cereals, pulses and moderate amounts of dairy and oil, with very limited meat, vegetables and fruit, the WFP said, while cooking gas was scarce, forcing many families to rely on burning discarded plastic or other alternative fuels to cook.Since the start of the ceasefire, Hamas has released all the 20 living hostages it was holding and returned the remains of all but three of the 25 dead hostages. In exchange, Israel has released nearly 2,000 prisoners in its custody and returned the bodies of hundreds of dead Palestinians.The UN security council gave formal backing last week to Trump’s plan, which calls for an interim technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza, overseen by an international “board of peace” and backed by an international security force.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But then Trump lobbied for the film to his friend and backer Larry Ellison, the largest shareholder of the new Paramount Skydance – which, earlier this year, as Paramount Global,settled a lawsuit with Trumpover a critical CBS News interview with the president.Trump wants to revive the Rush Hour franchise. Is he eyeing a return to Hollywood?Read moreAccording toPuck’s Matthew Belloni, Paramount has secured funding for the film and agreed to a distribution deal with Warner Bros, which previously owned the fast-talking buddy-cop franchise under its New Line banner. “Get ready for the dumbest possible state-controlled media,” Belloni wrote on social media.Ratner was accused of numerous instances of sexual assault in 2017, which derailed his career. He sued Melanie Kohler, a former employee of the Endeavor Talent Agency whoallegedthe director “preyed” on her at a club and raped her at the home of Robert Evans, the famed Hollywood producer, for defamation after she came forward; the two settled in 2018. In a statement from 2017, Kohler said she hoped Ratner would be held “accountable for the way he’s treated the nobodies of the world or at least the way he treated me”.Ratner most recentlydirected a $40m documentaryabout Melania Trump for Amazon MGM Studios, owned by Jeff Bezos, the billionaire Amazon CEO, who has also maintained friendly relations with the president. The film is set to hit theaters on 30 January.The first three Rush Hour films grossed over $850m worldwide and became hugely popular in China.A fourth film was long in the works, though Ratner struggled to secure financing despite the movie industry’s increasing reliance on franchise fare and recycled IP.“Does the world really need or want Rush Hour 4?” the Guardian’s Peter Bradshawwrote. “If it did, surely we would have it by now? Market forces in the brutally commercial Darwinian jungle of franchise cinema would have created Rush Hour 4.”The new film is widely seen as part of Trump’s second-term efforts to reintroduce old-fashioned masculinity into Hollywood culture, afterappointingSylvester Stallone, Jon Voight and Mel Gibson unofficial “special ambassadors” to Hollywood.Explore more on these topicsParamount PicturesComedy filmsComedyDonald TrumpJackie ChannewsShareReuse this content"

Time and time again promises have been broken and Britain’s reputation as a clean and fair place to do business has been dragged through the mud.“Those overseas territories which continue to block and frustrate the will of parliament are letting the rest of the British family down, including those jurisdictions which have already acted in good faith and opened up their books.”The government’s anti-corruption champion Margaret Hodge visited the BVI in September and said she hoped the joint ministerial council would be the occasion where an agreement on registers was reached. Lady Hodge was instrumental in passing the original laws requiring all BOTs to make registers publicly available.At the last council meeting in 2024, all BOTs that had not already done so agreed to design and implement open corporate registers by June 2025. The UK originally set a deadline of December 2023 for the preparation of public registers, giving them more than five years since the original legislation was passed.In defining those with a legitimate interest, the BVI includes anyone seeking to investigate, prevent or detect money laundering, terrorist financing or proliferation financing, but it also states the registrar can deny access if it believes it is in the public interest of the BVI to do so. The relevant company would have to be notified if a request was being made.The BVI is thought to have 12 companies registered for every individual BVI citizen. The Financial Action Task Force grey-listed the BVI in June 2025, citing its lack of transparency surrounding beneficial ownership.Transparency International said the BVI rules meant “legitimate interest users will only see a subset of data, rather than what is being submitted to the register. This means users will most likely end up seeing the name of nominee shareholders or trustees holding the company on behalf of a hidden beneficiary.”Explore more on these topicsBritish Virgin IslandsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeAmericasRegulatorsCorporate governanceTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

It would also have been in operation by 2035.Alexander said the government would nowreview the airports national policy statement, needed for the runway to progress, with a full public consultation by July next year.Heathrow third runway mapA Heathrow spokesperson welcomed the decision, saying expanding the airport “will mean more connectivity, increased trade, improved passenger experience and a huge economic boost for the British businesses that will help design and build it”.They said, however, that “further clarity” was needed on how the next phase of the project would be regulated, calling for “definitive decisions” from government and the Civil Aviation Authority in the coming weeks.The hotels tycoon Surinder Arora, the chair of the Arora Group, said his company would continue to aim to build the runway, despite its own proposal being turned down. He said: “The option for a promoter other than Heathrow Airport Ltd remains possible. It’s imperative there is a clear and transparent process for selecting a promoter to ensure it best serves the interests of consumers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are now reviewing how our plans will be adjusted to the longer runway scheme.”The runway itself is expected to cost £21bn, with a further £12bn needed for associated infrastructure including new satellite terminals. Heathrow has promised a further £15bn investment in airport improvements. The scheme is expected to be fully privately financed. It could mean up to 760 more planes in the skies around London every day, with the airport’s capacity increasing to 756,000 flights and 150 million passengers a year.The Department for Transport said it was clear that Heathrow expansion should meet the UK’s legally binding climate obligations, and said the independent Climate Change Committee would be consulted to ensure it wasconsistent with the net zero framework.But environmental groups said that was not feasible. Tony Bosworth, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the scheme was “the equivalent of bolting an airport the size of Gatwick on to Heathrow.

Debenhams and Beales have left the high street, House of Fraser has closed almost two-thirds of its stores and Fenwick exited its prime London site.Peter Ruis, the managing director of John Lewis, has a different view. Afterclosing 16 stores during the pandemicand shedding thousands of jobs as it fought for survival, he says expansion is now “definitely something we are looking at”. The 161-year-old retailer is spending £800m by 2029 on giving its 36 remaining outlets a reboot.Ruis, whoreturned last yearafter more than a decade away to lead the revival of John Lewis, says: “The store is a perfect invention, and we’ve seen only too well, coming back from Covid, how people have gravitated back to the stores.”He says there are “definitely no plans to close anything” and there are parts of the country the department store would like to step into.Ruis, who started his career as a graduate trainee at Marks & Spencer, was credited withputting the fashion backinto John Lewis before going on to lead retailers including Jigsaw and Anthropologie. He says his current job is about bringing “radical relevance” to the group’s once – staid outlets.“We are getting rid of the old stuffy department store and replacing it with something more experiential,” he says.However, this season could be a nail-biter, with British shoppers likely to leave their present-buying late again this year, as many people will have a full five days of holiday before the present giving begins.As shoppers bustle into the chain’s Bluewater store in Kent to visit its packed cafe and busy beauty and gifting section, Ruis says of theChristmasshopping rush: “I do get the sense that obviously there has been a lot of doom and gloom, and it’s coming late, but it’s coming hard.”The employee-owned department store chain, part of the widerJohn LewisPartnership, made a £10m profit for the year to January. In a similar fashion to last year, it will have to fight back from a £53m loss at the half year to stay out of the red in this financial year. Ruis says: “I think we’re optimistic, but, you know, it’s a difficult market. It’s difficult for the customer.”View image in fullscreenRuis says making items more easily browsable is the future of shopping.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianStanding in the doorway, Ruis gestures to a new gifting section that draws together an eclectic array of items from puzzles and mugs to an electric bicycle, perfume and vases all livened up with a gin bar run by independent brand Mermaid.Previously, these items would have been dispersed around the store in a number of departments. While those departments still exist, Ruis wants more mixing and pulling together of products around lifestyle themes in future.He says making items more easily browsable is the future of shopping, as John Lewis tries to help shoppers happen on what they want in a way that is not possible online.As suggested by itsChristmas adfeaturing a father and son bonding over a vinyl dance track, which Ruis claims has gone viral as far afield as Germany and Hong Kong, John Lewis is gunning for teens and twentysomethings as well as their parents and younger siblings.2:07Watch the 2025 John Lewis Christmas advert – video“It’s not the generation of my parents where I’d be watching Top of the Pops, and they would be like, ‘Who’s that person with makeup?’,” he says. “It’s the generation where the father is pulling the daughter or son to watch Jools Holland.”New brands that have cross-generational appeal, fromTopshop, Carhartt and Charlotte Tilbury, to Apple and Waterstones bookshops are part of the story.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said chicken was “the fastest-growing protein” in the world.Wetherspoons to open first pub in Spain – offering garlic prawns and beer from 6amRead moreIt is understood that there was friction between Rennie and the board over his focus and approach to the business, although the statement from Domino’s said he was stepping down “by mutual agreement”.In September, Domino’s launched its Chick ’N’ Dip brand – which Rennie described as a “bold new chapter” for the group – and is trialling it in 210 outlets in the north-west of England and Northern Ireland.While the company is still going to roll it out across its nearly 1,400 branches next year as planned, it sees fried chicken as complementary to its core pizza business.Ian Bull, the Domino’s chair, said: “The board believes that there are a number of opportunities to drive further growth and value creation in Domino’s core business. We are focused on identifying the right chief executive to lead the disciplined execution of that growth strategy.”Earlier this month, Domino’s, which has 13 million customers in the UK and Ireland, said orders dipped by 1.5% in the third quarter. In August, it warned that the takeaway markethad “become tougher”as it blamed weaker consumer confidence in the run-up to Wednesday’s budget and rising wage costs for weaker-than-expected sales and a 15% drop in half-year profits.Other pizza operators are also struggling. Pizza Hutannounced the closureof 68 restaurants a month ago, after the company behind its UK venues fell into administration.Trying to keep up with consumer trends towards healthier eating, Domino’s has launched lower-calorie products, such as its Thin & Crispy range of pizzas below 400 calories as well as plant-based and gluten-free pizzas. A large pepperoni pizza has 2,311 calories. A large cheese and tomato pizza has 2,171, while a small has 909 calories.Frampton has been with Domino’s since 2021, and previously worked for the gambling company William Hill.

The less sympathetic might have called him a chancer, but from the very beginnings there was little he wouldn’t try if he thought it would advance either himself or the music. Over the years I got to know him, both from interviews and sometimes just hanging out, so many of his anecdotes ended with the words: “Well I wasn’t going to say no, was I?” I wasn’t fully joking when I told him it should be his catchphrase.But that was Jimmy Cliff, a charismatic combination of charm, bravery, humour and an ability to see beyond what was put in front of him. Throughout his career he frequently shifted away from standard reggae industry practice, often expanding the music’s horizons and options.This was true at the start of his career when he saw an opportunity to establish himself as a singer outside the cutthroat world of the Kingston sound systems where artists made records to be played in dances rather than for sale. The 17-year-old talked Leslie Kong, a Chinese Jamaican who owned an ice-cream-parlour-cum-record-shop-cum-cosmetics-boutique called Beverley’s into starting his own label: “I wrote a song called Dearest Beverley and sang it to him in the shop the next day. He loved my voice … so he asked me how he could get into making records. I knew all the musicians and the studios, I knew the business. So I could help him.” Under Kong and Cliff’s guidance, Beverley’s became a very successful and influential label.Jimmy Cliff: a life in picturesRead moreA few years later he took the chance to move to London, immersed himself in the pop music of the day, absorbing new song structures and ideas to apply to the Jamaican music that was already evolving from ska to rocksteady to reggae. He always maintained this helped him develop as a songwriter and allowed him to take Jamaican music into a much more international situation without losing touch with what it was or should be.In the late 1960s such broad-mindedness gave music critics something of a problem. With the Trojan Explosion of perky strings-backed reggae hitting the charts and the first stirrings of roots and culture yet to reach the mainstream, the music was largely dismissed as essentially worthless (BBC Radio 1 was a significant offender). Cliff, however, was releasing thoughtful, well-rounded songs that acknowledged the musical environment outside Kingston, in LP format – this was years before Jamaican music came to terms with albums as anything more than collections of singles. His albums Jimmy Cliff and Another Cycle (1969 and 1971, the latter recorded in the US) contained the likes of Sitting in Limbo, Vietnam, Many Rivers to Cross and Wonderful World, Beautiful People, and confused the hell out of reviewers – this was reggae, Jim, but not as we know it.View image in fullscreenJimmy Cliff pictured around the time of The Harder They Come.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockIt was work of this calibre that attracted The Harder They Come’s director/writer Perry Henzell to approach him to do the music for the film. When Cliff’s evolved and varied reggae was put into context with Henzell’s vivid visuals they made perfect sense; suddenly, assessments of many of the same songs were being rowed back, and Jimmy Cliff was now at the heart of one of the world’s bestselling soundtrack albums. He was always very proud of his part in introducing the world to Jamaica “as it really was” through this, as well as the music he made well into the 21st century which, always looking outwards, maintained his international acclaim.His time in London in the 1960s also offered another example of Cliff’s resourcefulness. About to be evicted from his bedsit after his landlady found out she had “a coloured” living under one of her roofs, she saw him in the audience on Top of the Pops – they were recruited from London discos where he was very much on the scene – dancing next to Nina Simone as she performed. “I told her she couldn’t evict me because I was famous – and she agreed! So much for racism when it comes up against celebrity.”It was also in London that he met Henzell. What transpired, and the way Cliff laughed through the recollection, goes a long way to summing up who he was and how he approached life:“He asked me if I could write music for films. I said: ‘Yeah man, of course I can!’ It was like being back in Kong’s ice-cream shop – you’ve got to know your opportunities! Then six months later Chris Blackwell gave me the script and told me Perry wanted me for the lead part. I’d never acted before, but I took it, read it and liked it, I could identify with both sides of it, I knew Rhygin [the real-life model for Ivan in the movie], I understood that aspect of Jamaican life, and I’d been in the music business since I was 14. It didn’t seem like anything I couldn’t do.“And besides, I wasn’t going to tell them no, was I?”Explore more on these topicsJimmy CliffReggaePop and rockJamaicacommentShareReuse this content"

ThenMiddle. And nowDavid Eldridge’s superlative trilogy about different couples at successive stages has come to a close withEnd. All three can be appreciated individually but the final play, which opened last week at the National Theatre in London, poignantly overlaps with its predecessors. If you’ve seen the other two, you can’t help but draw connections between them as much as you may find familiarities with your own relationships. Before too long, an enterprising theatre should stage all three plays together.Beginning charted the drunken burgeoning of romance between a pair at a house party who are on each side of 40. Middle is about a marriage in crisis, with a young child also in the equation. Tenderly directed by Rachel O’Riordan, End finds Alfie and Julie squaring up to his cancer diagnosis after spending decades together. But the casting of the new play gives it an extra resonance as it reunites Clive Owen and Saskia Reeves more than 30 years after they starred together in Stephen Poliakoff’sClose My Eyes. I found the memory of that 1991 film complements the play enormously.Inspired by Poliakoff’s 1975 play Hitting Town, Close My Eyes caused a tabloid frenzy for its explicit depiction of an incestuous affair between Natalie (Reeves) and her younger brother, Richard (Owen). The film has a similarly elegiac tone to Eldridge’s play partly because of the nature of its relationship, which is doomed before it begins. As well as that eventual implosion, Poliakoff offers other endings. Close My Eyes opens with Natalie’s recent breakup, the divorce of her and Richard’s parents lingers in the background and Richard’s colleague, who has Aids, is dying. As Natalie’s new husband, Sinclair (Alan Rickman), puts it towards the finish: “Something tells me it’s the end of the party.”View image in fullscreenA society in flux … Clive Owen as Richard and Saskia Reeves as Natalie in Close My Eyes.Photograph: Beambright/Four Four Int/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockNatalie and Richard’s relationship unfolds partly amid the regeneration of Docklands in London and is set against a society in flux and the burst of ruthless Thatcherite individualism in the 80s. Some critics saw their incest as symbolising the era’s moral decay and urban decline – Poliakoff has a character make this comparison in Hitting Town. But in the film the couple’s union is presented as a retreat from a world shown to be not just politically corrupt but also disrupted by the horror of the Aids crisis and climate chaos. Poliakoff told the Observer when the film was released: “If you were to say, ‘Why use this taboo?’ I’d say I want the film to be a seductive experience under the shadow of twin worries – the weather out of kilter and the threat of Aids. As with all my stories, I’m trying to get into the subconscious, so that the story hangs around. I wanted it to have a haunting, end-of-decade, end-of-century feel.”Eldridge sets Alfie and Julie’s personal turmoil against one of the most divisive periods in recent British political history. End takes place one morning in the summer of 2016, a week before the Brexit vote. That is mentioned in passing by Julie but Alfie is more preoccupied with a greater upheaval: his beloved West Ham’s departure from Upton Park after more than 100 years. When he speaks of his career as a DJ, providing people with sparks of dancefloor joy in a dark and unpredictable world, it brings to mind Richard and Natalie hiding away for illicit afternoons that are presented as almost being out of time.The memory of the intense sex scenes in Close My Eyes (“One feels almost embarrassed to be caught watching,” wrote Stephen Holden in the New York Times) also serves to heighten Eldridge’s play. Natalie and Richard are at times literally and almost comically hot under the collar as they are consumed by an addictive, obsessive relationship – in one scene she insists that he stay on the other side of the room as she attempts to subdue their passion. In End, Owen and Reeves each have a beautifully nuanced physicality reflecting the easy comfort of decades together as well as an unavoidable sense of distancing. Early on, Alfie wonders aloud if they will ever make love again. His illness means he uses a crutch and moves awkwardly; as he stands motionless and plays a house music track in contention for his funeral playlist, she dances playfully and seductively around him.That moment is then echoed in the rarest of theatrical sex scenes (intimacy direction by Bethan Clark). Unlike the artfully framed, ample nudity of Poliakoff’s film, Alfie and Julie have a quick shag on the sofa, almost fully dressed. Both actors expertly bring out their characters’ vulnerabilities, their ease with and care for each other, their love and fear. It has humour, melancholy and absolute authenticity in a short and sweet evocation of their more youthful passion and abandon.View image in fullscreenRarest of sex scenes … Clive Owen (Alfie) and Saskia Reeves (Julie) in End.Photograph: Marc BrennerWhen actors reunite to play couples it’s often as the same characters in a sequel but when the roles are new, they can’t help but bring the ghosts of their predecessors. In End, I was reminded of Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer playing the emotionally weatheredFrankie and Johnnyeight years after starring as Tony and Elvira in Scarface and the contrast between their dancefloor encounter at a flashy club in the earlier film and the homely, ramshackle party they attend in the later one.Actors’ previous roles can cleave to them, something directer Jamie Lloyd often exploits, although I was already struggling to buy into the characters of his West EndMuch Ado About Nothingbefore Tom Hiddleston and Hayley Atwell were accompanied by full-length cardboard cutouts of their Marvel characters. End is altogether more powerful in evoking its stars’ screen history. When Alfie recalls his cocksure, “baby-faced” old self, you flash on Owen’s TV role as Chancer as well as the smoothly dressed Richard. The suaveness of his past roles (remember when he was touted as the next James Bond?) accentuates the wincing, tracksuit-wearing Alfie’s dishevelment; his first appearance, standing stiff with a haunted look in his eyes, provokes a double take. In a strange way, Julie’s success as a novelist in Eldridge’s play helps to fulfil the thwarted creative ambitions of Natalie in Close My Eyes.Awkward flirting, 4am breakdowns and a last kiss: David Eldridge on a decade of writing about loveRead morePoliakoff’s film is frequently paradoxical; the nature of their relationship means that even in the first flush of their romance, Natalie and Richard share the well-worn squabbling of siblings and have a whole history as brother and sister to unpick. Like End, it’s poised between the past and the future. Even though the spectre of a possible pregnancy (emphasised in Hitting Town) does not loom in Close My Eyes, a general unease about what lies ahead is often voiced by Rickman’s character, who has made a fortune through stock forecasts.Eldridge’s play painfully imagines the family’s life without Alfie, a future that Julie finds she can only process by plotting it as if one of her novels, much like Alfie, navigates his send-off in terms of a DJ choosing the right banger. The dancefloor becomes a convincing motif for the stages of the trilogy – it’s a place where Alfie has seen first kisses and breakups – and Eldridge draws a nice analogy between storytelling as choosing the right records as well as finding the right words. While End was written without Owen and Reeves in mind (props to casting director Alastair Coomer for bringing them together again), their old film gives this superbly performed new play a remarkable charge of intimacy.End is at theNational Theatre, London, until 17 JanuaryChris Wiegand is the Guardian’s Stage editorExplore more on these topicsTheatreActingClive OwenDavid EldridgeStephen PoliakoffNational TheatreRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

Refusing to give up her friendship, Renko hurls a laboratory burner on to her desk, setting it ablaze and throwing the class into chaos. Unbeknown to most of her friends, Renko’s parents are separated, too.Equal parts perceptive and mischievous, little Renko is the protagonist of 1993’s Moving, the acclaimed 10th feature by the Japanese auteur Shinji Sōmai. Attuned to the sensibilities of childhood, Moving delicately traces the uncertainties that line the thorny path towards adolescence. With Sōmai’s signature long takes and elaborate camera movements, the film tries to keep up with Renko’s hurried footsteps as she dashes between her discordant parents.View image in fullscreen‘Renko’s world of innocence shatters’ as her parents undergo a wounding process of separation.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyRenko’s father, Kenichi (Kiichi Nakai), is gentle but ineffectual. Although his moments with Renko are playful, Kenichi’s vacant gazes convey a deeper weariness. On the other hand, Renko’s mother, Nazuna (Junko Sakurada), is fiercely assertive. After her split from Kenichi, Nazuna throws herself into the task of reinventing life for her and her daughter. However, her fervent resolve to restore order makes her affection for Renko harden into impatience and control. Caught in the downpours of Kyoto’s summer, Renko stirs up a typhoon herself in hopes that her separated parents will reunite.North by Northwest: Hitchcock’s funniest, most ambitious filmRead moreRenko runs, she lashes out and, at times, she quietly observes her sense of normalcy crumble away. In one scene, she locks herself in a bathroom at home and forces her parents to confront one another. When a heated argument erupts, Renko glimpses in them a tempest she has never known. As Kenichi and Nazuna sink into a wounded silence, Renko’s world of innocence shatters.Nevertheless, she remains undeterred. Oscillating between sowing havoc in domestic spaces and speeding through urban landscapes, Renko keeps up her earnest yet painful attempts at reconnecting her parents. As the camera drifts across rooms and streets to follow Renko, the film’s 90s backdrop is brought to the fore. Referred to as Japan’s “lost decade”, the period saw the country’s economic bubble burst, plunging a previously forward-looking society into stagnation. In the breakup of Renko’s parents, you might sense the nation’s loss of faith in the nuclear family and the economic system that once sustained it.View image in fullscreen‘Finding herself suspended between a past she can no longer hold on to and a future full of doubts, Renko gradually stops running.’Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyKyoto’s summer festivals, too, are woven into the film. With this recurring motif, Sōmai elegantly links the growing tensions of the Urushiba household with a collective sense of spirituality, which adds a mythological dimension to the film’s domestic realism.When Nazuna finds Renko missing from home, she hears the faint drums and bells of Japan’s famous Gion festival, whose festivities only weigh on her loneliness. Similarly, as Kenichi takes Renko home on his motorcycle, the Kanji character “大” (“great”) burns on a faraway mountainside: part of a bonfire rite to farewell ancestral spirits. Through long handheld shots, Sōmai tethers the fragility of the father-daughter bond and the melancholy of the flames.As Renko attempts one final ploy to bring her parents together, she runs away and disappears into a local festival by Lake Biwa. Bundles of burning hay and blazing torches cast an amber glow into the night: hypnotic and meditative, carrying fleeting sparks that guide Renko on her personal rite of passage. Finding herself suspended between a past she can no longer hold on to and a future full of doubts, Renko gradually stops running. At last, the film slows down with her.As dawn breaks, ripples glisten in the half-light, carrying Renko slowly away from her childhood, away from a world she has grown disillusioned with.Moving is streaming on Mubi in Australia and the UK and Criterion Channel in the US.

The world’s black rhino population has plummeted to just over 6,000 as rhinos are pushed to the brink of extinction by habitat loss and poaching. But conservation efforts have resulted in a rhino comeback inKenya, where numbers are growing in fenced-off sanctuaries known as conservancies that employ local people and keep poachers out.Tom Hardy provides a slightly distracting narration to this documentary, channelling David Attenborough with a dash of 19th-century aristo-explorer. The film opens with the fact that in the past three years, 1,900 rhinos have been poached across Africa, but not a single one in Kenya. In the Borana Conservancy we meet charismatic head ranger Ramson Kiloku, a man who knows every single rhino on his patch by its footprint and the nicks on its ears.Kenya’s rhinos, however, are becoming victims of their own success. Increasing numbers in the conservancies are causing competition between males, who will fight to the death for territory. There is a horrible irony of rhinos protected from poachers killing each other, and a plan is hatched to move 21 rhinos 100 miles away to Loisaba Conservancy – a high-risk strategy, we’re told. A similar attempt ended in disaster with the death of all 11 rhinos being moved.But before the rhinos can be transported, Kenya is hit by a drought, devastating for locals whose survival depends on agriculture and livestock. Gangs of bandits terrorise farms, and poaching is on the rise. Oddly, the film doesn’t explore the threat to endangered species from the climate crisis. I could have lived with a bit more of Hardy on the voiceover if he had been given the remit to explain – and possibly without some choices on the soundtrack, including a mawkish rendition of Knocking on Heaven’s Door.● Rhino is in UK cinemas from 28 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsWildlifeConservationKenyaTom HardyAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

And yet it has to be said: his lavishly upholstered vampire romance has ambition and panache – and in all its Hammer-y cheesiness, I’m not sure I wouldn’t prefer to it toRobert Eggers’s recent, solemnly classy version of Nosferatu. There are some very bizarre touches, including one shot that appears to show a land border between France and Romania.Christoph Waltz plays a witty yet careworn vampire-hunting priest – I can’t believe he hasn’t played this role before – who finds himself in Paris in 1889 for the French Revolution centenary celebrations. So does the evil Count Dracula, played by the body-horror veteran Caleb Landry Jones with a mangled central European accent reminiscent ofSteve Carell’s Gru from the Despicable Me comedies. This is a part that he too was born to take on.The story is this: the count has been restlessly roaming the world in anguish for 400 years since he became undead, a punishment for his irreligious grief over the death of his wife, Elisabeta (a movie debut role for Zoë Bleu, daughter of Rosanna Arquette). The count has been searching, searching, searching for some woman who would be the reincarnation of his lost love. As ill fortune would have it, the lucky lady turns out to be Mina (also Bleu, of course), the demure fiancee of Dracula’s wimpish land agent, Jonathan Harker (Ewens Abid), who has recently been to the count’s castle to discuss his property portfolio and whose miniature portrait of the winsome Mina caught the count’s hooded eye.Besson structures Dracula’s second-act backstory of global roaming in various outrageous costumes with a sure hand, and he is not above giving us some comedy moments with a distinctly Mel Brooks flavour – such as the count’s repeated and futile attempts to kill himself after Elisabeta’s death, as well as farcical scenes that result after Dracula douses himself in a certain perfume in 18th-century Florence, which makes him irresistible to women.

It’s funny, but on this evidence, it’s not really a joke. As an exhilarating Tick Tick Boom crashes back into the room, it’s easy to believe that the Hives could prop up the National Grid.Twenty-five years on from their first UK tour, the Swedish punk’n’rollers are full of piss and vinegar, reinvigorated after breaking a decade-plus recording hiatus with two well-received albums in three years, all while playing some of the biggest shows of their career, from stadium support slots with Arctic Monkeys to an upcoming night at London’s Alexandra Palace.In that context, tonight is a blip – tickets are available on the day despite the gig originally being booked at the larger Utilita Arena across town – but if their pride is hurt the Hives don’t show it.

As cartoonish as they can be, the Hives are obviously hungry to prove themselves again rather than settling into the numbing comfort of nostalgia. Paint a Picture’s fizzing powerpop becomes a snarling reminder that they are disciples of New Bomb Turks’ sardonic punk, easily matching the unruly energy of their debut’s Here We Go Again, the evening’s lone deep cut.It’s a good thing, too, because theirs is not the only killer set by a sharply attired garage-rock band. Fronted by punchy vocalist Michael Bingham, openers Spiritual Cramp are more Stone Island than Savile Row, but their sneering harmonies, slashing riffs and sardonic wit are irresistible. The headliners meet them on these terms, emerging bloodied but unbowed. “You have no choice but to give it up for the Hives,” Pelle yells at one point, and he’s not wrong.The Hives play the O2 Academy, Glasgow, 26 November;then touringUK until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsThe HivesPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Four books deep, this gargantuan work of supernatural existentialism is an unsettling account of the occult phenomena that attend the appearance in the sky of a bright new star. Mysteries from the first three volumes include: who killed the musicians in the forest? What’s going on with the local wildlife? Why does no one seem to be dying any more? By the end of The School of Night, the most burning question may sound comparatively mundane:who isKristian Hadeland?Scattered references appeared in the saga’s first 2,000 pages. Kristian Hadeland was the 67-year-old man buried without mourners by doubting priest Kathrine Reinhardsen inThe Morning Star(2021). InThe Third Realm(2024), he was the sinister chap hitching a lift with Kathrine’s husbandafterthe unloved man she buried is supposed to have died.The School of Night offers another answer. Here, Kristian Hadeland is the author of a 500-page suicide note, and the misanthropic narrator of a compellingly nasty novel. From the remote Norwegian island where he’s preparing to end his life, Kristian sets down the story of how he got there, starting with his time as a photography student in mid-1980s London.Young Kristian has a good eye and self-belief, even if – as a visiting professor suggests – his photos are “a bit dull. Without temperament.” Soon after arriving from Norway, he meets the enigmatic Hans, a Dutch artist into artificial intelligence, and Vivian, who is staging a production of Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus; he develops an uneasy friendship with the former and a hostile sexual relationship with the latter. Kristian is reflexively unpleasant, quick to disdain everyone and everything from homeless people to old women in jeans and coffee with milk.When Kristian is home for Christmas, he’s antagonistic towards his family, too. After his sister overdoses, he hears his father describing him as “a black hole … a narcissist, through and through”. Outraged, he returns to London, retreating into himself. He cycles through the rain in a cityscape that resembles a graveyard. He steals a dead cat from a vet’s, planning to photograph its skeleton. Like so many of Knausgård’s men, he drinks a lot. Then a chance encounter with a homeless man sets Kristian on a path from near ruin to staggering glory.The Faustus subplot indicates Knausgård’s literary model as well as providing an interpretive lens for the reader. When the central crisis of the story is resolved thanks to a mysterious intervention by the Mephistophelean Hans, Kristian’s abilities as a photographer are miraculously transformed. “Every photograph seemed incandescent, it was as if I was being carried forward by some momentous force,” Kristian writes. Twenty-four years later, we find Kristian finalising a retrospective of his work at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. But then, his life and success begin to unravel.Knausgård’s assertion that he barely plans or edits his work may unsettle those who have ventured this far in the series, not to mention repelling readers who are yet to startKnausgård’s assertion that he barely plans or edits his work may unsettle those who have ventured this far, not to mention repelling readers who are yet to start. Each new instalment in the Morning Star cycle has contributed to a sense more of creeping entropy than grand design; and it’s not clear how The School of Night fits into the bigger picture – if thereisone. Thenexttwovolumes, already out in Norway, seemingly focus on the Løyning family first introduced inThe Wolves of Eternity(2023). Are the anachronisms and inconsistencies in the text deliberate, features of a superstructure beyond rationalism whose outline is still only partially visible? How else, when their birth dates don’t align, could the protagonist of The School of Night be the man Kathrine buries in The Morning Star?Other readers will be drawn into kabbalistic exegesis. I found myself translating Danish Reddit threads, examining Norwegian ferry schedules to trace Kristian’s movements, and scouring the classics to understand how the Faustus story may illuminate the world of The Morning Star. When Marlowe’s Faustus asks Mephistopheles, “How comes it, then, that thou art out of hell?” and the demon replies, “Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it”, it’s as good a description of the bleak universe Knausgård has created.As in the first three books, the author’s philosophical preoccupation with death is a constant, expressed through the tension between an instinctual materialism and the haunting possibility of something beyond comprehension. It’s a tension Kristian seems to want to ignore, yet he is unable to explain Hans’s strange agency in his life, let alone the Dutchman’s sudden diabolical appearance at a pivotal moment at the end of part one: “Abruptly, he threw back his head and stared into the sky, the orbs in his sockets rolled white. Three times in quick succession his mouth opened and closed like a fish’s.” Close readers may recall the same convulsion afflicting Jesper, the musician suspected of murdering his three bandmates in a satanic bloodbath, in the chilling final pages of The Third Realm. Intimations of the supernatural give the saga much of its momentum and uncanny frisson. But can the mystery be indefinitely sustained?‘I knew I was doing something I shouldn’t’: Karl Ove Knausgård on the fallout from My Struggle and the dark side of ambitionRead moreSome readers won’t be persuaded. Knausgård’s prose is sometimes not just erratic but incoherent; even fans will concede that you don’t read him for the beauty of his sentences. Besides, 500 pages in Kristian’s hateful company is a lot to handle – and getting the most from The School of Night entails thousands of pages of background reading. (You will need to have paid close attention to experience as a thrill the revelation that the house where Kristian writes his last testament belongs to Egil Stray, the writer of the essay On Death and the Dead that concludes The Morning Star and may yet provide a kind of Rosetta stone for the mysteries of the saga … et cetera.)A lot is riding on Knausgård’s ability to deliver on the colossal promise of this sprawling epic. But for readers with the stomach, patience and faith to keep going, this work of millenarian fiction remains an object of fascination.The School of Night by Karl Ove Knausgård, translated by Martin Aitken, is published by Harvill (£25).

Fewer know that Crick also played a key role in modern neuroscience and inspired our continuing efforts to understand the biological basis of consciousness.Crick once said the two questions that interested him most were “the borderline between the living and the non-living, and the workings of the brain”, questions that were usually discussed in religious or mystical terms but that he believed could be answered by science. In his new biography of the Nobel prize-winning scientist, Matthew Cobb, emeritus professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, does an admirable job of capturing the rare thinker who not only set himself such ambitious goals but made remarkable progress in achieving them, radically remaking two scientific disciplines in the process.Surprisingly, perhaps, Crick was not a child prodigy. He began life as an “averagely bright student”, born in 1916 to a provincial middle-class family: his father ran a shoe company. After boarding at Mill Hill School in north London, he failed to get an Oxbridge scholarship (possibly because he was “hopeless” at Latin), and studied physics and mathematics at University College London, graduating with a 2.1. He began a PhD there, but it was disrupted by the second world war, when he was conscripted into developing mines that could evade German minesweepers.It was only after the war that Crick, inspired by Erwin Schrödinger’s 1944 book What Is Life?, determined that he wanted to investigate the molecular basis of life, for which he needed a grounding in biology. He managed to get a studentship through the Medical Research Council to work at Strangeways Laboratory near Cambridge, studying the structure of cytoplasm (the liquid part of cells), and in 1949 transferred to Cambridge University’s Cavendish Lab, where scientists were using a technique called X-ray crystallography to investigate the structure of proteins. It was there that he found an ideal collaborator in the 23-year-old American scientist James Watson. Remarkably, by 1953 the pair had cracked the structure of DNA.Cobb wants to correct the widespread view that Crick and Watson arrived at their double helix model after stealing data from Rosalind FranklinFar from being the stereotypical reclusive genius, labouring in isolation, Crick was loud-talking and charismatic, a philanderer, poetry lover and thrower of risque parties. Crick’s inspiration and breakthroughs came through intense encounters with others, and he was skilled at bringing researchers from different disciplines together to solve scientific puzzles.In Cobb’s telling, Crick was bold and arrogant, with an uncanny ability to uncover connections and to identify new theoretical and experimental approaches, often challenging far more established experts. Lawrence Bragg, the head of the Cavendish lab, is said to have described him as “the sort of chap who was always doing someone else’s crossword”. This approach meant he often stepped on people’s toes and was occasionally wildly off mark.Cobb wants to correct the widespread view that Crick and Watson arrived at their double helix model after stealing data from Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist whose X-ray diffraction images of DNA supported their theories. In The Double Helix, Watson’s popular account of his breakthrough, he wrote that he developed his ideas after seeing one of Franklin’s images, known as Photo 51. Cobb argues that this was an oversimplification: that Photo 51 gave Watson no new information, and Crick did not himself see it until weeks after the pair made their discovery. Crick and Watson should have asked Franklin for permission to use her data, Cobb writes, and it is true that she did not receive sufficient credit for her work. But the pair nonetheless acknowledged Franklin’s contributions in their academic papers on the double helix, and Crick and Franklin remained on friendly terms, with Crick acting as her “unofficial advisor”.The whole affair nonetheless reeks of sexism, from the lack of courtesy shown to Franklin to her exclusion from networking groups such as the RNA Tie Club, and the letters exchanged between Crick and a male colleague discussing how Franklin was too cautious to be a first-rank scientist. I wished Cobb might have named it as such. (After all, what female scientist of their era could have recovered their public reputation after the kinds of blunders Crick sometimes made.)Cobb sets himself an ambitious task in trying to do justice to both Crick’s prolific scientific career and his colourful personal life, and this biography is an impressive work of research and scholarship. It is intended to be accessible to the general reader, with the advice that those who are struggling with the science should “follow Crick’s advice to readers of his own books and skip the hard bits”. This general reader struggled often with the technical detail and vocabulary. Some difficulty may be inescapable simply because the science is complex. Nonetheless, it is a relief whenever Crick is quoted, describing his research in his own words, because he had a knack for translating hard science into lay terms.In a passage explaining how a rare mutation, if advantageous, can become widespread, Crick observes that “when times are tough, true novelty is needed … chance is the only source of true novelty”. These broader, philosophical reflections, which place discoveries in their wider context, are fascinating and much needed – because when readers feel bogged down, they miss out on the wonder.Crick: A Mind in Motion – from DNA to the Brain by Professor Matthew Cobb is published by Profile (£30).

Lessening their legendary volume, though, would reduce the impact of theMy Bloody Valentinelive show as a multi-sensorial, physical and musical experience. You wouldn’t experience every bass drum like a heartbeat, undergo the peculiar, otherworldly sensation of a ribcage rattling with sound or – during the encore – a noise so ferocious that it feels as if a gale force wind is flapping at your clothes.My Bloody Valentine are, of course, credited with inventing shoegaze, the ethereal, dreamlike, effects-laden genre that has been rediscovered by the TikTok generation. However, at times here they seem to have more in common with noise warriors such as Einstürzende Neubaten than the drippier home counties combos that followed them.That said, at the centre of the maelstrom there is an undeniable prettiness – in co-vocalist/guitarist Bilinda Butcher’s gentle singing, or the lovely melodies that somehow make themselves distinct amid be-hatted singer/guitarist Kevin Shields’ walls of shrieking sound. Such unfathomably but beautifully intermeshing textures are driven relentlessly by the rock solid rhythm section of bassist Debbie Googe and tireless drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig.View image in fullscreenWalls of shrieking sound … Kevin Shields.Photograph: Isaac WatsonThat their tours come along as rarely as comets – this is the first for seven years – makes the Irish-English band sound even more special and unique.

Philip Pullman’s fairytale of volcano scaling, talking elephants and “The Greatest Firework Show in the Galaxy” isn’t one of them. But with buckets of imagination and a sterling cast, Lee Lyford’s new production for six-to-12-year-olds is both epic and spellbindingly intimate. My seven-year-old guest, Artie, isn’t familiar with the book but is immediately enthralled and, at times, so far on the edge of his seat I fear he’ll collide with the woman in front.Lila dreams of becoming a firework-maker like her dad; he isn’t so keen. So when he’s tricked into revealing the final secret to his craft – winning Royal Sulphur from a fire fiend atop a volcano – Lila’s off like a rocket, via jungles and pirates. Her friend Chulak, learning more about the dangers in store, goes in search of protective water with the king’s vociferous white elephant, Hamlet.Lyford and team rifle through a bulging dramatic toolbox to bring it all to life. Anisha Fields’ simple set begins as Lila and her father’s workshop but, with the help of some lo-fi additional scenery and a few humble props, soon becomes a river, a jungle and the side of a volcano, complete with cardboard-box rockslide. Fireworks are unfurling cocktail umbrellas and tiny lights dancing on the ends of fingers. (The finale’s firework competition is more extravagantly breathtaking in ways I won’t spoil.)View image in fullscreenEnthralling … The Firework-Maker’s Daughter.Photograph: Jake BushThere’s excellent puppetry (designs and direction by Maia Kirkman-Richards), from hulking Hamlet – controlled by two cast members within – to intricate shadow puppets parading across a lampshade. “Write down that – that’s amazing!” whispers Artie, jabbing my notepad. Jonathan Chan’s lighting and Elena Peña’s sound design bring real peril. When red lights, smoke, crackling sound effects and a rumbling voiceover conjure the fire fiend, a spooked Artie suggests raising the minimum age guidance to nine.The cast of five take the technical demands of such invention in energetic stride, with all except Tika Mu’tamir (a pleasingly plucky Lila) also playing multiple roles. Artie’s favourite is Jules Chan as cheeky Chulak and one of the useless pirates rowing themselves in circles in his favourite scene – it’s also a moment where Jude Christian’s adaptation adds gleeful silliness to Pullman’s vivid language. My standout is Rose-Marie Christian, whose every incarnation is a delight, although cockney chancer Auntie Rambashi is her best.Lila’s quest could do with a clearer setup, and the final lessons in love and risk-taking a little more exploration. But what seven-year-old cares about all that amid so much fun? Despite some questions throughout, Artie leaves creating fireworks with his fingers, practising the “mouth noises” he admired from the actors, and planning an explosive future career.AtPolka theatre, London, until 18 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsChristmas showsPlay timeChildren's theatrePhilip PullmanChildren's books: 8-12 yearsChildren and teenagersPolka theatrePuppetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

The asking price: $25m.The Stahl family, which has owned the home for its entire 65-year history, shared a statement on the decision to sell, saying the property had become too difficult to maintain.“This home has been the center of our lives for decades, but as we’ve gotten older, it has become increasingly challenging to care for it with the attention and energy it so richly deserves,”wroteBruce and Shari Stahl, the children of the original owners.They added that the time had come to find a new “steward” of the house – “someone who not only appreciates its architectural significance but also understands its place in the cultural landscape of Los Angeles and beyond”.View image in fullscreenThe Stahl house was ‘avant-garde, modern and unthinkable in terms of how it was built on that site’.Photograph: Julius Shulman/J Paul Getty Trust. Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (2004.R.10)The origins of the Stahl house date to May 1954, when CH “Buck” and Carlotta Stahl bought a hilly patch of land in the then undeveloped Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles for $13,500.Although the Stahl house became a famous symbol of Los Angeles, “nobody famous ever lived here”, Buck oftensaid, calling his family a “blue-collar family living in a white-collar house”. Buck worked as a graphic designer and sign painter, and he and Carlotta transported concrete from city construction projects to the property on their weekends.Buck created the original design for the Stahl house over the summer of 1956, though many architects were originally wary to build it on the precarious hillside. In November 1957, the Stahls interviewed the architect Pierre Koenig, who agreed to undertake the task.With the support of the Case Study program, a project spearheaded by the editor of Arts &Architecturemagazine, John Entenza, the Stahls received subsidies to hire Koenig.The modernist program “was about experimentation” and “using new materials and building in places that maybe previously the technology didn’t really allow”, said Adrian Scott Fine, the president and chief executive of the Los Angeles Conservancy. “All those things are wrapped up into a place like the Stahl house, which was avant-garde, modern and unthinkable in terms of how it was built on that site that everyone else thought, at the time, was unbuildable.”View image in fullscreenIn 1999, the City of Los Angeles declared the house a historic-cultural landmark, and in 2013 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a property considered worthy of protection.Photograph: Julius Shulman/J. Paul Getty Trust. Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (2004.R.10)The Stahl house became Case Study house No 22, and construction began in May 1959. According to the family, construction cost “a mere $37,500” and the home was move-in ready by May 1960. The result was “an idealized version of what everyone thinks LA is and should be”, said Fine.Soon after construction was finished, the architectural photographerJulius Shulmantook perhaps the most famous image of the home. Taken through the floor-to-ceiling glass windows,the photo featurestwo women seated in the home’s living room but appearing to float over the Los Angeles skyline.“I think the enduring impact of Shulman’s photo is due to the way it conveys an idea about living in Los Angeles, an ambivalence about being both in the city and removed from it,” said Kevin Daly, founder of Kevin Daly Architects and an adjunct professor at the University ofCaliforniaLos Angeles school of architecture and urban design.The home made historic appearances in film, television and music videos, including Playing by Heart (1998), Galaxy Quest (1999) and Nurse Betty (2000).In 1999, Los Angeles declared the Stahl house a historic-cultural landmark, and in 2013, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a property considered worthy of protection.View image in fullscreenThe Stahl house had made numerous appearances in TV and film.Photograph: Julius Shulman/J. Paul Getty Trust. Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (2004.R.10)The home remains open for tours, as it has been for the past 17 years, although all are currently sold out through February. In their statement announcing the sale of the home, the family said they would give “ample notice” before discontinuing the tours.Thelistingfor the home emphasizes finding a buyer who will preserve the character of the space.“For collectors of design, patrons of architecture, or institutions seeking to safeguard an American masterpiece, there is simply nothing comparable,” the listing reads. “This is not merely a sale; it is a passing of responsibility – a search for the next custodian who will honor the house’s history, respect its architectural purity, and ensure its preservation for generations to come.”View image in fullscreenThe house was described as ‘an idealized version of what everyone thinks LA is and should be’.Photograph: Julius Shulman/J. Paul Getty Trust. Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (2004.R.10)Fine agreed that the choice of buyer would be an important one, given the home’s history.“I think any time a longtime owner, and a stewardship like this, is transferring hands of a property like this, it always gives us a little bit of a pause – because you never know what the next owner, what their intentions will be. And will they understand and appreciate the house, as in this particular case the Stahl family has?”This article was amended on 25 November 2025 to clarify that the National Register of Historic Places is a listing of places that deserve preservation but does not actually provide any protection for those places.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

Her Teatro Oficina, in São Paulo, was named by this paper asthe best theatre in the world.Five hundred miles away is one of my favourite residential buildings,A la Ronde; an eccentric 16-sided home in Exmouth, Devon. It was designed in 1796 byJane and Mary Parminter(two “spinster” cousins, in the words of the National Trust) and relative John Lowder. The cousins, who were not professionals, had been inspired by their Grand Tour of Europe (an unusual undertaking for women at the time) and, in particular, theBasilica of San Vitalein Ravenna, Italy. The critic Lucinda Lambtondescribedthe cottage orné with Byzantine inflection as embodying “a magical strangeness that one might dream of only as a child”.View image in fullscreen‘Magical strangeness’ … A la Ronde.Photograph: Markfromexter/Wikimedia CommonsI thought of Bo Bardi and the Parminters when reading the recentreport by the Royal Institute of British Architects (the RIBA)which found that “stark displays of sexism” were pushing women out of the profession, stalling their progress within it, or putting them off entering it altogether. The RIBA’s chief executive officer, Dr Valerie Vaughan-Dick –the first woman CEO in the organisation’s almost 200-year-old history– said that the report, which documented sexual harassment (including stalking and groping), unequal pay (a16% gender gap), unsociable hours, and pervasive power imbalances, makes for “uncomfortable reading”.It comes two decades after a seminal2003review explored an exodus of women from architecture. Clearly, the industry hasn’t sufficiently renovated itself. More women are studying the subject at university, but just31% of architectsregistered with the Architects’ Registration Board (2022) andunder a quarterof RIBA chartered members are female. Increasingly, the retention issue overshadows the recruitment one. In a2017 surveyby Dezeen, just 10% of senior positions in the 100 largest architecture firms worldwide were held by women. The result is the unfortunate truth that the achievements of some of our finest architects are made even more impressive on the basis of their sex.There’sKazuyo Sejimaand her confident but mercurial buildings which mirror the moods of their natural surroundings: aluminium coruscates in the bright sun and shimmers in the rain; theconsidered “reflective cloud”of her 2009 Serpentine Gallery pavilion (with Ryue Nishizawa) seamlessly integrated with Hyde Park.Mariam Issoufou, a Niger-born architect works with sustainable local materials and resources – compressed earth bricks, rubber wood, palm leaves – to produce handsome libraries and housing estates in her native country and elsewhere.View image in fullscreenHolding its own against flashier neighbours … The Broad Museum in Los Angeles, designed by Liz Diller.Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/ReutersLiz Diller’s work is porous and community-focused – her greatest triumph, in my opinion, is New York’s extremely popularHigh Line, a 2km elevated linear park along an abandoned freight viaduct. Meanwhile, her Broad Museum in Los Angelesholds its ownacross the street from Frank Gehry’s better knownWalt Disney Concert Hall.Architecture has long been considered one of the most misogynistic of fields, whether it’s due to the stereotype of mathematics being for boys or women are solely suited to soft furnishings. This is reflected in day-to-day praxis: on-site PPE which is too large, rarefied cliques, and emails which begin with the salutation “gentleman”. As one of the best architects of the past 30 years, the late Zaha Hadid onceput it: “I am not part of this boys’ network … there are places men can go and women can’t, like those gentlemen’s clubs, or guys asking each other to play golf.”Of course, buildings have long been built by andformen. Le Corbusier’s famedUnité d’habitation, as stunning as the typology is, was designed according to his ideal figure of anthropometric scale. He called this “theModulor Man” – inspired somewhat by Da Vinci’s Vitruvian man – except Le Corbusier based his on a “6ft British policeman” (despitenever building anythingin Britain). This imaginary PC Plod dictated everything from the heights of handles to the dimensions of staircases.View image in fullscreenZaha Hadid’s Phaeno Science Center in Wolfsburg.Photograph: Colin Walton/AlamyIt isn’t just that buildings’ functionality was designed with men in mind, but that they adhered to ostensibly inherently “male” qualities of form and character – hard steel, austere wood-panelling, the rawness ofBéton brut. The most obvious example isphallic skyscrapers; certainly more common than Hadid’s football stadium in Qatar which was mocked forresembling a vulva(she disagreed, but honestly: it does. Then again,so does a stadiumin the same country by Albert Speer Jr).Accordingly, mainstream cultural depictions of architects are mainly hyper-masculine; the brooding Adrien Brody with sleeves rolled up inthe three-hour epic The Brutalist, for instance. The protagonist of Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead, Howard Roark, is an early archetype of the egotistical starchitect (or bro-chitect). Here’s an excerpt channelling Roark: “These rocks, he thought, are here for me: waiting for the drill, the dynamite and my voice; waiting to be split, ripped, pounded, reborn; waiting for the shape my hands will give them.”The hypothesis that unadorned concrete or clean lines are “male” by default is, of course, reductive.Denys Lasdunis one of my favourite architects, and this is not because I think of structural clarity as a signifier of a “male” propensity to lucidity. I’m afraid the (gorgeous) work of Mies van der Rohe does not call to mind the defined pecs ofDoryphoros. Likewise, though Oscar Niemeyer oncesaidhis gorgeous, fluent curves were partly inspired by “the body of the beloved woman”, I imagine a flesh-and-blood woman with the same proportions might topple over. Hadid, often called the “queen of the curve” had her designs compared to the female form, even though she frequently referenced the abstract art ofKazimir Malevichas an influence and not Jessica Rabbit.So does the sex of an architect even matter, aside from the obvious failure of equity? Yes. More women in the profession means that buildings and urban environments increasingly reflect the lived experience of women, style aside. In the 1980s, the women of the London-based activist collectiveMatrix, tired of struggling with prams up steps or hurrying through unlit underpasses, campaigned for and realised a cityscape more attuned to the way women lived.It isn’t that childcare and shopping and domestic labour should be the domains of women, but while these inequities and disparities exist they should be acknowledged and catered for (and that goes for the needs of older people, or those with disabilities or neurodivergence, too).There is alsoresearch which showsthat companies with greater gender diversity on boards tend to generate higher profits. When it comes to architecture specifically – though it’s salient to avoid the diametric of the gender stereotype that resulted in hard, cold crystalline surfaces supposedly reflecting the temperament of men – roundtables from within the industry dosuggestthat women’s key strengths include working more collaboratively and inclusively, and communicating in a more effective way with clients.In the past, even where female and non-binary architects’ contributions have been foundational to acclaimed projects, their input has been overlooked. Two of the most recognised architects in the UK, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, cut their teeth witha firmco-established in 1963 alongside three women. One of whom, as the only licensed architect at that time among the group, was the sole reason the firm was allowed to practice. But few know the names of Georgie Wolton, Su Brumwell and Wendy Cheesman (or assistant Sally Appleby).Frank Lloyd Wright is one of the world’s most lionised architects – for good reason, the guy built multiple masterpiece iterations of my dream home – but the Prairie School style was heavily reliant on his first employee, Marion Mahony Griffin. Half of the lithographs in Lloyd Wright’sWasmuth Portfolioare the work of Mahony Griffin, despite Lloyd Wright’s attempts to claim otherwise.View image in fullscreenThe work of Georgie Wolton, who co-founded an early practice with Norman Foster and Richard Rogers.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverEileen Gray’s iconicE-1027 houseon the shores of Cape Martin in France, meanwhile, filled with her original and innovative furniture designs, was left to fall into disrepair – and not before Le Corbusier himself had vandalised it. (Le Corbusier and Lloyd Wright: excellent buildings, unbearable personalities.)In 2013, apetitionfailed in its attempt to have Denise Scott Brown retroactively awarded the Pritzker prize; it had been awarded solely to her husband Robert Venturi in 1991, despite the fact Scott Brown had been co-principal at the practice for 22 years. (Just six womenhave won the prize in its history, including Sejima and Hadid.) And I’ve lost count of the number of people who think both of theEameseswere men.View image in fullscreenDenise Scott Brown, photographed in 1978.Photograph: Lynn GilbertThe preponderance of women architects needs to improve then, not just to give due credit for, and make tangible, the aesthetic creativeness and beauty of their designs, but to facilitate the real-life actualities of half of the human population. The gradual culture shift within the field that fosters teamwork, better dialogue with clients and considerations of inclusivity, is testament to the fact that more women following in the footsteps of the greatNorma Merrick Sklarekand her fellow trailblazers is important. Women are increasingly advancing in other workplaces thanks to flexible and remote working, mentorship programmes, hiring reforms and the changing nature of networking events. Architecture must build on that.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArchitectureWomenZaha HadidThe RIBAfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A working-class mother driven to seek justice for her daughter in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. A modest, resilient woman finding dignity in lifeon the road in Nomadland.The actorFrances McDormand’sthree Oscar-winning performances display rare versatility but have empathy at their core. But qualities were on display last week when she joined the conceptual artistSuzanne Bocanegraat the opening of an exhibition featuring adult-sized cradles.McDormand’s and Bocanegra’s were the hands that rocked the cradle of Nancy Buchanan, 79, and 94-year-old Barbara T Smith, two doyennes of the Los Angeles art scene before Shaker lemon pie was served at Cradled, an exhibition inspired by the Shakers, a Christian sect formally known as the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing.Frances McDormand’s 10 best performances – ranked!Read moreThe Shakers are best known for their simple, communal lifestyle and ecstatic worship that included dancing and shaking (hence the name). Today the last active Shaker community in the world is located at Sabbath Day Lake in Maine,consisting of three members. But the group is gaining fresh attention.A new film,The Testament of Ann Lee, starsAmanda Seyfried as the woman who brought the Shakers from Britain to the American colonies in the 18th century. Cradled, at theHauser & Wirth Downtown Los Angelesgallery, highlights how the Shakers, who embraced celibacy and often sheltered more elders than children, developed a culture of end-of-life care.“Here’s a community where you are saved all the possessiveness, jealousy, enviousness – all the things that come along with carnal relations between men and women, men and men, women and women,” McDormand says from New York in a group Zoom call.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Keith Lubow“If you subtract that, how much more successful can a community be? Sometimes I get frustrated with the idea of, ‘Oh, they only lasted so long as they didn’t have children. They weren’t having sex; of course they weren’t successful.’ In fact, they were successful for 200 years because of that.”Bocanegra, who co-conceived and co-curated the exhibition, chimes in: “That’s what makes the cradle such an interesting object, because it’s something we associate with an infant and yet, for the Shakers, it was used more for adults and for the end of life.”The show features four Shaker cradles on loan from Shaker museums spanning the country from New England to Kentucky. Each is paired with a tableau of Shaker rocking chairs and woven baskets filled with projects so that visitors can take part in the literal and figurative act of mending, an activity at the heart of Shaker values.Sharon Koomler, collections manager atthe Shaker Museumin Chatham, New York, which drew on its archive for the show, observes: “The Shakers weren’t the only ones in the world using an adult cradle but we do find that it speaks to their tender care of people from the cradle to the grave, so to speak, from youth all the way through their advancing years and in their infirmities. It is a way to soothe someone.“From a former nursing background, I can tell you that rocking helps to prevent pressure sores because you’re not leaving anybody on one pressure point, so there’s a practical reason for it as well as the soothing emotional reason.”Jerry Grant, the museum’s director of library and collections, says: “It was a two-person activity, so it meant that if you were being rocked there was somebody with you. When you had Shakers who were ill or dying, they were not left alone. The cradle gives an opportunity for both people to have purpose in that relationship.”McDormand’s fascination with the Shakers grew out of a performance she gave forthe Wooster Group, a New York experimental theater company, based on an album of five Shaker women singing songs passed down through oral history. She became acquainted with Koomler and Grant of the Shaker Museum and staged a forerunner of the show at its pop-up gallery in Kinderhook, New York.McDormand explains: “I was drawn to the adult-sized cradles in the collection because it was something that was provocative in its size and in its use for the infirm and elderly. I was honoured to be asked to create something at the Kinderhook space. I had worked with Suzanne on some of her art lectures and she was one of the most interesting and funny conceptual artists I knew.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Keith LubowThe exhibition is designed to be an immersive, multi-sensory environment. Bocanegra and McDormand worked with the composer David Lang, and Skip Lievsay and Paul Umstron, sound editors, on an end-of-life lullaby that resonates throughout. Lang adapted the text for his “last lullaby” from a Shaker spiritual about eternal life.Asked how her career as a performer translates to the confines of a gallery, McDormand replies: “Well, I’m trying to do that as little as possible in my life, period, and also especially in this space. We enter the space and work is what informs the space, not performance. We’re trying to make it clear that people aren’t coming to a performance.It’s not performative; it’s more experiential.”Bocanegra adds: “We hope that people will feel free to be comfortable and sit.The audience decides how much time they want to spend with the piece and we try to make this installation the kind of thing where you felt like you were welcome and you could sit with it and you could contemplate and we’re hoping that the longer you stay, the more you get out of it.”The Shakers wereborn in Manchester in Britainbut were formally established in America after Mother Ann Lee and a small group of followers arrived in 1774. The movement flourished for more than 200 years.The Shakers were dedicated to pacifism, natural health and hygiene. Their philosophy is encapsulated in sayings such as, “Hands to work, hearts to God” and “Do your work as if you had a thousand years to live but as if you knew you might die tomorrow.” This focus on durable, useful craftsmanship, rather than decoration, resulted in an aesthetic of spare beauty.McDormand says:“If you look at Japanese design, you look at Scandinavian design, you look at mid-century modern, you look at early American, it’s not about decoration, it’s about utility. But because of that and because of the attention that’s given to it, it ends up being beautiful.”View image in fullscreenA cabinet card photograph of Shaker sisters Martha Jane Anderson, Grace Bowers, and Anna White in the North Family Sewing Room, Mount Lebanon, New York, circa 1890 – 1910.Photograph: Courtesy Shaker Museum, Chatham NYGrant chips in: “People will say, ‘I need to simplify my life.’ The Shakers would say simplicity is a singleness of heart. Making your life simpler was to keep yourself simply focused on one thing and not let it get all cluttered up. That’s a lesson that we can always learn. It’s not about just getting rid of the stuff in your house, it’s about what’s inside.”The Shakers were also highly entrepreneurial and self-sufficient. A surprising discovery in the museum archive wasa 1960s Barbie dolldressed in a custom Shaker outfit and created as a product for sale. At the same time they practiced charity, always planting a surplus to provide for their neighbours and those in need.McDormand reflects: “For some reason, people think religious sects are constantly seeking funds or taking a vow of poverty, but they they took care of themselves very well with seed collections and furniture and a lot of different things. One of them was doll clothes and so we saw one of the first Barbie dolls dressed in a Shaker outfit, which was exciting for us, being of our age group.”The actor and producer adds: “I like to call us Shaker-adjacent. There’s many of us that are Shaker-adjacent. We haven’t been thoroughly able to embrace the theology, necessarily, but certainly the ethos and the community spirit.”Cradled is on display at Hauser & Wirth in Los Angeles until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFrances McDormandArtReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’re essentially security cameras with a chime function.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Choosing the best video doorbell can be a bewildering task, with various factors to consider, including how much of your doorstep you want to see or whether you’re prepared to pay for a subscription. To help make the decision a little bit easier, I tested eight popular video doorbells to find the best.At a glanceBest video doorbell overall:Google Nest Doorbell (battery)£119.98 at John LewisBest budget video doorbell:Blink smart video doorbell with Sync Module 2£59.99 at VeryBest subscription-free video doorbell:Eufy video doorbell E340£99.99 at ArgosWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing products, including everything fromvacuum cleanersand robot lawnmowers to computers and games, for various publications for more than three decades.

It gives me a good understanding of what I’m likely to be looking for in the next one I buy.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I lived with this rigged-up contraption on my doorstep for a fortnight.’Photograph: Andy ShawThe only way to test a doorbell is to stick it next to your front door and see how well it works. To achieve this, I mounted all eight on a board at doorbell height and lived with this rigged-up contraption on my doorstep for a fortnight. Delivery drivers were rightly suspicious of the number of buttons and cameras, and struggled to work out whether it was them or the doorbells that were being tested.I’m not sure whether my neighbours noticed them all, or spotted the number of times I lapped my drive at various times of day and night to test the movement sensors. If they did, they were too polite to mention it.I compared the doorbells by measuring how close I could get to the door before the motion detection was triggered, how much video was recorded and how useful that footage was. I timed how long it took for notifications to reach the doorbells’ apps on a smartphone and how long it took for the doorbell to send an alert or ring a chime (if included) when its button was pressed. I also tested the apps, examined the prices and considered the additional cost of subscriptions.All doorbells that didn’t need to be returned to the brands are being donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best video doorbells in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: RichLegg/Getty ImagesBest video doorbell overall:Google Nest Doorbell (battery)GoogleNest Doorbell (battery)from£119.98£119.98 at John Lewis£119.98 at AmazonWhat we loveGood viewing angle and quick to send alerts to mobile devices and smart speakersWhat we don’t loveRequires a £60 subscription to store footage and doesn’t come with a chimeThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£119.98 at John Lewis£119.98 at AmazonDoorbells can be inundated with features, and their apps can be amazing. But if they don’t do a good job of letting you know when someone approaches your door and captures a video of them, there really isn’t much point. The Nest Doorbell (battery) performed these tasks the best.Why we love itIn my tests, the Nest was a solid all-rounder. I found the viewing angle of its lens to be about perfect, not going so wide that people appear too small, but still capturing enough of the surrounding area to catch people skirting around its periphery. The video and audio were as consistently clear as those on any of the doorbells I tested, and they were decent both in daylight and at night.The Nest sometimes detected people right at the end of my drive, but proved consistent at capturing movement from about 3m away. I found there was some delay between the button being pressed and notifications arriving on Nest devices and smartphones, but it averaged at a fairly reasonable five seconds. While not as fast as the doorbells that had dedicated local chimes, which tend to go off almost immediately, this was among the fastest for sending alerts to smartphones and smart speakers.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with a chime. Instead, you need to buy a separateNest Mini smart speaker, which costs £49 (or use an existing Nest or Amazon Echo speaker). You also have to sign up for theNest Aware subscriptionat £60 a year – without it, motion events are stored for only three hours, which isn’t hugely useful.Subscription:Google Home Premium (30-day storage, records only when movement triggered), £8/month or £80/year; Google Home Premium Advanced (60-day storage, records 24/7), £16/month or £160/yearGoogleNest Doorbell (battery)from£119.98£119.98 at John Lewis£119.98 at AmazonWhat we loveGood viewing angle and quick to send alerts to mobile devices and smart speakersWhat we don’t loveRequires a £60 subscription to store footage and doesn’t come with a chimeBest budget video doorbell:Blink smart video doorbell with Sync Module 2BlinkSmart video doorbell with Sync Module 2from£59.99£59.99 at Very£59.99 at AmazonWhat we loveOne of the most affordable doorbells; saves footage to local storageWhat we don’t lovePoor microphone quality makes audio conversations with visitors difficult£59.99 at Very£59.99 at AmazonThe Blink is the only model I reviewed that costs less than £100. Amazon’s bargain basement doorbell costs as little as £49, and while you get what you pay for in terms of quality, it does the job.Why we love itPrice is the key selling point here because it’s significantly more affordable than its nearest competitor. However, we reviewed the version that comes with Blink’sSync Module 2, which costs only £10 more. This plugs into a wall socket and lets you connect USB storage (I used a USB flash memory drive). The device then locally backs up video that’s saved to the cloud, so you won’t lose any footage unless your local storage fills up. You still need a (relatively affordable)subscriptionfor motion detection to work, though.For a cheaper camera, I was impressed with the video footage. It has a wide-angle lens, so there’s a bit of a fish-eye effect around the edges, but it’s not so wide that people approaching the doorbell look tiny.It’s a shame that …the two-way audio isn’t great. The microphone quality was the worst I tested, so it’s best suited to those not planning to have lengthy conversations with people on the doorstep.Subscription:Basic Plan, £2.50/month or £24.99/year (30-day storage), single device; Plus Plan, £8/month or £80/year, multiple devices (30-day storage)BlinkSmart video doorbell with Sync Module 2from£59.99£59.99 at Very£59.99 at AmazonWhat we loveOne of the most affordable doorbells; saves footage to local storageWhat we don’t lovePoor microphone quality makes audio conversations with visitors difficultBest subscription-free video doorbell:Eufy video doorbell E340EufyVideo doorbell E340from£74.99£99.99 at Argos£74.99 at AmazonWhat we loveNo subscription required as footage is saved to the doorbell’s own storageWhat we don’t loveUnreliable motion detection sometimes misses fast-moving visitorsThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£99.99 at Argos£74.99 at AmazonMost video doorbells provide limited features without additional costs, hiding all their best bits (such as storing video for any length of time) behind a paywall. The Eufy E340 is unusual because it ditches the paid-for subscription concept entirely.Why we love itThe Eufy uses local rather than cloud storage, with 8GB built in to the device. How long that lasts before overwriting itself will depend on how busy your doorstep is. This built-in storage makes it one of the more expensive models, although that’s not its only trick. It uses two cameras, with an extra one pointed to the floor, so you can also keep an eye on parcels and packages (and analyse your visitors’ footwear).It’s a shame that …while the stars have aligned over the Eufy’s video quality and lack of subscription costs, there were one or two occasions when movement didn’t trigger the camera early enough or at all. Ideally, I’d prefer something more reliable.Subscription:none requiredEufyVideo doorbell E340from£74.99£99.99 at Argos£74.99 at AmazonWhat we loveNo subscription required as footage is saved to the doorbell’s own storageWhat we don’t loveUnreliable motion detection sometimes misses fast-moving visitorsThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Integrates smoothly with Amazon’s Echo smart speakers’: the Ring Battery Video Doorbell Pro.Aqara G4AqaraG4from£79.99£79.99 at Aqara£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveReplaceable batteries mean no down-time for chargingWhat we don’t loveThe app for reviewing footage is cumbersome and overcomplicatedThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£79.99 at Aqara£79.99 at AmazonBest for:no charging timeThe big problem with rechargeable doorbell batteries is that there’s a period when they have to be removed from the door and charged up, at which point any visiting friends will have to knock, and unwanted visitors won’t be recorded. This doorbell uses six AA batteries rather than a rechargeable, so its only downtime is while you’re replacing them.This model also comes with the option of recording video to a microSD card, which slots into the supplied chime, sitting safely inside the house. However, it only provides access to the past seven days of video recordings through the app. To view further back, you have to remove the memory card and watch the files through a PC.It didn’t make the final cut because …the app is nothing short of horrible. It has an AI chatbot. No, I don’t know why either. It was also one of the slowest to send notifications to a smartphone.Subscription:not required if using a memory card. A free subscription option downgrades footage to 360p and keeps it available for only seven days, so it isn’t particularly useful. The paid-for tier stores at full 2K resolution and keeps it for 30 days, for $4.99/month (about £3.88) or $49.99/year (about £38.86)AqaraG4from£79.99£79.99 at Aqara£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveReplaceable batteries mean no down-time for chargingWhat we don’t loveThe app for reviewing footage is cumbersome and overcomplicatedRing Battery video doorbell ProRingBattery video doorbell Profrom£119£119 at John Lewis£119 at AmazonWhat we loveCaptures footage continuously, so never misses any movementWhat we don’t loveSlow to send alerts to mobile devices, which can leave visitors waitingThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£119 at John Lewis£119 at AmazonBest for:Alexa usersThe big brother of the Blink doorbell, with a price to match.

That means people are still reasonably sized in the captured videos, but it gets a fish-eye effect around the edges, making it tricky to catch people hiding or sneaking up.The app is simple to use. It has few frills, but that may suit someone who doesn’t want their doorbell to be too complicated.

It’s more expensive but sits comfortably in the middle of the price range of doorbells reviewed, and it can record video locally on a microSD card. However, there’s still a £2.99-a-month subscription available. That lets you save captured footage to the cloud as well as or instead of a memory card and sends camera snapshots with its text alert notifications.For the price, I was impressed with the quality of the footage captured, but it uses colour night vision as it gets dark, which was a bit too grainy. It has a wide 180-degree viewing angle and comes with a chime that sounds inside when someone pushes the doorbell button.It didn’t make the final cut because …motion detection started at about 1.5m in our tests, which meant some movement was missed.

Smart doorbells are crammed with features designed to make you think they sound good, luring you into choosing one over another. However, you should also take into account how good they are at alerting you when people arrive at your door, and whether you’ll be able to tell who it is when you watch a video or live feed on your smartphone, as I did in my tests.Battery vs wired video doorbellsIf you have an existing wired doorbell, you can use its wiring to connect most video doorbells. There are two main benefits to a wired doorbell: there’s no battery, so it doesn’t need to be recharged; and it will ring the existing doorbell chime inside the house when the doorbell button is pressed. They’re a bit more complicated to install, though, so if you’re not a competent electrician, we’d suggest getting a professional to do it for you.Battery doorbells are much easier to install, but charging them can be a faff. You usually have to remove the doorbell (or at least its battery) and charge it overnight. During that time, you have no doorbell or camera. You’ll probably have to do this every month or so, but it depends on the battery and how busy your doorstep is.Some doorbells can use a spare battery or come with regular batteries that can simply be swapped, so you don’t need to be without a doorbell while it charges. Others can be topped up using a small solar panel, either out of the box or as an additional accessory.Installing your video doorbellInstalling a new battery doorbell is simple. Most come with a mounting plate to attach wherever you want the doorbell to sit. Screwing into a wooden door frame is easy and convenient, if your doorway has one, but it can also be mounted on to a wall if you’re prepared to drill some holes and use a wall plug to hold the screws in place. Once the battery is charged, the doorbell attaches to the mounting plate.If you’re replacing a wired doorbell, ensure you switch off the electricity first. This should be possible through your circuit breaker, and you should test it before you remove your old doorbell by ringing it – if it stops ringing, you’ve successfully shut off the power to it. The old wires should then attach to terminals on the new doorbell, but we’d strongly advise tackling this only if you know what you’re doing, or getting a professional to do it for you.Subscriptions and storageOne of the hidden costs of a video doorbell is the price of a subscription, which usually costs a few pounds a month and includes some form of cloud storage. Without a subscription, most video doorbells are little more than a regular doorbell with the video equivalent of a peephole that allows you to see who is at the door right at that second. A storage subscription elevates it into an archive of visitors, with video footage of everyone who’s been on your doorstep in recent days, so you can go back and check.Having said this, some doorbells (such as the Blink and Eufy doorbells reviewed here) have their own storage, can accept a memory card or connect to a wireless hub that’s kept inside the house. This kind of doorbell can be used without a subscription and still store footage locally, though many still offer a subscription alongside that can provide additional features, such as recognising the faces of your visitors.Do video doorbells work with voice assistants?Video doorbells integrate nicely with other smart home devices. The most useful add-on is a smart screen, such asAmazon’s Echo Show (available in various sizes from £89.99) orGoogle’s Nest Hub Max (£159). These screens can be set to alert you when your doorbell rings and immediately switch to a live video feed from the doorbell camera.Smart speakers such asAmazon’s Echo DotandGoogle’s Nest Minican also be used in conjunction with a doorbell, though without a screen, they can’t display a live view. You can still set them to chime, which can be useful for hearing the doorbell all around your house.Video doorbells can also be controlled using Amazon and Google’s smart assistants. You can use voice commands to perform doorbell tasks, such as showing the view from your doorbell on your phone or smart screen.Your doorbell doesn’t have to come from the same company as your smart device or favoured voice assistant; Google’s Nest Doorbell is compatible with Amazon Alexa as well as Google Assistant devices, for example. However, you tend to get more functions with a directly compatible system – Amazon’s Echo devices, for example, with a Ring or Blink doorbell.How long do video doorbells generally last?Quoting the battery life of a video doorbell is problematic, even for the manufacturers. Amazon states only that the batteries in its Ring doorbells can last for “months”, while Google quotes the battery life of the Nest Doorbell (battery) as between one and six months. Both are too vague to be particularly useful.However, it’s hard for the manufacturers to be more specific because there are huge differences between how people use their doorbells. If you live on a busy street, for example, and have motion detection switched on, your doorbell will be activated by every passerby. Video doorbells can also be activated by movement from cars, trees and animals.There are other factors that can reduce the battery life, too. If you often use it to view a live picture of your doorstep even when there’s no one there (which can be very tempting, especially when the doorbell is new), then the battery will run down faster. Battery life is also reduced in cold weather, so those living in chillier parts of the country might find that their battery doesn’t last as long, particularly during winter months.When it comes to the life of the doorbell itself, manufacturers tend to offer warranties of between one and two years. We’d expect that to be a minimum lifespan, as with few moving parts, there isn’t that much that can go wrong.The first thing that’s likely to fail is the battery, because they tend to deteriorate over time. That puts doorbells with removable batteries at a slight advantage, because a failed battery in a sealed device may be impossible to replace. You can extend a battery’s life by treating it well: wait until its charge is below 20% before recharging and try not to let it run down completely. That way there’s no real reason why a video doorbell shouldn’t last for years.In some cases it’s possible that a manufacturer’s support for a doorbell will run out before the hardware dies. For most doorbells, that’s about five years after the product was first launched. Support is usually withdrawn by stopping software updates, which can leave a product vulnerable to hacking, or by changing elements such as cloud storage services that can render advanced features unusable.Andy Shaw is aconsumer journalist and technology addict.

But with so many websites being shouty about their Black Friday offers, the best buys aren’t always easy to spot. So before you splash the cash, it might pay to do some research – and look closely at the specification.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I know this may not be welcome advice. After all, the thought of drawing up a spreadsheet of memory configurations and pricing history might put a slight dampener on the excitement that builds as Black Friday approaches. But buy the right laptop today and you can look forward to many years of joyful productivity. Pick a duff one, and every time you open the lid you’ll be cursing your past self’s impulsive nature. So don’t get caught out; be prepared with our useful tips – and a roundup of the Filter’s favourite laptop deals.Before you make the jump, also be sure you really need a new laptop withour guide to making the most out of your existing one.How to find a genuinely good Black Friday laptop dealView image in fullscreenFind out what a laptop is really like to use to ensure it’s right for you.Photograph: Oscar Wong/Getty ImagesDon’t sweat the CPUMany people get hung up on processor power, but this is the one thing you rarely need to worry about these days. Although new processor models come out with alarming frequency, almost any AMD Ryzen, Intel Core or Apple M-series chip of the past few years will be fine for everyday web browsing and office tasks. High-end models are only really needed for particularly demanding workloads; a quick trip to Google (or your AI chatbot of choice) will help you see how different processor models measure up.Plan ahead with plenty of RAM and storageEvery laptop needs a decent amount of memory. If the system is starved of RAM, then performance will be sluggish, regardless of the CPU’s speed. While Windows 11 runs acceptably in 8GB, a minimum of 16GB will help ensure that future updates continue to run smoothly. Some models are upgradeable, so you can start with a basic allocation of RAM and add more as your needs grow, but this certainly isn’t something you can take for granted.Laptop storage is also rarely expandable, except by plugging in a USB flash drive or an external SSD. That might be fine if your device will spend much of its time on a desk, but if you want to carry it around with you – not an unreasonable ask for a computer of this type – it’s a drag. So while a base-level 256GB SSD might suffice for home-working, consider stepping up to 512GB or even 1TB of internal storage, especially if you want to edit videos or play big 3D games. Look into battery life, weight and overall dimensions, too, if portability is a priority.Find out what it’s really like to useSome important considerations – such as the quality of the screen and keyboard – don’t show up on the spec sheet, yet these things are arguably just as important as the processor and memory. If the display is dim and blocky, and typing emails feels like pressing Scrabble tiles into a flannel, it will make day-to-day working more difficult.Since online retail doesn’t give you an opportunity to try tapping out “the quick brown fox” for yourself, the next best thing is to read reviews of other people’s hands-on experience. Pay particular attention to the model number, though: laptops often come in a few variants, including a high-end version that will usually get great reviews – and a more cheaply made model that can be flogged for a knock-down price on Black Friday.Is this a genuine special offer?The final thing to check is whether the bargain that’s flashing up on your screen is actually a deal at all. You can look up past prices for a vast range of items by going toCamelCamelCamel– yes, really – and either typing in a laptop model number or pasting in the web address of an Amazon product page. You may find that the heavily promoted Black Friday price is identical to last month’s standard price on Amazon. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad deal, but it signals that you probably don’t need to race to grab a once-in-a-lifetime bargain (we’ve made sure to list this price history on all the laptop deals below).Indeed, with Cyber Monday, pre- and post-Christmas sales, Easter specials, Amazon Prime Day, back-to-school offers and so forth, you’re rarely more than a few weeks away from the next big discount event – so don’t let the excitement of Black Friday encourage you into making a hasty purchase.Darien Graham-SmithFor more, read the Filter’s roundup of thebest early Black Friday dealsQ&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts.

It’s sleek, portable and stylish, although it lacks ports, so you may need to pick up a cheap USB-C adapter to supplement. The 13.6in Liquid Retina screen is sharp and detailed, while 18 hours of battery life is sure to keep you up and running for a couple of working days away from the mains.Price history:this is the lowest ever price.A top-end MacBook AirView image in fullscreenApple MacBook Air M4 13in£849 at Amazon£849 at CurrysThe current flagship MacBook Air has dropped back to its lowest ever price for Black Friday, complete with its capable M4 chip inside.

There are incremental upgrades elsewhere, such as 16GB on this base model, plus the ability to connect to two external displays with the lid down. Otherwise, this is the same modern MacBook Air we know and love, with a dazzling Liquid Retina screen and up to 18 hours of battery life. You will need a cheap USB-C adapter to extend the ports to a more usable selection.Price history:a return to its lowest ever price.A decent everyday laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Aspire 14 AI£399 at CurrysFor basic working needs, this Acer Aspire 14 AI has everything you need at a wallet-friendly price. The Snapdragon X chip inside provides more than enough power for day-to-day tasks, plus it enables this laptop to last for up to 28 hours on a charge, which means battery woes can be pushed to the back of your mind. A RAM allocation of 16GB is handy for multitasking, and a 512GB SSD is a decent amount of storage at this price. The 14in, 1,920 x 1,200 IPS panel is perfectly serviceable for productivity tasks, plus its 120Hz refresh rate keeps onscreen action zippy.Price history:not available, but this is the lowest ever price at Currys.A good mid-range laptopView image in fullscreenHP Omnibook 5£599.99 at John LewisThe HP Omnibook 5 is a solid mid-ranger, offering decent performance on a larger screen. An eight-core AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 processor is paired with 16GB of RAM and a larger 1TB SSD. It also benefits from a larger 16in, 1,920 x 1,200 IPS display. It also comes in a pleasant blue colour, and has ports including USB-C, USB-A and HDMI, plus a full-size, backlit keyboard.Price history:this is the best price for this model – historical best on Amazon is £820, so a good saving.A lightweight Windows laptopView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook A14£619 at John LewisMade from an innovative blend of ceramic and aluminium, this Asus Zenbook A14 is one of the lightest Windows laptops you’ll find, weighing in at less than a kilo. Not only is it super light, but a Snapdragon X chip alongside 16GB of RAM ensures enough grunt for productivity and multitasking.A 1TB SSD is handy for storing documents, apps, and more besides, while the 14in 1,920 x 1,200 OLED screen is compact and sharp. Asus also rates this laptop to last for up to 32 hours on a charge – while my tests put it at about 21 hours, I’ll happily take nearly three days of use away from the mains.Price history:not available.A budget Samsung laptopView image in fullscreenSamsung Galaxy Book4£299 at AmazonThe Samsung Galaxy Book4 is an attractive Windows alternative to similarly priced Chromebooks, offering greater software flexibility for getting work done. It includes an impressive range of ports for the price, with USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, microSD and even wired Ethernet in the mix. The Intel Core 3 processor will happily cope with everyday productivity tasks, and is supported by 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for storage.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.Dual-screen powerView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook Duo (2025)£1,539.99 at AmazonIf one screen isn’t enough for you, then the Asus Zenbook Duo is an intriguing concept. It’s a laptop that can beallscreen, with a pair of 14in 3K 120Hz OLED screens with excellent clarity and motion. They can be used as touchscreens for design work or for some clever multi-tasking, especially with the laptop’s detachable keyboard and trackpad. Inside, there’s a powerful Intel Core Ultra 9 285H processor along with 32GB of RAM and a capacious 2TB SSD. Battery life is also pretty good, lasting 12 or so hours in my tests.Price history:this is the best price for this model.A two-in-one for £300 lessView image in fullscreenDell 16 Plus 2-in-1£549 at AmazonIf you want the powers of a conventional laptop and a very large-screen tablet in one, then the Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1 is a well-specced option, and it’s £300 off at Amazon (not currently listed as a price cut, but price history on Keepa shows the discount, making this a hidden deal of sorts).It comes with a 16in, 1,920 x 1,200 IPS screen, providing lots of real estate for everything from conventional productivity tasks in its laptop form factor to more design-orientated projects in its tablet form. This screen has a vibrant 600 nits of peak brightness and there’s Dolby Vision HDR support for extra sharpness in supported content.Inside, it’s got an eight-core Intel Core Ultra 7 256V processor – often found on laptops much more expensive than this. It provides great performance for both productivity and more intensive tasks, and is an efficient chip while doing so – Dell quotes battery life as up to 21 hours on a charge. To go with it, there’s 16GB of RAM and an OK capacity 512GB SSD. It also comes in a stylish sky blue colour, and has a decent port selection with two USB-Cs, a USB-A and an HDMI port.Price history:this is the best price for this model.A bargain ChromebookView image in fullscreenAcer Chromebook Plus 515£235.99 at AmazonChromebooks have always been deemed inferior to Windows laptops, but you can now easily find genuinely capable budget options with few compromises. Acer’s Chromebook Plus 515 features a modest Intel processor with six cores that should prove sufficiently speedy for basic tasks, while its 8GB of RAM will allow you to have multiple Chrome tabs open without the device grinding to a halt. You also get 256GB of SSD storage for apps and light games, plus room for any local documents that aren’t in Google’s online suite. There’s also a handy 15.6in Full HD screen and a decent set of ports for this bargain-basement price.If you feel like you need the extra performance, you can step up to a Core i5 processor with an extra four cores for anextra £102 at Amazon.Price history:it was £12.79 cheaper in a deal this summer.A cheap ChromebookView image in fullscreenAsus Chromebook Plus CX14£209 at VeryThis Asus Chromebook Plus CX14 has the fundamentals of a decent laptop for kids’ schoolwork, with a compact 14in Full HD screen plus 8GB of RAM for reasonable multitasking and a 128GB SSD for any apps or lightweight games. Inside, there’s an Intel Core 3 N355 processor with eight cores, which should be reasonable for the light workloads Chromebooks are designed for.This CX14 is a Chromebook Plus model, which means Google has designated it as a more powerful option. It benefits from clever software integrations such as the Photo Eraser editing trickery seen on Pixel phones, Offline File Sync for accessing Google Docs and so on offline, and Google Meet effects such as auto-framing and background blur.Price history:this is the best price at the moment – but it was lower earlier this Black Friday in a deal that’s now expired.A respectable Arm-based choiceView image in fullscreenAsus Vivobook 14£449.99 at John LewisThis Asus Vivobook 14 model is a compact and potent choice that won’t break the bank. Its Snapdragon X processor provides enough power for basic tasks and enables 19 hours of battery life per charge. There’s also 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for solid multitasking headroom and storage needs. The compact 14in, 1,920 x 1,200 IPS screen has a refresh rate of up to 75Hz for a little bit more responsiveness than the more standard 60Hz.This Vivobook also comes with a far-reaching port selection for the price, including a pair of USB-A ports, HDMI, USB-C and more besides.Price history:this is the best price for this model, although Amazon doesn’t stock it.A bargain LenovoView image in fullscreenLenovo IdeaPad Slim 5£449.99 at John LewisThis Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 is on a “reduced to clear” discount at John Lewis, giving you the chance to grab a bit of a bargain. It has everything you could want from a modern laptop: a compact 14in 1,920 x 1,200 OLED screen for dazzling results; an eight-core Snapdragon X Plus chip for zippy performance; and excellent battery life – Lenovo says the laptop can last for up to 20 hours or so on a charge, providing all-day working and then some. For multitasking and intensive tasks, 16GB of RAM provides plenty of headroom, while a 512GB SSD is fine for storage at this price.Price history:this was briefly cheaper in the summer.A powerful and portable ultrabookView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook 14£999.99 at AmazonThis Asus Zenbook 14 is a very capable choice. The Intel Core Ultra 9 285H processor with its 16 cores means it will be able to handle any tasks you throw at it, and 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD provide lots of capacity for multitasking and dealing with heavier, creative workloads. Elsewhere, the 14in 3K OLED screen is bright and delivers good detail, and a weight of just 1.2kg makes the Asus super portable. There’s a decent selection of ports, too –and its dark-blue chassis oozes class.If you don’t necessarily need the power of the Core Ultra 9 285H, and you’re happy with a slightly lower-end Core Ultra 7 model (which performs quite similarly in some tests) with 16GB of RAM, then that model is £799 from John Lewis, too.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A Zenbook with a high-resolution displayView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook S 16 OLEDskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The 14in 1,920 x 1,200-resolution IPS panel might not be an OLED, but it’s still perfectly capable for what this laptop is designed for. The port selection here is also pretty good, providing decent connectivity for most people’s needs.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A well-priced Lenovo laptopView image in fullscreenLenovo IdeaPad Slim 5£469.99 at AmazonThis Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 is a slightly older variant of the one above, arriving with a larger 16in, 1,920 x 1,200-resolution IPS screen, as opposed to that model’s 14in OLED. The eight cores and 12 threads of the Intel Core i5-13420H processor here deliver solid productivity performance, with room to step up to more intense workloads if the need arises. Elsewhere, 16GB of RAM and a capacious 1TB SSD are excellent for the price, plus there’s a decent port selection that includes USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, a microSD reader and more besides.Price history:this matches its lowest ever price.A slim ultrabook with an OLED displayView image in fullscreenAcer Swift X 14 AI£1,199.99 at AmazonThe Acer Swift X 14 AI is a slim and powerful ultrabook, featuring a dazzling 14in 2,880 x 1,800 OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth and responsive on-screen action. Its AMD Ryzen 7 AI 350 processor can handle anything from productivity tasks to more intensive work, with Nvidia’s RTX 5050 GPU stepping up where extra graphical horsepower is required. Elsewhere, the port count includes USB-C, USB-A, microSD and HDMI, all present in a chassis that’s less than 20mm thick and 1.57kg in weight.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A lightweight LG laptopView image in fullscreenLG Gram Pro 17Z90TR£1,669.99 at AmazonLG’s Gram laptops have long been lightweight and slender choices in their size classes, and this 17in model is no exception, weighing in at just 1.479kg. It’s also just 14.5mm thick, but maintains a decent port selection with Thunderbolt 4-capable USB-C ports, USB-A and HDMI options.The 17-inch 2.5K resolution screen with 144Hz refresh rate is zippy and responsive, thanks to an Nvidia RTX 5050 paired with a powerful Intel Core Ultra 7 255H processor. In spite of this power, LG says this laptop will last for up to 27 hours on a charge, giving you several days of work away from the mains.Price history:this is a match for its lowest ever price.A larger-screen Windows laptop for under £500View image in fullscreenAsus Vivobook 16 X1605VA£479.99 at AmazonFor a larger-screen Windows laptop for productivity tasks and the odd bit of more intensive work, this Asus Vivobook 16 is perfect. Performance is decent, thanks to a 10-core Intel Core 7-150U processor, plus 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for your storage needs. The 16-inch 1,920 x 1,200 IPS screen is pretty standard at this price, but a lay-flat hinge makes this laptop great for collaborative working. You also benefit here from a full-size keyboard, while USB-C, USB-A, HDMI and a headphone jack make up the port count.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An upgrade on the Acer aboveView image in fullscreenAcer Aspire 14 AI£699.99 at AmazonThe Acer Aspire 14 AI is different to the model above: it comes running an eight-core AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 chip, with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, rather than the Arm-based Snapdragon processor. Display-wise, you get a 14in 1,920 x 1,200 OLED panel that delivers deeper blacks and stronger contrast and colour accuracy, and a good selection of ports. This model is a little more expensive than the other version, but I’d argue the expense is justified.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A lightweight 16in laptopView image in fullscreenLG Gram Pro 16Z90TS£1,029.99 at Amazon£1,149 at CurrysIn keeping with the portable laptop theme, this LG Gram Pro 16Z90TS provides one of the lightest 16in laptops you’ll find, delivering a good selection of ports and solid performance, with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Intel’s Core Ultra 7 256V processor with eight cores and eight threads, plus its potent integrated graphics, provide enough oomph for both basic workloads and more intensive tasks. It’s a shame the 16in 2.5K 144Hz panel isn’t OLED; but it’s a decent IPS screen – it’s responsive and delivers good detail. Lasting for up to 25.5 hours on a charge, you’ll get a few days away from the mains.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The best Windows MacBook Pro alternativeView image in fullscreenAsus ProArt P16 (2025)£2,279.99 at AmazonThe Asus ProArt P16 (2025) is a creative’s dream, providing one of the most compelling Windows alternatives to a MacBook Pro. This RTX 5070 variant isn’t lacking in power for everything from video and photo editing to gaming, especially when paired with a AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor. There’s also a generous 64GB of RAM and 2TB SSD.The real kicker with this ProArt laptop is the display: a 16in 4K (3,840 x 2,400) 120Hz OLED screen that’s one of the best on the market for detail, clarity and generally sharp images – and I also found it pretty bright in my testing. There’s one of the best port selections out there, plus a comfortable keyboard, huge trackpad and stylish chassis. You are paying out for it, but this is a really excellent laptop.Price history:this is the best ever price for this model.The best gaming laptop dealsAn adequate 1080p gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Nitro V15£849.99 at AmazonThe Acer Nitro V15 is a respectable affordable gaming laptop and it’s dropped to its lowest price. It features a solid core for Full HD gaming, pairing Nvidia’s modest RTX 5060 GPU with a decently potent Intel Core i7-13620H processor. That might not be the latest in Team Blue’s catalogue, but it’s still capable, with 10 cores and 16 threads. Elsewhere, there’s a 15.6in Full HD IPS screen for solid detail, plus a 165Hz refresh rate for slick motion. There’s not too much of a gamer aesthetic, and there’s a solid set of ports, with everything from Ethernet for wired networking to USB-A and USB-C for expansion. The 1TB SSD is generous at this price.Price history:this is the best ever price by £50.An Asus ROG for lessView image in fullscreenAsus ROG Strix G16£1,599 at AO£1,599 at VeryAsus’s ROG gaming laptops typically carry a premium, but this Strix G16 is one of the cheapest RTX 5070 Ti-powered gaming machines available right now. Pairing it with a 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 7940HX processor will yield very capable gaming performance at this laptop’s native 1,920 x 1,200 resolution.The display also has a 165Hz refresh rate for more responsive onscreen action. Modern AAA games can be a storage hog, but the 1TB SSD means there’s enough headroom for a good few here, while 16GB of RAM is enough for gaming loads.Price history:not available, but cheaper than the closest equivalent on Amazon.A mid-range gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Nitro V16 AI£1,089.99 at Amazon£1,099 at VeryAcer’s Nitro V16 is a strong mid-range gaming laptop, especially in this spec, which pairs an RTX 5070 graphics card with AMD’s eight-core Ryzen AI 7 350 processor. The setup delivers solid performance at 1080p and the laptop’s native 2,560 x 1,600 resolution – although the higher resolution may benefit from reduced settings and some upscaling. A 180Hz refresh rate makes for a smooth and responsive panel, and the laptop comes with a well-rounded port selection, too. Acer rounds off the package with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A sub-£1,000 gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAsus V16£799 at AmazonAt £799, the Asus V16 is quite a feature-rich gaming laptop, as long as you don’t mind its modest 1080p display. The 10-core, 16-thread Intel Core 7 240H processor paired with an RTX 5060 laptop GPU brings solid performance to the table, alongside the powers of Nvidia’s DLSS4 upscaler and the multi-frame-gen tech, if you want it. The 16GB of RAM will be good to run most modern games, with the 1TB SSD generous for storage. All of this helps to drive a large, 16in, 1,920 x 1,200-resolution, 144Hz-refresh-rate screen for a solid blend of detail and responsiveness. An array of USB-C, USB-A, HDMI ports and more deliver decent connectivity, too.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A decent laptop for 1080p gamingView image in fullscreenHP Victus 15-fb2008na£899.99 at John LewisIf you’re after a decent gaming machine for 1080p duties, then this HP Victus 15-fb2008na model packs a punch for a decent price. It might feature the latest components inside, but it’s one of the better budget gaming laptops out there, pairing an RTX 4060 GPU with a six-core AMD Ryzen 5 8645HS processor.There’s a 15.6in Full HD 144Hz IPS screen, plus 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Connectivity is very capable for the price, too, with USB-As, USB-C, HDMI, wired Ethernet and an SD card reader.Price history:this is the best price for this model, although Amazon doesn’t stock it.A gaming laptop with heaps of styleView image in fullscreenAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025)£1,999.99 at John LewisAsus’s gaming laptops carry a bit of a premium, and arguably none more so than its Zephyrus line. This is Asus’ most stylish set of laptops, pairing beefy internals for gaming grunt with a compact, suave chassis. In this example, there’s an RTX 5070 GPU and an AMD Ryzen 9 270 processor, plus 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. That’s a good core for playing games at both 1080p and 1440p. The display here is a dazzling 14in 3K (or 2,880 x 1,800) 120Hz OLED screen for sublime detail, clarity and smooth motion, plus we’ve got a slim and slender chassis for such a powerful laptop that has a good set of ports. It includes a pair of USB-C ports, plus two USB-As, HDMI and more.Price history:£50 off the best price ever from Amazon.A high-performance gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAlienware 18 Area-51£2,899 at Amazon£2,998.99 at DellIf it’s averycapable gaming laptop you’re after, this Alienware 18 Area-51 is one of the strongest options you’ll find. A 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and Nvidia’s second-in-command RTX 5080 laptop GPU deliver the goods for gaming on its huge 18in QHD+ resolution screen. The IPS panel here is strong, too, with its super-high 300Hz refresh rate bringing impeccable motion handling. There’s 32GB of DDR5 RAM and a generous 2TB SSD. Sporting Alienware’s classic space-age looks, you’ll need some muscle if you plan to use it on the move – this laptop is big and bulky; but the extra room also means it arrives with an enviable set of ports.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An attractive Acer laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Predator Helios Neo 16 AI£1,599.99 at AmazonThe Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 AI is one of the best value gaming laptops in its price class – but it’s become an even stronger proposition with a £300 price cut. On the inside beats an RTX 5070 Ti GPU alongside the same beefy Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor as the Alienware option above to handle the most demanding of games on its 16-inch, 2,560 x 1,600-resolution screen. The panel’s 240Hz refresh rate delivers smooth motion, plus you also get 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Those looking for style as well as substance won’t be disappointed, as the Acer is quite a looker compared to other gaming behemoths out there. If price-to-performance is the name of the game, this is a candidate for the best we’ve seen this Black Friday so far.Price history:this is its lowest ever price, although it was only 1p more for a period in September.Reece BithreyFor more:How to shop smart this Black FridayHow to avoid bad Black Friday TV dealsThe best early Black Friday dealsThe best Black Friday beauty dealsExplore more on these topicsLaptopsThe FilterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now it’s hyperbaric chambers and longevity chat. Andrew Carnie, CEO of the private club, explains how life and trends have changed since the Covid eraJess Cartner-MorleyTue 25 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTShareFriday night in the north of England. On the ninth floor of the old Granada Studios, a very chi-chi crowd is drinking tequila and eating crisps. Not Walkers out of the bag, mind, but canapes of individual crisps with creme fraiche and generous dollops of caviar. A young woman – leather shorts, chunky boots, neon lime nails, artfully messy bob – winks at me from the other side of the silver tray. “Ooh, caviar.Veryposh forManchester.”Soho House’s 48th members’ club has caused quite the stir. Thirty years after Nick Jones opened the first club in Soho, London, the first north of England outpost of the empire is raising eyebrows. An exclusive club, in the city that AJP Taylor described as “the only place in England which escapes our characteristic vice of snobbery”. (The home, after all, of the Guardian.) An open-air rooftop pool, in the climate that fostered the textile industry because the rain created the perfect cool, damp conditions for spinning cotton. Will it work?A 2,500-strong waitlist – the highest of any Soho House worldwide – suggests it just might. Rewind a few hours before the party, and I am with the boss, Andrew Carnie, CEO of Soho House. The space is teeming with workers in hi-vis jackets and cleaners wielding mops, and Primal Scream’s rider (bottles of spirits, along with jars of chamomile teabags) is still being installed in a makeshift dressing room, but Carnie is convinced the timing is perfect. Born 30 miles away in Preston, he has seen Manchester “change dramatically, and flourish dramatically. It has physically expanded, and extended its worldview. Hospitality has boomed, the creative industries have grown, the universities are thriving and it seems like a lot of folks who go to universities stay, which is great in the city.” Tomorrow, a second opening night will see Loyle Carner perform; in February, when the Brit awards moves from London to the city’s Co-op Live Arena, Soho House Manchester will host the afterparty. “I think this is going to be one of our most successful houses,” says Carnie.View image in fullscreenPrimal Scream headline the opening night party at Soho House Manchester.Photograph: Kadir GoldWhether or not you have ever been inside a Soho House, it has infiltrated your culture. Perhaps you watched Carrie and Samantha sneak into the rooftop pool of the New York club, in Sex and the City. You might remember that Harry and Meghan had their first date in one of the London houses. Maybe you have heard the rumour that, when the first LA house opened, Kim Kardashian’s application was turned down. (I did ask; Soho House does not comment on members.) But the man at the top of the business, who took over from Nick Jones when the founderstepped aside in 2022after treatment for prostate cancer that he said “changed my perspective and focus”, is a friendly and approachable 51-year-old, tattoo just visible at the cuff of his black Henley top, pristine white trainers, zero red-velvet-rope airs and graces. (A Guardian reader, indeed.) By contrast to the larger-than-life Jones, Carnie is understated. For example: he tells me he “likes running”, which turns out to mean that he recently completed a 155-mile, six-day ultra marathon across the Sahara and is getting ready for an ultra marathon across the Colorado mountains next year. It is, he says, “a good way of keeping fit”.What sets Soho House apart from the four-century tradition of members clubs, that has its roots in the armchairs-and-claret enclaves of Mayfair and Piccadilly, is its self-proclaimed identity as being “for creative people”. This has been both the stardust that can make membership feel like a golden ticket – what Jones foresaw in 1995 was that, in contemporary culture, everyone likes to see themselves as “a creative” – and the ingredient that can rub people up the wrong way. (To paraphrase the critics: “telly wankers”.) The definition of creative people, says Carnie, is broad. “AI is creative. Hospitality is creative. Anyone can apply, and we have members from every industry.” The Manchester membership, he says, skews towards entrepreneurs. With fees starting at £1,200 a year – pricing is the same for every house in the world, but lower for under-27s – membership is privileged, but “we try not to be exclusive”, Carnie says. In Manchester, he will take part in a mentorship scheme that connects members with local creatives from lower socioeconomic or underrepresented backgrounds, who are invited to panels, workshops and networking in-house to grow their connections, confidence and experience.In the late 90s, Soho House was about power breakfasts, boozy lunches and late-night carousing. All of which still happens, but Soho Houses have evolved as the way all of us live has changed. The membrane between our on-duty and off-duty lives has become more porous; 24/7 technology has erased the possibility of ever clocking off. The Soho House model – a third space that is neither work nor home, neither completely public nor entirely private – has become a space people gravitate toward.View image in fullscreenThe cocktail menu on the opening night.Photograph: Kadir Gold“The shift was really accentuated coming out of Covid,” says Carnie. “People had gotten lonely. We are humans, and we like to be around other people. What we’ve found is that when companies have policies that allow working from home, lots of our members prefer to work from our clubs.” The appeal of this has, in fact, become a challenge, and the houses now “discourage” working all day, he says. “Laptops in the morning, social in the afternoon.” A “no-phones” rule has had to be modified now that most of us cannot bear to be parted from our devices: phones on tables are fine, but you can’t take photos or make calls.Wellness is the new hedonism. Fitness is no longer just about grinding out 5k on a treadmill before getting on with your day, but a conversation topic, and an aesthetically sophisticated element of an aspirational lifestyle. “We all want to be healthier,” says Carnie. “But if you go back five or six years, that was all about cardiovascular fitness: you would run, row, whatever. But new science has come out that tells us we have to have strength. We still do run clubs, but now we have Reformer pilates studios,Hiit classes, padel courts.” Contrast chambers with saunas and cold plunge tubs are in huge demand, mirroring the explosion of interest in wild swimming, and the pop-up saunas that have appeared all over Britain in the past two years. The next growth area is longevity. At the Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a “Lazy Lab” offers IV infusion drips, 60-minute sessions in a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber and diagnostic testing to “future-proof” your health. “That’s what our members are telling us they want next,” says Carnie.But the future, at least according to Soho House, is not as demoralisingly virtuous as that might suggest. Sticky toffee pudding remains their bestselling dessert, worldwide. (“If we ever try to take it off the menu, anywhere, it’s anarchy,” an executive chef tells me in the Manchester kitchen.) “Our members love a great dining experience,” says Carnie. “They don’t necessarily eat more healthily, but they do care more about where food comes from.” (Plant-based, he says, has “plateaued”.)For all the talk of generation Z eschewing alcohol, drinking shows no sign of dying out. There are indicators of restraint – the Manchester dessert menu features a two-sip, 60ml mini-version of an espresso martini, for £7, if you prefer an alternative to stodge – and there is “a pocket, from 26- to 30-year-olds” who drink less, says Carnie. But the bigger trend is toward “clean” cocktails, with fewer ingredients and less sugar. The multicoloured, juice-laden, bafflingly named cocktail is old hat. “I get it, because if I go to a bar, and I don’t understand the menu, it annoys me,” the barman tells me. “A cocktail isn’t cheap. If I’m spending money on a cocktail, I want to know I’m going to like it.”The Soho House signature cocktail is a picante: tequila, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, coriander leaves, garnished with a chilli. In preparation for the opening party, a picante trolley is being prepared: you pick your favourite tequila, and one of 15 chillies, graded for fieriness and flavour. (I asked the very chic French barman: he recommends the bright yellow Peruvian aji limon.) Judging by Friday night’s party, the picante trolley will be a hit. “In France, we don’t put chilli in everything. But in the UK, youlovea chilli,” he says. (Also: tequila. The most popular spirit everywhere, now outselling vodka and gin – a trend imported from the US, and now felt across Britain and Europe.)View image in fullscreen‘We are better as a private company’ … CEO Andrew Carnie.Photograph: Shaw & Shaw/The GuardianFor the past five years, newspaper headlines about Soho House have been about financial woes. A stock exchange listing in 2021 was followed by torrid years in which members complained about overexpansion, while investors bemoaned a lack of profitability. The business priorities of being a public company, and the demands of a clientele who prized exclusivity, proved a mismatch. In 2024 The Guardian called Soho House “a victim of its own success”.Why didn’t going public work? “I wouldn’t exactly say it didn’t work,” says Carnie, with an almost imperceptible bristle. “We went public for all the right reasons, and the experience helped us figure out how to run the business.” But in August this year, the strategy was reversed ina $2.7bn deal with investors, including the actor Ashton Kutcher, taking it private again. “We are better as a private company,” says Carnie. “We can slow down growth a little bit and focus on making our existing members happy.” As founder, Jones is still closely involved on all aspects of design and creative, and Carnie speaks to him all the time, but as CEO, he runs the show, a job which sometimes involves “dragging our girls” – he has three, aged 18, 15 and 10 – to look in on Soho Houses at weekends. “I work a lot.”Christine Cort OBE, who co-founded the Manchester international festival in 2005 and is a member of Soho House Manchester’s founding committee, is at Friday’s party. She can’t wait to see Primal Scream – and to get in the pool, when it opens in a few weeks. “When we set up an arts festival in Manchester 20 years ago, people said, ‘Oh, that won’t work in Manchester. That’s a London thing,’” she says. “But Manchester has changed dramatically.” It is, she points out, nothing if not a dynamic city: the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, and the Suffragette movement. “Already on the committee I’ve met a florist, stylists, club promoters – I’ve made friends I never would have met. And because it’s Manchester, it’s really not about famous people, or people-watching. It’s about collaboration and friendship – and having a really good time.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingHospitality industryManchesterServices sectorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All due to the vision of a group determined to accelerate its recoverySteve RoseTue 25 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 07.06 ESTShareThe manically melodic song of the nightingale is a rare sound in Britain these days, but not at Maple Farm. Four years ago, a single bird could be heard at this secluded spot in rural Surrey; this summer, they were everywhere. “We were hearing them calling all night, from five different territories,” says Meg Cookson, lead ecologist for theYoungwilders, pointing to the woodland around us. A group of Youngwilders were camping out at the site, but the birds were so loud, “we couldn’t sleep all night,” says Layla Mapemba, the group’s engagement lead. “We were all knackered the next day, but it was so cool.” An expert from the Surrey Wildlife Trust came to help them net and ring one of the nightingales the next morning, Cookson recalls: “He’d never held a nightingale in his hands before. He was crying.”Rewilding is by definition a slow business, but here at Maple Farm, after just four years, the results are already visible, and audible. The farm used to be a retirement home for horses. Now it’s a showpiece for the Youngwilders’ mission: to accelerate nature recovery, in one of themost nature-depleted countries in the world, and to connect young people (18-30-year-olds) with a natural world they are often excluded from, and a climate crisis they are often powerless to prevent. Global heating continues, deforestation destroys natural habitats, and another Cop summit draws to a disappointing conclusion in Brazil – so who could blame young people for wanting to take matters into their own hands?Our organisation was premised on the idea that there were people willing to let a bunch of young idiots on to their land“The younger generation is the most informed ecologically that there’s ever been,” says the Youngwilders’ co-director, Jack Durant. They are also “the most emotionally involved in the problems, and have contributed the least to their causing, and, then, are also going to suffer most as a result.”Today, the organisation is taking root across the UK – and Maple Farm planted the seed, in every sense. “It’s where we started, and where we built our network,” says Molly Easton, another co-director, as she gives me a tour of the 12-hectare (30-acre) site. “This used to be six different fields,” she says, as we walk through long grass dotted with low scrub, hemmed by mature woodland. “The main visual difference is that we’ve taken out all the fencing, 1.2km of it, to make it feel like one landscape.” In the summer, they donned hazmat suits and removed masses ofgiant hogweed, an invasive species that can burn the skin. “We’ve planted loads of hedgerows,” says Easton. “But the main thing is we’ve just let it breathe for a little bit. We’ve removed a lot of grazing pressure and seen what’s come up.”Low scrub and hedgerows are a perfect nightingale habitat, she says, although today they’re cutting back some of the brambles to create a greater variety of habitats and to link up two parts of the site. New trees will take considerably longer to establish, but saplings from the surrounding oaks are already taking root in the fields; the team have been installing guards to protect them from grazing deer.View image in fullscreenNoah Bennett …. ‘There were days when we were, like, pretending to be wild boar.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianIt’s not just the nightingales – wildlife is returning in droves. This year they’ve seen grass snakes, slowworms, bats and insects, says Noah Bennett, another of the co-directors, as he lifts up one of their reptile mats (like a doormat over a small hollow in the ground). “You get snakes and things hiding under there, but it’s probably a bit cold for them now.” Natural beehives, made from hollowed-out sections of tree trunk and buzzing with wild bees, are strapped to some of the trees. The absence of grazing horses has given invertebrates space to thrive in the long grass. When they visited this summer, says Bennett, “I’d never seen so many butterflies. There were just clouds of them. We were like, ‘What is happening?’”The original Youngwilders – Bennett, Durant, Easton and two others, Oscar Hartman Davies and Anya Doherty – came together as students, studying or sharing an interest in ecology. In 2019, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was predicting that the safe limit of 1.5C of global heating was looking unachievable, Greta Thunberg was leading the school strikes for climate movement, and activist Clover Hogan was talking about young people experiencing “climate anxiety”. It was also the time ofIsabella Tree’s book, Wilding, on how she and her husband transformed the Knepp Estate in nearby Sussex from a struggling dairy farm into a thriving natural habitat. “We were super-inspired by the Knepp story, but what was the role for young people?” says Easton. “So we made a website and rang up loads of wildlife trusts and were like, ‘Do you ever get your landowners wanting to do something and you don’t have capacity?’”Durant continues the story: “Our whole organisation was basically premised on the idea that there were people who were willing to let a bunch of young idiots on to their land indiscriminately, to make fairly massive decisions that would affect land value. We didn’t have any evidence that those people existed at the start. We just kind of assumed, or prayed, that they did.”How a radical experiment to bring a forest into a preschool transformed children’s healthRead moreAfter six months of “yammering into the void”, their prayers were answered by Maple Farm’s owner, Colleen Long. She had also read Tree’s book, and had begun to see her land in a different way. She met the Youngwilders and warmed to them. “It was passion that was coming from the heart but backed with some knowledge as well,” she says. “I thought: what’s the worst that can happen?” They obtained a grant from the Titcomb Foundation,and they were on their way. Long says she has occasionally felt like their mum, but “as much as they’ve tested me at times, they have brought so much to the table and they are so enthusiastic and they’ve got loads of young people involved”. Everything they do is planned, mutually agreed and budgeted, she says: “They don’t just run riot.”The Youngwilders readily admit that they didn’t knowexactlywhat they were doing when they first started at Maple Farm. “The thing is, with ecological restoration, it is obviously a science, but there’s also a major art component to it,” says Durant, “because they’re such complex systems, and every site responds to things so differently. You just need to make decisions and keep an open mind, listen to the landscape.” The phrase “learn by doing” comes up a lot.Rewilding is a serious business but that doesn’t mean it can’t be fun. “There were days when we were, like, pretending to be wild boar,” says Bennett. In the wild, this landscape would be inhabited by megafauna, he says. Large mammals such as boar would rootle in the grass, exposing bare ground that helps with germination of seeds. In the absence of boar, the Youngwilders took on the role themselves. How do you mimic a wild boar? “Step one was to buy pig noses off the internet,” says Durant, laughing. “You’ve got to get in the zone emotionally.”View image in fullscreenYoungwilders at work in Northumberland.Photograph: Jack Durant/YoungwildersEcological restoration is a relatively new discipline, but it is dominated by big ecological consultancies, well-funded trusts and older experts, who often act as gatekeepers (and would never dream of putting on a pig nose). “There’s this real sense of impostor syndrome – that you need years and years of experience to have anything to say,” says Easton of their eco-elders. “There are some amazing people who are willing to share their expertise, but there’s also quite a lot who are willing to shout you down if they think you’re not doing the right thing.” Now, everything they do on site is run by young people – 30 and under.There are other barriers to entry in this sector, says Durant. “One thing we talk about a lot is the amount of volunteer work that’s expected from you before you can get an entry-level job. We know people who have had volunteer positions that have been three full days a week, and they’ve done them for a year and they haven’t been paid a penny. That has a major privilege aspect to it: the people who are able to work for a year, at the age of 21, for free, are people who have parents who can facilitate that. There’s masses of talent that’s not being accessed.”This is the second part of the Youngwilders’ mission: to encourage and enable young people to participate, hands-on. “Action, access and agency,” says Durant. “There are all these young people who want to do these things for nature, and the system’s set up presently so that beautiful moment is prevented most of the time.”It’s fully changed my life in so many ways. I’ve met people here who have just made me feel part of somethingThe Youngwilders have volunteer days where they “try to impart some knowledge,” says Cookson. “We’ll have a workshop in the middle of a grass-cutting day and we’ll say, ‘Here’s how to ID five grasses.’ So people come away not only feeling like they’ve achieved something, but they’ve learned something, and they’ve made friends.” Cookson, who was previously an ecological consultant in a large company, joined the Youngwilders after coming to a volunteer weekend at Maple Farm in May 2023 – to help build the outdoor classroom where we are sitting now (it is made out of recycled horse boxes). “It was an amazing weekend. I said: ‘Do you guys want an ecologist?’”They now do a range of events and initiatives. There are “Wayfinder” monitoring events, where young visitors can help survey the flora and fauna on site, collecting data and learning field skills (no prior experience necessary). They have artists in residence, and they hold a biannual youth rewilding summit – more like a mini festival – called Overgrowth, in Northumberland and at the Knepp estate. When I visited Overgrowth south this September, there were about 100 young people, from diverse backgrounds and parts of the country, including urban areas (half of the tickets were subsidised). The vibe was fun but wholesome – outdoor wear rather than festival garb. Guest speakers included Hogan and other activists, but there were also activities and workshops from moth-trapping and bird feather identifying to “solarpunk visioning for economic justice” and “queer marine ecology”.On seven of their sites around the country they have “wild stewards” – local young people who are paid to work there for one day each month for a year. Now in its second year, the programme has been transformative. Jack Rees, for example, had quit his job in marketing and was doing care work when he went along to a Youngwilders event in northern England last year. He loved it, he says: “It was just being in nature with your mates, learning, but actually getting your hands dirty.” Later, he became a wild steward, working with a landowner in Monmouthshire, surveying, planting, building, researching and learning. He started going to other nature-focused conferences and events, and now has a full-time job doing communications for a nature advocacy group.“It’s fully changed my life in so many ways,” Rees says. “I’ve met people here who have just made me feel part of something.”There’s also Megan Sice, whom the Youngwilders now call Moth Megan. She came here on a whim, too, having seen their Wayfinder camping session on social media in spring 2024. After her first taste of moth trapping, she was hooked. She came back for more events, and began to learn about butterflies, moths and other insects. She is now a full-time ecologist, working with local councils and conservation trusts, and returned to teach at Youngwilders this year. “I really wanted to be able to give some knowledge back and possibly spark that same moment in others,” she said. She lives in a van she calls the Moth Mobile, and has a detailed tattoo on her arm of the first moth she caught.View image in fullscreenMolly Easton … ‘This is about abundance: nature in its entirety.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThere is always more to do at Maple Farm. The next task is to dig three ponds at the top of the site, says Bennett. These will encourage even more biodiversity and retain more water in the landscape – important for modulating droughts and flooding. They’re hoping storks may start nesting here soon, as they have at Knepp – the first wild storks in Britain since the 15th century.The Youngwilders have 12 projects across the UK, ranging from a tennis court-sized plot in Islington, London to a 20-hectare (50-acre) portion of the Castle Howard estate in North Yorkshire. But they consider Maple Farm their spiritual home. “This was a huge moment for us,” says Durant. “Since then, there’s been steady interest. Maybe every three weeks, we get a message to our website from a similar-ish situation to this: someone wanting us to help. And, then also, crucially, they’ll really buy into our youth-led, youth-engagement vision.”Easton stresses that it’s a positive vision: “When I worked in climate policy, it was constantly about taking things away – we need to change our habits, not do this, or not do that. This is more about abundance: nature in its entirety. So, not only are you coming to plant a tree, it’s also giving back toyou, and it’s giving back the landscape, and it’s part of a community activity.”“The core problem underneath all of this is a kind of cultural, societal, fundamental disconnection with nature,” says Durant. “I like framing it emotionally; you could do it in more scientific ways, but, basically, if you had this relationship with nature – and lots of cultures do presently, and lots of cultures that don’t now used to – then the kinds of behaviours that lead to the damage we’ve caused don’t even come up. As a default, you care about your local environment.”From a planetary perspective, restoring small parcels of land might feel insignificant, but this is the way a global nature restoration movement starts: one field, one sapling, one nightingale at a time.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We all wanted to sit next to her at dinnerDavid PriorMon 24 Nov 2025 20.07 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 07.22 ESTShareSpring is a season of transition, when bare earth transforms into something alive with promise. It was also the name chef Skye Gyngell, who hasdied at age 62, chose for her London restaurant. She said it was her favourite season, but the truth is she embraced all four and lived them wholly.Gyngell was singular: she had the palate of a chef and the palette of an artist. Those twin gifts met in food that was painterly in its composition, delicate in its details and tuned to nature’s shifting notes.It was that interplay that made her so beguiling, placing her at the heart of a movement she never sought to lead, yet in her own quiet, uncompromising way undeniably did. It is why she stands as one of the most significant chefs of her generation.I knew Gyngell long before she knew me. Though I never told her, the first meal I ever had in London was at her restaurant Petersham Nurseries, which opened in 2004. I pretended I was looking for the bathroom just so I could walk up to the little garden shed where she cooked. She was a beautiful, striking figure who seemed to tower above me. I mustered the courage to tell her how much I loved her monkfish curry: a bright and brilliant dish that seemed to float above continents. It tasted Australian in its top notes yet was grounded in ingredients gathered locally.She used the eclectic toolbox she had collected along her path from Sydney to Paris to London to create something unmistakable, what I came to think of simply as “Skye food”.Several years later we met properly, while I was working for one of her greatest inspirations, Alice Waters, the California pioneer of the farm-to-table movement and a radical force for women in kitchens.The parallels between Gyngell and Waters were unmistakable, as they were with legendary food figures such as Maggie Beer and Ballymaloe’s Darina Allen. All were feminists, bold in their conviction that food rooted in nature could be transformative.Gyngell took that inheritance and made it entirely her own. For this she won the respect of peers as diverse as René Redzepi and Nigella Lawson.I was a generation below her, and like many of my contemporaries – not only in food but across the broader creative world – thought she was impossibly cool. We all wanted to sit next to her at dinner, to tap her taste in fashion, literature and art, or simply watch how she saw the world.She was often searingly honest and unintentionally hilarious. A sentence beginning, “Darling, if I am really honest …” always heralded an observation about the food world that cut through its nonsense. She had no airs, yet her intelligence was acute, and she cared instinctively for people, especially those who had not yet found their place.View image in fullscreenShe made dishes that looked simple until you realised how stealthily sophisticated they werePhotograph: Kristin PerersGyngell’s professional life was a series of reinventions that strengthened, rather than diluted, her voice. In her first head chef position at Petersham Nurseries, she began cooking from a garden shed. From there, she upended the way Michelin thought about restaurants. With dirt floors underfoot, she produced food bracing in its beauty, dishes that looked simple until you realised how stealthily sophisticated they were. She was awarded a Michelin star in 2011, and left the restaurant the next year.Much has been made of her rejecting the Michelin star. With hindsight that decision seems prescient, just as her early commitment to food directly connected to its source anticipated where the culture would go.In 2012, she became culinary director of Heckfield Place, a period less often cited but defining. Working with her longtime collaborator, farmer Jane Scotter, she helped build an extraordinary hotel farm: rare fruit and vegetable varieties, a working dairy, orchards and flowers grown with intention. While other hotels boasted herb patches, Heckfield’s produce travelled metres and came almost entirely from the property. Some of her best cooking happened there. Again she rewrote the book of dining in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She pioneered a joyful, prix-fixe Scratch menu, cooked from ingredients that would otherwise go to waste. It was not earnest or worthy, but generous and quietly radical, offering an affordable way to dine beautifully inside one of London’s grandest buildings.Goblets of borscht, turkey-shaped madeleines: why Martha Stewart’s fantastical menus are still an inspirationRead moreHer perspective shaped the tastes and thinking of a generation of cooks. She never sought acclaim or authorship. She was respected, yes, but she was adored – deeply – by those who followed her.Her deepest pride were her daughters, Holly and Evie, who embody the best of her. Both possess their mother’s beauty, curiosity and quiet strength. Her grandchild Cyprien brought her new joy.Several hours after I heard of Gyngell’s passing, I found myself at one of New York’s most admired restaurants, a rarity for its seasonality and for being run by three extraordinary young women. On the menu was a layered radicchio salad, a study in bitterness and colour arranged with precision. They call it a “Skye salad”. They had never worked with her. They were simply cooking in the language she helped write.Skye Gyngell was a great original. She created a vocabulary of beauty, purity and integrity in her food that travelled far beyond Britain. Her legacy endures in every dish that feels perfectly of its moment: seasonal, honest, surprising, painterly. She couldn’t help but be Australian – her instinct, her sense of colour and her agenda-setting food – but what she created belongs to the world.David Prior is the founder of the New York-based travel company Prior and the former contributing international editor of Condé Nast TravelerExplore more on these topicsRestaurantsFoodAustralian food and drinkBritish food and drinkChefsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It loves to be twisted and turned, bathed in butter or oil, baked or fried until glowing with the promise of crispy flakes on your chin, lap and heart as you crunch into its golden, glassy fuzz.Since they’re often interchangeable doughs, it’s easy to assume that kataifi pastry is simply shredded filo. But rather than being rolled and stretched into paper-thin sheets like filo (or phyllo, depending who you ask) kataifi begins as a light, pourable batter which is streamed through fine nozzles on to a rotating heated plate, where it cooks almost instantly into a cascade of fine vermicelli-like strands, delicate yet strong, like spun silk.View image in fullscreenA bundle of joy: to make the pie, gently fluff and separate the kataifi so the strands separate.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianView image in fullscreenThe pie in progress.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianWith origins in the Ottoman empire that spread across the Balkans and Middle East, you’ll find it bunched and crisped into nests for syrup-soaked sweets like baklava, ekmek, and künefe, knafeh or kunafa; wrapped around seafood like scallops and prawns; or layered into savoury pies that blur the curly lines between crunch and comfort.But where you couldn’t find it earlier this year was in a single fridge section across Australian retailers. According to Effi Tsoukatos, marketing manager and recipe developer for Antoniou pastry, one of the largest manufacturers of kataifi in the country, the popularity ofDubai chocolate, where fried kataifi is a main ingredient, led to a rush.Alice Zaslavsky’s strawberry and stracciatella salad with orange dressing – recipeRead more“We couldn’t make it fast enough,” she told me. “For those desperate enough, people were selling it for almost quadruple the price.

If using it for wrapping individual portions, keep it under a damp towel so it doesn’t dry out.

Split the pastry in half. Set aside one half in the mixing bowl under a clean, damp tea towel. Use the other half to line the springform pan, laying it across the bottom and sides, ensuring you have an overhang to form the lid later. Using your fingers, gently press down on the pastry and push it into the edges of the tin to form an even base. Brush the base and sides of the pastry with three-quarters of the melted butter. Carefully place the tin on a baking tray.For the savoury custard, in a large bowl combine the tomatoes, garlic, onion and oregano. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, yoghurt, most of the feta (reserve a small handful of feta for the finish), nutmeg, salt and pepper until just combined, but still lumpy. Add to the tomato mixture. Using scissors, gently snip half the remaining pastry into small pieces, directly into the custard (after this, you should have one-quarter of the pastry remaining). Gently fold everything together until just combined, but don’t overmix.DIY Dubai chocolate: Ravneet Gill’s recipe for crunchy pistachio chocolateRead morePour the savoury custard into the pastry-lined tin. Fold the overhanging pastry over the filling to cover it. Gently brush with some of the remaining melted butter. Fluff the remaining quantity of pastry and spread evenly over the top of the pie – like trying to cover a bald spot with a strategically angled bouffant. Brush with the last of the melted butter.Carefully slide the baking tray with the tin on to the top shelf of the oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes. You want the pastry to become golden brown and the custard to be well set.While the pie bakes, make the warm oregano honey drizzle. Using a vegetable peeler or very sharp knife, peel the rind of the lemon into a twist, or as large a piece (or pieces) as possible. Slice the lemon in half. Juice one half and slice the remaining half into wedges for serving.In a small saucepan on a low heat, add the lemon peel and juice, honey, pistachios and oregano, and warm through – no need to boil. Remove from the heat and allow the flavours to get friendly.Remove the pie from the oven and allow to cool slightly, preferably on a cooling rack (this helps with air flow and keeps the base from schvitzing). Release the sides of the springform pan, then drizzle with the warm honey and sprinkle with a pinch of salt flakes. In a small bowl, crumble the last bits of feta through the rocket for a side.

Our panel of experts unpicks them one by oneAnna BerrillTue 25 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareI always order chocolate mousse in restaurants, but it never turns out quite right when I make it at home. Help!Daniel, by email“Chocolate mousse defies physics,” says Nicola Lamb, author ofSiftand theKitchen Projects newsletter. “It’s got all the flavour of your favourite chocolate, but with an aerated, dissolving texture, which is sort of extraordinary.” The first thing you’ve got to ask yourself, then, is what kind of mousse are you after: “Some people’s dream is rich and dense, while for others it’s light and airy,” Lamb says, which is probably why there are so many ways you can make it.That said, in most cases you’re usually dealing with some form of melted chocolate folded into whipped eggs (whites, yolks or both), followed by lightly whipped cream. And, with so few ingredients, you need to make them count, Lamb says: “What you’re doing by making chocolate mousse is extending the flavour of the chocolate, so first off always go with a bar you really like.” And, for her, that means 70% dark chocolate.One potential stumbling block, however, comes when folding the melted chocolate into the colder ingredients (eggs, say): “The chocolate can seize and you end up overfolding or knocking out all the air.” Her solution? Whisk a little water, alcohol or coffee (“a couple of tablespoons for 100g chocolate”) into the melted chocolate, and “it’ll be easier to work with”.Use older eggs, too, adds Matthew Ryle, author ofFrench Classics: “As an egg gets older, the white gets looser, which is not what you want when it comes to poaching, but for meringues and mousses it’s perfect, because those looser whites have more elasticity, so they stretch and incorporate air without breaking.” Room-temperature eggs will also help with this.As with any difficult relationship, it pays to take things slow, too. “The longer and slower you whip the meringue, the smaller the bubbles will be,” Ryle says, “resulting in a stronger, fine meringue and mousse.” To ensure a light mousse, Lamb always adds an extra egg white, while Ollie Templeton pours in hot honey. The co-founder ofCarousel, where chocolate mousse has been on the menu since the day it opened, says: “Bring some honey to a boil, pour that into the eggs and whisk until they’ve cooled; that creates a light and airy texture.” He then folds in the obligatory whipped cream, seasons with salt and pops in the fridge for four to five hours to set.If you’ve made a dense, truffle-like mousse (ie, without cream), however, Lamb would take it out of the fridge 20 minutes before serving: “It’s less of a problem with a cream-based mousse,” she says, “although that would still benefit from 10 minutes out of the fridge before digging in.”Templeton would top his mousse with a drizzle of olive oil, some salt and a few crushed hazelnuts: “You want some crunch [a veil of peanuts or breadcrumbs would also do the job].” Lamb, however, is not one for gilding the lily, and just adds a pinch of salt: “Chocolate mousse is one of those things that’s best left alone,” she says. Unless whipped cream has been omitted from the recipe: “In that case, a coupe of chocolate mousse with a spoon of barely whipped cream would be really chic. Chicanddelicious.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Food assistant: Emma Cantlay.FoodNoodle night: Emiko Davies’ recipe for vegetable udon curryA comforting bowl of soupy curry noodles that’s ready in well under an hourEmiko DaviesTue 25 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareAs in many Japanese families, we had curry regularly when I was growing up. It was the standard Japanese curry of potatoes, onion, carrot and pork, usually thickened withS&B Golden Curry blocks. It made a weekly appearance in our house, and now I regularly make it for my own family, too. However, my kids are a little fussy: one likes it with tonkatsu on top and the other doesn’t want any meat at all. So I now make curry with no meat in it, and more vegetables, which means that I have to make only one version (and whoever wants to add tonkatsu can do so!).Vegetable udon curry (yasai kare udon)Udon curry is a great dish if you have (as I often do) impatient people who cannot wait the extra 20 or so minutes it takes to make rice (and, if you have fresh or frozen noodles, it’s even faster). You could also serve this with rice, but if you do, use only half the quantity of dashi, because this curry is made slightly soupier to go with the noodles. If you don’t have a Japanese grater (oroshigane) for ginger, use a microplane.Prep15 minInfuseOvernight (optional)Cook35 minServes4For the dashi2 x 12cm pieces kombu1 litrecold waterFor the curry2tbsp butter4cmknob fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated1 onion, peeled and sliced½aubergine, dicedA pinch of salt1 carrot, peeled and chopped into chunky slices200gpotato(floury will be softer, waxy will be firmer), peeled and chopped1tbsp Japanese curry powder2tsp garam masala2tbsp mirin, or sake1 litredashi(see above and method)1tbsp soy sauce½ green bell pepper, seeds and pith discarded, flesh thinly sliced2tsp potato starch, or cornflour2tbsp miso4 servings udon noodlesFirst, make the dashi, which you can do in one of two ways. For the lengthier, cold infusion method, put the kombu and cold water in a container or jar, cover and leave in the fridge overnight to infuse. The next morning, lift out and discard the kombu, and the dashi is now ready to use. If you don’t have time to make the cold infusion, simply put the kombu and water in a saucepan over a low heat, so it warms up and draws out the flavour as slowly as possible. Just before the liquid starts to boil, take off the heat, remove the kombu and your dashi is ready.Now for the curry. Melt the butter in a heavy-based saucepan ordonabeon a medium heat, then stir in the ginger, onion, aubergine and salt. Stir to coat everything in the buttery ginger for about two minutes, being careful the onion doesn’t burn, then add the carrot and potato. Tip in the curry powder and garam masala, and stir to coat the vegetables.Pour in the mirin, followed quickly by the dashi and soy, then bring to a simmer and leave the vegetables to cook for about 10 minutes, until tender. Add the green pepper and cook for a couple of minutes more.Meanwhile, make a slurry by mixing the potato starch with a splash of water until dissolved, then stir this into the curry along with the miso, and leave to bubble and thicken for a minute.Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain and rinse under cold water – this will give them a bit of spring. Distribute the noodles between four bowls and pour the vegetable curry over the top.This recipe is an edited extract from The Japanese Pantry, by Emiko Davies, published by Smith Street Books at £30.Explore more on these topicsFoodNoodlesJapanese food and drinkCurryVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkPotatoesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Less well known is that its restaurant scene has a wealth of talented female chefs, a rarity in SpainFiona DunlopTue 25 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTShareI’m on a quest in buzzy, beachy Alicante on the Costa Blanca to investigate the rice dishes the Valencian province is famed for, as well as explore the vast palm grove of nearby Elche. I start with a pilgrimage to a restaurant featured in my book on tapas, New Tapas, a mere 25 years ago.Mesón de Labradoresin the pedestrianised old town is now engulfed by Italian eateries (so more pizza and pasta than paella) but it remains a comforting outpost of tradition and honest food.Map of Alicante areaHere I catch up with Timothy Denny, a British chef who relocated to Spain, gained analicantinagirlfriend and became a master of dishes from the region. Over afideuá demariscos(seafood noodles, €20), we chew over local gastronomy. “For me, Alicante epitomises the Mediterranean – for rice, seafood and artichokes,” he says. “But there are curiosities, too, likepavo borracho.” Tim explains that so-called “drunken turkeys” are cooked in vast amounts of cognac plus a shot of red wine and eventually emerge as a hefty stew, perfect in winter.This passion for experimentation has been endorsed by the Catalan master chef, Ferran Adrià, who once stated “[the Costa Blanca] … has a magical elf that takes hold of the products and sneaks into the kitchens to offer diners unique dishes with unique flavours”.View image in fullscreenFideuá de mariscos.Photograph: Jordi Ruiz/Getty ImagesTim emphasises the preponderance of female chefs in the area, quite a rarity in Spain’s male-dominated world of gastronomy. “Because in this historically poor region, the choice was often between cooking and cleaning,” he says. As proof we greet the exuberant owner of Labradores, Raquel Sabater, among the vintage plates, tiles and furniture that have barely changed after all these years.But I soon discover another reason when I meet the much-garlanded María José San Román atMonastrell, her high-end restaurant beside the marina. Here, as we embark on a refined six-course tasting menu (€79), she tells me about the associationMujeres en Gastronomía(MEG) that she founded in 2018 to unite Alicante’s many talented female chefs. Nicknamed the Queen of Alicante gastronomy, this tornado of energy now heads four restaurants, including the heavingTaberna del Gourmet, with another in the pipeline.A magical elf takes hold of the products and sneaks into the kitchens to offer diners unique dishes with unique flavoursFerran AdriàNext day, I lunch at another member of MEG,La Sastrería, whose owner, María Luisa Rivera, changed tack 20 years ago from landscape gardener to chef. Her restaurant, a smallmodernistabeauty, overlooks a lush square of towering centennial ficus trees, their tangled trunks echoed inside by a curvaceous staircase. Here I opt for anarroz del senyoret(€19)named for the little lord (or in my case lady) who doesn’t like handling shellfish, so it all comes peeled. Theséniarice from Valencia’s Albufera (a freshwater lagoon) is perfect, each tiny grain separate despite 20 minutes or so cooking in María Luisa’s complex broth.Now the island of Tabarca, south of Alicante, beckons. An elongated sandstone slab washed by transparent waters teeming with fish, it is a marine reserve and its coves are a snorkeller’s heaven. After a 25-minute ferry crossing from Santa Pola, I disembark with my guide, Felipe, who fills me in on Tabarca’s rich history.View image in fullscreenSeafood at MonastrellDespite being the smallest inhabited island in Spain, it has seen Greeks, Romans, Berber pirates, smugglers and shipwrecked Genoese sailors who settled there when a military garrison was created in 1760. Quite a history for an islet. Although the garrison later decamped, stone gateways remain leading to quaint streets, a striking church and leafy squares. It’s a dreamy place if you get there before the lunchtime crowds.I am in search of a unique fisherman’s stew combined with rice. Thiscalderois, like paella, named after its cooking dish – in this case a cast iron hotpot. AtLa Almadraba, the owner, a woman called Nines, explains the technique: two courses (€30) start with a succulent dish of potatoes and fish simmered in a broth of alioli, garlic, saffron and parsley so good that I spoon out the remains; it is followed by the rice cooked in the same concoction. The upshot is a fabulous feed overlooking bobbing boats in the harbour and a glittering Med beyond.Another day, another quest, this time in Elche, inland from Santa Pola and 15 miles from Alicante. The city is famed not only for the exquisite Dama de Elche (a fourth-century BC sculpture of a bejewelled Iberian woman) but also for its vast palm grove. About 200,000 date palms in the largestpalmeralin Europe and the northernmost in the world have earned the city Unesco world heritage status. Most of the palms are divided into a grid of rectangularhuertos(orchards) fed by irrigation channels that also nourish fruit trees such as pomegranate, citrus and olives.Miguel Ángel Sánchez, owner of Elche’s largest date company, TodoPalmera, leads me around the Museo del Palmeral, where an enlightening display covers every aspect of the palm tree, whether the plant structure, the use of palm wood and fibre and, extraordinarily, intricate “sculptures” made with white palms for Elche’s Easter processions. For Miguel Ángel, “the palm has so much value: cultural, religious, environmental, nutritional, agricultural, ornamental, functional and spiritual”.View image in fullscreenCooking over a grapevine wood fire at El CachitoHe says that Elche’s date production of about 80 tonnes restricts availability in Spain, so it remains a gourmet product. Five varieties include the widely known Medjoul as well as the local Confitera, which I sample at Miguel Ángel’s farm – freshly harvested, yellow, velvety and utterly delicious. Despite my addiction to Palestinian Medjoul dates, this is an epiphany. When I later spot them at Alicante’s cornucopian Mercado Central, into my bag they go.My lastarrozlunchlooms. Instead of indulging at highly ratedMesón el Granaíno, we head south of town to 90-year-oldEl Cachito, an unpretentious family restaurant. Here I watch another woman, Noelia, orchestrate the flames of grapevine branches in a cavernous, blackened fireplace. The result? A perfect paella of rabbit and wild snails (€18), its glistening grains as flawless as the artichokes grown in her vegetable garden, and as luscious as Elche’s dates.The tripwas provided byspain.info,costablanca.organdvisitelche.com.

We did use the tram to and from the city centre after walking in the adjacent park.It was the enforcement officer who pointed out a notice on the back of the entrance sign which stated, in small print, that drivers have to buy a ticket on arrival. We appealed citing inadequate signs but the appeal was rejected.RB, NottinghamParking permit mix-up cost £110 and then £150 in finesRead moreI’ve studied photos of the different signs and it seems that the requirement to buy a tram ticket on arrival is mentioned in minute print some way down small green posters dotted around the huge site. Large red signs visible to all merely say car park users must use the tram – which you did.The Q&A leaflet about the site also makes no mention of this crucial caveat. In any case, £140 seems an excessive penalty given that drivers who contravene parking restrictions elsewhere in the city are fined £50, which is halved if paid promptly.Clamping was outlawed on private land nationally in 2012 but Nottingham’s park and ride sites are owned by the local authority which has awarded Nottingham Tramlink a private finance initiative contract to run them along with the tram service. Local authorities can still use clamps.According to statutory guidance from the Department for Transport (DfT), they should only be used in limited circumstances for persistent offenders, or a failure to pay a previous penalty charge.The guidance also says they should be proportionate and reasonable. However, councils are allowed to draw up bylaws for specific sites, setting their own parking rules and penalties. Once these bylaws have been approved by the DfT, they and their contractors can enforce them without regard to the guidance.Nottingham city council confirmed that its approved bylaws permit vehicles to be immobilised so Nottingham Tramlink can clamp away.That still leaves the question of the signs, which must be clear and unambiguous for enforcement measures to be valid.Tramlink’s CEO Tim Hesketh insists that the instructions are “clearly visible”. The £140 release fee is, he says, set and retained by the private enforcement company it contracts.He adds: “The option of amending the bylaws to allow the introduction of a parking, or penalty charge notice, has already been explored extensively by Tramlink before deciding on our current process which we believe to be the most fit for purpose.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

It advises mothers not to use doctors or midwives and suggests they avoid pregnancy scans.The multimillion-dollar business, run by former doulas Emilee Saldaya and Yolande Norris Clark, has a successful podcast, Instagram following, festival and online schools for birth attendants.View image in fullscreenScreengrab from the FBS website promoting its services.Photograph: Free Birth Society websiteThe prevalence of freebirthing is low in the UK, but is believed to be on the rise, fuelled in part by distrust of maternity services and fears of an overly medicalised approach to birth.However, experts have warned that manyFBS claims are at odds with evidence-based medical advice. Saldaya and Norris-Clark have described medical attempts at newborn resuscitation as a form of “sabotage”, and claimed that doctors and midwives often sexually assault women in hospitals.On Saturday, aninvestigation by the Guardianidentified 48 cases of late-term stillbirths or neonatal deaths or other forms of serious harm involving mothers or birth attendants who appear to have been linked to FBS. In 18 of those cases, there is evidence FBS played a significant role in the mother or birth attendant’s decision-making, leading to potentially avoidable tragedies.Now the Guardian can reveal how the NHS has been directing women towards FBS content recommended by the Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services (Aims), a charity that campaigns on UK maternity care.Until this summer, the NHS web page entitled “Where to give birth: the options” directed women considering unassisted birth to a factsheet from Aims. When women clicked on the link, the factsheet recommended the FBS podcast.“The Freebirth Society is a US-based network for women who want to freebirth,”the factsheetstates. “They advocate a non-medical approach to childbirth which some people may find extreme and unpalatable. However, within their podcasts there are empowering stories of unassisted births which many UK freebirthing women have found helpful when preparing for their own.”While the link to the Aims factsheet was quietly removed from the NHS web page in August, online patient information leaflets distributed by several NHS trusts, includingCambridge,Gloucestershire hospitalsandEast and North Hertfordshire, continue to direct women to the Aims factsheet recommending FBS.After it was contacted for comment by the Guardian on Monday, Aims removed the FBS podcast references from its online factsheet. A spokesperson said: “We were not aware of the serious concerns now associated with FBS, and we have now removed the reference and link from our website.”They said Aims “never recommended or referred” women to FBS, saying the podcast was listed on its factsheet “as an example of material some freebirthing women were using, not as advice or endorsement”.A spokesperson for the NHS said: “The NHS does not endorse this society [FBS], or its ideology which could harm women.”Kenga Sivarajah, a lead obstetrician at King’s College hospital, in London, one of several expertswho reviewed FBS materials for the Guardian, said that some of the information it provides women is “dangerous and harmful … so for the NHS to direct people towards that is very shocking”.Amid growing concerns about the standard of care in UK maternity services, a small but growing number of British women are believed to be disengaging from professional services to choose alternatives such as free birth.View image in fullscreenOne study found a ‘mistrust of institutional midwifery’ was influencing women to choose a free birth.Photograph: AlamyA2024 studyby Robert Gordon University, in Aberdeen, found that “a quest for a safer birth” was a key factor influencing women’s decisions to freebirth, as was their “mistrust of institutional midwifery”.In September 2025, the Nursing and Midwifery Council published a survey of women choosing free birth. It found that 142 free births were recorded between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024 by 47 NHS trusts. This is likely to be a significant underestimate because not all trusts collect data on free births, and many women do not report their intention to freebirth to healthcare professionals.While the sample was too small to draw wider conclusions, 65% of the women surveyed said their births went smoothly, without any need for medical intervention. Just 3% of the women surveyed reported trauma or mental health concerns after their freebirths.The NMC data also found there was one stillbirth and two neonatal deaths out of the 142 reported free births, although no information was provided about the circumstances of those deaths.Some women choosing free birth will have previously experienced substandard care in NHS hospitals. According to the Care Quality Commission, which regulates NHS trusts, safety levels in almost two thirds of English hospitals’ maternity services are eitherinadequate (18%) or require improvement (47%). In 2024, the birth trauma inquiry, led by the then Conservative MP Theo Clarke,received submissionsfrom more than 1,300 women who had experienced traumatic births in the NHS. “Although freebirthing is a first choice for a few, for most it seems to be a ‘least worst’ option,” said Prof Soo Downe, a senior British midwife at the University of Lancashire.Researchers also point to the mass closure of home birth services in the UK during the pandemic as a factor pushing women towards free births. “Post-Covid, services haven’t recovered,” said Dr Claire Feeley, a senior lecturer in midwifery at King’s College London, explaining that women were sometimes choosing free birth as a “back-up plan” because they did not wish to give birth in hospital. “What my colleagues tell me is that in areas which are doing really well with their home birth teams, there’s hardly any freebirthing,” she added.In its statement, the NHS said that while it was a legal right for women to choose an unassisted birth in England, “we strongly recommend accessing trained healthcare professionals to ensure the safety and wellbeing of both mother and baby – and if do you go down this route, you can change your mind at any time during pregnancy – including during labour”.FBS did not respond to requests for comment about the Guardian’s investigation. Following publication of the article on Saturday, Saldayaposted a statement on Instagramcriticising “propaganda on mainstream news”. “This is what it means to be a disruptor,” she said. “They will try to discredit you. They will lie about you. They will attempt to silence what they don’t understand.”An FBS disclaimer published in May said its content was for “educational and informational” purposes and not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any medical condition related to pregnancy or birth. “For medical advice, consult your healthcare provider,” it added.The Birth Keepers, a multi-part Guardian podcast series investigating the Free Birth Society, is released in December.

A hydrophone in this shipping corridor off Baffin Island, Nunavut, captures their calls as the tusked whales navigate their autumn migration route to northern Baffin Bay.But as the Nordic Odyssey, a 225-metre ice-class bulk carrier servicing the nearby iron ore mine, approaches, its low engine rumble gives way to a wall of sound created by millions of collapsing bubbles from its propeller. The narwhals’ acoustic signals, evolved for one of Earth’s quietest environments, fall silent.I have yet to find any marine species that is completely immune to noise or vibration of any kindLindy Weilgart“Narwhals stop calling or move away from approaching vessels when they hear them,” says Alexander James Ootoowak, an Inuk hunter from Pond Inlet and field technician with the research team that deployed the hydrophone to study these acoustic overlaps.Theresearch, carried out in 2023 and published this year, adds to mounting evidence that underwater radiated noise – sound energy that ships emit through their hulls, propellers and machinery – is disrupting marine life. As the crescendo grows, so too do calls to quiet the seas by designing less-noisy ships.Michelle Sanders, director general of the Innovation Center at TransportCanadain Ottawa, says: “We need to bring everybody together to work toward a solution that will reduce the sound in our ocean to protect marine species, regardless of where the ships are operating.”View image in fullscreenNoise from the engine and propellers of the Nordic Odyssey caused narwhals to stop calling to each other in Eclipse Sound.Photograph: Alex OotoowakThis November, members will gather at theInternational Maritime Organization Assemblywhere aHigh Ambition Coalition for a Quiet Ocean– of 37 countries representingmore than 50%of the global shipping fleet – will call for new policies to focus on the design and operation of quieter ships.Action cannot come soon enough, says Halifax-based marine biologist Lindy Weilgart.“I have yet to find any marine species that is completely immune to noise or vibration of any kind,” she says. “Once you know, you do something, now.”View image in fullscreenLocal Inuit people were the first to notice that narwhals are particularly sensitive to ship noise.Photograph: Minden Pictures/AlamySound helps underwater organisms find food, communicate, navigate, avoid predators and mate.

While seismic surveys for oil and gas exploration require powerful sound pulses to map seafloor geology, and offshore windfarm development uses pile-driving to install turbine foundations, “ships don’t gain anything from making noise”, says Weilgart.0:42Spectogram shows the silencing of narwhals while a ship passes – videoThe maritime industry has long recognised thatunderwater radiated noise is wasted energy, says Giorgio Burella, a naval architect at Robert Allan, a Vancouver-based company that designs boats.To reduce noise, vessels can reroute around sensitive marine areas or slow down. But through design, the industry can target the primary sources of ship noise, with advanced propeller designs that reduce cavitation bubbles, hull modifications that create smoother water flow and engine isolation systems that prevent machinery vibrations transmitting through the vessel into surrounding waters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features, opinion and photography, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the message got out, that rate increased to 90%, she says, pointing to other co-benefits: slowdowns reduced air emissions by approximately a third and loweredcollision riskfor marine mammals.Knight believes the future lies in designing quieter ships. “We know there is a longer-term solution that takes much more investment, time and design expertise. For the future of the whales, we need quieter ships to begin with,” she says.Back in Eclipse Sound, Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation, which relies on cargo carriers such as the Nordic Odyssey to service its Mary River mine, last year incorporated aSilent-E designated vesselinto its fleet. The Nordic Nuluujaak is the world’s first bulk carrier to receive the designation. The mining company has also implemented arange of measures, including convoy operations – where ships travel in groups – nine-knot speed limits, and fixed shipping routes to reduce cumulative noise exposure for marine life.Mads Petersen, the chief operating officer of Pangaea Logistics Solutions – the company that owns the Nordic Odyssey and the Nordic Nuluujaak – says it is working to reduce underwater noise from its fleet. “This includes working with our partners in the Arctic. With a vessel that has received the Silent-E notation, we consider the impacts of our operations in areas where there might be wildlife of any kind.”View image in fullscreenBaffinland has started using quieter vessels to transport cargo to its Mary River iron ore mine on Baffin Island.Photograph: All Canada Photos/AlamyBut Joshua Jones, an oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, says that even when ships operate below quiet certification standards, the noise can still disrupt highly sensitive species such as narwhals.Dodging New York traffic: hundreds of humpback whales on a collision course with shipsRead more“In order to determine what’s quiet, you must have a few key definitions and understand quiet. Quiet is from the reference point of a listener,” he says.Arctic waters create unique acoustic challenges, too – colder temperatures and ice conditions require region-specific solutions. The Eclipse Sound research, led by the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization with Scripps and Oceans North, started with Inuit observations that narwhals are sensitive to ship noise. Theresearchconfirmed this vulnerability at 20km (12.4-mile) distances, far exceeding the 3km range previous studies had predicted.“Having western science to back up the testimonies of local people has been instrumental in moulding the rules and regulations of the waters here,” says Ootoowak, who would like to see all vessels entering Arctic waters take efforts to reduce their noise.From cruise ships to fishing vessels to pleasure craft, comprehensive noise management requires accountability across the entire maritime fleet, says Ootoowak, because in the acoustic world of narwhals, every engine matters.Explore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansWhalesOceansCetaceansMarine lifeWildlifeCanadafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The remaining 24 were all saved, according to a statement from the Nigerian president, Bola Tinubu, though no details were released about the rescue.“I am relieved that all the 24 girls have been accounted for. Now, we must put as a matter of urgency more boots on the ground in the vulnerable areas to avert further incidents of kidnapping,” the statement said.The attack in Kebbi was amonga spate of recent mass abductions in Nigeria, includinga raid on St Mary’s schoolin north-central Niger state on Friday, in which more than 300 students and staff from the Catholic school were abducted. Fifty students escaped over the weekend.Musa Rabi Magaji, principal of the primarily Muslim school in Kebbi, told the Associated Press that all of the girls had been released but that they were still in the custody of authorities. He had no immediate details of their condition.Abdulkarim Abdullahi, whose two daughters, aged 12 and 13, were among those abducted, said authorities told him the girls were being taken to the state capital of Birnin Kebbi.“I am excited to receive the news of their freedom. The past few days have been difficult for me and my family, especially their mother,” Abdullahi said in a telephone interview. “I will wait to see from the government about their wellbeing, but I can’t wait to see them in good health.”Meanwhile, 38 worshippers kidnapped during a deadly church attack in central Nigeria’s Kwara state have regained their freedom, Kwara Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq said in a statement on Sunday. Gunmen had attacked the Christ Apostolic church in Eruku on 18 November, killing two people and taking the others hostage.No group has claimed responsibility for the recent abductions, but analysts and locals say gangs of bandits often target schools, travellers and remote villagers in kidnappings. The gangs have used kidnapping for ransom as one way of dominating remote communities with little government and security presence.Authorities say the bandits are mostly former herders who have taken up arms against farming communities after clashes between them over strained resources.School kidnappings have come to define insecurity in Africa’s most populous nation, and armed gangs often see schools as strategic targets to draw more attention. At least 1,500 students have been seized in Nigeria sincethe infamous kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls more than a decade ago, and many of the children were released only after ransoms were paid.The kidnappings are happening as the US president, Donald Trump, hasclaimed that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria, although attacks have affected both Christians and Muslims.Arrests are rare and ransom payments are common in many of the hotspots in northern Nigeria.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Among these 17 men, who are requesting the South African government for assistance, are eight of my family members.”Zuma-Mncube accused the three of breaking laws against people trafficking, providing assistance to foreign militaries and fraud, saying she was “driven by moral obligation”. A spokesperson for the South African police service confirmed they had received the statement.Thandi Mbambo, a spokesperson for the Hawks serious crime unit, which is now handling the case, said: “Investigation in this matter is still at an early stage, with the docket received only Sunday, so there is nothing much to report except that investigation is under way.”The South African news outlet News24 said it had receivedvideos from three of the South African mentrapped in Ukraine, in which the men alleged Zuma-Sambudla had persuaded them to sign contracts in Russian that they did not understand and said she would spend a year in Russia training with them.Zuma-Sambudla has now filed charges against Khoza, claiming she was duped into recruiting men for what she thought was a legitimate training programme, according to the local media outletDaily News.Mbambo confirmed the Hawks had also received allegations from Zuma-Sambudla, but would not confirm their contents.

Bolsonaro has been living under house arrest since August and was taken into preventive custody on Saturday afterunsuccessfully trying to cut off his electronic ankle tag with a soldering iron.Jailhouse shock: Brazil coup monger Bolsonaro finally faces life behind barsRead moreBolsonaro’s six co-conspirators were also ordered to start their sentences.The former defence minister Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, and the former minister for institutional security Gen Augusto Heleno were arrested and imprisoned in the Planalto Military Command in Brasília. They received sentences of 19 and 21 years respectively.The former navy commander Adm Almir Garnier Santos, who received a 24-year sentence, was reportedly arrested by navy officials and held on a navy base.Bolsonaro’s former defence minister, Gen Walter Braga Netto, who received a 26-year sentence, was already in custodyhaving been arrested last December.The former justice minister,Anderson Torres, who received a 24-year sentence, was expected to be sent to a penitentiary for police officers and other “special” prisoners in Brasília called Papudinha.The former spy chief Alexandre Ramagem received a 16-year sentence, but recently fled to the US to avoid jail.Bolsonaro’s incarceration has sparked jubilation among progressive Brazilians who remember his four-year government as a calamitous spell of environmental devastation, international isolation and hostility to minorities. Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians died during a Covid outbreak Bolsonaro was accused ofcatastrophically mishandlingwith his anti-scientific stance.Mustafa Baba-Aissa, the owner of a Rio de Janeiro record store, has marked the historic occasion by decorating its facade with a white banner announcing: “Bolsonaro’s in jail!”“He’s a contemptible man who has done nothing with his life apart from living off public money …I’ve no idea how he was elected,” said the business owner, who plastered his shop’s windows with homemade posters celebrating Bolsonaro’s downfall.Bolsonaro supporters condemned the jailing of their leader, a paratrooper-turned-politicianwho was elected in 2018and posed as South America’s answer to Donald Trump.“He’s been kidnapped,” complained Ronny de Souza, a 43-year-old Bolsonaro activist, as he stood outside the federal police base where the politician was taken last weekend after being arrested amid suspicions he was about to abscond to a foreign embassy.Lenildo Mendes dos Santos Sertão, a politician​ from the Amazon who uses the nickname Delegado Caveira (“Police chief Skull”), claimed his ally was the victim of a witch-hunt. “He fought against the system and now the system has unfairly and illegally incarcerated him,” Sertão said.Bolsonaristas vowed to battle on, even with their movement’s helmsman in prison and out of the political game. “He represents millions of people in our country,” said Souza, predicting that large numbers of followers would flock to Brasília to protest Bolsonaro’s plight.But so far there has been no sign of mass protests or unrest, with only small groups of Bolsonaristas demonstrating and praying outside the federal police compound where he has spent the last three nights.Experts say the former president’s influence has waned dramatically in recent months, particularly after Bolsonaro was arrested for tampering with his ankle tag.Camila Rocha, a political scientist who studies Brazil’s new right, said recent polls revealed a clear decrease in support for Bolsonaro – both in the streets and social media. One study found that only 13% of voters now supported Bolsonaro “no matter what”. Last month, a rally in Brasília organized by Bolsonaro’s family drew about 2,000 people – far smaller than the huge crowds the former president mobilized when at the peak of his powers.“Could there be more protests? Sure. But I think this declining trend is established,” said Rocha, who saw Bolsonaro in “a dead-end situation”.Rocha believed Bolsonaro’s arrest was good news for the rightwing politicians hoping to inherit his votes, as well as for voters hoping to see “a reduction in anti-democratic extremism” in Brazil.Not all of the pro-Bolsonaro schemers sentenced over the coup could be imprisoned on Tuesday. Ramagem, the former head of Brazil’s intelligence agency, Abin, recently skipped the country despite having his passport cancelled.“I’m safe in the US,” Ramagem announced in a social media video on Monday, urging Bolsonaristas to take to the streets to defend “our greatest leader”.On Tuesday afternoon, as the plotters began to serve their sentences, there was no immediate sign citizens would heed his call.After visiting his father earlier in the day, Carlos Bolsonaro told reporters: “He’s psychologically devastated.”Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Time and time again promises have been broken and Britain’s reputation as a clean and fair place to do business has been dragged through the mud.“Those overseas territories which continue to block and frustrate the will of parliament are letting the rest of the British family down, including those jurisdictions which have already acted in good faith and opened up their books.”The government’s anti-corruption champion Margaret Hodge visited the BVI in September and said she hoped the joint ministerial council would be the occasion where an agreement on registers was reached. Lady Hodge was instrumental in passing the original laws requiring all BOTs to make registers publicly available.At the last council meeting in 2024, all BOTs that had not already done so agreed to design and implement open corporate registers by June 2025. The UK originally set a deadline of December 2023 for the preparation of public registers, giving them more than five years since the original legislation was passed.In defining those with a legitimate interest, the BVI includes anyone seeking to investigate, prevent or detect money laundering, terrorist financing or proliferation financing, but it also states the registrar can deny access if it believes it is in the public interest of the BVI to do so. The relevant company would have to be notified if a request was being made.The BVI is thought to have 12 companies registered for every individual BVI citizen. The Financial Action Task Force grey-listed the BVI in June 2025, citing its lack of transparency surrounding beneficial ownership.Transparency International said the BVI rules meant “legitimate interest users will only see a subset of data, rather than what is being submitted to the register. This means users will most likely end up seeing the name of nominee shareholders or trustees holding the company on behalf of a hidden beneficiary.”Explore more on these topicsBritish Virgin IslandsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeAmericasRegulatorsCorporate governanceTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

King says this group was the main source of the rumours.The genealogist working with Taaf told King she found no evidence of Cherokee ancestry on either side of his family lineage. King says he accepts the findings.“It’s been a couple of weeks since that video call, and I’m still reeling. At 82, I feel as though I’ve been ripped in half, a one-legged man in a two-legged story,” he wrote. “Not the Indian I had in mind. Not an Indian at all.”King, a California-born academic, writer and activist, has lived in Canada since 1980, when he took a job in Alberta teaching Indigenous studies at the University of Lethbridge. He rose to prominence with work thatCanada’s governor general saiddisplayed “formidable wit to explore the social, economic and political dimensions of the modern Aboriginal experience”.King has long said he grew up hearing a story that his father, Robert King, was not his biological father. Instead, Thomas King’s grandfather was Elvin Hunt, a man believed to have Cherokee ancestry. But the genealogist working with Taaf found no evidence of Cherokee ancestry on either side of King’s family lineage.King won the 2014 RBC Taylor prize for non-fiction for his book The Inconvenient Indian and in 2020 won the Stephen Leacock memorial medal for humour for his work Indians on Vacation. That same year, he was promoted to companion of the Order ofCanada, commended for his “prolific and groundbreaking work [which] continues to enrich our country’s culture, and has changed our perception of Canadian history”.In an interview with the Globe and Mail published on Monday, King said he intended to return the National Aboriginal Achievement award, which he received in 2003. “The rest of my awards are based on my writing, not my ethnicity,” he said.King is the latest prominent figure whose claims to Indigenous ancestry have been disproven. Recently, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation investigation claimed folk singer Buffy Sainte-Marie was born in Massachusetts to white parents,not to Cree parentsas she had long claimed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Throughout my career – activist, academic, administrator, writer – I’ve conducted myself in the belief that I was mixed-blood Cherokee.”But he wrote that after seeing the evidence, if he chose to withhold that information “then an accusation of fraud would have merit”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndigenous peoplesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He alleged that the Albanese government had signed a $2.5bn deal with Adeang to deport more than 350 people in the NZYQ cohort to the tiny Pacific nation, despite knowing of the agency’s suspicions of corruption and money laundering against him.Nauru president floats returning NZYQ refugees to home countriesRead moreThe NZYQ cohort are a group of about 350 non-citizens who have had their visas cancelled on character grounds but who cannot be returned to their home countries, largely because they face persecution.Adeang visited Canberra last week for a series of meetings with government ministers, including the foreign and home affairs ministers.The report from the Australian government’s financial intelligence agency alleges suspicious transfers of millions of dollars reported by financial institutions in 2020 when Adeang was a member of parliament. The report also details suspicious activity by Lionel Aingimea, then the president of Nauru, now theforeign ministerand minister for police.“Suspicious matter reports submitted by the Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited’s customer service agency in Nauru reported suspicious financial transactions by the president of Nauru [then Aingimea], his family and associates,” Shoebridge, reading from the Austrac report, told the Senate. “These transactions involve the movement of funds between personal and business accounts, transactions on behalf of others and activity indicative of money laundering and corruption.“These suspicious transactions occurred over a nine-month period from January to September 2020 in Nauru totalling over $2m in combined credits and over $1m in combined debits.“President of Nauru, Lionel Aingimea, first lady Ingrid Aingimea, brother of the president, David Aingimea and member of parliament, David Adeang, are linked to the reported suspicious activity.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA further “suspicious matter report” from September 2020 “relates to rapid movement of large volume and value of funds by David Adeang, forming a suspicion of corruption and money laundering”, the Austrac report was said to have stated.Shoebridge said the suspicious matter reports indicated Adeang had received funds from a company called 1402 LRC Car Rentals and Construction, a company associated with Aingimea’s wife. The company held subcontracts with a Brisbane firm, Canstruct International, which was contracted by the Australian government to run Australia’s offshore processing regime, and its detention centre on Nauru.The Austrac report highlighted several transactions flagged by banks reportedly made by Adeang, including: 15 Osko payments, three of those from the Aingimea-linked 1402 LRC Car Rentals and Construction, totalling $113,797; 462 transactions associated with building and construction reference of payment totalling $248,888; 140 ATM withdrawals totalling $68,840; and one branch withdrawal of $700.The Austrac report also said: “[Adeang] was investigated in 2015 by Australian Federal Police for alleged bribery in relation to phosphate mining in Nauru.”Shoebridge told the Senate that Australia’s “cruel and corrupt offshore detention arrangements with Nauru must be torn down”.“Let me put this clearly, the Australian government has, at all times, known that the current Nauruan president and key members of his government are seriously corrupt, and they still signed a $2.5bn deal with him,” Shoebridge alleged in the Senate on Tuesday night.“Corruption follows cruelty and it breeds in secrecy, and that’s the Nauru deal and offshore detention all over. We must stop the rorts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Canstruct made more than $1.8bn from a succession of expanding offshore processing contracts with the Department of Home Affairs, despite a litany of controversies and the exposure of consistent abuses of refugees and asylum seekers.A translation of the Nauruan president’s remarks will stay suppressed for a decade – but secrecy in Australia’s offshore policy is nothing newRead moreGuardian Australia contacted Canstruct with a series of questions about alleged corrupt payments. Canstruct, which appears to no longer be operational, has not responded.The Guardian also put a series of questions to Adeang’s office, the Nauruan government and the Nauruan embassy in Canberra about the allegations of corruption but has yet to receive a response.A spokesperson for the home affairs minister said: “The government takes advice from our security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies, not from the Greens political party.”Subsequent to the Austrac reports, the Albanese government commissioned the former defence chief Dennis Richardson to conduct a review into allegations of corruption in Nauru in 2023. Examining multiple contracts and subcontracts,he foundthat some contractors suspected of drug smuggling and weapons trafficking had been handed multimillion-dollar offshore contracts but concluded that the Australian government “may have had no option but to enter into contracts with these companies” due to the high-risk environments of offshore processing.Guardian Australia put a series of questions to Austrac about the allegations made by Shoebridge but has not yet received a response.Australia’s secrecy over its dealings with Nauru, its former colony, have raised consistent criticism. Nauru itself has no free press and does not allow independent journalists to visit the country.The Australian government has refused to reveal the details of the $2.5bn agreement it has signed with Nauru to resettle members of the NZYQ cohort, as well as details of its offshore processing contract, worth nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars with a US private prisons operator.The government also refuses to say how much it is paying Papua New Guinea to hold asylum seekers and refugees formerly detained on Manus Island, which is part of PNG. Previous governments have refused to release details of offshore detention contracts, saying their disclosure woulddamage Australia’s international relations, as well as keeping secret the Australia-Nauru security partnership memorandum of understanding signed nearly a decade ago.Explore more on these topicsNauruAustralian immigration and asylumPacific islandsBusinessAustralian politicsAustralian GreensAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The bodies were not found until 2022, when an unsuspecting family pried open the contents of an abandoned storage locker they bought in an auction.Lee, who had long since changed her name and fled the country for South Korea, was extradited to face trial in New Zealand.The sentencing hearing on Wednesday heard how the murders had left deep emotional scars on Lee’s family.“If she wanted to die why didn’t she die alone?” Lee’s mother Choon Ja Lee said in a statement read to the court.The trial hinged not on whether Lee had murdered her children - which she had confessed to - but whether she knew her actions were morally wrong. Her lawyers had argued she was not guilty by reason of insanity and that the death of her husband in 2017 sent her into a depressive spiral.A forensic psychiatrist testified for the defence about Lee’s mental state - describing depression, suicidal thoughts, guilt, and a belief that killing her children was the right thing to do.But the prosecution had argued she knew what she was doing, pointing to her efforts to hide the bodies before fleeing the country.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It said that cremation was necessary to preserve land resources and promote a “frugal new funeral style”.In recent years China has struggled with crowded cemeteries and the government has encouraged people to consider alternative funeral practices, such assea burials.But for many rural people, traditional burials are a core part of their culture.One villager from Xifeng county, the administrative district for Shidong town, posted on social media that his grandfather had been cremated earlier in the year because of pressure from local officials. He said that his family was warned that failure to comply would lead to negative consequences for three generations.Many comments on Douyin, a video-sharing app, were supportive of the protesters. “Yes everyone, let’s stand up and support traditional burial practices!” wrote one user.This year CDM has recorded 661 rural protests in China, a 70% increase on the whole of 2024. In the third quarter of 2025, CDM logged nearly 1,400 incidents of unrest, a 45% increase on the same period in 2024.Many protests appear to be driven economic struggles and related grievances.View image in fullscreenProtests broke out in Sichuan province in August over a school bullying incident.Photograph: YouTubeBut in some cases, such as the cremation protests in Guizhou, the initial trigger can be the state’s intrusion into what many people see as a deeply personal matter. Kevin Slaten, the research lead for CDM, said that the protests in Guizhou were unusual for the fact that they have lasted several days.“Protests are more likely to be large scale and last longer if it involves something very personal. Whether that is a major hit to someone’s economic livelihood … or something like that’s their heritage or dealing with ancestors. People are much more likely to feel motivated to take the risk of protest.”In August, aprotest in Sichuan provinceover a school bullying incident spiralled into a multi-day clash between hundreds of locals and the authorities.The Xifeng local government declined to comment.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaProtestAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Taiwan’s democratically elected government strongly rejects China’s stance.The ministry said the call touched on other issues, including Ukraine, with Xi also stressing the need to build on a fragile trade truce between China and the US.But Taiwan featured prominently. China is embroiled in aweeks-long diplomatic rowwith key US ally Japan over the island that has seen a dip in Chinese tourism to Japan, a ban on Japanese seafood and the cancellation of joint cultural events.The bitter dispute between Tokyo and Beijing was triggered after Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s new prime minister, suggested this month thatTokyo could intervene militarily in any attack on Taiwan.On Tuesday, Takaichi said she also had a call with Trump and discussed his conversation with Xi, as well as US-Japan relations.She and Trump “held a wide-ranging exchange of views on strengthening the Japan-US alliance and the challenges and issues facing the Indo-Pacific region”, she told reporters, without elaborating. She said Trump had proposed the call.The US does not officially recognise Taiwan’s claim to statehood but Washington remains the island’s most important partner and arms supplier.Trump did not mention Taiwan in hispost on Truth Social about his callwith Xi. Instead, he praised “extremely strong” US-China relations.According to China’s foreign ministry, Trump told Xi during their discussion that the US “understands how important the Taiwan question is to China.”In response, Taiwan premier Cho Jung-tai said on Tuesday that a “return” to China is not an option for the island’s 23 million people.“We must once again emphasise that the Republic of China, Taiwan, is a fully sovereign and independent country,” Cho told reporters outside parliament, referring to the island’s formal name.“For the 23 million people of our nation, ‘return’ is not an option - this is very clear,” he added.The US president’s statement also confirmed that he will visit China in April and that Xi will come to Washington later in 2026. Beijing said nothing about the state visits.Their call came after the pairmet in late Octoberfor the first time since 2019, engaging in closely watched trade talks between the world’s top two economies.The Washington-Beijing trade war, which encompasses everything from rare earths to soya beans and port fees, has rocked markets and slowed supply chains for months. Atentative dealreached in October’s meeting in South Korea saw Beijing agree to suspend for one year certain export restrictions on critical minerals.China is hugely dominant in the mining and processing ofrare earths, which are essential for sophisticated electronic components across a range of industries including auto, electronics and defence.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Xi Jinping talk on the sidelines of the Apec summit in October.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersMeanwhile, the US said it would cut back tariffs on Chinese products, and Beijing would buy at least 12m metric tons of American soya beans by the end of this year, and 25m metric tons in 2026.Xi told Trump on Monday that their two countries should “keep up the momentum”, according to the foreign ministry. He added that the “successful” meeting in South Korea “recalibrated the course of the giant ship of China-US relations and provided more momentum for it to sail forward steadily”.Since the meeting, China-US ties have “generally maintained a steady and positive trajectory, and this is welcomed by the two countries and the broader international community”, Xi said. Trump struck a similarly optimistic tone in his statement.“This call was a follow-up to our highly successful meeting in South Korea, three weeks ago. Since then, there has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate. Now we can set our sights on the big picture,” he said.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said Washington hoped to finalise a deal with Beijing for securing supplies of rare earths by the Thanksgiving holiday, which falls on Thursday.The two leaders also discussed thewar in Ukraine– an issue high on Trump’s agenda as hepushes for an end to the war.China has positioned itself as a neutral party and, in Monday’s call, Xi reiterated his backing to end the nearly four-year conflict.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsChinaTaiwanDonald TrumpAsia PacificXi JinpingnewsShareReuse this content"

Ukrainian officials said they were close to accepting the framework of a deal, but that some details could only be discussed at presidential level.Trump envoy reportedly told Kremlin official that Ukraine must cede land for peace dealRead moreHowever, Trump said he would instead dispatch Dan Driscoll, the US army secretary, to Ukraine for further discussions. The official,who has suddenly taken a central role in the peace negotiations, is expected in Kyiv later this week, according to Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak.In his nightly address, Zelenskyy said Ukrainian officials had been working “on the text of the document” prepared in a previous round of talks in Geneva and said that “the principles in this document can be developed into deeper agreements”.But there was no suggestion that the revised US-Ukraine agreementdiscussed in Geneva on Sundaywould be something to which Russia would agree.Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said that any amended peace plan would have to reflect the “spirit and letter” of what Donald Trump and Putin discussed at their summit in Alaska in August, after which Trump had appeared to conclude that Ukraine should make territorial concessions to Russia.Moscow meanwhile continued its nightly assaults on Ukrainian cities. Russian forcesfired 22 missiles and 464 dronesat Ukraine on Tuesday night, primarily at targets in and around Kyiv. Seven people were killed.Earlier, senior Ukrainian officials said they hoped Zelenskyy would meet Trump during this week’s US thanksgiving holiday to discuss the revised agreement and talk directly about territory. Russia continues to want Ukraine to cede the 30% of Donetsk province it has not captured, which Ukraine has said is unacceptable.A Ukrainian official told AFP that the new US-Ukraine proposal was “significantly better”. The revised term sheet raised a proposed cap on the country’s future military forces from 600,000 to 800,000 members – close to the current number of personnel on active service.“Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,” the secretary of Ukraine’s security council, Rustem Umerov, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday.“We look forward to organising a visit of Ukraine’s president to the US at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump.”Zelenskyy said on Tuesday evening that any talks with Trump should include European allies, and told 40 allies that “security decisions aboutEuropemust include Europe” in a virtual meeting of the coalition of the willing, countries willing to contribute to a post-war peacekeeping force.The issue of territorial concessions was not covered by the US-Ukraine agreement, according to Keir Starmer. “My understanding is this is not a new agreement, it is Ukraine confirming they are happy with the draft that emerged in Geneva yesterday, which of course doesn’t cover the question of territory,” the UK prime minister told parliament on Tuesday.On Monday night, Driscoll met a Russian delegation in Abu Dhabi, and talks continued into Tuesday. “The talks are going well and we remain optimistic. Secretary Driscoll is closely synchronised with the White House ... as these talks progress,” his spokesperson told Reuters.Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, was also expected to participate in the Abu Dhabi talks, theFinancial Times reported, though it was not clear whether there would be direct talks with Moscow’s representatives or separate bilateral talks with Driscoll.Nor was it immediately clear who was in the Russian delegation. “I have nothing to say. We are following the media reports,” Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told Russian state media.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, who had emerged as one of Trump’s main interlocutors among European leaders in recent months, said on Tuesday that the coming days would be decisive in attempts to find a peace settlement, after speaking by phone to Zelenskyy and the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte.“Zelenskyy gave an overview of the latest situation. The future of Ukraine is for Ukraine to decide, and European security is for Europe to decide,” Stubbwroteon X.Zelenskyy also spoke to Starmer and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, cautioned against a peace deal that would be a “capitulation” for Ukraine.“What was put on the table gives us an idea of what would be acceptable for the Russians. Does that mean that it is what must be accepted by the Ukrainians and the Europeans? The answer is no,” Macron said.View image in fullscreenA logistics centre of a supermarket chain was destroyed inthe airstrikes on Kyivovernight.Photograph: Danylo Antoniuk/Ukrinform/ShutterstockThe US plan wasoriginally made up of 28 pointsand was based on discussions between Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the Kremlin aide Kirill Dmitriev, reportedly with input from the head of Ukraine’s security council, Rustem Umerov.The proposal would have involved Ukraine ceding territory occupied by Russia and other areas it would have been expected to surrender voluntarily.

Zelenskyy said on Friday that the country was facing one of the most difficult moments in its history and was being forced to choose between “losing our dignity or losing a key ally”.Driscoll then briefed Nato ambassadors on the plan in Kyiv. One person present said it had been“a nightmare meeting”and that European ambassadors had been shocked by the content and tone of Driscoll’s delivery.Washington then rowed back on its ultimatums and said the 28-point plan was an opening point for discussion.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyEuropeUnited Arab EmiratesnewsShareReuse this content"

Putin “will congratulate” and will say: “Mr Trump is a real peace man,” he said.a map of Russian-controlled territory and Russian advancesThe heavily criticized28-point proposalwould require Ukraine to cede the entire Donetsk region to Russia, including areas currently under Ukrainian control. Russia has not fully captured Donetsk.Those territories would become a demilitarized buffer zone internationally recognized as Russian, and the plan would also grantRussiacontrol of Luhansk and Crimea while freezing current battle lines in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.Putin said this month he believed the US plan could serve as the“basis for a final peaceful settlement”, though the Kremlin maintains it has not discussed the proposal in detail with Washington.The revelations come as Trump said on Tuesday he was sending Witkoff to meet with Putin in Moscow, and the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, to meet with the Ukrainians – ahead of a possible White House meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on Friday.“I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages,” Trumpsaid in a Truth Socialpost.The US has pushedUkraineto accept the framework as the foundation for ending the nearly four-year conflict, though Ukrainian officials have insisted they will not recognize Russian control of occupied territories or accept limits on their military forces.The phone conversation took place as Trump’s stance toward Moscow appeared to be hardening. On the same day as the Witkoff-Ushakov call, Trump voiced frustration with Putin’s unwillingness to end the war, saying: “I don’t know why he continues with this war. He just doesn’t want to end that war. And I think it’s making him look very bad.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

There can be no pauses in assistance.”The Ukrainian leader said the Kremlin must not feel it was able to win the war while talks continued. He said: “What matters most now is that all partners move toward diplomacy together, through joint efforts. Pressure on Russia must deliver results.”Explosions erupt over Kyiv as Russia strikes Ukrainian capitalExplosions erupt over Kyiv as Russia strikes Ukrainian capitalZelenskyy said four drones had also crossed “into the airspace of our neighbours – Moldova and Romania”.

His son, Anton, posted on Facebook that he and his mother recognised his body when it was recovered. “I hate the world,” Anton wrote.There were 13 separate reports of attack damage or falling debris, including to a 22-storey residential apartment block in the Perchersk district.

The first flew back into Ukrainian airspace, but the second was later found downed in Puieşti, about 70 miles from Ukraine.Ionuț Moşteanu, Romania’s defence minister, said two of the German pilots had been given orders to shoot down the second drone. In the end, he said it appeared to have crashed, possibly because it had run out fuel.MapExamination of the wreckage showed the drone was unarmed, the minister added. “It could have been destroyed if all the conditions had been met ... the pilots needed to see it, to engage it, to lock it on radar and to be able to fire a missile at it.”The first drone was detected at 6.28am local time (0428 GMT) and the second at 7.50am, the defence ministry said. People in three Romanian border counties were told to take cover in the morning until the incident was resolved.It is the 13th time Romanian airspace has been breached by Russian drones, the third incident in the past week and the first during daytime. Villagers on the Romanian side of the border with Ukraine were evacuated last week when a tanker carrying liquefied petroleum gas was struck and caught fire in the nearby Ukrainian port of Izmail across the Danube.Six drones also crossed into Moldova’s airspace overnight, according to the country’s defence ministry. One of them, a distinctive delta-wing model with a RussianZ symbolspray painted on the tailfin, landed on a roof in the village of Cuhureştii de Jos, 15 miles from the Ukrainian border.After an inspection, the country’s police said the drone was an unarmed Gerbera decoy, used by the Russians to overwhelm Ukrainian air defences and increasingly in incursions into the airspace of neighbouring countries. They suggested the drone had landed when it ran out of fuel.In September, 21 unarmed Gerbera dronescrossed into Polandin an apparently deliberate incursion by Russia. The incident led Nato to create the Eastern Sentry mission, with increased fighter jet patrols of countries on the alliance’s eastern flank.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Gaza health ministry said on Monday that at least 342 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli fire since the start of the truce. Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed by militant gunfire in the same period.Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a smaller allied militant faction, said on Tuesday that they were preparing to hand over the remains of another Israeli hostage in line with the terms of the ceasefire deal. A spokesperson for Islamic Jihad said the body of the hostage had been found on Monday during search operations in central Gaza.Israel said the delay in handing over the remains was a violation of the ceasefire.There is little clarity about how the challenges of implementing the more immediate requirements ofDonald Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza will be met, let alone longer-term questions of reconstruction.The two-year war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 during a surprise incursion into Israel on 7 October 2023. More than 69,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in the ensuing Israeli offensive and in strikes since the ceasefire. The bodies of thousands moreremain under the rubble.Road network damage in GazaConditions in Gaza, which has been effectively split since the ceasefire with Israeli military forces controlling just over half of the territory,are extremely difficult.In its most recent update, the World Food Programme (WFP) said most households in Gaza were unable to afford basic food items. It said prices had dropped steeply in recent weeks, but the quantity of food consumed daily was still well below pre-war levels.Diets are dominated by cereals, pulses and moderate amounts of dairy and oil, with very limited meat, vegetables and fruit, the WFP said, while cooking gas was scarce, forcing many families to rely on burning discarded plastic or other alternative fuels to cook.Since the start of the ceasefire, Hamas has released all the 20 living hostages it was holding and returned the remains of all but three of the 25 dead hostages. In exchange, Israel has released nearly 2,000 prisoners in its custody and returned the bodies of hundreds of dead Palestinians.The UN security council gave formal backing last week to Trump’s plan, which calls for an interim technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza, overseen by an international “board of peace” and backed by an international security force.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He targeted me for being Jewish – and it hurt | Peter EttedguiDaniel Boffey,Henry Dyerand Mark BlacklockTue 25 Nov 2025 15.58 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 19.10 ESTShareThree more school contemporaries who claim to have witnessed Nigel Farage’s alleged teenage racism have rejected the Reform UK leader’s suggestion that it was “banter”, describing it as targeted, persistent and nasty.One former pupil, Stefan Benarroch, claimed that people emerging from a Jewish assembly at Dulwich college had been in the sights of Farage and others for taunts while a second, Cyrus Oshidar, described as “rubbish” the claim that the Reform leader did not act with intent to hurt.“Being called a Paki isn’t hurtful?” Oshidar asked. A third, Rickard Berg, told the Guardian: “He’s now in a position where he shouldn’t be denying this. He’s straight up lying.”The Guardian has spoken to more than 20 people who alleged racist or antisemitic behaviour by Farage at school, including seven people who say they recall the targeted abuse of Peter Ettedgui, who is now an Emmy- and Bafta-winning director.The alleged abuse spanned six years, from age 13 to 18.On Monday night, Farage broke his silence over allegations that he had targeted fellow pupils for racial and antisemitic abuse, nearly a week after the Guardian published an investigation into his alleged conduct.His aides previously said that “the suggestion that Mr Farage ever engaged in, condoned, or led racist or antisemitic behaviour is categorically denied”.In his broadcast interview, Farage changed tack and appeared to admit to saying things that could be construed as prejudiced today. But he denied any “intent” to inflict hurt on people due to their race or religion.He said: “Have I said things 50 years ago that you could interpret as being banter in a playground, you could interpret in a modern light today in some sort of way? Yes.”He went on to admit that he “probably” had “misspoken in my younger days” and that he hoped he had not said anything that could be construed as racist but that his recollection was imperfect after more than four decades.He denied directly abusing anyone, which he defined as “taking it out on an individual on the basis of who they are or what they are”.He suggested that those who had spoken out were politically motivated and were not “telling the truth”.In a further statement on Tuesday after the Guardian put fresh allegations to him, Farage appeared to change his stance again. “I can tell you categorically that I did not say the things that have been published in the Guardian aged 13, nearly 50 years ago,” he said.He claimed the Guardian wanted to “smear anybody who talks about the immigration issue”.Writing for the Guardian, Ettedgui, who alleges that Farage as a 13-year-old classmate would say “Hitler was right” or “gas them” to him, claimed: “Well, he did directly target me and I can tell you that it did hurt. How did he think it would make me feel? How does he think those who were called Pakis or told to ‘go home’ felt?”Benarroch, who is Jewish and was two years below Farage at school, said he did not get personally targeted by him but that he recalled the abuse allegedly meted out to Ettedgui.“He was such a gentle soul and Farage – Farage made his life a fucking nightmare,” he said.“They could only identify us, because we had to go to this stupid Jewish service in the science labs school. I mean, none of us were remotely religious. They would hang out there. Farage would hang out with his minions. And then they would taunt us as we would leave.”Of Farage’s claim that those who had spoken out were not telling the truth, he believes “this is the oldest of the antisemitic tropes”.He said he considered this was akin to claiming there is a “worldwide Jewish global conspiracy, and in order to have a conspiracy, you have to lie. That is what Reform are accusing us of. It couldn’t get more personal.”Berg,who was in the same year as Farage during O-levels, said he also recalled the abuse of Ettedgui as being direct and designed to hurt.He said: “He definitely had a go at Peter and there were a couple of others he would also have a go at. Me being foreign, because I’m Swedish, he sort of made the point that I was foreign, but didn’t have a go at me, because for a start, I stood up to him. The other guys didn’t. Peter Ettedgui never reacted to him. Farage was a bully, typical, picked on the soft guys who wouldn’t stand up, rise to the bait. That’s the way he worked.“He was nasty, there was no question. [The song] Gas ’em all, I heard him singing it to Ettedgui. I didn’t get it at the time, because Peter didn’t react. Back in the day, you thought it was for him to react.”Oshidar, who was in the same year as Farage, said he recalled the constant name calling, including the use of antisemitic and racial slurs. “The same sort of noise that came out of him every day,” he claimed, adding that he recognised that it was “the language of that time”.He claimed: “He wasn’t the only one saying it. But he was the only one in Dulwich saying it regularly.”Responding to Farage’s denial that he abused anyone directly, he claimed: “No, that’s rubbish. I mean, that’s absolutely rubbish. There’s no question that this happened … Because of who he is now and where he is he will try to deny it. But he can’t. I mean, it’s undeniable.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We’ve got a 200-metre perimeter around the scene. We’ll make sure that everyone keeps away.“It’s going to be a very, very busy scene of operations for the foreseeable future, certainly overnight.“So, we would ask members of the public to keep away, keep a safe distance and allow the fire brigade to do their job.”0:39Huge fire breaks out in west London warehouse – videoCrews from Southall, Heston, Ealing and surrounding fire stations were responding to the blaze, the LFB added.Three turntable ladders had been deployed previously to allow crews to fight the fire from height, but firefighters have since withdrawn for safety reasons.Earlier, Pat Goulbourne, the brigade’s incident commander said: “All firefighters have withdrawn to a safe distance and are now fighting the fire from a greater distance to ensure crew safety.“Firefighters are working hard to bring this fire safely under control. Due to the complex nature of the site, and the size of the fire, this will be a protracted incident with crews continuing firefighting operations through the day,” he added.View image in fullscreenThe fire at the two-storey warehouse in Southall, west London.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesGoulbourne said the fire was producing a large amount of smoke, and advised residents to close their doors and windows until the fire was put out. He also suggested drivers avoid the area.First reports of the fire were received at 8.55am, the LFB said, adding that there were about 60 calls in total.The cause of the fire was not yet known, the LFB added.Explore more on these topicsLondonFirefightersnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "12.32 ESTNo 10 claims no final decisions taken after leak reveals all jury trials might be scrapped except for alleged rapists and killersDavid Lammy, the justice secretary, has written to officials and other ministers suggesting only rape, murder and manslaughter cases might be heard by juries under plans to overhaul the courts system.According toa report in the Times, in the document Lammy said there was “no right” to a jury trial in the UK and that drastic action is needed to reduce crown court backlogs.Downing Street insisted that no final decision has been taken, but did not deny that Lammy, deputy PM as well as justice secretary, is considering getting rid of juries for most trials.According to the Times, Lammy proposed that ony only rape, murder, manslaughter and “public interest” cases would be heard by juries. It says this could result in 75% of cases being heard by a judge alone.In July, in a report for the government, SirBrian Leveson, a former judge, proposed apartial restriction of the right to a jury trial. He recommended that a large number of mid-ranking offences should be heard by a judge sitting with two magistrates. The Lammy proposal goes much further.Asked about the Times report, thePM’s spokespersonsaid:Jury trials will remain a cornerstone of our justice system for the most serious cases.No final decisions have been taken, but it is right that we ask whether there are cases that need not be heard by a jury.Asked if the PM would be comfortable with a situation where the only cases that went before a jury were homicides and rapes, the spokesperson added:I think we’re slightly getting ahead of things. We are looking at the review, no decisions have been taken, and we will respond accordingly.Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, said:David Lammy once proudly defended jury trials, but now he’s in office he’s getting rid of them in virtually every case. Scrapping this pillar of our constitution because of the administrative failure to reduce the court backlog is a disgrace.Share"

While those decisions involved individual migrants or small groups, Sykes on Tuesday extended her ruling nationwide.About 65,000 people were in immigration detention in the US as of last week, according to government data.The Trump administration has argued that individuals’ differing circumstances required the issue to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, but Sykes said that being deprived of the right to a bond hearing was an injury common to the class.“Such common injury can be resolved in a single stroke upon the determination that the new policy is in violation of (migrants’) due process rights,” wrote Sykes, an appointee of Joe Biden.The US Department of Justice and lawyers for the four migrants who filed the lawsuit did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Under federal immigration law, “applicants for admission” to the United States are subject to mandatory detention while their cases proceed in immigration courts.Bucking a longstanding interpretation of the law, the Trump administration in July said that non-citizens already residing in the United States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.Sykes in her ruling last week disagreed, saying the law makes a clear distinction between existing US residents and new arrivals.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsDonald TrumpCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

Still, Trump’s remarks remain the only public reason for why the US is firing missiles – when the legal justification is in fact very different.And it would also be the first time the US has claimed – dubiously, and contrary to the widely held understanding – that the cartels are using cocaine proceeds to wage wars, rather than to make money.In a statement, a justice department spokesperson said: “These operations were ordered consistent with the law of armed conflict.” The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.The new rationale being advanced by the administration comes as the legal justification gains heightened importance amid a military campaign against the cartels that shows signs of dramatically expanding.The US now has an extraordinary force in the Caribbean withthe arrival of the USS Gerald Ford, the world’s most advanced super-carrier, which brings capabilities to hit land targets, which Trump has said he wants to pursue.And this week, defense secretary Pete Hegseth threatened senator Mark Kelly with court-martial after he recorded a video with five other Democratic lawmakers warning military members to question unlawful orders, apparently in reference to the strikes.View image in fullscreenDefense secretary Pete Hegseth leaves a classified briefing on the strikes at the US Capitol.Photograph: Aaron Schwartz/EPACartel goals disputedAccording to three lawyers directly familiar with the OLC opinion blessing the boat strikes, the collective self-defense argument is said to be a key plank of the legal analysis.The opinion formalizes a 21 July meeting of a “restricted interagency lawyers group” of four career and four political appointees from the Pentagon, the office of the joint chiefs of staff, the CIA, the White House and the OLC.It principally argues that the US has entered an armed conflict with the cartels because it is helping allies in the region like Mexico and Colombia, which, according to an administration official, asked for US help confidentially for fear of reprisals.The armed conflict designation is key because it allows Trump to operate under the so-called law of armed conflict, which permits the use of lethal force without violating federal murder statutes or international law.The opinion then finds Trump does not need congressional approval because the administration satisfied OLC’s two-prong test: whether the strikes serve a national interest, and whether they would not be of a prolonged scope, nature or duration.For instance, it outlines four areas of national interests the strikes serve, from the duty to provide assistance to allies, to preserving regional stability, to protecting the US from the influx of illegal drugs themselves.But despite the plausible legal framework, the OLC opinion relies on a fact pattern about the cartels for which no public evidence appears to exist.The closest analogy is perhaps the Taliban and al-Qaida trafficking opium during the war on terror to finance its terrorist activities. But in that instance, it was clear their primary goal was to wage armed attacks against the US and Nato allies, and the opium financed their weapons.It is uncertain whether the same applies to drug cartels in Latin America.Martin Lederman, a former deputy assistant attorney general at OLC during the Obama and Biden administrations, expressed skepticism with the administration’s claims about collective self-defense.“A significant problem with this theory is that they still have not identified any state that’s engaged in an armed conflict with a particular cartel,” saidLederman.“Nor has the administration provided any evidence that another state engaged in such an armed conflict has asked the US to destroy cocaine shipments that are allegedly being used to subsidize armed violence against the requesting state,” he said.An administration official said it had evidence that each boat carries around $50m worth of cocaine, the proceeds of which are being used to acquire sophisticated weapons, but the underlying intelligence is classified.Still, the justice department’s OLC is not an expert in assessing the intelligence findings or the purported objectives of the cartels; typically, it ends up deferring to the US intelligence community.For this opinion, a senior administration official acknowledged, OLC did not attempt to stress-test the purported goals of the cartels – or the underlying facts to determine the existence of an armed conflict.OLC considered only a narrow question posed by the White House of whether it was a lawful policy option for the president to use military force against unflagged vessels in international waters transporting cocaine.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationVenezuelaUS politicsDrugs tradeUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship,” they added.The statement deepens a dispute between theTrump administrationand Democrats, including Arizona senator and former astronaut Kelly and Michigan congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, over the video message, which urged the military and intelligence services members to “refuse illegal orders”.Slotkin said the FBI’s counter-terrorism division had notified the group that “they are opening what appears to be an inquiry against the six of us” and described the move as a “scare tactic” by Trump.“To be honest, the president’s reaction and the use of the FBI against us is exactly why we made the video,” she said.“He believes in using the federal government against his perceived adversaries, and he’s not afraid to use the arms of the government against people he disagrees with. He does not believe the law applies to him … which is exactly why we made the video, to give people some assurance that they weren’t alone as they watch this stuff unfold.”The Pentagon has also said it is conducting a review of misconduct allegations against Kelly that could, it said, result in him being recalled to active duty to face court-martial proceedings.Explore more on these topicsDemocratsUS politicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesUS SenatenewsShareReuse this content"

Garza alleges he was fired in January after he raised concerns about comments made by Martin Bally, Campbell’s vice-president of information technology – including referring to one of the company’s ingredients as “bioengineered meat” while going off on a racist tirade.The lawsuit recounts that Garza met with Bally in November 2024 to discuss his salary. However, Garza alleges, the meeting turned into an hour-long rant by Bally during which he disparaged the quality of Campbell’s products and customers, made racist comments about Indian employees and admitted to coming to work while high on marijuana edibles.In audio recordings captured by Garza after sensing that “something wasn’t right,” which were laterreviewed by the Michigan news outlet WDIV, a voice can be heard saying: “We have shit for fucking poor people.”The voice adds: “Who buys our shit? I don’t buy Campbell’s products barely any more. It’s not healthy now that I know what the fuck’s in it … bioengineered meat.“I don’t wanna eat a piece of chicken that came from a 3D printer”Allegedly referring to Campbell’s employees of Indian heritage, the voice continued: “Fucking Indians don’t know a fucking thing … Like they couldn’t think for their fucking selves.”Garza says he felt “pure disgust” after the meeting but kept the recording private until January, when he reported Bally’s behaviour to supervisor JP Aupperle, according to WDIV. Garza said he was dismissed from Campbell’s 20 days later and without any prior disciplinary action.According to Garza’s lawyer Zachary Runyan, who spoke to WDIV, the plaintiff was “sticking up for other people” before his firing.“He went to his boss and said: ‘Martin is saying this about Indian co-workers we have, he’s saying this about people who buy our food, who keep our company open, and I don’t think that should be allowed,’” Runyan remarked to the news station. “And the response to Robert sticking up for other people is he gets fired, which is ridiculous.”Garza’s lawsuit alleges retaliatory dismissal and claims the company maintained a racially hostile work environment. He also says neither Campbell’s nor its human resources department followed up on his report about Bally, leaving him unemployed for 10 months.Campbell’s said in a statement that it was investigating the allegations and had placed Bally on leave for the time being, adding: “If accurate, the comments in the recording are unacceptable. They do not reflect our values and the culture of our company.”Meanwhile, in a separatestatementto Newsweek, another Campbell’s spokesperson denied claims that the meat being used was bioengineered.“We use 100% real chicken in our soups,” the company spokesperson reportedly said. “The chicken meat comes from long-trusted, [US Department of Agriculture] approved … suppliers and meets our high quality standards. All of our soups are made with No Antibiotics Ever chicken meat.“Any claims to the contrary are completely false.”Bally has not publicly commented on the lawsuit, which names him, Aupperle, and the company itself as defendants.Garza’s lawsuit portrays Campbell’s – whose distinctive red and white cans feature in one of Andy Warhol’s most famous 1960s pop artworks – as joining other companies whose employees have verbally dumped on their own products.In 2017, Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei’s deputy chair Eric Xu responded to a question about a new smartwatch by casting doubt on whether the product was even necessary.“I am always confused as to what smartwatches are for when we have smartphones,” Xu was quoted assaying.Infamously, in 1991, the former chair of the Ratner Group jewelry company, Gerald Ratner, publiclycalledits products “total crap”.“People say: ‘How can you sell this for such a low price?’” Ratnersaidat the time. “I say, ‘Because it’s total crap.’”He apologized and explained that he was joking, but business for the Ratner Group was substantially wounded, and 330 Ratner Group shops across the UK and US subsequently closed.Explore more on these topicsUS newsMichiganFood & drink industryFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Not yet, says NvidiaBlake MontgomeryTue 25 Nov 2025 08.20 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 12.24 ESTShareHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, writing to you from an American grocery store, where I’m planning my Thanksgiving pies.In tech, theEuropean Unionis deregulating artificial intelligence; the United States is going even further. The AI bubble has not popped, thanks to Nvidia’s astronomical quarterly earnings, but fears persist. And Meta has avoided a breakup for a similar reason as Google.Regulation rollbackThe hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on AI are overwhelming Europe’s commitment to digital privacy and stringent tech regulation. The EU’s AI Act and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law are being delayed and weakened, respectively. Former Italian prime minister Mario Draghi had warned a year ago thatEuropehad fallen behind the US and China in innovation and was weak in the emerging technologies that would drive future growth, such as AI. Others, including the EU’s economy commissioner, agreed with him.My colleagueJennifer Rankinreports on Brussels’s quest for growth:The plans were part of the commission’s “digital omnibus”, which tries to streamline tech rules including GDPR, the AI Act, the ePrivacy directive and the Data Act.If agreed, the changes to GDPR would make it easier for tech firms to use personal data to train AI models without asking for consent, and try to end “cookie banner fatigue” by reducing the number times internet users have to give their permission to being tracked on the internet.The commission also confirmed the intention to delay the introduction of central parts of the AI Act, which came into force in August 2024 and does not yet fully apply to companies.Read more:European Commission accused of ‘massive rollback’ of digital protectionsMeanwhile, the US is taking things even further in its quest to maintain its lead in artificial intelligence, and is seeking to undo any constraints on the future growth of the AI industry. Members of Congress have included language in the yearly National Defense Authorization Act that would direct the federal government to block state-level AI regulation. AI is not heavily regulated in the US in comparison to Europe or China, but it may soon be even less so. The same measure within the NDAA may also bar the Chinese drone maker DJI, the biggest in the world, from launching new products in the US.Donald Trump drafted an executive order to the same effect last week, and Republicans in Congress proposed a 10-year moratorium on state laws regulating AI earlier this year that failed in a spectacular 99-1 Senate vote. The additions to the act may face a similar avalanche of blowback. On Monday, more than 200 state-level representatives and senatorspublished a letter opposing the measure(pdf).Under the proposed regulation’s terms, the justice department would sue individual states that attempt to rein in AI, likely California and Colorado. Should the act pass, the US would go even further hands-off with its regulation of the emerging technology, not only declining to impose nationwide regulation on the companies producing it but penalizing any state legislation that tries to do so. Critics say such a measure allows AI’s harms to run rampant and unchecked and impinges on state sovereignty; proponents in Silicon Valley say the fewer legislative hurdles they face, the faster they can grow and make money, which they argue is good for the country as well as themselves.Trump’s remarks on his desire to simplify AI regulation in the US are ridiculous. “You can’t go through 50 states. You have to get one approval. Fifty is a disaster. You’ll have one woke state and you’ll have to do all woke,” he said at the US-Saudi Investment Forum last week. “You’ll have a couple of wokesters and you don’t wanna do that. You wanna get the AI done.”What tech to buyThe best early Black Friday deals in the UK on the products we love, from sunrise alarm clocks to heated airersThe 15 best tech gifts in the US, picked by a gadget reviewer who’s used hundredsThe 20+ best Black Friday and Cyber Monday tech deals in the US – so farThe week in AIMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AIAI is changing the relationship between journalist and audience. There is much at stake | Margaret SimonsBubble go pop? Not yet, says NvidiaView image in fullscreenJensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO.Photograph: Ann Wang/ReutersNvidia reported its quarterly earnings last week. They were stellar, as has been the case now for multiple years’ worth of quarterly earnings. Our headline inAugust: “Nvidia sets fresh sales record amid fears of an AI bubble and Trump’s trade wars”. And thismonth: “‘We excel at every phase of AI’: Nvidia CEO quells Wall Street fears of AI bubble amid market selloff”.My colleagueJohana Bhuiyancovered the report:The company surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in nearly every regard, as it has for multiple quarters in a row, a sign that the financially enormous AI boom is not slowing down. Nvidia reported $1.30 in diluted earnings per share on $57.01bn in total revenues, beating investor expectations of $1.26 in earnings per share on $54.9bn in revenue. Sales are up 62% year-over-year. The company reported $51.2bn in revenue from datacenter sales, beating expectations of $49bn. The company is also projecting fourth- quarter revenue of around $65bn; analysts had predicted the company would issue a guidance of $61bn.“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” said CEO Jensen Huang. “From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI from pre-training to post-training to inference.”The markets cheered, with stocks worldwide surging in Nvidia’s wake. The chipmaker’s success is persistent; so are fears of an imminent steep crash. As evidence of ongoing uneasiness about the enormous spending on AI infrastructure, the day after Nvidia’s strong results, stocks across the board fell. My colleagueCallum Jonesreported on the market’s deflation:Leading US stock markets fell less than 24 hours after strong results from the chipmaker Nvidia sparked a rally.Wall Street initially rose after Nvidia, the world’s largest public company, reassured investors of strong demand for its advanced datacenter chips. But the relief dissipated, and technology stocks at the heart of the AI boom came under pressure.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 1.6%, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.8% in New York. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite closed down 2.2%.“The people who are selling the semiconductors to help power AI doesn’t alleviate the concerns that some of these hyper-scalers are spending way too much money on building the AI infrastructure,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth. “You have the company that’s benefiting from it, but the others are still spending too much money.”Australia’s social media ban loomsSnapchat to tell 440,000 Australians to prove they’re 16 or accounts will be locked in social media banAustralia’s under-16s social media ban is weeks away. How will it work – and how can I appeal if I’m wrongly banned?What’s really behind Meta’s antitrust victoryView image in fullscreenThe Meta store in Burlingame, CaliforniaPhotograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesMeta defeated a major antitrust lawsuit brought by the US government last week. The logic behind the win echoes the same rationale put forward by the judge in another tech giant’s monopoly case, US vs Google. Both judges said that the landscape in the technology industry had changed quite a lot since the trials began.In recent years, meaningful competition has emerged in Google and Meta’s spheres of the technology industry, search and social media. For Google, the insurgent competition is ChatGPT and generative AI more broadly. The tech giant has acknowledged that it is in an existential race against its smaller rival, OpenAI. In 2022, Google management called ChatGPT a “code red” for its search business. This David is not fated to win against Goliath, though. Sam Altman recently said Google’s advances in AI would create “temporary economic headwinds” and “rough vibes” for his company.For Meta, the competition is TikTok. Mark Zuckerberg used similar language to Pichai when he described the app’s rapid rise as a “highly urgent” threat to his company’s social networks. Soon after he said that, Meta debuted Reels, its short-form video feed within Instagram.Judge James Boasberg cited the rise of the wildly popular Chinese social media app as particular evidence of competition in the social networking market. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly.” He also chided the FTC for failing to account for the YouTube video platform as meaningful competition. “Even if YouTube is out, including TikTok alone defeats the FTC’s case,” he wrote.As a result of the new competition, Boasberg ruled, Meta will not be forced to sell off Instagram, which it bought for just $1bn in 2012, or WhatsApp, which it purchased in 2104 for $19bn.Read more:Meta wins major US antitrust case and won’t have to break off WhatsApp or InstagramIn September, the US judge presiding over US vs Google authored an opinion similar to Boasberg’s, though different in the key fact that Google lost the case. The government had accused the tech giant of operating an illegal monopoly over online search. Globally, the company controls about 90% of the search market, according to the University of Pennsylvania’sWharton Business School.Google.comis the most popular website in the world. The judge agreed with the government’s assertion. He did not agree that the solution would be forcing Google to sell Chrome.Google will not be forced to divest Chrome, the most popular web browser in the world and likely worth more than Instagram and WhatsApp combined. Generative AI had altered that market permanently, he said, and introduced the kind of competition Google had not seen in decades. OpenAI and others were in a better position to compete with Google than any previous challengers.Read more:How Google dodged a major breakup – and why OpenAI is to thank for itThe wider TechScapeMany prominent Maga personalities on X are based outside US, new tool revealsElon Musk’s Grok AI tells users he is fitter than LeBron James and smarter than Leonardo da Vinci‘It’s hell for us here’: Mumbai families suffer as datacentres keep the city hooked on coalBro boost: women say their LinkedIn traffic increases if they pretend to be menThe Guardian view on crypto’s latest crash: it reveals who pays the price for a failing economyCloudflare outage causes error messages across the internetQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The deal is likely to have involved concessions from either side of the negotiating table, including the union agreeing to call the workers “employee-like”.Among the protections that would be legally enforceable under the new standards is a minimum “safety net” rate of pay of at least $31.30 an hour which would come into effect from 1 July 2026 and increase slightly from 1 January 2027.The safety net would apply to all modes of transport used by delivery drivers, with the rate varying slightly depending on the type of vehicle used.The protections also include new dispute resolution processes, new engagement and feedback mechanisms, representation rights and accident insurance for injured workers.Eric Ireland, a driver in Melbourne who has worked for several platforms, believes the new standards will result in an increase in pay because it means he and his colleagues will get paid even if they have to wait for a restaurant to finish preparing the food.“The peace of mind that you are actually getting paid while you’re on the job … can only be a good thing,” he says.Ireland says while some working conditions have improved since he started delivering food six years ago, pay has not kept up with the cost of living.“I sort of worked out on average I get about $22 an hour before I pay for petrol,” he says. “Sometimes you can earn a lot more than that if you do what they call a ‘quest’, which is doing 10 jobs in a weekend or something.”However, as the workplace relations expert Prof Alex Veen points out, the safety net is different to a “minimum wage” in the way you may typically think of one.The deal does not include penalty rates for things such as working late at night and, Veen says, the minimum hourly rate does not apply to time spent waiting between delivery jobs.“What it materially means for gig workers is that when they’re working in periods of low demand they are unlikely to make that as their hourly pay,” Veen, a lecturer at the University of Sydney’s business school, says.But he says there are many positives to the deal, including clarifying who is responsible for insuring both vehicles and the workers themselves.How will the accident insurance work?The application to the FWC states that workers are responsible for maintaining third-party insurances on the vehicles they use for deliveries, so if they get in an accident and damage another vehicle the delivery platform will not be liable for the cost.On the other hand, Uber Eats and DoorDash will have to organise and pay for personal accident insurance that “provides a reasonable minimum level of cover” for their delivery workers. As Veen points out, that is “obviously open to interpretation”.The TWU says 23 gig workers have been killed in Australia since 2017 and the figure could be higher because some are never reported as workplace deaths.Will customers pay more for food delivery?While Uber Eats and DoorDash are yet to confirm how they plan to fund an increase in operating costs, Veen says the platforms are most likely to pass them on to consumers.“They may try to pass some of the costs on to restaurants and they could take a smaller [profit] margin themselves, although that’s not in their interests to do so,” he says.Dr Michael Rawling, an associate professor who teaches workplace law at the University of Technology Sydney, says there may be a small increase in the price of a takeaway ordered through a third-party delivery app.“In Australia we like to see workers treated fairly and if the consumer knows that then I think they’ll cop a small increase,” he says.Is it really a world first?Rawling agrees the deal is “world leading” and “very significant”.He says while the deal hasn’t been ratified by the FWC, the “major players” who will be affected by the new standard have agreed on its content, which the industrial umpire will factor into its decision.“[Typically] what the parties have actually consented to is a preferred direction for the FWC to go into for that particular matter,” he says.What comes next?The FWC needs to approve the deal before it can come into effect.Prof Andrew Stewart, a workplace relations expert at the Queensland University of Technology, says it is “not a done deal”, especially as the FWC will have to consult with other stakeholders – including other delivery platforms.“Potentially a huge fly in the ointment is that the FWC is going to have to come to a view as to whether the workers are eligible for a minimum standards order,” he says. “Because there’s a perfectly credible argument that the workers are already employees [and not employee-like].”Stewart says if the FWC ruled that food delivery drivers were employees and not “employee-like” this would be a landmark ruling that would likely result in a challenge from the delivery platforms that could go all the way to the high court.He is not ruling out this outcome, even though he says it is more likely the FWC will accept the application as it stands.“I do not want to understate the significance of this deal,” he says. “It is a really important agreement that makes it much more likely we will get a minimum standards order much more quickly than we would if the TWU and the platforms were fighting over the details.”What does this mean for the gig economy more broadly?Overall, Stewart says the agreement on the application brings Australia a lot closer to having a safety net for at least one part of the gig economy.It could also influence future FWC decisions relating to minimum standards. At the moment, the commission is considering similar gig workers in other sectors including package delivery. And the TWU has previously flagged it will submit an application to cover ride-share drivers.Explore more on these topicsGig economyIndustrial relationsAustralian trade unionsBusiness (Australia news)explainersShareReuse this content"

The accolades have come his way but it was different at Stamford Bridge.Lamine Yamal was barely given a kick by Marc Cucurella, who delighted in neutralising his international teammate, and was unable to do anything to make his first meeting with Estêvão Willian live up to expectations.Estêvão outshines Lamine Yamal to show why he is Chelsea’s rare diamond | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThe battle between two of the best youngsters in the world could hardly have been won more emphatically by Chelsea’s boy from Brazil. This was Estêvão seizing his opportunity to prove that the hype is justified.The 18‑year‑old, who is three months older than Lamine Yamal, tore Barça to shreds and it is not an exaggeration to say that the Brazilian looked like Lionel Messi when he scored a goal that will surely go down as one of the most captivating solo efforts inChampions Leaguehistory.No wonder Enzo Maresca did not hesitate to start Estêvão against the champions of Spain. This was the teenager’s fourth goal in his past four starts for Chelsea. Talk about fearless. Talk about making an impact. Estêvão, remember, moved to England only last summer. It would not have been surprising if Chelsea had eased him in gently. Sometimes, though, exceptions have to be made.Chelsea have bet big on Estêvão, paying £52m to sign him from Palmeiras, and they must have felt smug when he put them two up against Barça by rounding off a spectacular run with a firecracker of a shot at Joan García’s near post.It all happened so quickly. Pau Cubarsí was left with twisted blood and Estêvão had the strength to hold off a challenge from Alejandro Balde. Barça did not know where to look. The ball was glued to Estêvão’s feet, even though he was moving at blistering speed, and the shot with his weaker right foot was unloaded before anyone had time to react.Not that Estêvão becoming the third teenager – after Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappé – to score in his first three Champions League starts was the only highlight for Chelsea. They delivered another convincing performance without the injured Cole Palmer and are up to fifth in the standings after putting three past Barça without reply.View image in fullscreenLiam Delap slots home Chelsea’s third goal from close range.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMaresca is building something. Driven on by another outstanding midfield display from Moisés Caicedo, Chelsea overwhelmed Barça. Hansi Flick’s side lost their captain, Ronald Araújo, to a red card at the end of a torrid first half and look increasingly unlikely to finish in the top eight after taking seven points from their first five games.Barça were pallid. An early miss from Ferran Torres, who shot wide after a defensive mix-up, was the best they had to offer. The 37-year-old Robert Lewandowski was ineffective up front, Cucurella relished the task of dealing with Lamine Yamal’s runs down the right and there was never any point when Barça looked capable of dealing with Chelsea’s prowess at dead balls.There was frustration for Enzo Fernández, who had two goals disallowed from set pieces when the game was goalless. Chelsea just had to trust themselves, though. They recovered from a loose start and dominated midfield. Caicedo, Fernández and Reece James were simply too physical for Frenkie de Jong, Fermín López and Eric García.Much of Maresca’s plan was modelled around targeting Barça’s high‑wire offside trap. He deployed the busy, bustling Pedro Neto as the central striker – a surprise move given that João Pedro and Liam Delap were available – and the plan almost worked when Estêvão released the Portuguese forward, whose shot went over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They took a short corner on the right, Alejandro Garnacho found Cucurella and the left-back’s cutback ended with Jules Koundé bundling Neto’s flick into his own net.The concession summed up Barça’s half. They had faded as an attacking force and played with an air of entitlement. The outrage when play was waved on after Lamine Yamal tried to buy a free-kick off Cucurella was absurd. Araújo was booked for dissent and was soon sheepishly removing the captain’s armband after receiving a second yellow for fouling Cucurella just before half-time.Estêvão’s delight at ‘perfect night’ after Chelsea teenager helps see off BarcelonaRead moreBarcelona could not live with Chelsea’s controlled aggression. Marcus Rashford came on for Torres at the start of the second half but nothing changed. Chelsea remained dominant. Andrey Santos came on for Malo Gusto, who was on a booking, and soon had a goal disallowed for offside. Barça had accepted their fate. The challenges were feeble and they were in trouble when a turnover in midfield in the 55th minute led to Chelsea doubling their lead.The record books will, of course, show an assist for James got an assist. Really, though, it was all about Estêvão. He took the ball from James, ran at Cubarsí and wriggled into the tiniest of gaps. Balde came across but Estêvão is stronger than he looks. Stamford Bridge erupted when his shot flew into the top corner.Barça were beaten by sheer brilliance. It was 3-0 when Fernández unselfishly squared for Delap and the substitute clipped home his first goal since June. Chelsea cruised. They host Arsenal on Sunday and will know anything is possible with Estêvão in this mood.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueChelseaBarcelonamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Police say Kneeland took his own life.At first, authorities didn’t know the person they were pursuing on the evening of 5 November was Kneeland, initially believing the car he was driving had been stolen. After the driver abandoned the vehicle after a crash, authorities learned during their search that the suspect was Kneeland. His family and friends feared he was in danger of harm as he had sent messages telling them goodbye. They reached out to authorities to locate him.A trooper with theTexasDepartment of Public Safety (DPS) began chasing Kneeland, who was driving a Dodge Charger northbound on the Dallas North Tollway at 10.33pm on 5 November, according to an offense report the agency released on Friday through an open records request. The trooper said Kneeland’s vehicle reached speeds higher than 145 mph but other troopers in body camera footage released by DPS said they believed the chase reached speeds of up to 160mph.The trooper lost track of Kneeland’s car but it was later found around 10.45pm after it had collided with a truck in Frisco, a suburb of Dallas. Troopers said Kneeland’s car was abandoned but they found an empty holster inside, leading them to believe the driver was armed. Troopers and officers didn’t know at that point who the suspect was, initially believing the vehicle might have been stolen.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.At around 11.20pm, DPS troopers and Frisco police department officers were searching for Kneeland in a wooded area and a series of drainage tunnels under a sidewalk. “If you’re in this tunnel, I’m going to send my dog in here. He is going to bite you. This is your last opportunity,” the Frisco officer said.Authorities later fired pepper balls into the tunnels and sent in a drone but did not find Kneeland inside.By 1am on 6 November, authorities had learned the driver was Kneeland and they had briefly detained but not charged his girlfriend, Catalina Mancera. She had driven to the scene of the search area but initially hadn’t told authorities of her connection to Kneeland. Authorities later said Mancera worked with officers to find Kneeland.In other footage, law enforcement officers, while searching the area, discussed that Kneeland was anNFLplayer and that he had texted goodbye to family members. About 30 minutes later, Kneeland’s body was located.Mancera said in a Facebook post on Monday that she still thinks that Kneeland will walk through their front door. “My sweet boy is really gone. The things that I would do just to hold you one more time and tell you how much you mean to me. But now I have you to watch over me and wait for me on the other side. I will see you again,” Mancera wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jennings did not immediately retaliate but once the game was over he approached Moehrig and hit him in the helmet before giving him a shove. Jennings then needed to be held back as the teams left the field.“I was just responding to some childish behavior,” Jennings said.Moehrig said his shot at Jennings was in response to physical play after the whistle and trash talking throughout the game. On Tuesday, theNFLsaid it had suspended Moehrig for onr game without pay for the punch.Christian McCaffrey stars against former team as 49ers beat PanthersRead more“He was pushing me in the back and stuff, so, you know. That’s really all it was,” Moehrig said. “There really isn’t much to it. It was just that, you know what I’m saying? Like I said, I’ll take that one. He wanted to do a little dirty stuff, so … It is what it is man.”Jennings is know for his aggressive blocking and running style. That led to him getting ejected after a scuffle with Arizona cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting last season. But Jennings said he was surprised that Moehrig hit him in a sensitive area.“It was just out of nowhere,” Jennings said. “It’s probably just the history of me playing ball. I play hard. I’m physically stronger than a lot of DBs out there. A lot of things happen in between the whistle with me at least.”San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan called Moehrig’s actions a “cheap shot” and was glad that Jennings didn’t have a more extreme reaction.“I was real proud of Jauan for not losing his mind out there and getting to the sideline,” Shanahan said.Carolina coach Dave Canales said he will talk about the incident with Moehrig.“I’ll get to the bottom of that,” he said. “I want to see what exactly happened. I haven’t had a chance to talk to Tre about that yet. That will be a conversation that I’ll dig into … I’ll have a chance right now to look at the film and see what happened.”Explore more on these topicsNFLSan Francisco 49ersCarolina PanthersUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead it inspired a fashion revolutionTwenty years after the league introduced its controversial policy, many players see it as helping them develop self-expressionBranson WrightTue 25 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 09.13 ESTShareLonzo Ball froze in confusion. The question – “What do you think about theNBAdress code?” – hung in the air for a second before he cracked a sheepish grin.“There’s a dress code?” he said, smiling.Twenty years after the introduction of a rule that once roiled the league and ignited a culture war over image and identity, one of the NBA’s current players didn’t even know it existed.“Now do-rags are flying, along with jerseys and baggy stuff,” said Ball, a point guard for the Cleveland Cavaliers. “I didn’t know we had a dress code. I just knew we had to put something on.”Former NBA commissioner David Stern instituted the dress code, which went into effect at the start of the 2005–06 season. The policy has been relaxed since Adam Silver succeeded Stern in 2014, but the initial rollout – as with most change – came with controversy and pushback.The code required all players to dress in business or conservative attire when arriving and departing games, on the bench when injured, and when conducting official NBA business.Players bristled at the announcement because the policy effectively banned oversized T-shirts, do-rags, jerseys, and other “hip-hop-inspired” attire.The league’s move was widely seen as a critique of Black culture – a policing of expression and a response to the NBA’s discomfort with hip-hop aesthetics that had become inseparable from basketball itself. The backlash was immediate, loud, and deeply personal.Mark Cuban made the Mavericks relevant. But is his legacy rotten? | Lee EscobedoRead moreFor many, it was also a direct attack on Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen Iverson, who became the poster child for whatnotto wear. Iverson, then one of the biggest stars in the league, was known for his tattoos, braids, and baggy gear.In a recent interview onThe Breakfast Club radio show and podcast,Iverson said his influence on other players helped trigger the NBA’s response. “David Stern and the rest of the NBA were like, ‘No,’ because it was all right when I was doing it,” Iverson recalled. “But then everybody else said, ‘OK, if he can do that, we can do this.’ You see Kobe coming in with diamond chains and baggy clothes, and everyone started doing it. Then the league was like, ‘Hold on, we’ve got to do something about that.’”Twenty years later, that moment – once seen as a culture war between the league office and players – has come to represent something far more complicated. Instead of erasing individuality, the rule inadvertently helped create a fashion renaissance that reshaped both the NBA and global style.View image in fullscreenAllen Iverson in a game against Kobe’s Bryant’s Lakers in 2001. Some saw the NBA’s dress code as a rebuke to the 76ers star.Photograph: Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat began as a mandate for “professionalism” evolved into tunnels lined with photographers, endorsement deals with high-fashion brands, and players driving global trends in ways the league never imagined. Former NBA forward Ira Newble,who remains racially conscious, vividly remembers the tension.“Everyone seemed upset and up in arms about the dress code,” Newble, who was playing for the Cavaliers when the ban came in, says. “No one wanted to have a dress code. It was a big deal.”Players were used to traveling in sweats, hoodies, or whatever felt comfortable during long road swings. The style of the time – oversized clothing, long white tees, and baggy jeans – was heavily linked to hip-hop culture.“My style at that time reflected hip-hop culture,” Newble says. “I had the braids and wore baggy clothes. The sentiment among players was that the NBA was trying to take away from the cultural end. Iverson was an influence of that culture. That’s what the controversy was about. It felt as though they were trying to change and get rid of hip-hop culture.”But Newble also recognizes how the moment evolved. “Everything kind of grew in a different direction where hip-hop culture can still be embraced within the dress code,” he says. “So it’s cool to see how it evolved.”Inside the league offices, the intent was different, according to Kathy Behrens, the NBA’s president of social responsibility and player programs.“We felt at the time that it was important for our players to present themselves in a more professional fashion when on league business,” Behrens says. “We were not demanding a suit culture, but we did want to raise the level of how players showed up.”She says the league anticipated pushback, but emphasized it was never meant to sanitize hip-hop expression.“We knew what the goal was, and it had nothing to do with changing our players’ fashion or culture,” she says. “We talked with many players about this change before implementing it.”What the NBA didn’t expect, Behrens admits, was what happened next.“The reality is our players embraced the change very quickly and truly raised the level much higher than we anticipated,” she says. “Pre-game ‘fits’ became a thing. It soon became a competition over who could dress the best. How you dress became a cultural touchpoint.”Two decades later, the league still maintains a dress policy, though it has evolved with changing definitions of “professional attire” and is not as strict as it once was, allowing the players to be more creative with their fashion choices. But the legacy remains.“When the people most impacted by it embrace it the way our players have, you have to feel that it worked as intended,” Behrens says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nelson, now the 76ers’ assistant general manager, can appreciate how the policy unified the league.“So it didn’t affect me either way,” Nelson says. “But it was cool to see the brotherhood, the fraternity of basketball players, move in the same direction, whether we liked it or not.”Nelson laughs at how players have flipped the narrative completely.“You can see now how the personalities are being shown through fashion,” he says. “I have my own style, more old school, more casual. Somebody told me yesterday I dress hip-hop slash front office.”He says players today simply have more tools to showcase their creativity.“These brands, because of social media, take advantage of it,” Nelson says. “If social media was as big back in 2005, we probably would’ve done the same thing. Getting dressed is art. It’s how you express yourself without even speaking.”Few players symbolize that shift more than those in the current era, where tunnel entrances resemble fashion runways and some players are followed by photographers and videographers from the parking garage to the locker room.Take Cavaliers star Darius Garland, considered one of the team’smost fashionable players. He marvels at how far things have come.“The league implemented a dress code 20 years ago – that’s crazy,” Garland says. “Now we can put on our own stuff. We can express ourselves.”View image in fullscreenTim Hardaway Jr arrives for Game 5 of the 2024 NBA finals. Pre-game outfits are often their own fashion shows.Photograph: Adam Hagy/NBAE/Getty ImagesTo Garland, fashion and business are intertwined.“A lot of guys have different avenues of revenue with clothing pieces,” he says. “Guys have Lululemon deals, Armani deals. It’s crazy now. With the dress code not being a dress code anymore, it’s giving us money we can put in our pockets, and it lets us express ourselves.”If only the league had embraced a more relaxed dress policy earlier, says Garland.“Hip-hop culture influences basketball, and basketball influences hip-hop culture,” he says. “Everyone wants to see what athletes are wearing so they can wear it. We are the influencers.”What began as a controversial, racially charged flashpoint has become a cultural engine, embraced by the league, celebrated by players, and followed by millions worldwide.The NBA tried to define professionalism. The players redefined it instead. The dress code did not suppress the culture. It amplified it.Years later, the runway to the locker room, once a battleground, is now one of the most influential stages in global fashion.“You can trace the swag back to [Iverson],” Ball says. “The tattoos, the braids, the baggy stuff. We came a long way from [the NBA] punishing him for expressing himself. Now [hip-hop fashion] is at an all-time high again. We need to give Allen Iverson a lot of respect.”Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According to the seeding arrangements announced by Fifa on Tuesday, seeding will be split into four pots, with the three host countries – the US, Mexico and Canada – taking a spot in pot one.From there the pots are decided by Fifa rankings, with the six as‑yet‑undecided victors of the Uefa and international playoffs in pot four.This ranking system means the world’s top countries will not face each other in the group stage, and the new measure will keep the very best sides apart even further.“To ensure competitive balance, two separate pathways to the semi‑finals have been established,” Fifa said in a statement.“This will ensure that, should they win their groups, the two highest-ranked teams will not meet before the final.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had previously been sent off 13 times but never in a senior international fixture, a record that ran through an astonishing 226 matches.Fifa’s disciplinary code determines that a player should serve “at least three matches or an appropriate period of time for assault, including elbowing, punching, kicking, biting, spitting or hitting an opponent or a person other than a match official”. Under Article 27 of the code, however, the Fifa judicial committee which decides upon disciplinary sanctions has the option to “fully or partially suspend the implementation of a disciplinary measure”.A Fifa statement said: “In line with article 27 of the Fifa Disciplinary Code, the serving of the two remaining matches has been suspended under a one-year probation period. IfCristiano Ronaldocommits another infringement of a similar nature and gravity during the probationary period, the suspension set out in the disciplinary decision shall be deemed automatically revoked and the remaining two matches must be served immediately at the next official match(es) of the Portuguese representative team. This is without prejudice to any additional sanctions imposed for the new infringement.”The three-match suspension is subject to appeal to the Fifa appeal committee.Explore more on these topicsCristiano RonaldoPortugalWorld Cup 2026World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Her hopeful start to the 2025 season had given way to despair as the mental and emotional strain of constant competition, travelling and stress left its mark. The 31-year-old understood that competing would only make things worse and, in September, Svitolina decided to prematurely end her season, citing burnout.The world No 14 is not alone in feeling suffocated by her sport. This has been another year filled with incredible performances and gripping matches, but the past 11 months have also been defined by the physical and mental ailments endured by many of the sport’s stars.Berrettini and Cobolli clinch Davis Cup title for Italy after beating SpainRead moreJack Draper, Zheng Qinwen, Holger Rune and Arthur Fils have been forced off the court owing to significant long-term injuries. Others, such as Ons Jabeur (who has subsequently announced she is pregnant), Daria Kasatkina and Svitolina, felt they had no choice but to step away because of their mental struggles. Being a prominent tennis player comes with significant privilege and wealth, but their challenges are undeniable.Injuries are part of elite sport, where athletes continually push their bodies past their limits in pursuit of success, but many believe that tennis has not done enough to protect its athletes. In recent months, the growing list of absences from the tour has reinvigorated discussion surrounding an old topic: the sport’s long and punishing calendar.This year, the off-season that began on Monday will officially last only five weeks and four days, spanning 24 November until 1 January. Not every male player was in action at the Davis Cup, the final event of the season, but even the bruising 10 and a half month season is longer than most other sports’ campaigns.Complaints about the schedule date back decades and there have been some attempts to tackle the issue over the years. However, fresh ideas do not tend to last long in a fractured sport held together by seven official bodies – the men’s Association ofTennisProfessionals (ATP), the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open. Every organisation fiercely protects its own interests, which do not necessarily align with the players or each another.View image in fullscreenZheng Qinwen is one of the players to have been forced off the court owing to significant long-term injuries.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAIn the meantime, the schedule has actually become even more restrictive in a variety of ways. Many top players contend that the extended 12-day ATP and WTA 1000 events are further wearing them down. Attempts to incentivise more frequent competition through financial and ranking points penalties is also a source of consternation.A lucrative 10th ATP Masters 1000 event in Saudi Arabia will be added to the calendar as early as 2028. Not only is the season long, it is incredibly congested. The picture is also complicated by how the interests of players differ – lower-ranked competitors who lose earlier and play fewer matches each week and earn less money often need more playing opportunities.This is a fraught period in the sport. The Professional Tennis Players’ Association, co-founded by Novak Djokovic, remains in a class action lawsuit with the ATP, WTA, ITF and grand slams, accusing them of functioning as a “cartel” by holding an unfair monopoly over the elite game.At the same time, most of the world’s top-10 players have signed letters and held meetings with representatives of the grand slam tournaments, which are so powerful that they operate according to their own rules and often without input from the players. They have been imploring the grand slams to share a greater proportion of their revenues through prize money and to actually make player benefits contributions. Jannik Sinner, Iga Swiatek and Draper have aired their frustrations publicly.During the ATP Finals just over a week ago, the ATP chair, Andrea Gaudenzi, gave an illuminating press conference, addressing many of these issues. A former player himself, Gaudenzi expressed sympathy for players’ complaints but he insisted that the solution was for them to schedule more intelligently. That is, to focus on the most significant tournaments and ignore the temptation to pursue appearance fees at smaller events or exhibitions.View image in fullscreenThe ATP president, Andrea Gaudenzi, presents Jannik Sinner (right) with the 2025 ATP Finals trophy.Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty ImagesThose who complain about the grind while playing in exhibitions during off weeks are particularly vulnerable to criticism.

The world No 1 will contest at least three lucrative exhibitions in the US and South Korea before the Australian Open in January.Alcaraz is among those players who contend that exhibitions require minimal effort for far more money than most regular tour events, making it logical for them to play in them.Gaudenzi, whose ATP OneVision plan is behind the expansion of the ATP and WTA 1000 events, also made it clear that he has no interest in reducing the length of those events. He believes the revenue generated by the expanded Masters 1000 tournaments, particularly the far greater number of tickets on sale, plainly justifies their increase. It is certainly hypocritical to patronise players for making financially motivated scheduling decisions while maintaining an unpopular tournament format for the same reason.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka holds ice on her head due to high temperatures at Wimbledon earlier this year.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesThe sport’s cluttered, inefficient and broken calendar simply has not changed enough over the past three decades. Ideally, the various governing bodies would combine to tear it down and start again from scratch, making player health a priority with a more logical flow in the scheduling and timing of its events around the world.Other problems to address include ensuring that players are as protected fromextreme weather conditionsand enforcing stricter controls on court speeds, balls and playing conditions.These decisions should be made with greater input from the players, addressing legitimate concerns over their workload while still providing sufficient earning opportunities for the rank-and-file professionals. However, as long as governance of the sport remains so fragmented, nothing will change.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Allianz Arena, Munich. A decade ago, yet a lifetime away forArsenalin the Champions League.That night Arsène Wenger’s team were so shredded ina 5-1 defeatby Bayern Munich that my Guardian colleagueDavid Hytner likened themto “the chicken feed from the lower reaches of the Bundesliga that Bayern routinely gobble up”. It was Arsenal’s joint‑worst result in Europe. And to rub it in, Bayern repeated the trick the following season. Twice:5-1 at home, then5-1 at the Emirates Stadium.Arsenal’s Eberechi Eze finds own plane just above ground level to sink Spurs | Barney RonayRead moreBack then English football wasn’t just off the pace in theChampions Leaguebut in danger of being lapped. Across the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons, only two Premier League teams – Manchester City and Leicester – made it past the last 16. Remember the bloodletting and postmortems? The grasping for reasons why, for all their riches, English teams were struggling in Europe? The endless calls for a winter break?Now look. Arsenal are now the best team in Europe, at least according toClub Elo ratings, based on every team’s results and the strength of their opponents. Bayern, who travel to the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday, are third. And, most astonishingly, 12 Premier League sides are in the top 20.But watching Arsenal’sdismissive victory in the north London derby, during a weekend when Bayern smashed Freiburg 6-2 and Paris Saint-Germain brushed past Le Havre 3-0, a couple of questions bubbled to the surface.First: can we say how much stronger the Premier League is now compared with 2015, when Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were at Real Madrid and Barcelona, and Pep Guardiola was masterminding Bayern’s destruction of Arsenal?View image in fullscreenHarry Kane, who is on a prolific run with Bayern, will present a familiar challenge for Arsenal.Photograph: S Mellar/FC Bayern/Getty ImagesAnd second: could it be better for a team who play in an “easier” league – such as Bayern and PSG – to keep players fresher for the Champions League knockout stages? Or do clubs such as Arsenal and Manchester City benefit from tougher domestic competition?To help, I asked Omar Chaudhuri, the chief intelligence officer at Twenty First Group, which works with leading clubs across Europe, to crunch some numbers. As Chaudhuri points out, a leading Premier League team would expect to win about 66% of games in the top flight. But Twenty First Group’s model, which assesses the quality of 7,000 teams globally based on their results, suggests that figure would rise significantly in other leagues.According to Chaudhuri, clubs such as Arsenal and Manchester City would have a 9% higher win rate if playing in La Liga – and between 13% and 15% in the Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1.“A top Premier League team would expect to win 86 points in the league today,” he says. “If they were playing in La Liga, they would expect to win about 97 points, in Bundesliga 91 points from 34 matches, and in Serie A just over 100 points.”To put that in context, last season Barcelona won the Spanish title with 88 points. Bayern and Napoli won the German and Italian leagues respectively with 82 points apiece.“It’s worth saying how much the Premier League has pulled away,” Chaudhuri says. “Ten years ago the best team in England would have had a similar win rate – ie 66% if playing in La Liga or the Bundesliga, and 6%‑13% higher in Italy and France.”View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice cost Arsenal £105m, an amount far beyond the means of most European rivals.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesMoney talks, of course. It has helped the Premier League to bring in even more of the world’s best players and coaches. But clubs are generally smarter and more professional, too. The more sophisticated owners want more bang for their buck when it comes to player performance and also strive harder to find undervalued players.A final factor is the elite player performance plan, which has supercharged the quality of players coming out of Premier League academies. The days when England were knocked out of the Euros by Iceland certainly seem a long way behind us.And so to the second question: does the success last season of PSG, who breezed to the Ligue 1 title by 19 points and lifted the Champions League, suggest playing in an “easier” league can help to achieve European glory?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Opta’s data insights editor Michael Reid notes that PSG made an average of 4.78 changes to their starting XI between matches last season, more than any other Champions League club, while Inter,who they beat in the final, were third when it came to most rotations.PSG’s top five players in terms of minutes in Europe last season – Willian Pacho, Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes, Vitinha and Marquinhos – played fewer than 53% of the team’s minutes in the league.Meanwhile, Reid notes that Liverpool’s top five players in terms of minutes played in the 2024-25 season were among the highest across Champions League clubs. No wonder they looked so knackered in the spring.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Twenty First GroupBut it is not as simple as that. When Chaudhuri examined the results of the 14 clubs who, since 2016, have averaged at least €300m in revenue, and the interplay between domestic and Champions League success, he found no clear correlation.Bayern, for instance, have won 72% of domestic league fixtures and 71% of Champions League fixtures over the past decade – the best record among the richest 14 clubs. PSG have the same 72% win percentage in Ligue 1 but a 56% win percentage in the Champions League.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Twenty First GroupMeanwhile, in the past four and a half years Inter have a domestic win percentage similar to PSG’s and Bayern’s – but they also have a less impressive win percentage in the Champions League over the same period. In other words, a “softer” domestic schedule doesn’t seem to have helped.Finally, the fact Premier League clubs also have had vastly different win rates in the Champions League, ranging from more than 60% for Liverpool and Manchester City to less than 50% for Spurs and Manchester United, further suggests the quality of the squad and how well a club spend their vast revenues matter most.For those still unconvinced, Chaudhuri offers this thought experiment. “If Manchester City were relegated to the Championship tomorrow and retained their entire squad, we wouldn’t expect it to make that much difference to their Champions League performance,” he says. “Notwithstanding the obvious practical challenges regarding midweeks.”It is hard to argue with that. Or the fact that Arsenal v Bayern is not only one of the most mouthwatering clashes of the season so far but a stark reminder of how much football’s power balance has shifted since 2015.Explore more on these topicsArsenalBayern MunichChampions LeagueEuropean club footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Eddie Howe had cautioned his players that Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang was “as good as ever” and would need to be “controlled” but, ultimately, the visitors proved powerless to prevent the 36-year-old transforming both the match and Marseille’sChampions Leagueambitions.While Aubameyang fulfilled the soaring expectations of a raucously loud audience at a stupendously designed, incredibly atmospheric arena, Howe’s team started brightly before taking a wrong turn. They ended up mugged in the manner of naive tourists who had wandered into the wrong arrondissement of this beguiling yet sometimes brutal city.Estêvão wonder goal lights up Chelsea’s statement win over 10-man BarcelonaRead moreAlthough Newcastle retain genuine hopes of advancement into the knockout phase, their persistent travel sickness – they have won away once since April – dictates that unwanted playoff involvement may yet be required.“That was particularly painful,” Howe said. “We’d worked ourselves into a strong position but 10 minutes at the start of the second half cost us. It’s a big disappointment because we played so well in the first half. There’s a big feeling of frustration. We dealt well with the hostile atmosphere but we didn’t react well to their first goal. It was a concentration lapse. We’re bruised but we’ll come back better.”Harvey Barnes is far too talented to have spent so much of his Newcastle career warming the bench, but here Howe hit upon a solution as to how to force two into one and accommodate both his left wingers, Barnes and Anthony Gordon, in the starting XI.It involved that duo morphing into a front two in a 3-5-2 formation lacking the £70m Germany striker Nick Woltemade. Yet if Howe was happy to rotate the initially benched Woltemade, Sandro Tonali enjoys virtually undroppable status on Tyneside.Sure enough, the Italy midfielder soon proved his worth by accelerating forward and breaking theMarseillelines before watching Gordon nudge his cut‑back in the direction of Barnes. All that remained was for Newcastle’s man of the moment to score his third goal in two games by lashing a 10‑yard, left-foot shot beyond Geronimo Rulli.Barnes’s double had undone Manchester City in the Premier League last Saturday and now he had Roberto De Zerbi’s team firmly on the back foot as Newcastle initially pressed their hosts high and hard. Marseille’s Pierre-Emile Højbjerg performed wonders to clear Malick Thiaw’s header off the line.Howe’s only problem was that, not for the first time, his players could not possibly sustain such intensity and, almost incrementally, their hosts began dominating possession.View image in fullscreenMason Greenwood gets off a shot in his first match against a Premier League team since leaving Manchester United.Photograph: Guillaume Horcajuelo/EPAMarseille also started creating chances. One of the more notable involved Mason Greenwood, the Manchester United outcast turned Ligue 1’s leading scorer, playing in Aubameyang. The former Arsenal striker controlled the ball on his chest before swivelling imperiously and forcing Nick Pope into a decent save.Greenwood was facing Premier League opposition for the first time since leaving Old Trafford and his increasingly clever attacking link play represented a key reason why Newcastle’s lead always seemed fragile.Suddenly Howe’s team were playing on the counterattack but that was not necessarily an entirely bad thing for an XI possessing such petrifying pace on the break. As if to prove that point, Gordon showed Argentina’s Leonardo Balderdi and his co-defenders a clean pair of heels before forcing Rulli into a fine save following a through ball from the recalled, and impressive, Joe Willock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionNot that Willock or his teammates would prove exactly flawless. An extraordinary opening to the second half from De Zerbi’s side ruthlessly exposed Newcastle’s defensive fault-lines as the Stade Vélodrome dared to dream of springtime European involvement once more.First, just 18 seconds into the new half, Aubameyang connected with a long ball from the 17-year-old Darryl Bakola and the soon to be heavily criticised Pope was left stranded after inexplicably rushing off his line.Aubameyang duly delighted in rounding the visiting keeper and shooting expertly into an empty net but the extreme tightness of the angle underlined the sheer, and undimmed, quality of his finishing ability.If that was a sublime equaliser, Aubameyang was not quite done yet. Having taking the briefest of breathers while Barnes saw another “goal” disallowed, correctly, for offside, the veteran resumed his rescue mission.This time the Gabon forward received some constructive help from Timothy Weah – son of George – down the right. More specifically he made the most of Weah’s cross courtesy of an instinctive near‑post half‑volley past Pope.Although Willock’s drive subsequently stretched Rulli – his head now swathed in enormous white bandages after Dan Burn accidentally stood on his skull – to the limit Newcastle had been thoroughly dissected by a striker threatening to redefine the term “evergreen”.“I’m feeling great, even if I’m 36,” Aubameyang said after ambling off to a standing ovation. “I want to play more Champions League games and score more goals.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueMarseilleNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Seeing the result, they played not to make mistakes instead of doing what we had to do. They tried to do it. Maybe with the players who played regularly, maybe they would have had [more] confidence.”The defeat leaves City on 10 points with Real Madrid up next. “Now it’s Leeds and we have still three games [in theChampions Leaguephase] and we will see what happens,” Guardiola said.Beyond his tinkering, the wider truth is that City are no relentless winning-machine as they once were. He offered the normal platitudes about Leverkusen being tough opponents, then retained only Nico González as the No 6. Guardiola’s formation had Tijjani Reijnders and Rico Lewis as the attacking midfield pair behind a frontline of Oscar Bobb, Omar Marmoush, and Savinho.It was a centre-back – Nathan Aké – who went close when torching a shot at goal from a Reijnders corner on the left: Mark Flekken somehow beat the ball away from bulging the goalkeeper’s top left corner.This outing of the many contenders to be Guardiola’s first-choice next featured the understudy defender Abdukodir Khusanov, who skipped forward from right-back and curved the ball in for Marmoush who could not convert.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Grimaldo fires Bayer Leverkusen into a surprise lead.Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersThe ongoing absence of Rodri means City are too easily got at via attacks the peerless midfielder often spies and stops at infancy. So it was that Leverkusen cruised along their left, pinged the ball over, and Ernest Poku unloaded – Rayan Aït-Nouri’s sliding block was heroic and City were warned. As they were, again, when one moment Khusanov was nabbing the ball from Malik Tillman before Reijnders dawdled in Leverkusen’s area, and the visitors broke.Suddenly Poku was being grappled to the ground in City’s box by Aït-Nouri, in what looked a case for a penalty – yet while Kasper Hjulmand and his men were convinced, the referee, João Pinheiro, was not.Now, however, Guardiola’s near‑wholesale reshuffle of the team backfired.City were caught, centrally, before the ball was swept right, again, to Ibrahim Maza. The cross twisted the rearguard around, Christian Kofane touched back to Alejandro Grimaldo, and the captain drove past James Trafford into the right corner.Any side can concede anytime and the play to do against Guardiola’s City has always been the counter-surge. Yet since last season it has occurred too often for his liking, while there is a bluntness in front of goal when Haaland does not score or is on the bench as he remained at the break. Factor in how Foden’s paltry four goals are second to the Norwegian’s 19 and him being a replacement as well and you could see how their manager might consider introducing one or both soon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bobb and Reijnders each ran in and shot and each time Flekken repelled. They offered a glimmer of what was required – but only that.For the second half, Guardiola made his move. On came Nico O’Reilly for Aït‑Nouri, Jérémy Doku for Bobb, and Foden for Lewis. But it failed miserably, as Leverkusen scored again due to further iffy defending.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Grimaldo scores the opener for Bayer Leverkusen.Photograph: Philip Bryan/ShutterstockFrom the right, Maza again had copious time to spiral the ball over, Patrik Schick rose and got ahead of the dozing Aké and directed a header beyond Trafford to the keeper’s left.Instantly the camera moved to Haaland who, warming up, was dismayed and, after Savinho spooned over and a Foden effort went for a corner, Guardiola signalled for the striker and Rayan Cherki to strip off.They entered on 65 minutes for Marmoush and Khusanov, cheered on as the cavalry the City faithful hoped they would prove. Instantly Haaland was rising to head at goal: he missed but you felt, at last, those in blue were potent.Further evidence was a classic Haaland stampede forward that had Flekken diving at his feet. City dominated the closing phase – a Cherki dribble claimed a corner but though Haaland was found he, as with his teammates all evening, could find no answer.“We are so happy with this win but also the character we showed,” Hjulmand said. Leverkusen’s head coach was right to be proud.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityBayer Leverkusenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Cody Gakpo described the 3-0 reverse at home to Sean Dyche’s team as a “kind of embarrassment”.World Cup 2026 draw to adopt tennis-style system for the four top seedsRead moreLiverpool host PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday and Slot revealed their predicament has stunned the entire club. Asked to describe the situation, the Dutchman replied: “Ridiculous, almost. Something I didn’t expect to be in, not at any club I worked at let alone if you are the manager ofLiverpool. That is unbelievable.“It is unexpected for the club, for me, for everyone, but we are also working at a club that if you ever needed to face this maybe this is the best club to face it because the harder it gets at a club like this more we are together, the more we are trying to do the things Liverpool usually achieves.”Slot cancelled an appearance at the Northern Football Writers’ Association awards ceremony in Manchester on Sunday to spend more time working on a solution to Liverpool’s collapse in form. He had been due to collect the association’s award for manager of the year.“I don’t find it that difficult to stay calm, it’s in my character,” the 47-year-old manager said. “Most people would describe me as a calm person. These situations, it’s not really nice is it? It’s not nice to lose, especially at such a club like Liverpool.“To be honest, I didn’t expect myself to be in this situation with the way we go about things tactically and the quality of players we have. You would never have expected us to have lost so much. You can use facts and figures, you can say it’s the sixth match we’ve lost out of seven in Premier League and I can say in the last four matches we’ve lost two, and in the Champions League we’ve won three. But it’s lower than the level expected at Liverpool. For sure I take the responsibility and I feel guilty for it.”View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s home defeat against Nottingham Forest extended their miserable run.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockDespite winning the Premier League title in his debut season, Slot claimed that he has to prove himself every day at Liverpool. “You cannot say: ‘We won the league’, or ‘We did this or that’ and now it’s OK,” he said. “If you work at this level the next game is always the most important and you have to prove yourself every single time.“That is for me, for the players and that is what we like about working in this environment – that you can never rest and you always have to keep going, especially if things don’t go well. I don’t know if I have to prove myself to the fans as well as I have to prove myself to myself and the players and to everyone involved in the football club.”Virgil van Dijk said Liverpool were“in a mess”and questioned whether every player was taking responsibility for poor results in the wake of the Forest defeat. Gakpo insisted the captain’s message was taken on board by the rest of the dressing room.“After the game on Saturday it was a kind of embarrassment because we lost 3-0 at home in front of our own fans,” the forward said.“In the days after that we were … I don’t want to say angry, but we tried to speak together and be honest with each other about what we have to do to perform better on the pitch. We also know we have to stick together.“Everybody is aware we have to take responsibility on and off the pitch. This was a conversation you have with a teammate. It wasn’t really a ‘meeting meeting’ but we are aware we have to take responsibility, that we have to do better with certain things on the pitch. That’s what we spoke about. We are honest because otherwise there’s no point in speaking.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

So far in the Frauen Bundesliga, Germany’s top flight, there have been a reported seven ACL injuries 10 games into the current campaign. In the men’s Bundesliga, meanwhile, there have been three such injuries.WSL concerned by Sky broadcast slots after low TV audience figures for derbyRead moreAmong those to have suffered the injury is the Bayern Munich midfielder Lena Oberdorf. The Germany international recovered from an ACL injury to start this season and played six matches before rupturing the same ligament in the same knee. The DFB has implemented several measures to try to limit the amount of ACL injuries sustained by male and female players, including “training formats for medical staff and content on injury prevention in coach education” and “a scientifically supervised test battery with individual training recommendations”.ACL injuries are prevalent across the women’s game with a reported seven players enduring one in England’s Women’s Super League already this season. Among them is Michelle Agyemang, whoruptured an ACLduring England’s 3-0 friendly win over Australia last month. And according to ACL Women Football Club, a social media account that collates information on the injuries in the sport via research and club announcements, France’s Première Ligue has recorded six ACL issues and Italy’s Serie A Femminile two so far this season. None have been recorded in Spain’s Liga F.ACL injuries have become more common in the women’s game than in the men’s, leading to studies into the reasons. Fifa is funding research into discovering if hormonal changes impact the likelihood of the injury occurring in women.Saket Tibrewal is a consultant trauma and orthopaedic knee surgeon at Cromwell hospital in London. He conducts three to four ACL surgeries a week and says medical professionals do not yet have answers regarding the higher rate among female players.View image in fullscreenKatie Reid will miss the rest of the season for Arsenal after rupturing an ACL.Photograph: Izzy Poles/AMA/Getty Images“We are still in the infancy of really understanding this,” Tibrewal said. “I think the reason for that is women’s football has exploded on a professional level over the last few years. Five years ago there were probably the same amount of injuries but people weren’t aware of it. I think that it is now so much more mainstream we are seeing it a lot more.“The biomechanics of women are very different to men, in terms of muscle strength and landing mechanics. Women’s bone anatomy is also smaller than men’s. Where the ACL goes in, it is in the middle of the knee; we call it the notch. Women seem to have smaller notches; is that a reason to cause impediment or [more] force through it? We don’t know, but it’s something we are looking at.”The Chelsea and England midfielder Keira Walsh recently said the increasingly busy schedule that female players have to adhere to could be another factor. “Maybe sometimes we do play too many games in a congested fixture schedule. There’s not enough recovery time,” said Walsh. “You can do the research, but ultimately you need to listen to the ones going through it and how we can best find the solutions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Estêvão, who joinedChelseafrom Palmeiras for £52m last summer, convincingly won his battle with Barca’s Lamine Yamal and stole the limelight when he put Enzo Maresca’s side 2-0 up early in the second half.Estêvão outshines Lamine Yamal to show why he is Chelsea’s rare diamond | Jonathan WilsonRead more“I don’t really have any words,” the Chelsea winger said. “It was the perfect night. It was all very quick. It was such a special goal in my career for me and I hope to score many more.“It was the most special moment of my career. I’m so happy my family were here. From the moment I arrived I felt such a connection for the fans. I’m so happy I can score for them and make them happy.”Estêvão is only the third teenager – after Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappé – to score in each of his first three Champions League starts. But Maresca, whose side rose to fifth in the standings, sought to play down comparisons with Lionel Messi.“Estêvão needs to relax, enjoy his football,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “Him and Lamine, if you start to talk about Messi and Ronaldo, it’s too much pressure for young boys like them. It’s too much for them.”Chelsea took the lead through an own-goal from Jules Koundé and rounded off the scoring through Liam Delap. Barça were outplayed and were reduced to 10 men when Ronald Araújo received a second yellow just before half-time.Chelsea are unbeaten in six matches in all competitions before hosting Arsenal on Sunday. Maresca plans to give his players two days off before ramping up preparations for the Premier League pacesetters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The manager is under mounting pressure after Spurs’4-1 derby humiliationat Arsenal on Sunday, a result that extended a troubling run.Tottenham have won three of 11 matches in all competitions since the end of September and it has been as much about the lack of spark and identity in many of the performances. It was especially so against Arsenal when Frank set up in a 5-4-1 formation and watched his team fail to lay a glove on their rivals.Frank can afford to lose at PSG but sense of foreboding now clings to SpursRead moreFrank made it clear that he would not run from the debacle after he arrived in France with his players for their daunting Champions League assignment atParis Saint-Germainon Wednesday night. He has gone through the footage of it in forensic detail, seeking uncomfortable truths and answers. But now, he insisted, was not a time for self-doubt. As Spurs enter a defining spell, it was all about the response. After PSG, they face Fulham (home) and Newcastle (away) before taking on Frank’s previous club, Brentford, at home.“Part of taking this job was to have the challenges,” he said. “Part of that is to manage those setbacks and learn and move on. One thing I’m 1,000% sure of … I know how to build a team, I know how to build a club and we will do that.“The big thing is how we learn from the bad spells. That’s when we also can see when we go 1-0 down – how do we react as a team? The best teams just continually move on. They still run hard, they still do the same thing. There’s no doubt in that.”Frank has talked, grudgingly, about how Arsenal are years ahead of Spurs because of the continuity they have enjoyed under Mikel Arteta, and he applied the point to PSG and Luis Enrique, who endured some tough moments during his first season at the club in 2023-24. Luis Enrique’s team even made an unconvincing start in theChampions Leaguelast time out before hitting their stride and winning the competition. “This is his third season,” Frank said.“His first season … he had to take a lot of battles and he also turned everything around from playing with the biggest players in Europe to less stars; very determined players that play for the team.“He created one of the best teams in the world by making those changes. Even last year, they were close to getting knocked out of the Champions League. It’s marginal sometimes.”Frank said “the biggest thing to focus on” when he took over at Spurs in the summer was the defence. “Because no team wins anything if they can’t defend.” The most strident criticism of Frank has been about the lack of chance creation, which he accepted was valid. But as he stressed that his teams had always scored goals, he maintained that the shortcomings against Arsenal were not because of the formation but rather the lack of aggression in the duels.“The most disappointing thing was that we were not able to compete,” Frank said. “We had 53 situations where it was like a duel, [a] second-ball situation, where either Arsenal went long or we went long. We came out on top on 17 of those and lost 36. If you don’t do that … it is basic, then it’s very difficult to win a football match.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After taking England to the World Cup final in 2019, Jones’s contract wasfurther extended in early 2020through to 2023 by Sweeney before he was sacked in late 2022.Before Jones, Stuart Lancaster wasinitially appointed on an interim basisbut was appointed full-time after the 2012 Six Nations on a four-year deal. In October 2014, however, Lancaster was given anew long-term contract until 2020, only for England to bomb at their home World Cup in 2015, prompting his exit.Borthwick’s stock has never been higher as head coach after finishing 2025 with victory over Argentina on Sunday. The 46-year-old came under pressure in 2024 after a series of narrow defeats left England ranked seventh in the world but having won every match since beginning 2025 with a defeat in Dublin, there is optimism he will end England’s five-year wait for a Six Nations title next year.“We obviously back this coaching group and are really happy with it,” said Sweeney. “We haven’t had those conversations now, and we are not planning to in the foreseeable future, no. His contract goes through to 2027. We are obviously delighted with the direction it is going in.“We actually saw it in 2024. It’s easy with hindsight now, but those narrow losses in 24, we knew the trajectory the team was on. Narrow loss to Australia, the loss to New Zealand that could have gone the other way. I think what you’ve seen this year with the depth that the squad is building, the style of play he is developing, we are really happy with that. We haven’t got into any discussions about post-27.”Sweeney was speaking after the release of the RFU’s latest annual report which shows a net loss of £1.9m for the financial year after generating the second-highest revenue in its history. The accounts show a far more secure picture than the previous year’s which reported losses of £42m – largely due to fewer home fixtures because of the World Cup. Last year’s report prompteda scandalover Sweeney’s £358,000 bonus thattook his earnings to £1.1m. The latest accounts show that Sweeney was paid £702,000, down £40,000 on his previous basic salary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He insisted that staying remains the RFU’s “plan A” but again warned other options are on the table if ­Richmond council rules against the union. Wembley is understood to be among those options while ­Birmingham City haveunveiled plans for a new stadiumand expressed an ­interest in hosting rugby.The RFU’s preference is to stay at Twickenham but,as revealed by the Guardian, the union was dealt a blow when Richmond council decreed that the limit of three non-sporting events – and only one not on a Saturday – must remain. Licensing and planning applications are run in parallel and the RFU will still make a planning application next year and, if successful, reapply for a new licence.“I met with Richmond a couple of weeks ago,” said Sweeney. “Good conversations, good dialogue. Very positive. They want to support us in terms of the direction we’re going in but it’s a process that’s on track. We’ve laid out very clearly for them what it means for us. Those events are essential for us if we’re to reinvest in the stadium and the stadium needs reinvestment to keep pace with other stadiums. It’s not a grandstanding negotiation tactic.“And our plan A is to stay. We contribute over £90m to the local economy and well over £100m to the greater London economy. They want us to stay here but purely from a financial validity point, it’s essential we get those extra events. I’m confident. You can’t put all your eggs in one basket, so you have to have a plan B and even a plan C and D which are viable.“We’re confident with the plans that we’ve got in place. We’re confident we can attract all the rugby events we want here and sufficient entertainment events as well. If we get those 15, it’s a very financially viable model.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickRugby Football UnionSport politicsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Young threw for just 169 yards with one touchdown and one interception as Carolina missed a chance to move into sole possession of first place in the NFC South.The 49ers were conservative in the second half after Purdy’s rough start to the game, relying mostly on McCaffrey and short passes. The strategy worked with McCaffrey scoring on a 12-yard run to make it 17-3 before the Niners added a field goal by Matt Gay.Young did connect on one big play, a 29-yard TD pass to Tetairoa McMillan, but Carolina couldn’t convert on two-point attempt. Young then threw his second interception of the game to Ji’Ayir Brown with Carolina in scoring position with a 20-9 deficit.McCaffrey, who has transformed the 49ers’ offense since being acquired in October 2022, finished with 89 yards rushing and 53 receiving for his 10th 100-yard game of the season – two shy of the franchise record he set in 2023.The 49ers gave the ball to McCaffrey on the first five plays of the game, leading to the first opening-drive TD of the season against Carolina. Purdy connected on a 12-yard pass to Jauan Jennings for the score.The two offenses did nothing after that. Purdy became the first player to throw three interceptions – Jaycee Horn got two of them – in the first-half this season, but the Panthers turned those into only three points. Young ruined one drive when he was intercepted by Brown on a first-down play from the one-yard line. The teams traded field goals and the Niners led 10-3 at the half.Explore more on these topicsNFLSan Francisco 49ersCarolina PanthersUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Overall, the report expects the UK economy to add 2.3m jobs by 2035, but unevenly distributed.The findings stand in contrast to otherrecentresearchsuggesting AI will affect highly skilled, technical occupations such as software engineering and management consultancy more than trades and manual work.Research from King’s College published in Octoberestimatedthat “higher-paying firms” suffered job losses of roughly 9.4% between 2021 and 2025, with much of this period falling after the release of ChatGPT in late 2022.The UK governmentlistsmanagement consultants, psychologists and legal professionals among the occupations “most exposed to AI”, whereas “sports players”, “roofers” and “bricklayers” are less likely to be replaced.Last week, the law firm Clifford Chance revealed it waslaying off10% of business services staff at its London base – about 50 roles – attributing the change partly to AI. The head of PwC also publicly walked back plans to hire 100,000 people between 2021 and 2026, saying “the world is different” and artificial intelligence had changed its hiring needs.Jude Hillary, one of the report’s authors, said that NFER’s work – which is based on longer-term economic modelling of the UK labour market – suggests predictions about AI-driven job losses may be premature.He suggested layoffs attributed to the uptake of AI may be driven by a sluggish UK economy, factors such as rising national insurance costs and employers being risk-averse.“There’s this general uncertainty about where things are going, how long it takes to improve. There’s lots of talk about AI and automation without any real substance about it. Lots of employers are worried about it,” Hillary said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This latter, he said, was most concerning, as it would be difficult for people who lost lower-skilled jobs to reskill appropriately in a changing economy.“The additional jobs that we’re getting in the labour market tend to be professional and associate professionals … Displaced workers, the one to three million that we talk about in our report, face significant barriers to get back into the labour market,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingJob lossesEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Not yet, says NvidiaBlake MontgomeryTue 25 Nov 2025 08.20 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 12.24 ESTShareHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, writing to you from an American grocery store, where I’m planning my Thanksgiving pies.In tech, theEuropean Unionis deregulating artificial intelligence; the United States is going even further. The AI bubble has not popped, thanks to Nvidia’s astronomical quarterly earnings, but fears persist. And Meta has avoided a breakup for a similar reason as Google.Regulation rollbackThe hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on AI are overwhelming Europe’s commitment to digital privacy and stringent tech regulation. The EU’s AI Act and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law are being delayed and weakened, respectively. Former Italian prime minister Mario Draghi had warned a year ago thatEuropehad fallen behind the US and China in innovation and was weak in the emerging technologies that would drive future growth, such as AI. Others, including the EU’s economy commissioner, agreed with him.My colleagueJennifer Rankinreports on Brussels’s quest for growth:The plans were part of the commission’s “digital omnibus”, which tries to streamline tech rules including GDPR, the AI Act, the ePrivacy directive and the Data Act.If agreed, the changes to GDPR would make it easier for tech firms to use personal data to train AI models without asking for consent, and try to end “cookie banner fatigue” by reducing the number times internet users have to give their permission to being tracked on the internet.The commission also confirmed the intention to delay the introduction of central parts of the AI Act, which came into force in August 2024 and does not yet fully apply to companies.Read more:European Commission accused of ‘massive rollback’ of digital protectionsMeanwhile, the US is taking things even further in its quest to maintain its lead in artificial intelligence, and is seeking to undo any constraints on the future growth of the AI industry. Members of Congress have included language in the yearly National Defense Authorization Act that would direct the federal government to block state-level AI regulation. AI is not heavily regulated in the US in comparison to Europe or China, but it may soon be even less so. The same measure within the NDAA may also bar the Chinese drone maker DJI, the biggest in the world, from launching new products in the US.Donald Trump drafted an executive order to the same effect last week, and Republicans in Congress proposed a 10-year moratorium on state laws regulating AI earlier this year that failed in a spectacular 99-1 Senate vote. The additions to the act may face a similar avalanche of blowback. On Monday, more than 200 state-level representatives and senatorspublished a letter opposing the measure(pdf).Under the proposed regulation’s terms, the justice department would sue individual states that attempt to rein in AI, likely California and Colorado. Should the act pass, the US would go even further hands-off with its regulation of the emerging technology, not only declining to impose nationwide regulation on the companies producing it but penalizing any state legislation that tries to do so. Critics say such a measure allows AI’s harms to run rampant and unchecked and impinges on state sovereignty; proponents in Silicon Valley say the fewer legislative hurdles they face, the faster they can grow and make money, which they argue is good for the country as well as themselves.Trump’s remarks on his desire to simplify AI regulation in the US are ridiculous. “You can’t go through 50 states. You have to get one approval. Fifty is a disaster. You’ll have one woke state and you’ll have to do all woke,” he said at the US-Saudi Investment Forum last week. “You’ll have a couple of wokesters and you don’t wanna do that. You wanna get the AI done.”What tech to buyThe best early Black Friday deals in the UK on the products we love, from sunrise alarm clocks to heated airersThe 15 best tech gifts in the US, picked by a gadget reviewer who’s used hundredsThe 20+ best Black Friday and Cyber Monday tech deals in the US – so farThe week in AIMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AIAI is changing the relationship between journalist and audience. There is much at stake | Margaret SimonsBubble go pop? Not yet, says NvidiaView image in fullscreenJensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO.Photograph: Ann Wang/ReutersNvidia reported its quarterly earnings last week. They were stellar, as has been the case now for multiple years’ worth of quarterly earnings. Our headline inAugust: “Nvidia sets fresh sales record amid fears of an AI bubble and Trump’s trade wars”. And thismonth: “‘We excel at every phase of AI’: Nvidia CEO quells Wall Street fears of AI bubble amid market selloff”.My colleagueJohana Bhuiyancovered the report:The company surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in nearly every regard, as it has for multiple quarters in a row, a sign that the financially enormous AI boom is not slowing down. Nvidia reported $1.30 in diluted earnings per share on $57.01bn in total revenues, beating investor expectations of $1.26 in earnings per share on $54.9bn in revenue. Sales are up 62% year-over-year. The company reported $51.2bn in revenue from datacenter sales, beating expectations of $49bn. The company is also projecting fourth- quarter revenue of around $65bn; analysts had predicted the company would issue a guidance of $61bn.“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” said CEO Jensen Huang. “From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI from pre-training to post-training to inference.”The markets cheered, with stocks worldwide surging in Nvidia’s wake. The chipmaker’s success is persistent; so are fears of an imminent steep crash. As evidence of ongoing uneasiness about the enormous spending on AI infrastructure, the day after Nvidia’s strong results, stocks across the board fell. My colleagueCallum Jonesreported on the market’s deflation:Leading US stock markets fell less than 24 hours after strong results from the chipmaker Nvidia sparked a rally.Wall Street initially rose after Nvidia, the world’s largest public company, reassured investors of strong demand for its advanced datacenter chips. But the relief dissipated, and technology stocks at the heart of the AI boom came under pressure.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 1.6%, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.8% in New York. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite closed down 2.2%.“The people who are selling the semiconductors to help power AI doesn’t alleviate the concerns that some of these hyper-scalers are spending way too much money on building the AI infrastructure,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth. “You have the company that’s benefiting from it, but the others are still spending too much money.”Australia’s social media ban loomsSnapchat to tell 440,000 Australians to prove they’re 16 or accounts will be locked in social media banAustralia’s under-16s social media ban is weeks away. How will it work – and how can I appeal if I’m wrongly banned?What’s really behind Meta’s antitrust victoryView image in fullscreenThe Meta store in Burlingame, CaliforniaPhotograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesMeta defeated a major antitrust lawsuit brought by the US government last week. The logic behind the win echoes the same rationale put forward by the judge in another tech giant’s monopoly case, US vs Google. Both judges said that the landscape in the technology industry had changed quite a lot since the trials began.In recent years, meaningful competition has emerged in Google and Meta’s spheres of the technology industry, search and social media. For Google, the insurgent competition is ChatGPT and generative AI more broadly. The tech giant has acknowledged that it is in an existential race against its smaller rival, OpenAI. In 2022, Google management called ChatGPT a “code red” for its search business. This David is not fated to win against Goliath, though. Sam Altman recently said Google’s advances in AI would create “temporary economic headwinds” and “rough vibes” for his company.For Meta, the competition is TikTok. Mark Zuckerberg used similar language to Pichai when he described the app’s rapid rise as a “highly urgent” threat to his company’s social networks. Soon after he said that, Meta debuted Reels, its short-form video feed within Instagram.Judge James Boasberg cited the rise of the wildly popular Chinese social media app as particular evidence of competition in the social networking market. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly.” He also chided the FTC for failing to account for the YouTube video platform as meaningful competition. “Even if YouTube is out, including TikTok alone defeats the FTC’s case,” he wrote.As a result of the new competition, Boasberg ruled, Meta will not be forced to sell off Instagram, which it bought for just $1bn in 2012, or WhatsApp, which it purchased in 2104 for $19bn.Read more:Meta wins major US antitrust case and won’t have to break off WhatsApp or InstagramIn September, the US judge presiding over US vs Google authored an opinion similar to Boasberg’s, though different in the key fact that Google lost the case. The government had accused the tech giant of operating an illegal monopoly over online search. Globally, the company controls about 90% of the search market, according to the University of Pennsylvania’sWharton Business School.Google.comis the most popular website in the world. The judge agreed with the government’s assertion. He did not agree that the solution would be forcing Google to sell Chrome.Google will not be forced to divest Chrome, the most popular web browser in the world and likely worth more than Instagram and WhatsApp combined. Generative AI had altered that market permanently, he said, and introduced the kind of competition Google had not seen in decades. OpenAI and others were in a better position to compete with Google than any previous challengers.Read more:How Google dodged a major breakup – and why OpenAI is to thank for itThe wider TechScapeMany prominent Maga personalities on X are based outside US, new tool revealsElon Musk’s Grok AI tells users he is fitter than LeBron James and smarter than Leonardo da Vinci‘It’s hell for us here’: Mumbai families suffer as datacentres keep the city hooked on coalBro boost: women say their LinkedIn traffic increases if they pretend to be menThe Guardian view on crypto’s latest crash: it reveals who pays the price for a failing economyCloudflare outage causes error messages across the internetQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Under the system, an image or video reported by a user is cross-referenced against a database of illicit images – for instance, a “revenge porn” image or anexplicit deepfake– that have been converted into “hashes”, or digital fingerprints. This allows harmful images to be detected and removed from circulation.The recommendations have been made under the Online Safety Act (OSA), a landmark piece of legislation designed to protect children and adults from harmful material on the internet.Although the recommendations are technically voluntary, Ofcom has put pressure on social media companies to comply, saying it will publish a report in 2027 on how individual platforms have responded to the guidelines.The regulator added that the OSA could be toughened if the recommendations were ignored or implemented ineffectively.“If their action falls short, we will consider making formal recommendations to government on where the Online Safety Act may need to be strengthened,” said Ofcom.Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s chief executive, said she had encountered “shocking” stories of online abuse suffered by women and girls.View image in fullscreenMelanie Dawes, the chief executive of Ofcom.Photograph: Zuma Press Inc/Alamy“We are sending a clear message to tech firms to step up and act in line with our practical industry guidance, to protect their female users against the very real online risks they face today,” said Dawes. “With the continued support of campaigners, advocacy groups and expert partners, we will hold companies to account and set a new standard for women’s and girls’ online safety in the UK.”Other recommendations announced by Ofcom include: deploying prompts asking people to think twice before posting abusive content; imposing “time-outs” for people who repeatedly misuse a platform; preventing misogynistic users from earning a share of advertising revenue related to their posts; and allowing users to quickly block or mute multiple accounts at once.The recommendations finalise a process launched in February when Ofcom issued a consultation that included the hash-matching measure. However, more than a dozen of the guidelines, including setting “rate limits” on posts, are entirely new.Internet Matters, a nonprofit dedicated to children’s online safety, said the government should make the guidance mandatory and warned that many tech companies were likely to ignore it. Ofcom is consulting on whether to make the hash-matching recommendation mandatory.Rachel Huggins, co-chief executive at Internet Matters, said: “We know that many companies will not adopt the guidance simply because it is not statutory, meaning the unacceptable levels of online harm which women and girls face today will remain high.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaFacebookInstagramXSocial networkingMetaInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Today, they watch us as we approach, let the people inside the home know we’re coming sooner than our finger can hit the button, and give them a good look at our faces before they open the door.

Choosing the best video doorbell can be a bewildering task, with various factors to consider, including how much of your doorstep you want to see or whether you’re prepared to pay for a subscription. To help make the decision a little bit easier, I tested eight popular video doorbells to find the best.At a glanceBest video doorbell overall:Google Nest Doorbell (battery)£119.98 at John LewisBest budget video doorbell:Blink smart video doorbell with Sync Module 2£59.99 at VeryBest subscription-free video doorbell:Eufy video doorbell E340£99.99 at ArgosWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing products, including everything fromvacuum cleanersand robot lawnmowers to computers and games, for various publications for more than three decades. I’ve also owned a video doorbell for a couple of years, so I am well aware of their strengths and weaknesses. It gives me a good understanding of what I’m likely to be looking for in the next one I buy.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I lived with this rigged-up contraption on my doorstep for a fortnight.’Photograph: Andy ShawThe only way to test a doorbell is to stick it next to your front door and see how well it works. To achieve this, I mounted all eight on a board at doorbell height and lived with this rigged-up contraption on my doorstep for a fortnight. Delivery drivers were rightly suspicious of the number of buttons and cameras, and struggled to work out whether it was them or the doorbells that were being tested.I’m not sure whether my neighbours noticed them all, or spotted the number of times I lapped my drive at various times of day and night to test the movement sensors. If they did, they were too polite to mention it.I compared the doorbells by measuring how close I could get to the door before the motion detection was triggered, how much video was recorded and how useful that footage was. I timed how long it took for notifications to reach the doorbells’ apps on a smartphone and how long it took for the doorbell to send an alert or ring a chime (if included) when its button was pressed. I also tested the apps, examined the prices and considered the additional cost of subscriptions.All doorbells that didn’t need to be returned to the brands are being donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best video doorbells in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: RichLegg/Getty ImagesBest video doorbell overall:Google Nest Doorbell (battery)GoogleNest Doorbell (battery)from£119.98£119.98 at John Lewis£119.98 at AmazonWhat we loveGood viewing angle and quick to send alerts to mobile devices and smart speakersWhat we don’t loveRequires a £60 subscription to store footage and doesn’t come with a chimeThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£119.98 at John Lewis£119.98 at AmazonDoorbells can be inundated with features, and their apps can be amazing. But if they don’t do a good job of letting you know when someone approaches your door and captures a video of them, there really isn’t much point. The Nest Doorbell (battery) performed these tasks the best.Why we love itIn my tests, the Nest was a solid all-rounder. I found the viewing angle of its lens to be about perfect, not going so wide that people appear too small, but still capturing enough of the surrounding area to catch people skirting around its periphery. The video and audio were as consistently clear as those on any of the doorbells I tested, and they were decent both in daylight and at night.The Nest sometimes detected people right at the end of my drive, but proved consistent at capturing movement from about 3m away. I found there was some delay between the button being pressed and notifications arriving on Nest devices and smartphones, but it averaged at a fairly reasonable five seconds. While not as fast as the doorbells that had dedicated local chimes, which tend to go off almost immediately, this was among the fastest for sending alerts to smartphones and smart speakers.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with a chime. Instead, you need to buy a separateNest Mini smart speaker, which costs £49 (or use an existing Nest or Amazon Echo speaker). You also have to sign up for theNest Aware subscriptionat £60 a year – without it, motion events are stored for only three hours, which isn’t hugely useful.Subscription:Google Home Premium (30-day storage, records only when movement triggered), £8/month or £80/year; Google Home Premium Advanced (60-day storage, records 24/7), £16/month or £160/yearGoogleNest Doorbell (battery)from£119.98£119.98 at John Lewis£119.98 at AmazonWhat we loveGood viewing angle and quick to send alerts to mobile devices and smart speakersWhat we don’t loveRequires a £60 subscription to store footage and doesn’t come with a chimeBest budget video doorbell:Blink smart video doorbell with Sync Module 2BlinkSmart video doorbell with Sync Module 2from£59.99£59.99 at Very£59.99 at AmazonWhat we loveOne of the most affordable doorbells; saves footage to local storageWhat we don’t lovePoor microphone quality makes audio conversations with visitors difficult£59.99 at Very£59.99 at AmazonThe Blink is the only model I reviewed that costs less than £100. Amazon’s bargain basement doorbell costs as little as £49, and while you get what you pay for in terms of quality, it does the job.Why we love itPrice is the key selling point here because it’s significantly more affordable than its nearest competitor. However, we reviewed the version that comes with Blink’sSync Module 2, which costs only £10 more. This plugs into a wall socket and lets you connect USB storage (I used a USB flash memory drive). The device then locally backs up video that’s saved to the cloud, so you won’t lose any footage unless your local storage fills up. You still need a (relatively affordable)subscriptionfor motion detection to work, though.For a cheaper camera, I was impressed with the video footage. It has a wide-angle lens, so there’s a bit of a fish-eye effect around the edges, but it’s not so wide that people approaching the doorbell look tiny.It’s a shame that …the two-way audio isn’t great. The microphone quality was the worst I tested, so it’s best suited to those not planning to have lengthy conversations with people on the doorstep.Subscription:Basic Plan, £2.50/month or £24.99/year (30-day storage), single device; Plus Plan, £8/month or £80/year, multiple devices (30-day storage)BlinkSmart video doorbell with Sync Module 2from£59.99£59.99 at Very£59.99 at AmazonWhat we loveOne of the most affordable doorbells; saves footage to local storageWhat we don’t lovePoor microphone quality makes audio conversations with visitors difficultBest subscription-free video doorbell:Eufy video doorbell E340EufyVideo doorbell E340from£74.99£99.99 at Argos£74.99 at AmazonWhat we loveNo subscription required as footage is saved to the doorbell’s own storageWhat we don’t loveUnreliable motion detection sometimes misses fast-moving visitorsThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£99.99 at Argos£74.99 at AmazonMost video doorbells provide limited features without additional costs, hiding all their best bits (such as storing video for any length of time) behind a paywall. The Eufy E340 is unusual because it ditches the paid-for subscription concept entirely.Why we love itThe Eufy uses local rather than cloud storage, with 8GB built in to the device. How long that lasts before overwriting itself will depend on how busy your doorstep is. This built-in storage makes it one of the more expensive models, although that’s not its only trick. It uses two cameras, with an extra one pointed to the floor, so you can also keep an eye on parcels and packages (and analyse your visitors’ footwear).It’s a shame that …while the stars have aligned over the Eufy’s video quality and lack of subscription costs, there were one or two occasions when movement didn’t trigger the camera early enough or at all. Ideally, I’d prefer something more reliable.Subscription:none requiredEufyVideo doorbell E340from£74.99£99.99 at Argos£74.99 at AmazonWhat we loveNo subscription required as footage is saved to the doorbell’s own storageWhat we don’t loveUnreliable motion detection sometimes misses fast-moving visitorsThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Integrates smoothly with Amazon’s Echo smart speakers’: the Ring Battery Video Doorbell Pro.Aqara G4AqaraG4from£79.99£79.99 at Aqara£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveReplaceable batteries mean no down-time for chargingWhat we don’t loveThe app for reviewing footage is cumbersome and overcomplicatedThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£79.99 at Aqara£79.99 at AmazonBest for:no charging timeThe big problem with rechargeable doorbell batteries is that there’s a period when they have to be removed from the door and charged up, at which point any visiting friends will have to knock, and unwanted visitors won’t be recorded. This doorbell uses six AA batteries rather than a rechargeable, so its only downtime is while you’re replacing them.This model also comes with the option of recording video to a microSD card, which slots into the supplied chime, sitting safely inside the house. However, it only provides access to the past seven days of video recordings through the app. To view further back, you have to remove the memory card and watch the files through a PC.It didn’t make the final cut because …the app is nothing short of horrible. It has an AI chatbot. No, I don’t know why either. It was also one of the slowest to send notifications to a smartphone.Subscription:not required if using a memory card. A free subscription option downgrades footage to 360p and keeps it available for only seven days, so it isn’t particularly useful. The paid-for tier stores at full 2K resolution and keeps it for 30 days, for $4.99/month (about £3.88) or $49.99/year (about £38.86)AqaraG4from£79.99£79.99 at Aqara£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveReplaceable batteries mean no down-time for chargingWhat we don’t loveThe app for reviewing footage is cumbersome and overcomplicatedRing Battery video doorbell ProRingBattery video doorbell Profrom£119£119 at John Lewis£119 at AmazonWhat we loveCaptures footage continuously, so never misses any movementWhat we don’t loveSlow to send alerts to mobile devices, which can leave visitors waitingThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£119 at John Lewis£119 at AmazonBest for:Alexa usersThe big brother of the Blink doorbell, with a price to match.

Smart doorbells are crammed with features designed to make you think they sound good, luring you into choosing one over another. However, you should also take into account how good they are at alerting you when people arrive at your door, and whether you’ll be able to tell who it is when you watch a video or live feed on your smartphone, as I did in my tests.Battery vs wired video doorbellsIf you have an existing wired doorbell, you can use its wiring to connect most video doorbells. There are two main benefits to a wired doorbell: there’s no battery, so it doesn’t need to be recharged; and it will ring the existing doorbell chime inside the house when the doorbell button is pressed. They’re a bit more complicated to install, though, so if you’re not a competent electrician, we’d suggest getting a professional to do it for you.Battery doorbells are much easier to install, but charging them can be a faff. You usually have to remove the doorbell (or at least its battery) and charge it overnight. During that time, you have no doorbell or camera. You’ll probably have to do this every month or so, but it depends on the battery and how busy your doorstep is.Some doorbells can use a spare battery or come with regular batteries that can simply be swapped, so you don’t need to be without a doorbell while it charges. Others can be topped up using a small solar panel, either out of the box or as an additional accessory.Installing your video doorbellInstalling a new battery doorbell is simple. Most come with a mounting plate to attach wherever you want the doorbell to sit. Screwing into a wooden door frame is easy and convenient, if your doorway has one, but it can also be mounted on to a wall if you’re prepared to drill some holes and use a wall plug to hold the screws in place. Once the battery is charged, the doorbell attaches to the mounting plate.If you’re replacing a wired doorbell, ensure you switch off the electricity first. This should be possible through your circuit breaker, and you should test it before you remove your old doorbell by ringing it – if it stops ringing, you’ve successfully shut off the power to it. The old wires should then attach to terminals on the new doorbell, but we’d strongly advise tackling this only if you know what you’re doing, or getting a professional to do it for you.Subscriptions and storageOne of the hidden costs of a video doorbell is the price of a subscription, which usually costs a few pounds a month and includes some form of cloud storage. Without a subscription, most video doorbells are little more than a regular doorbell with the video equivalent of a peephole that allows you to see who is at the door right at that second. A storage subscription elevates it into an archive of visitors, with video footage of everyone who’s been on your doorstep in recent days, so you can go back and check.Having said this, some doorbells (such as the Blink and Eufy doorbells reviewed here) have their own storage, can accept a memory card or connect to a wireless hub that’s kept inside the house. This kind of doorbell can be used without a subscription and still store footage locally, though many still offer a subscription alongside that can provide additional features, such as recognising the faces of your visitors.Do video doorbells work with voice assistants?Video doorbells integrate nicely with other smart home devices. The most useful add-on is a smart screen, such asAmazon’s Echo Show (available in various sizes from £89.99) orGoogle’s Nest Hub Max (£159). These screens can be set to alert you when your doorbell rings and immediately switch to a live video feed from the doorbell camera.Smart speakers such asAmazon’s Echo DotandGoogle’s Nest Minican also be used in conjunction with a doorbell, though without a screen, they can’t display a live view. You can still set them to chime, which can be useful for hearing the doorbell all around your house.Video doorbells can also be controlled using Amazon and Google’s smart assistants. You can use voice commands to perform doorbell tasks, such as showing the view from your doorbell on your phone or smart screen.Your doorbell doesn’t have to come from the same company as your smart device or favoured voice assistant; Google’s Nest Doorbell is compatible with Amazon Alexa as well as Google Assistant devices, for example. However, you tend to get more functions with a directly compatible system – Amazon’s Echo devices, for example, with a Ring or Blink doorbell.How long do video doorbells generally last?Quoting the battery life of a video doorbell is problematic, even for the manufacturers. Amazon states only that the batteries in its Ring doorbells can last for “months”, while Google quotes the battery life of the Nest Doorbell (battery) as between one and six months. Both are too vague to be particularly useful.However, it’s hard for the manufacturers to be more specific because there are huge differences between how people use their doorbells. If you live on a busy street, for example, and have motion detection switched on, your doorbell will be activated by every passerby. Video doorbells can also be activated by movement from cars, trees and animals.There are other factors that can reduce the battery life, too. If you often use it to view a live picture of your doorstep even when there’s no one there (which can be very tempting, especially when the doorbell is new), then the battery will run down faster. Battery life is also reduced in cold weather, so those living in chillier parts of the country might find that their battery doesn’t last as long, particularly during winter months.When it comes to the life of the doorbell itself, manufacturers tend to offer warranties of between one and two years. We’d expect that to be a minimum lifespan, as with few moving parts, there isn’t that much that can go wrong.The first thing that’s likely to fail is the battery, because they tend to deteriorate over time. That puts doorbells with removable batteries at a slight advantage, because a failed battery in a sealed device may be impossible to replace. You can extend a battery’s life by treating it well: wait until its charge is below 20% before recharging and try not to let it run down completely. That way there’s no real reason why a video doorbell shouldn’t last for years.In some cases it’s possible that a manufacturer’s support for a doorbell will run out before the hardware dies. For most doorbells, that’s about five years after the product was first launched. Support is usually withdrawn by stopping software updates, which can leave a product vulnerable to hacking, or by changing elements such as cloud storage services that can render advanced features unusable.Andy Shaw is aconsumer journalist and technology addict.

It was discounted in July, but only to £199.An affordable 55in TVView image in fullscreenHisense A6Q LED, 55in£299 at Argos£299 at AmazonFor such an affordable mid-sized TV, this Hisense A6Q ticks most of the boxes, with a 4K resolution and a pleasant complement of HDR standards (Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG) that can provide vivid highlights in supported content. Freely is built in to provide access to live and on-demand TV out of the box, with no aerial or set-top box required. For gaming, there’s support for Auto Low Latency Mode, although the refresh rate tops out at 60Hz (120Hz or higher is preferable for smoother onscreen action with recent consoles). Connectivity is limited to three HDMI 2.1 ports.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A bargain TCL TVView image in fullscreenTCL C6KSQD-Mini LED, 50in£349 at Argos£349 at AmazonThe TCL C6KS seems too good to be true, packed with higher-end features at a bargain-basement price. It’s a modest 50 inches, but its Mini LED panel is bright and sharp with 160 dimming zones, allowing for surprisingly vibrant and saturated images for a television at this price point. Its new HVA panel helps in providing more depth to its overall images, top. For this price, the fact that it supports HLG, HDR10, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision is excellent. Many TVs several times more expensive can’t say that.Gaming performance is fine – it’ll do up to 4K/60Hz with VRR and ALLM – although the lack of higher-refresh-rate output means it isn’t optimal for powerful home consoles or PCs. In terms of connectivity, there are three HDMI ports, one of which supports eARC to hook up a soundbar or speakers for improved audio. The Onkyo-branded system with this TV is surprisingly detailed, though – you may be able to get away with using it for some time before feeling the need to upgrade to separate speakers.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A quality Sony TV for a low priceView image in fullscreenSony Bravia KD55X75WL, 55in£499 at AmazonWhile this isn’t Sony’s latest and greatest option, it’s a quality telly for a great price. It’s a moderate size that should be good for most rooms, and HDR support is reasonable, with HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision all supported.This Sony TV also comes with four HDMI ports for inputs, plus support for eARC to connect a soundbar or supported speakers. For gaming, it has ALLM, a custom screen size setting, a black equaliser and an onscreen crosshair – features more commonly seen in monitors than TVs.Smart TV duties are handled by the familiar Google TV OS, providing good access to smart apps, and it bundles in 15 credits of Sony Pictures Core and a 24-month streaming package.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An affordable TV for gamingView image in fullscreenTCLT8C, 55in£356.73 at Amazon£357 at HughesThis is an excellent value pick if you’re after a TV for gaming. It features four HDMI ports, with two that support full 4K/144Hz HDMI 2.1 output, making it ideal to pair with a games console or living-room PC. It also supports VRR and ALLM for the most optimal experience. This screen also has rich HDR support – supporting Dolby Vision, HLG, HDR10 and HDR10+ – and it has a decent Onkyo-tuned Atmos-capable speaker setup. For well under £400, this feels like quite a steal.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A bright Mini LED TVView image in fullscreenHisense U7Q ProMini LED, 65in£899 at John Lewis£899 at CurrysThis large, feature-rich Mini LED TV looks like a capable option for everything from games to films.There’s a rich set of HDR support (Dolby Vision and Dolby Vision IQ, plus HDR10+, HDR10 and HLG) and the Mini LED screen allows for some serious depth and searing brightness (Hisense claims a peak brightness of 2,000 nits).The integrated speakers provide up to 50W of power and support Dolby Atmos and DTS:X surround standards. There are different sound modes to dig into, too, as well as different picture modes, so you can optimise image quality as you wish.It has four HDMI 2.1 ports with full support for 4K/120Hz gaming, so will play nicely with modern games consoles (and if you’re a PC gamer looking for a living-room monitor, you’ll be glad to know that refresh rate can be overclocked further up to 165Hz). Support for variable refresh rate and ALLM further enhances the gaming experience.Price history:not available, but this is its lowest ever price at Currys.An entry-level LG OLED for lessView image in fullscreenLG B5OLED, 55in£899 at John Lewis£899 at AmazonLG’s B5 OLED is the most affordable entry in the brand’s 2025 OLED lineup, adding a new processor, improved connectivity and an updated UI to last year’s B4 model.It comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports with full support for 4K/120Hz output, and also offers VRR and ALLM for gaming. In terms of HDR, the B5 supports Dolby Vision IQ, Dolby Vision, HDR10, HLG and Cinema HDR, offering impactful highlights in supported content. It also comes with LG’s slick and easy-to-use webOS operating system, with a wide range of streaming apps, plus different picture modes. The 20W speakers support Dolby Atmos.If you want a larger version, the 65in version is currently£1,299 at AO.Price history:this is the lowest ever price.A Philips Ambilight bargainView image in fullscreenPhilips Ambilight 65PUS8200, 65in£459 at AmazonIf all you’re after is a serviceable and hardy larger-screen TV, then this 65in Philips Ambilight model could be a good choice – especially for sub-£500. It provides you with plenty of screen real estate and Philips’ own TitanOS smart system for accessing smart TV apps.There is decent HDR support for such an affordable television, with HDR10 and HLG, plus compatibility with HDR10+, and it has three HDMI ports – one of which is an eARC port for soundbars. It also supports HDMI VRR and ALLM for gaming. With this in mind, though, its maximum refresh rate is 60Hz rather than 120Hz. Its 20W speakers also have Atmos support.What’s unique about Philips TVs is the presence of the company’s Ambilight system, which provides atmospheric lighting on the rear of the unit that projects on to the surface behind it. Aimed at reducing eye strain, this is also useful if you want to add a splash of colour to your room.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An Ambilight OLEDView image in fullscreenPhilips AmbilightOLED760, 65in£1,099 at Currys£1,099 at AmazonThe Philips Ambilight 65OLED760 might not be one of the brand’s flagship OLED choices, but as more of a mid-range one provides a very rich set of features for its price point. It’s a solid OLED screen that provides great depth and good contrast while supporting all four of the main HDR formats – Dolby Vision, HLG, HDR10 and HDR10+, and comes with various picture modes to choose from. This Philips screen also benefits from four HDMI 2.1-capable ports for gaming use, with full 4K/120Hz powers with ALLM and VRR so it’ll play nicely with console or PC.What’s quite unique about this Philips TV is the presence of its Ambilight system, providing atmospheric lighting on the rear of the unit that projects onto the surface behind it. This is useful if you want to add a splash of colour to your setup through your TV, which not many others can do.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It means this telly provides sublime image quality. HDR support consists of HDR10, HDR10+ and HLG; Samsung still isn’t supporting Dolby Vision.The four HDMI 2.1 ports are welcome, and offer support for proper 4K/120Hz gaming, with up to 144Hz for PC gaming. There is also support for variable refresh and ALLM, alongside Samsung’s Game Hub menu.Price history:this is its lowest ever price at Amazon.Sony’s best OLED TVView image in fullscreenSony Bravia 8 IIQD-OLED, 65in£2,199 at John Lewis£2,199 at CurrysSony’s Bravia 8 II is one of the best TVs currently available – with a price to match. The QD-OLED panel is 25% brighter than on the A95L model it replaces, with even sharper picture quality, not least with HDR enabled. There’s support for Dolby Vision, HLG and HDR10, and claimed peak brightness is a searing 4,000 nits.The Acoustic Surface Audio+ speaker system is widely well reviewed, providing surprisingly solid audio for a set of TV speakers. Gaming support is strong, too, with 4K/120Hz input supported over HDMI 2.1, plus VRR and ALLM. There’s even an ‘optimised for PS5’ mode that automatically optimises the TV’s settings when it detects that the PlayStation is plugged in. Unlike Samsung and LG’s flagships, however, there are only two HDMI 2.1 ports here (one of which is an eARC, if you did want to connect a soundbar).Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An LG mid-range TV for a little cheaperView image in fullscreenLG C5OLED, 55in£1,099 at John Lewis£1,099 at CurrysLG’s latest mid-range C-series model OLED offers an improved operating system and a new processor over last year’s C4. The new processor helps it to better upscale content to 4K than previous models, too, which is handy if you watch a lot of older and lower-definition content.There are four HDMI 2.1 ports for 4K/144Hz gaming (or up to 4K/120Hz on consoles), with VRR and ALLM supported on all of them. HDR support comes in the form of HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision, and this 55in model benefits from LG’s Evo panel for even stronger brightness.As you’d expect from an LG OLED, it comes with dazzling image quality with inky blacks, sublime contrast and wonderfully accurate colours that make viewing everything from games to movies a pleasure.Price history:it’s been available slightly cheaper but this is its lowest price at a mainstream retailer.A great mid-range Sony OLEDView image in fullscreenSony Bravia 8A OLED, 55in£1,299 at John Lewis£1,299 at ArgosThe Sony Bravia 8A was initially more expensive than the standard Bravia 8, but as pricing has settled, this A variant has become a more compelling choice. One of Sony’s 2024 TV models, it comes with an OLED panel that it claims is 10% brighter than its predecessor. HDR support comes in with Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG (no HDR10+). It also comes with Sony’s AI-enabled Bravia XR processor inside, plus the same Acoustic Surface Audio+ sound system for surprisingly decent audio. The Google TV operating system also provides a familiar experience.As an OLED, image quality looks to be rather excellent, and gamers should be decently happy with HDMI 2.1 support for 4K/120Hz output with VRR and ALLM. As with the other Bravia above, this comes with the caveat that HDMI 2.1 is supported on only two of this TV’s four HDMI inputs.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The small 42in smart OLED TVView image in fullscreenLG C5OLED, 42in£849 at Argos£849 at AmazonThis 42in TV is the most compact OLED you can buy in the current LG range, making it a dead cert if you’ve got a smaller room like me, or want to use this TV as a super-size monitor.There are four HDMI 2.1-enabled ports with 4K/144Hz capability (and up to 120Hz on consoles), plus VRR and ALLM support for gaming. There’s also solid HDR support with HDR10, Dolby Vision and HLG. LG’s new webOS 25 brings small upgrades, such as the ability to hide apps on the front screen, and it’s a reasonable smart TV system to use every day.It also comes with a new AI Magic Remote with what LG calls ‘AI buttons’ – voice controls and drag-and-drop functions.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The surprising Mini LED standout 65in TVView image in fullscreenTCL C7KQD-Mini LED, 65in£749 at CurrysTCL has become known for its more affordable, feature-rich televisions in recent years. The C7K is a shining example of this, providing excellent image quality at a modest price point for its 65in size. A particular highlight is its fantastic black levels, contrast and dynamic range, helped along by a bright QD-Mini LED panel with 1,008 dimming zones and a claimed peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits.It also has a full complement of HDR support, with HLG, HDR10, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision for impactful highlights. Gaming support is great, with two out of the four HDMI ports supporting 4K/144Hz HDMI 2.1 powers with VRR and ALLM. Plus, if you’re willing to drop the resolution down to Full HD from 4K, it can double the refresh rate to 288Hz. That’s a feature more typically found on a PC monitor than a TV, but if you have a powerful PC connected and want to maximise performance in high-refresh-rate games, then the C7K should allow you to do so.This new model also adds in a Bang & Olufsen stereo with 60W of power, replacing TCL’s previous collaboration with Onkyo, as well as support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundtracks.If you’re after an even bigger screen, the 75in version is£948 at AmazonandAO.Price history:it’s only £40 cheaper than it’s been at Currys all month, but it’s still its lowest ever price.A big-screen LG OLEDView image in fullscreenLG C4OLED, 77in£1,799 at AmazonLast year’s mid-range LG OLED, the C4 was the first LG C-series OLED to support native 4K/144Hz output over its four HDMI 2.1 ports – a boon for gamers. It also brings proper Nvidia G-Sync certification for one of its supported VRR standards.The presence of webOS 24 brings benefits such as a built-in Chromecast for easy wireless casting right out of the box, and the Alpha 9 processor brings AI smarts to enhance the clarity of onscreen dialogue and to bring even more channels of virtual surround sound. The internal 40W speakers have Atmos support to provide more cinematic audio in supported content.Price history:this is higher than it was during Prime Day – but only by 2p.Reece BithreyFor more:How to shop smart this Black FridayHow to avoid bad Black Friday laptop dealsThe best early Black Friday dealsThe best Black Friday beauty dealsBlack Friday TV deals: what to look out for – and how to avoid the bad onesView image in fullscreenSteer clear of the bargain aisle if you want your new TV to make a statement.Photograph: Pressmaster/Getty ImagesDesign is importantDesign counts. If you want that new TV to be a statement in your living space, stay clear of the bargain aisle – that’s where you’ll find cookie-cutter designs with flimsy plastic pedestal stands. If you’re not wall mounting, pay particular attention to the feet. Are they placed close to each edge? On a TV 55 inches and larger, that could mean you’ll also have to factor in new furniture just to accommodate it.Central pedestal stands are always the easiest to live with, and some models also have a swivel so that you can angle the screen to best suit your seating. It’s a little bonus well worth having.Think about when you’ll use itAre you buying a TV for everyday use, or do you hanker after a special screen for movies? If it’s the latter, buying an OLED will generally be your best bet. Unlike LED-based TVs, there’s no need for a backlight, because OLED pixels are self-emitting. This means when you dim the lights, black levels stay nice and inky and shadow detail is retained, giving your pictures cinematic depth. Conversely, LED models (be they LCD LED, QLED or Mini LED) tend to look their best in rooms with ambient light, and therefore make better daytime TVs.Connectivity countsDon’t just look at the front. The cheapest TVs you’ll see during the Black Friday sales will only offer three HDMI inputs at the back. This may be fine if you don’t plan on connecting much equipment, but it could prove limiting in the long term. Cheap televisions tend to offer poor audio, so one of those HDMI ports will probably be assigned to a soundbar. That just leaves two to share between games consoles, set-top boxes and Blu-ray/DVD players.View image in fullscreenMaximise gaming performance by playing at a higher refresh rate.Photograph: simpson33/Getty ImagesConsider what you need for gamingIf you plan to play video games on your new set, check to see if those HDMIs support a 120Hz high refresh rate. If you own a PlayStation 5 or current Xbox, you can maximise performance (and therefore improve your chances of winning against your mates) by playing at a higher refresh rate. These 120Hz-capable TVs also tend to offer VRR (variable refresh rate) and ALLM (auto low latency mode), acronyms that add to the gaming experience.Incidentally, if you buy a Sony Bravia, there’s a good chance it will also have PS Remote Play, meaning you can enjoy your PlayStation console while it’s not even in the same room as the TV.Of course, you can always play games on standard 60Hz TVs, and if you have an older console or just like casual family games, you’ve nothing to worry about.Don’t avoid last year’s modelsMany TV makers use Black Friday to offer cheap deals on older stock, to clear inventory. This is where you really can grab a killer deal, particularly at the mid-to-higher end of the market.For example, a 2024 LG OLED C5 55in screen has a sale price of £1,199. The 2025 G5 OLED, also on sale, still commands a premium of £1,599. Last year’s top models will still impress 12 months after release.Buying a well-reviewed older TV is almost always better than buying a newer model that’s been stockpiled to shift in volume during the sales.Not all HDR is worth havingIt’s worth bearing in mind that not all HDR (high dynamic range) TVs are created equal. While every 4K model sporting a Black Friday price tag will boast HDR compatibility, there can be huge differences in performance. Entry-level screens – typically those 50in models selling for little more than £200 – will invariably lack the brightness to make HDR programmes really shine. Indeed, in their attempt to make HDR details (such as bright street lights, fireworks, explosions and so on) pop, the rest of the show can look unnaturally dark. These HDR ‘lite’ TVs are actually better suited to non-HDR programmes, such as regular SDR (standard dynamic range) channels on Freeview, rather than streams from Netflix and Co.The good news is that HDR performance improves dramatically from the mid-range upwards, and is a real differentiator at the posh end of the market.Be aware also that HDR comes in different flavours. In addition to standard HDR10, there’s HDR10+, Dolby Vision and cleverly ‘Adaptive’ versions of each on top, able to react to the light levels in your living room. Film fans favour screens that offer Dolby Vision, but not every brand has it. Samsung is the most prominent outlier.Sound adviceFinally, listen out for audio. It’s a fact that thin, inexpensive TVs generally tend to sound awful. They lack bass and become painful when you crank the volume. But there are exceptions that could save you from shelling out on a soundbar.Samsung QLED TVs boasting object tracking sound (OTS) offer far better audio than you might expect, and tend to have innovative processing that can enhance dialogue and combat extraneous noise, making them great for family use. Meanwhile, Sony OLED TVs have a clever Acoustic Surface Audio sound system, which uses actuators on the rear of the OLED panel to produce impressive high-fidelity audio. And if you want the full home theatre audio enchilada, Panasonic’s best sets have a full 360-degree sound system with front, side and up-firing speakers tuned by sister brand Technics, able to produce convincing Dolby Atmos cinema sound.And here’s a closing tip. Even if your Black Friday bargain TV doesn’t have decent sound onboard, check to see if it passes a Dolby Atmos signal out over the e-ARC HDMI connection, because you can always add a great-sounding Dolby Atmos soundbar during the January sales.Steve MayExplore more on these topicsThe FilterThe FilterTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But with so many websites being shouty about their Black Friday offers, the best buys aren’t always easy to spot. So before you splash the cash, it might pay to do some research – and look closely at the specification.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I know this may not be welcome advice. After all, the thought of drawing up a spreadsheet of memory configurations and pricing history might put a slight dampener on the excitement that builds as Black Friday approaches. But buy the right laptop today and you can look forward to many years of joyful productivity. Pick a duff one, and every time you open the lid you’ll be cursing your past self’s impulsive nature. So don’t get caught out; be prepared with our useful tips – and a roundup of the Filter’s favourite laptop deals.Before you make the jump, also be sure you really need a new laptop withour guide to making the most out of your existing one.How to find a genuinely good Black Friday laptop dealView image in fullscreenFind out what a laptop is really like to use to ensure it’s right for you.Photograph: Oscar Wong/Getty ImagesDon’t sweat the CPUMany people get hung up on processor power, but this is the one thing you rarely need to worry about these days. Although new processor models come out with alarming frequency, almost any AMD Ryzen, Intel Core or Apple M-series chip of the past few years will be fine for everyday web browsing and office tasks. High-end models are only really needed for particularly demanding workloads; a quick trip to Google (or your AI chatbot of choice) will help you see how different processor models measure up.Plan ahead with plenty of RAM and storageEvery laptop needs a decent amount of memory. If the system is starved of RAM, then performance will be sluggish, regardless of the CPU’s speed. While Windows 11 runs acceptably in 8GB, a minimum of 16GB will help ensure that future updates continue to run smoothly. Some models are upgradeable, so you can start with a basic allocation of RAM and add more as your needs grow, but this certainly isn’t something you can take for granted.Laptop storage is also rarely expandable, except by plugging in a USB flash drive or an external SSD. That might be fine if your device will spend much of its time on a desk, but if you want to carry it around with you – not an unreasonable ask for a computer of this type – it’s a drag. So while a base-level 256GB SSD might suffice for home-working, consider stepping up to 512GB or even 1TB of internal storage, especially if you want to edit videos or play big 3D games. Look into battery life, weight and overall dimensions, too, if portability is a priority.Find out what it’s really like to useSome important considerations – such as the quality of the screen and keyboard – don’t show up on the spec sheet, yet these things are arguably just as important as the processor and memory. If the display is dim and blocky, and typing emails feels like pressing Scrabble tiles into a flannel, it will make day-to-day working more difficult.Since online retail doesn’t give you an opportunity to try tapping out “the quick brown fox” for yourself, the next best thing is to read reviews of other people’s hands-on experience. Pay particular attention to the model number, though: laptops often come in a few variants, including a high-end version that will usually get great reviews – and a more cheaply made model that can be flogged for a knock-down price on Black Friday.Is this a genuine special offer?The final thing to check is whether the bargain that’s flashing up on your screen is actually a deal at all. You can look up past prices for a vast range of items by going toCamelCamelCamel– yes, really – and either typing in a laptop model number or pasting in the web address of an Amazon product page. You may find that the heavily promoted Black Friday price is identical to last month’s standard price on Amazon. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad deal, but it signals that you probably don’t need to race to grab a once-in-a-lifetime bargain (we’ve made sure to list this price history on all the laptop deals below).Indeed, with Cyber Monday, pre- and post-Christmas sales, Easter specials, Amazon Prime Day, back-to-school offers and so forth, you’re rarely more than a few weeks away from the next big discount event – so don’t let the excitement of Black Friday encourage you into making a hasty purchase.Darien Graham-SmithFor more, read the Filter’s roundup of thebest early Black Friday dealsQ&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best Black Friday laptop deals in 2025A slim and powerful laptopView image in fullscreenLenovo IdeaPad Slim 3£349 at John LewisFor this price, this Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 has a decent core for productivity tasks as well as some headroom for more intensive loads. The Intel Core i5-13620H processor has eight cores and eight threads, while you also get 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for storage. It’s a slim laptop for easier portability, although it still comes with a mid-size 15in IPS screen.If have a bit more to spend,£650 will get you a more powerful versionwith a faster eight-core AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 processor, plus 24GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.Price history:this is the best price for this model, and you’d pay an extra £120 for a 1TB model from Amazon.A big-screen OLED Asus laptopView image in fullscreenAsus Vivobook S16 OLED£649 at CurrysThis Asus Vivobook S16 OLED nails the basics, if you’re after a big-screen laptop with a little something extra. Its Intel Core Ultra 5 225H processor delivers solid performance, while 32GB of RAM and a hefty capacity 1TB SSD provide enough headroom for intensive multitasking and installing of all sorts of apps.A larger 16in Full HD+ resolution OLED screen displays high-quality output with deeper blacks, stronger contrast, and more accurate colours than standard IPS screens found elsewhere at this price. Up to 20 hours of battery life is a boon if you’re going to be away from the mains, too.Price history:not available, but this is the lowest price ever at Currys.A rare MacBook dealView image in fullscreenApple MacBook Air M2 13in£699 at John Lewis£699 at CurrysApple’s M2 MacBook Air is a couple of years old now, but the Apple Silicon chip inside continues to deliver oodles of power for anything from productivity loads to editing high-res video on battery power. It’s sleek, portable and stylish, although it lacks ports, so you may need to pick up a cheap USB-C adapter to supplement. The 13.6in Liquid Retina screen is sharp and detailed, while 18 hours of battery life is sure to keep you up and running for a couple of working days away from the mains.Price history:this is the lowest ever price.A top-end MacBook AirView image in fullscreenApple MacBook Air M4 13in£849 at Amazon£849 at CurrysThe current flagship MacBook Air has dropped back to its lowest ever price for Black Friday, complete with its capable M4 chip inside. It’s a beefier choice than older M-series chips, with faster single-core performance and two extra CPU and GPU cores for even more power. There are incremental upgrades elsewhere, such as 16GB on this base model, plus the ability to connect to two external displays with the lid down. Otherwise, this is the same modern MacBook Air we know and love, with a dazzling Liquid Retina screen and up to 18 hours of battery life. You will need a cheap USB-C adapter to extend the ports to a more usable selection.Price history:a return to its lowest ever price.A decent everyday laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Aspire 14 AI£399 at CurrysFor basic working needs, this Acer Aspire 14 AI has everything you need at a wallet-friendly price.

Modern AAA games can be a storage hog, but the 1TB SSD means there’s enough headroom for a good few here, while 16GB of RAM is enough for gaming loads.Price history:not available, but cheaper than the closest equivalent on Amazon.A mid-range gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Nitro V16 AI£1,089.99 at Amazon£1,099 at VeryAcer’s Nitro V16 is a strong mid-range gaming laptop, especially in this spec, which pairs an RTX 5070 graphics card with AMD’s eight-core Ryzen AI 7 350 processor.

But with voters becoming more and more concerned about the firm’s surveillance tech, could that relationship affect his chances?Tue 25 Nov 2025 10.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 14.39 ESTShareThe US is the land of the free and the home of the world’smost expensive, and most excruciatingly drawn-out, elections. In most democracies, the election cycle lasts justa few weeks or months. In most democracies there are strict laws regulating how long politicians can campaign, and how much money political parties can accept. But the US is not most democracies.Which is why, despite the fact we’re not even a full year into Trump 2.0, there’s already chatter about 2028. Assuming Donald Trump doesn’t find some sort of legal loophole that lets him run again (notunthinkable!), JD Vance is widely seen as his heir apparent, with Trump saying a presidential ticket with Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio would be “unstoppable”. Meanwhile, Rubio, it was recently reported, is telling his inner circlehe’d support Vance for president.In his role as vice-president, Vance is already under constant scrutiny. But, as 2028 approaches, he will be put under the microscope. And if he wants to get the top job there are a few liabilities that he should probably sort out.His personality is one of them: Vance can come off assmug and obnoxious. But that’s something he can work on. This is a man, after all, who haschanged his namemany times; a former atheist who converted to Catholicism in 2019, a few years before running for political office. A man who once called Donald Trump “America’s Hitler” and now calls him boss. Vance is adept at shape-shifting.A liability that might be rather harder to shake off, however, is his ties to the shadowy $450bntechnology company Palantir. Vance would not be where he is today were it not for the mentorship of Peter Thiel, the company’s billionaire co-founder. Thiel encouraged the hiring of Vance at his investment firm Mithril Capital in 2016, then spent$15m on Vance’s senate campaign. Some people see Vance as a sort ofavatar for Thielin the White House. Which is worrying because Thiel hassaid he doesn’t“believe that freedom and democracy are compatible”.It’s hard to explain exactly what Thiel’s firm does in non-buzzwordy language, but here are a few examples. The company has a multimillion-dollar contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help improve “deportation logistics”, and has been building an “ImmigrationOS” that, according to a contract seen byBusiness Insider, will include “near real-time visibility into instances of self-deportation”. Palantir, which hasbeen called“the AI arms dealer of the 21st century”, also works very closely with Israel’s military.A June reportfrom the UN special rapporteur Francesca Albanese says there are “reasonable grounds to believe Palantir has provided automatic predictive policing technology” to Israel – which is as dystopian as it sounds – as well as “core defence infrastructure”. When the Palantir co-founder Alex Karp was heckled by a pro-Palestine protester in May and accused of killing Palestinians, he shrugged it off with: “Mostly terrorists, that’s true.”Many potential Vance voters don’t give a damn about Palestinians. But they are suspicious of big tech and the surveillance state – and they are very wary of the Trump administration’sdeepening ties to Palantir. The podcast bros who helped get out the vote for Trump in 2024, for example, have repeatedly voiced concerns about the company. On a 9 September episode of his podcastJoe Roganreferenced anarticlefrom the financial news site Benzinga about the Trump administration employing Palantir to gather the “personal data of American citizens” and called it “kinda creepy”. Rogan went on to quote the article’s comments about Palantir creating “detailed profiles of American citizens” and asked, alarmed: “Who signed off on this?” Over adozen other rightwinginfluencers, includingTucker Carlson, have worried aloud about Palantir’s capabilities and its objectives for the US.All this is a big problem for Vance because, as herecently acknowledgedwhile speaking to university students: “I get asked about Palantir a lot because there’s this internet meme out there that somehow I am super in bed with Palantir.” Meme or not, it’s hard to ignore the links between the two, which are,increasingly, generating headlines. You’ve made your bed, Vance; now you’ve got to lie in it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A federal judgedismissedthe sham indictments the administration had obtained against them.Judge Cameron McGowan Currie reminded the president and his attorney general of the great lessons of a society governed by the rule of law:how things are done matters as much as what is done. Without fair procedures, no one can be safe from the arbitrary exercise of government power.This is never more apparent than when leaders target their political opponents and seek revenge against those who do not fall in line. The US is learning this lesson in real time as the Trump administrationpoliticizesprosecution.Donald Trump has built a regime of retribution and reward | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreRecall the president’s infamous 20 September direction to Pam Bondi, the US attorney general.“Pam,” Trumppostedto Truth Social, “I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as the last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.’“Then,” he continued, “we almost put in a Democrat supported U.S. Attorney, in Virginia, with a really bad Republican past … I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so. Lindsey Halligan is a really good lawyer, and likes you, a lot.”The president ended by making it clear what he wanted and why he wanted it. “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”US judge throws out criminal cases against James Comey and Letitia JamesRead moreTwo days later, BondiinstalledHalligan as interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia with an apparent mandate to go after Comey, James and others. Several days after that,Comey was indictedin federal court, accused of lying to Congress; the next month, James was indicted in a mortgage case. Both denied wrongdoing and said the cases were intended to punish them for past clashes with him.On Monday, Currie delivered a decisive rebuke to Trump and Bondi when she threw out the Comey and James indictments. She found that Halligan’s appointment violated the clear language of the statute governing such appointments and of the constitution itself.As a result, all of the actions flowing from her appointment, including the indictments of Comey and James, were “unlawful exercises of executive power”. While Currieleft the door open for the administration to refile indictmentsagainst Comey and James, in Comey’s case, the time allowed under the applicable statute of limitations has run out.As the Washington Post notes, Currie’s decision is just the latest in a series ofjudicial rulings“disqualifying Trump’s interim U.S. attorney picks in New Jersey, Nevada, and Los Angeles”. Like her colleagues, Currie made clear that Trump’s Department of Justice had again distinguished itself by its dangerous combination of lawlessness and incompetence.Her opinion is good news for defenders of the rule of law. It should also strengthen the hand of other judges who want to push back against the administration’s vindictive prosecutions.Judges, like Currie, are never eager to dismiss an indictment issued by a grand jury. They are inclined to trust the grand jury process and are reluctant to cast aside the investment of time and resources that a good prosecutor makes in securing an indictment.In 1988, the supreme courtheldthat, in most cases, dismissal of an indictment is appropriate only if errors in the handling of the grand jury process prejudiced a defendant by “substantially” influencing the decision to indict or raising “grave doubt” about whether the decision was free from such influence.As the attorney James M Burnhamhas written, this high bar “plays a central role in the ever-expanding, vague nature of federal criminal law because it largely eliminates the possibility of purely legal judicial opinions construing criminal statutes”. Burnham wants judges to be more active in policing indictments and making sure they are legally justified.Currie did just that. She found that Halligan lacked the authority to seek indictments of Comey or James because the justice department had not followed theapplicable law governing the appointment of interim US attorneys. That law is,in her words, “unambiguous”.It allows the attorney general to appoint an interim US attorney, who can serve for a period of 120 days. It falls to a federal district court, not the administration, to choose a successor or extend the term of the current interim appointee – as happened with Halligan’s predecessor.The purpose of the law, Currie noted, was to prevent the president from circumventing the constitutional requirement that US attorneys go through a Senate confirmation process by making a series of interim appointments back-to-back.But Senate confirmation takes time. Alas, how inconvenient when the president demands that his enemies must be brought to justice now.Bondi may have known what the law required when she appointed Halligan to do the president’s bidding. But she seems to interpret her role asserving Trumpand pushing the outer boundaries of the law until a judge has the temerity to tell her she can’t.Like federal judges in other cases, that is what Currie did. Along the way, the judge noted that Halligan was a “White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience”, who appeared alone before the grand jury after career prosecutors in her office concluded that neither had committed any crime.In the end, the judge, having pointed out the lawlessness and incompetence that accompanied Halligan’s appointment and the Comey and James indictments, reminded Bondi and the president that the legal requirements governing appointments, as the supreme court oncesaid, are “more than a matter of etiquette or protocol”. No matter how much the president insists or how many all-caps messages he posts to Truth Social, those requirements cannot be discarded, she concluded, to suit the president, since they are “among the significant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme”.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionJames ComeyLetitia JamesTrump administrationUS justice systemUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Take it from this Brit: sometimes laughter is the only optionTue 25 Nov 2025 07.59 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 12.40 ESTShareLiterally nothing on this earth takes itself as seriously as American journalism. There are rogue-state dictators it’s more permissible to laugh at than the endlessly hilarious pretensions of newsmen and newswomen in the United States. The crucial difference between the British press and US press is that at least we in the British pressknowwe’re in the gutter. The Americans have always imagined – and so loudly – that they are involved in some kind of higher calling. Guys, I love you and stuff, but get over it, because you’re missing one of the great jokes of the century. Yourselves.I don’t deny that everything’s bigger in America. Our former health secretary had a knee-trembler up against his office doorin the pandemic; their current oneapparentlywrote felching … poetry, is it … felching poetry? … to a superstar journalist who was worrying about his brainworm, yet the story is being written up like it’s Dante, instead of X-rated Italian brainrot.We are, by the way, talking about the tale of Olivia Nuzzi, Ryan Lizza and Robert F Kennedy. If you’ve missed this one, you havea great treat in store. Olivia and Ryan were hotshot political journalists (and a couple) covering presidential campaigns and writing a joint book about the 2020 one, when Ryan discovered last year that Olivia had had what is primly described as a “digital affair” with wingnut presidential candidate RFK. It all blew up, there was some legal hokey-cokey, they lost their jobs, she fled to LA, RFK became health secretary. He’s gotbigger brainwormsto fry; the other two are now “breaking their silence”.And everything – everything – about it is darkly hysterical. It should obviously be being written as comedy. Instead, the story is being chronicled with maximum portentousness by its own protagonists. First, in Nuzzi’s forthcoming memoir/state-of-the-nation something-or-other, which isactually entitledAmerican Canto. And second in Lizza’s Substack, which isgenuinely calledTelos. I can’t.No, hang on – I can. Like so many of the self-regarding big-hitters of the US fourth estate, this sundered pair very much need you to know that serious prose is occurring. Both of them adore a sledgehammer metaphor. With Lizza, it’s bamboo. The bamboo in the couple’s apartment courtyard “had become a metaphor for our decade-long entanglement”. Righto. “If not tamed, [it] would march through the entire courtyard and kill everything.” Thanks for flagging, mate. “I spent hours hacking at the sprouts to keep the bamboo at bay, just as I had with all the secrets that Olivia and I shared.” Is there much more of this? Yes, would seem to be the answer. “I should have known that it was futile and that, at some point, the bamboo would take over the garden, and that’s all anyone would see.” Come on Ryan, batter me round the head with the bamboo analogy one more time – I’m so close to getting the point.With Nuzzi,it’s wildfires. She flees to LA after the RFK story breaks, staking down seemingly dozens of signposts to where we are going as the burning takes hold. “10:30 a.m., 10 acres burning. 10:50 a.m., 20 acres burning … 2 p.m., 700 acres burning. 3 p.m., 1,300 acres burning … 12:30 a.m., 3,000 acres burning. 9 a.m., 5,000 acres burning. 11:45 a.m., 12,000 acres burning. 1:30 p.m., 16,000 acres burning … 9 p.m., 20,000 acres burning. 8 a.m., 22,000 acres burning. 4 p.m., 24,000 acres burning.” OK GOT IT. Luckily, because we’re literary dumbos, Nuzzi has already explained: “You cannot outrun your life on fire.” Makes u think. Could we have some crossover metaphor event where the bamboo catches fire? Maybe for Black Friday.With heavy heart, apparently, the wider US mediamust cover the tale, yet not even America’s dainty journalese can rob the story of its full-spectrum trash merriment. In fact, in some cases it adds to it. Nuzzi’s lawyertold the New York Timeshis client would “not dignify efforts to impugn her character with any future response”. Dialling in from an Edith Wharton novel, there. I believe the felching poetrydropped a couple of days later.It’s so sad that, across American newsrooms, hankies must be overtly pressed to noses about all this, while refresh keys can only be covertly pressed to see if any more has dropped. Pretty much the only splashy thing Vanity Fair has done under its new editorship was hire Nuzzi as West Coast editor and run her book extract, so it should be absolutely zero surprise to learn that, as a result of something they read in Telos – again, “Telos”!!! – the magazine is reviewing the appointment. “We were taken by surprise,” intoned a Vanity Fair spokeswoman, “and we are looking at all the facts.” For heaven’s sake, buck up and stop being so absolutelywet. This sort of thing is why you hired her. Just own it and allow yourself a bit of fun.Alas, they seem bent on playing it like they’re in the midst of some boring ethics crisis, when you can’t help feeling that ship has sailed. May we humble outsiders offer a word of advice? Guys, you just need to stop being so American and serious about it all. And, indeed, about America. God knows we lesser countries have put some ghastly people in charge ourselves, but you do have to allow your international underlings the occasional cackle at the fact that in your great nation, Donald Trump has now become president, twice. When you lot shit the bed, the whole world has to lie in it – so do at least have the delicacy to realise that once dignity has gone, a good laugh is how the rest of us get by.

Let’s hope it is not too late for Democrats to win back the working class and WashingtonTue 25 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 15.50 ESTShareSince theDemocrats’sweepingvictorieson 4 November, a strange thing has happened among the party factions: a semblance of unity has emerged.At first, “affordability” became the slogan of rapprochement. Moderates, populists and socialists agreed Democrats must campaign around thecost-of-living crisisand hang the broken economy aroundDonald Trump’s neck.At the same time party grandees – left, right and center – quietly agreed to ditch wokeness and embrace common-sense appeals to American solidarity and equality. Ideologically, we see the same convergence. Last week,writingin the Atlantic, Rogé Karma argued that the left has pulled the moderates toward populism, while the centrists have won debates on a number of cultural issues.And this week, James Carville – thebête noireof every leftwing Democrat andBernie Sandersvoter, the architect of Clintonian centrism –writesin the New York Times that he is become a populist.Here is Carville (James Carville!) describing whatDemocratsshould do:Why did young men move left in this month’s US elections? | Cory AlpertRead more“I am now an 81-year-old man and I know that in the minds of many, I carry the torch from a so-called centrist political era. Yet it is abundantly clear even to me that the Democratic party must now run on the most populist economic platform since the Great Depression.”Carville advocates a program that includes raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour (blowing past the old progressive demand of $15 an hour), universal childcare, free university education, and major investments in utilities. But more important than the suite of policies itself, the editorial signals to Democratic bigwigs that populism has won. A decade after he announced his first campaign for president, it seems that Sanders has won hiscrusadefor the soulof the Democratic party.Winning consensus on the need for a “seismic” economic program is no small feat and it will go a long way to helping Democrats win back their working-class base. Still, there is a lot of work to be done and many pitfalls along the way.First, progressives must resist the temptation, so attractive to scorned factions, to reject centrist overtures. There is a danger that if moderates fulsomely embrace a social populist program, figures on the left will attempt to differentiate themselves by reanimating the dead-end politics of fringe woke causes.But being lefter-than-thou serves no one and would only succeed in helping the right paint the left as a collection of sky-pilots, eggheads, and weirdos. This is, in part, the lesson of the old Socialist party of Norman Thomas. Franklin Delano Roosevelt adopted the political narrative, and much of the practical program, of the socialists of his day. However, instead of embracing FDR’s social-democratic turn, Thomas & co tried more and more to distinguish themselves and discredit Roosevelt claiming that he only “carried out the socialist program on a stretcher”.Some on the left attacked Roosevelt’s enormously popular New Deal and lambasted Democrats as cynics and opportunists. The result was to hasten the political irrelevance of the very figures most responsible for inspiring a great populist revival in the 1930s. If today’s left wants to avoid a similar fate, they should embrace the new populists of the center and work with them to craft visionary social policy. And they should have the humility to revise their own opinions when the centrists have a point.Second, the turn toward populism will remain incomplete until party leaders are willing to stridently declare war on the economic elite – the same elite who fill the campaign coffers of powerful Democrats. Not only is it essential for candidates to draw lines between themselves and the very rich to demonstrate their populist convictions, but without naming the “millionaires and billionaires” as the cause of so much economic misery, Democrats will be unable to mount a serious challenge to rule by the rich.Many moderates who have lately flirted with populism have as yet been unwilling to point the finger at Wall Street and Silicon Valley as the villains of the contemporary order. Yet, it is precisely because the ultra-wealthy have hijacked American society that so many working-class Americans struggle to pay their bills. The fact is we cannot win a society that is more equal and more prosperous without directly challenging the plutocrats at the top.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Becoming the party of “economic rage” is a good way to win elections but to fix the crisis (crises?), the new social populism must go beyond the standard welfare state toolbox. Carville and other newfound populists have made a huge political leap in embracing a suite of big, new public services and for that they should be commended. Yet it isn’t enough.Maga is in meltdown over a preppy pink sweater for men. So, what exactly is the problem? | Ellie Violet BramleyRead moreNo doubt, we urgently need bold redistributive programs to rebalance income and wealth and to address the persistent cost crunch. But these alone will not fix our broken economy. Nor are such programs popular enough to propel a populist takeover in Washington. To get a sense of just what is wrong, consider that since Bill Clinton was president, we haveshedsome 7m middle-income jobs in manufacturing, and in an exaggerated inverse-proportion we have gained some 700 billionaires.If a renewed leftwing populism is to succeed it needs to address this. We need to de-globalize the economy, to disentangle the home market from the increasingly dysfunctional world market. We need to bringmanufacturinghome and reindustrialize the rustbelt.We need to reign in and repatriate the hyper-global banking sector. We need to rebuild American infrastructure from coast to coast. And we need to strengthen the power of labor on the shop floor by leveling the legal playing field between workers and employers. All of this would amount to a democratic reorganization of the political economy away from the global rich and toward the domestic working class.This would be a populism worthy of the name and if moderate Democrats are embracing such a call, they ought to be welcomed with open arms. And if the hour isn’t too late, this kind of appeal might be the only chance Democrats have of winning back the working class and retaking Washington.Dustin Guastella is a research associate at the Center for Working Class Politics and the director of operations for Teamsters Local 623Explore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionUS politicsBernie SandersDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

He targeted me for being Jewish – and it hurtPeter EttedguiNow that my former classmate has finally spoken about the allegations of his behaviour at school, I feel compelled to address his points directlyTue 25 Nov 2025 14.38 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 18.31 ESTShareIhad thought my Dulwich days were well behind me and that I’d never again have to think about the antisemitic taunts I suffered fromNigel Farageat school. Then at some point in the late 2000s, a friend sent me a YouTube video of the then Ukip leader haranguing EU commissioners.The instant I saw Farage, my blood froze. All I could think of was his 13-year-old self sidling up to me, growling the words “Hitler was right” and other odious remarks (“To the gas chambers”, “Gas them – ssssssssss”) which he now refers to, rather quaintly, as banter. The verb “trigger” is perhaps overused, but it’s the only word I can think of to describe the stomach-churning emotions I felt in that moment I laid eyes on him again on YouTube.As Farage became an increasingly ubiquitous figure on the public stage, I would tell friends and strangers alike of my experience of him at school. It was alarming to me that all people seemed to see was Farage the entertainer, the nonconformist political figure, overflowing with bonhomie – a straight-talking man of the people, holding up his pint glass.One of my friends with whom I shared my recollections of that darker side of Farage urged me to speak out about my experience in 2013 and put me in touch with the Channel 4 journalist Michael Crick, who was then compiling his report of Farage’s alleged racism at school.I felt deeply ambivalent. I didn’t want to expose what happened to me on national TV, and I wondered if it was even fair to do so, given that we were only 13 to 14 at the time. But of course I followed the reporting closely, and it was Farage’s response to Crick’s questions that made me regret not having participated: “I said some ridiculous things, not necessarily racist things.” My anger at what I saw as blatant dishonesty meant I would not be quite so reluctant in the future.I have seen Farage’s denials of the allegations made in the Guardian and I listened on Monday night to Farage’s response in a broadcast interview. I heard only more dishonesty. I would like to address the points he made directly.Farage has said that this happened so long ago that people could not possibly remember such experiences. I ask, how could I not? It was the first time that I had encountered the “oldest hatred”, the one that claimed generations of my family. I had assumed that such views were a thing of the past – but he taught me otherwise. Maybe he cannot recall what he did. If so, such memory loss is perhaps not a great selling point for a potential leader of a country. But as the victim of his verbal abuse, I can assure you that I do recall it all vividly. His words, the tone of his voice, his physical posture, these are all intensely ingrained, as was the emotional impact – degrading, humiliating.Twenty people allege he has a racist past. He denies it. Who’s telling the truth about Farage’s schooldays?Read moreFaragesuggests that he has never “directly” abused anyone, or at least he did not do so with any intention to hurt. He has said that those who have claimed otherwise are not telling the truth. Well, he did directly target me and I can tell you that it did hurt. How did he think it would make me feel? How does he think those who were called Pakis or told to “go home” felt? His aides have said it is “one person’s word against another”. The Guardian has spoken to about 20 people who witnessed or experienced racist behaviour, including a number who have corroborated my account.A third strand of Farage’s explanation of events is that he may have simply “misspoken” as a child. How very woke of this culture warrior to use that term. He was not a child. He was 13 to 14 years old when he “misspoke” to me. The age when many cultures and religions encourage teenagers to face adulthood. I was doing barmitzvah classes during the year Farage was frequently misspeaking to me. His words made me feel conflicted about my Jewish heritage, ashamed even. Ridiculous, really. According to the allegations in the Guardian’s reporting, racist abuse of other pupils continued through to when he was aged 18. That is a lot of misspeaking.Finally, there is the suggestion from Farage that this was somehow normal 1970s banter that is being wrongly reinterpreted today to fit a contemporary narrative. The cruelty of Farage’s words transcended typical schoolkid banter even back then in the 1970s. Racist attacks are becoming normalised once again in the UK, fuelled by the rise of populism and the far right across the world, and, of course, the anti-immigration agenda. Given Reform UK’s policies, it is even more pressing that questions about Farage’s own “banter” and “misspeaking” are raised.I’d like to know why he has never shown the slightest contrition for the deep offence these allegations caused me and many others. And I’d like to know if what I view as his early racist mindset has truly changed with the passing of time. Because when I hear Mr Farage talking about rounding up and deporting hundreds of thousands of human beings, and threatening those with leave to remain or settled status, I cannot help but think of the schoolboy sidling up to me and telling me that “Hitler was right”.Peter Ettedgui is a Bafta- and Emmy-winning director and producer.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Such distortion of facts from a public body should alarm us allTue 25 Nov 2025 10.54 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 13.03 ESTShareThe latest strike by resident doctors began on Friday 14 November. That morning, the headline of the lead story on the front page of the Times proclaimed: “Five days of NHS strikes opposed by most doctors”.The story began: “Most junior doctors do not support Friday’s strike, a poll has revealed as Wes Streeting attacked the British Medical Association for going ‘against the wishes’ of its members.” The trouble is that the poll showed no such thing.It was conducted by Savanta, a reputable survey research company. Question nine, which asked doctors whether they supported or opposed the strike, found that as many as69% backed it, while only 12% were opposed.However, those figures appeared nowhere in the Times story. It reported a different question, question 10, which asked whether the British Medical Association should call off the strike if theNHStrained thousands more doctors, prioritised graduates with NHS experience and covered the costs of various training fees.Had both questions been reported, Times readers would have been given a significant insight into thecurrent angerof the striking doctors, set against the prospect of a future settlement based on proposals advanced by the health secretary. Indeed, it was arguably a bigger and better story.So why did the Times not tell it? Because the poll was commissioned by the Department ofHealth– another unpublished fact – and the department wanted a propaganda win as the strike started. So it gave the Times the results for Q10 and withheld the results for Q9.Fortunately, the truth came out, six days too late. Like all the well-known survey research companies, Savanta is a member of the British Polling Council. I helped to set up the council 20 years ago when Ichaired YouGov. Its rules are based on the principle of transparency. It requires members to correct publicly any client that distorts the findings by publishing only the results it likes.The results for Q9 were eventually published the following Thursday evening. But this should be only an initial skirmish in the far greater battle to insist on government departments telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.For a start, the Department of Health should come clean on who took the decision to brief the Times the way they did. Did junior or middle-ranking officials act independently, or did ministers or senior officials take the final decision? Was everyone involved aware that two questions were asked about doctors’ views of the strike, not just one? If not, why was this information held back from the final decision-makers? Did anyone challenge the decision to suppress Q9? If so, why were they overruled? Were any codes of conduct broken? If so, did anyone point this out?These questions are well worth answering because, unusually, we have clear evidence of something specific going badly wrong inside a government department. One need not be a rabid cynic to suspect that other government stories in recent years have also fallen short of the standards of candour and rigour that citizens of a democracy should have the right to expect.There is a wider point. Most statistics published by the government come from independent agencies, such as the Office for National Statistics. They are rightly respected for presenting their data in a standard, comprehensive form. Cherrypicking figures that put the government in a good light would be alien to the way they work and, indeed, to their very purpose.It’s different when Whitehall commissions research from private polling companies – Savanta, YouGov and many others. These days, there’s a lot of it. Some is published in full. Some is kept confidential and used internally by departments to shape policies and track how well or badly government actions are going down with the wider public. And there are those such as Savanta’s poll of doctors: some results are published and others held back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When I chaired YouGov, there was nothing I saw in our government work that really needed to be kept completely confidential. Occasionally, a case could be made for deferring publication while ministers were confidentially exploring options ahead of a public announcement (such as the budget). Maybe some research, involving defence or national security issues, should be held back much longer, even years or decades.However, the general rule, subject to clearly defined exceptions, should be that what the government knows about what we think, we should know too. After all, in a free society, we have the right to speak out as individuals. It seems odd to regard the record of our collective views as state secrets.I wish I weren’t writing this. I had hoped the Times story was right. In my view, the doctors are wrong to strike. But in an era when populism feeds on distrust of mainstream politicians, we should object when the truth is twisted, even in favour of a cause we agree with.Peter Kellner is a former president of YouGovDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The substance was widely speculated to be a dye called methylene blue, though Kennedy has not publicly commented on it.The fabric dye is also taken by the likes of Joe Rogan – who in a podcast weeks later said that “RFK Jr told me about it” – and Bryan Johnson, thesludge-eatingAmerican venture capitalist who has sunk millions into trying to prevent the (famously) inevitable process of death.So what is methylene blue and is there any benchmark evidence that it’s good for your health?What is methylene blue?Methylene blue is a synthetic textile dye, noted for its ability to bind well to fabrics. (Kennedy, ironically, wants the US food industry tostop using artificial dyes.)The substance has gained popularity in wellness circles, with a laundry list of claimed benefits, including that it boosts cognition, increases energy levels, has anti-ageing effects, relieves stress and has antioxidant effects. On TikTok, influencers poke out blue tongues and dropper the cobalt colourant straight into their mouths.But ingestion of the dye for unapproved uses carries serious risks.What is protein water – and can it help me lose weight and gain muscle? | AntiviralRead moreMethylene blue was first synthesised in the late 19th century. Dark green as a powder and deep blue when dissolved in water, the synthetic dye was soon discovered to kill the parasite that causes malaria.It became one of the first fully synthetic drugs used in medicine, and was used widely in the second world war when quinine – the standard antimalarial treatment at the time – was in short supply.“The troops weren’t impressed as it turned their urine blue,” says Dr Ian Musgrave, a molecular pharmacologist at the University of Adelaide. “This is one of the commonest reported adverse effects of methylene blue even today.”Though it is now rarely used for malaria, methylene blue is considered by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine. It’s primarily used to treat methaemoglobinemia, a blood disorder in which there is an excess of methaemoglobin – a form of haemoglobin that cannot carry oxygen – in the blood.Methylene blue has redox properties, meaning it can gain and give up electrons, and through a chemical reaction it restores haemoglobin to its functional form. It is also sometimes used to treat the effects of carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning.“I used methylene blue when I did my biochemistry major, because it’s one of the oldest dyes … for staining DNA and all sorts of biological molecules,” says Dr Slade Matthews, a senior lecturer in pharmacology at the University of Sydney. “It’s been used as a dye in surgery, but there’s been quite a lot of reported toxicity.”Does methylene blue have health benefits?Much of the wellness hype around methylene blue has origins in studies conducted in animals as well as in vitro – in cells tested in lab settings – and the Victorian Poisons Centre warns: “There is no current evidence that methylene blue improves health or brain function in healthy individuals.”Methylene blue can cross into the brain through a protective membrane known as the blood-brain barrier. In rodents,studiessuggestit can improve memory and prevent degeneration in conditions that mimic Alzheimer’s, but Musgrave notes it has “largely failed in human clinical trials for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease”.As an antioxidant, he notes that “while there are some promising results in tissue culture, there is currently no evidence in humans that it has significant anti-ageing effects”.Those selling methylene blue and other compounds marketed to boost brain function often make vague claims that are hard to prove or refute, Matthews says. “To prove that a drug is going to make you smarter – it’s just really difficult. That’s why they go for claims like that; they don’t say that it produces some effect that’s easily measurable.”What are the health risks associated with methylene blue?Across Australia, poisons information centres have noted an increase in calls as a result of methylene blue ingestion, with some patients developing significant symptoms.The Western Australia Poisons Information Centre has recorded nine calls this year, compared with one call a year over the previous two years. Centres in Queensland and Victoria have already received more calls this year (eight in both states) as a result of methylene blue exposure than the previous four years combined.“Most of these exposures appear to be linked to the ingestion of methylene blue for unapproved wellness purposes,” Carol Wylie, manager of the Queensland Poisons Information Centre, says. “Consuming unregistered or unapproved methylene blue can cause serious side-effects including nausea, vomiting, rapid heart rate, dizziness, confusion and skin discoloration.”Recharging station: can at-home mats provide the same benefits as PEMF therapy? | Natasha MayRead moreIn September, the medicines regulator issued asafety advisory, noting an increase in importation and unregistered use of methylene blue, and warning that the dye can interact with drugs such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a common type of antidepressant.Matthews has seen methylene blue sold online at dosages that, in people taking SSRIs, can cause serotonin syndrome – a potentially fatal condition that can cause muscle spasms, confusion and agitation.And despite its use as a treatment for methaemoglobinemia, he points out that at high doses the dye can paradoxically cause the condition.In healthy people, it also commonly results in pain in the extremities, nausea, excessive sweating, and changes in taste and skin colour.Given the evidence, wellness influencers drink the dye at their own peril – the rest of us must resign ourselves to highlighting its risks until we’re blue in the face.Donna Lu is an assistant editor, climate, environment and science at Guardian AustraliaAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

As Covid swept in, and with horrific images of Italiantemporary morguesin tents,he went on holidayand took no calls. With the NHS bracing to be “overwhelmed” by the virus, he rode his new motorbike, walked his dog and hosted friends at Chevening.Nothing is surprising about that: he was ejected from Downing Street and later stepped down as an MP largely for partying and lying toparliament about it. Everyone knew he was a self-aggrandising fantasist with a “toxic and chaotic culture” around him. But this is not just about one narcissistic politician. It’s about his entire rightwing coterie of libertarians and their lethally dominant creed in the UK media.They have a long history of rejecting things that save lives – seatbelts, speed limits, smoking restrictions, sugar taxes, vaccination, benefits, sewers, clean air, the NHS itself and, of course, stopping climate breakdown. Recall that during the 1980s and 1990s, the Sunday Times under the editorship of Andrew Neil promoted the strangestgay plague theory, publishing pieces suggesting that Aids wasn’t caused by HIV, and that it was almost impossible for heterosexual people to contract it. (Neil has said he regrets certain aspects of the paper’s coverage, but does not take personal responsibility for it.)That anti-science tradition is alive and well today.Lockdowns are the quintessence of everything rightwing science-sceptics abhor: what misfortune that a tribe least equipped to cope was in power during the pandemic. In the circumstances, the interventions from those in charge were “too little, too late”. Hard to imagine, but Covid in the UK could have been even more deadly, had unavoidable facts about the pandemic not eventually overwhelmed their fact-free ideologies.Naturally, lockdown sceptics are out in force to demolish thelatest module of the Covid report chaired by HeatherHallett, the former high court judge appointed by Boris Johnson. From the start they had proclaimed lockdowns worse than pointless. On the recent fifth anniversary of the first lockdown, they were contesting who denounced it first: Daniel Hannan in the Sunday Telegraph boasted he wasthe only oneto “stand in the way of a stampede”. “What the hell were we thinking? Five years ago, we were sliding towards the most expensive mistake ever made by a British government, a mistake that led to our financial ruin, the annihilation of our basic freedoms and the obliteration of public trust,” he went on.Toby Young in the Spectatordashed to outdoHannan: “I’m happy to name myself as one of the first journalists to oppose the lockdown policy, along with Peter Hitchens, Allison Pearson, Ross Clark, Julia Hartley-Brewer and a handful of others.” The Daily Mail, Telegraph, Sun, Express and Spectator, joined mid-pandemic by GB News, were among those who kept the extremist libertarian flag flying, with no relenting since. The public needs reminding constantly of those 23,000 deaths, as Nigel Farage and Richard Tice were among lockdown’s fiercest opponents, hastily rebranding their Brexit party as Reform UK tocampaign against all restrictions. None of this can be called “populist”: the public always favours precaution, as they did in lockdown.Now with this report, virulent attacks by this cadre rain down on Hallett’s statisticsand reasoning.The Telegraph conteststhe numbers. Toby Young’s outlet,the Daily Sceptic(successor to his Lockdown Sceptics blog), ison the attack. Shamefully, Johnson himselfsmeared the inquirythat he himself complied with as “hopelessly incoherent”, in the Daily Mail.Maybe 23,000 is too many or not enough: but it’s an informed estimate. Sweden is the country constantly quoted by the right, as it relied entirely on a voluntary advisory approach, never compulsory lockdowns. In terms of deaths per capita, many fewer Swedes died than Britons: case proven? Hallett trounced? Alas, we are not Sweden in social structure, national wealth, vulnerable deprivation, health or social care, mainly due to the longterm malign influence of the right fighting tooth and claw against Swedish-style social democracy. But here’s the most telling research, comparing the socially and economically similar Norway with Sweden. Norway implementedlockdownswhile Sweden refused. Many moredied per millionin Sweden (2,759) than in Norway (1,050).The precautionary principle, putting safety first when the science is uncertain, is as alien to these ideologues as risk registers. To them, safeguarding regulations and public protections are comical, while officials who shield society are laughable blobs and plods. Johnson took a witty swipe at me back in 2006 exemplifying the great chasm between our sides. Hesaid that I incarnate“all the nannying, high-taxing, high-spending schoolmarminess of Blair’s Britain” as “the high-priestess of our paranoid, mollycoddled, risk-averse, airbagged, booster-seated culture of political correctness and ‘elf’n’safety fascism’”. Fair enough and funnily enough, I wear the badge with pride; public wellbeing is a serious matter.Johnson and his world were never serious: they play games and affect jocular mannerisms because they don’t actually believe in government. Brexit was another of their political games, with direst consequences. The report quotes Johnson saying, “let the bodies pile high” at the prospect of large numbers dying in care homes (he has denied saying it). More than 45,000 of themdid indeed die, as hospitals tipped untested patients into care home beds.That was an outrageously flippant and deeply revealing attitude, so objectionable that it instantly shuts down discussion. His faction are using their own bogus figures to reject Hallett’s and “prove” lockdowns don’t save lives, as so often decadently rejecting majority scientific opinion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How many QALYs – quality adjusted life years – ie years of good quality, were preserved and at what price?Bereaved families are painfully clear in their view. But the gigantic cost has to be weighed in the balance,estimated by the House of Commons libraryat £310bn to £410bn. A Benthamite felicific calculus seeking the greatest good for the greatest number might compute how many more lives could be saved one way or another, how much more happiness could be created and unhappiness avoided if the chancellor now had that vast extra sum for her budget this week.Understandably people are torn by such questions. It’s not easy, but it needs serious thought that will never be had from these extremist dilettantes.Future modules of Hallett’s inquirywill look at the terrible harm done by keeping children out of school for extended periods; leaving old people to die alone; domestic violence; loneliness; and the crippling blow to the economy, commerce and public services. Those life and death trade-offs need to be faced truthfully in the next pandemic. But always beware the deranged right’s predilection for “freedom” over even the most basic lifesaving health and safety measures.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCovid inquiryOpinionCoronavirusInfectious diseasesBoris JohnsonNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

We talk a lot about strategies for keeping anti-liberal, nationalist populists out of power, but Donald Trump’s daily wielding of a wrecking ball shows that it’s equally important to reinforce your democracy so it can withstand a period of populists in power.Germany has a concept calledwehrhafteDemokratie,often weirdly translated as “militant democracy” but actually meaning a democracy capable of defending itself. Under this motto, some in Germany areproposing to banAlternative für Deutschland (AfD), now one of the most popular parties in the country. That’s the wrong way to go. It would only reinforce the far-right party’s supporters in their conviction that the democratic state itself is a kind of liberal elitist conspiracy, and impart to the AfD the nimbus of martyrdom. The French experiment of a “republican arc”, in which virtually all the other parties agree only on keeping out Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, is also visibly backfiring. Such a wide range of parties unsurprisingly fails to agree on urgently needed reforms and the National Rally can go on criticising from the sidelines. So it’s worth contemplating the example of the Netherlands, where the party of the inflammatory populist Geert Wilders was allowed into power in a coalition government, failed to deliver, brought that government down bywithdrawing from the coalition, andlost the subsequent election(albeit only narrowly) to a liberal party led by the young, dynamic Rob Jetten.But if you’re going to take the risk of letting populists into government, you need first to reinforce the defences of your democracy – otherwise they will use democracy to dismantle democracy, as Viktor Orbán has done in Hungary and Trump is trying to do in the US. Salami slice by salami slice, these once liberal democracies become what political scientists call an electoral authoritarian system. There are still elections, but they are not free and fair.Here are a few things to look at, if you want to populist-proof your democracy.Proportional representationA winner-takes-all two-party system, such as the US has – and the UK largely still has in Westminster, despite the recent fragmentation of its party landscape – may be helpful until a nationalist populist takes over one of the two big parties, as Trump has done. Then it’s worse. Better to have proportional representation, so the populists will be constrained by coalition partners, as in the Netherlands and much of continentalEurope.Electoral administrationA little nerdy perhaps, but this matters. The absurdly archaic US system, in which each of the 50 states has its own different procedures, is a standing invitation to partisan gerrymandering, voter suppression and all the other dirty tricks on which Republicans are plainly hellbent in advance of next autumn’s midterm elections.Public service broadcastingThe shared public sphere we need for democracy is everywhere being eroded by the simultaneous fragmentation and polarisation that results from the US capitalist version of the digital revolution. There are few easy remedies. If, however, you have a trusted public service broadcaster, as in Britain, Canada, Australia, Germany or Scandinavia, you should hang on to it for dear life, further ringfence its editorial independence, double its budget and increase its presence on social media. That Britain is doing the precise opposite byundermining the BBC, probably the world’s most widely respected public service broadcaster, is just another example of the country’s seemingly endless capacity for national self-harming.Media ownershipCensorship issoold-fashioned. The modern authoritarian controls speech through ownership. In Turkey andHungary, the leaders’ oligarchic cronies own the key media. At first glance, it may look like perfect media pluralism; behind the mask, the reality is entirely different. It’s almost impossible to formulate a general rule on this. Foreign ownership, for example, has been a curse of British newspapers (think Rupert Murdoch) but a blessing for the defence of democracy in some post-communist countries (the broadcaster TVN in Poland, for example). It’s horses for courses.Independent judiciaryObvious, but so vital. The judicial chaos in Poland today, where the governing coalition isdisputing the legitimacy of judgesappointed by the previous populist government, shows what happens when the rule of law has been lost. Germany recently saw a disastrous incident in which the candidacy of a left-liberal legal scholar for a seat on the constitutional court, already approved by the relevant cross-party parliamentary committee,was derailedby a group of rebel conservatives. Like the attacks on the BBC, this is precisely the wrong thing to do when you have populists at the gate. Unlike the US supreme court, the UK supreme court has kept its reputation for impartiality. But when the shadow justice minister, Robert Jenrick, waves a judge’s wig in front of his party conference while denouncing leftwing activist judges, we see that the Trumpian threat is not far away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps most worryingly, this is already happening in the US department of justice, where hundreds of officials have either beensacked or have resigned. Indictments of outspoken critics, such asJohn Bolton,James Comey and Letitia James, have followed.Constitutional monarchyYou laugh? But asked by Yascha Mounk on his The Good Fight podcast how we can best defend liberal democracies, the leading American comparative constitutionalist Tom Ginsburg unexpectedlysingled out the advantagesof having a constitutional monarchy. Anti-liberal populists claim to speak on behalf of the nation, but if you have a constitutional monarch who is the undisputed, non-partisan top representative of the nation, that space is at least partly occupied. I’m not suggesting that the US should bring back one of the heirs to George III (although a British royal spare is available in LA), but if you happen to have a constitutional monarchy, like Britain, Sweden or the Netherlands, do preserve it – for in practice it is, quite paradoxically, a bulwark of democracy.I could mention many other areas, such as security services, the military, universities, and the incestuous, neo-oligarchic relationships between big money and politics. In each case, the specific national answers will differ, and none of them will be easy. It helps to have detailed provisions in a hard-to-change constitution, but what James Madison inFederalist Paper 48memorably called “parchment barriers” are no guarantee in themselves. It needs us, the people, to mobilise to protect them. When I was in Prague last month, my Czech friends were preparing to defend their public service television and radio, on the streets if need be.For what’s painfully clear is that once you’ve lost any of these essential checks and balances, they are very hard to restore. Destruction is so much easier than construction. Just look at the mess Poland is in today, and the US will be tomorrow. For liberal democracy, as for health, prevention is better than cure.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionProportional representationCivil serviceEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

But in real crises, the fallibility of politicians can be terrifyingTue 25 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 08.26 ESTShareThe camera catchesJacinda Ardernin her pyjamas, bleary-eyed with exhaustion. It follows her wiping crumbs off the worktops, breastfeeding, trying to take a phone call while simultaneously retrieving something her curious toddler has picked up off her desk. They are scenes many frazzled, distracted working parents will recognise, except that at the time she was the prime minister of New Zealand and these home movies – shot on her husband’s phone, originally for family consumption – have since been turned into a documentary premiering in British cinemas this December.Prime Minister, the movie, is the latest step in Ardern’s campaign for politicians to be allowed toreclaim their humanity, which broadly means the public accepting that they are grappling with the same private pressures as the rest of us (and no doubt similarly making a hash of it at times). It was the message of her recent memoir,A Different Kind of Power, and in some ways of her time in office, made only more urgent lately by the avalanche of violent threats and abuse heaped on anyone in public life – as if by getting elected they had become instantly dehumanised.Of course, politicians are only flesh and blood; of course they get sick, have children or elderly parents who need them, slip up sometimes or need a break. (Though that does not, Boris Johnson please note, mean a delightful-soundingfew days offbumbling around Chequers on your new motorbike with your now wife in the middle of what turns out to have been the crucial February period for pandemic preparation.) Without the kind of latitude that Ardern is asking for, leadership roles would effectively be restricted to robots and sociopaths, which doesn’t seem in anyone’s best interests.Yet the suspicion remains that sometimes in politics, “only human” is deployed as a plea for forgiveness or attempt at distraction, shifting attention away from the political and controversial to the more disarming (and often more easily spun) personal. It’s hard to be angry with someone you have watched rocking a Moses basket while trying to do their paperwork, as Ardern does in the film. But what if there is reasonable cause to be angry? And are politicians still allowed to be lovably human during an existential crisis calling for superhuman efforts?Both Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, though naturally reserved and private people, have shown a little of their softer undersides ahead of what looks bound to be a monumentally difficult budget: he by publishing afond open letterto his teenage son on International Men’s Day, she by venting her frustration at newspaper columnistsmansplaining economicsto her. Both interventions seemed designed to make them more relatable, perhaps even to raise a defensive shield against the flak likely to be flying on Wednesday.LiveHow the world fell in love with Jacinda Ardern – videoBut people who are struggling themselves don’t tend to have much sympathy to spare for those nominally in charge of the economy in which they are struggling. And even Ardern’s film, whichwon an audience awardwhen it premiered at the Sundance film festival earlier this year, perhaps hits a little differently back in her native New Zealand. Critics have complained that itskips too lightlyover hard questions about what she actually achieved in office, for all the talk of leading with kindness and empathy.Helpfully, there is a more objective if slightly less gripping way of assessing her record. New Zealand’s royal commission on lessons learned from the pandemicpublished its first reportthis summer and in comparison with the British Covid inquiry’s withering “too little, too late” verdict on the Johnson government’s handling of the pandemic, Ardern emerges practically glowing. Her “be strong and be kind” strategy, which involved sealing borders early to keep the virus at bay, was judged effective in public health terms, holding back infections until a vaccine was ready and allowing the country to spend less time in strict lockdowns than others around the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ardern’s decision to make vaccination compulsory for some jobs and social gatherings was also, the inquiry found, reasonable on public health grounds – but it cost some vaccine refusers their jobs and left others feeling socially ostracised, fuelling resentment and a distrust of medical authority that may have long-lasting consequences.The report is hard to read without feeling once again that Britain would have fared better through the pandemic with an Ardern in charge rather than a Johnson. But it’s still harder to read without recognising that nobody gets everything right; and that in a crisis where what is best for the country as a whole is bound to be tough on individuals, getting it right for everyone was a mathematical impossibility.To be human is to accept that there are times when even someone’s best isn’t always enough. In life-threatening situations, the idea that leaders are not all-powerful is a terrifying concept, which perhaps helps explain why so many people would rather rage against politicians’ failings than accept that everyone has their limits.And that’s what, I suppose, Ardern’s film is really up against. It’s not just that the woman up in lights on the big screen is flawed. It’s that the rest of us, munching our popcorn judgmentally in the audience, are too.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsJacinda ArdernOpinionBoris JohnsonKeir StarmerRachel ReevesCoronavirusNew ZealandAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

That is most apparent when Australia finds itself pulled into another so-called “debate” about migration. This is usually sparked by populism or attempts to blame complex issues like housing affordability on our annual migrant intake.Across the country, recent rallies and commentary are blaming migrants for a range of woes, from the cost of living to housing supply. Politicians from various sides madesimilar claimsprior to the last federal election. We’re seeing a rise in far-right parties platformed on anti-immigration rhetoric and racism. This rhetoric feeds on genuine economic concerns but ignores the structural forces driving economic insecurity and undermines the right to dignity, security and equality for all.The opposition has been allowed to set the agenda. It’s an absurd situation that is debasing national politics | Julianne SchultzRead moreThe Coalition is reported to be working ona new policy to cut migration. There is nothing wrong with discussing migration levels. The issue is when we are not having honest discussions about the rights to housing, decent social security benefits and fair wages.The debate needs to be courageous enough to require the wealthy and corporations to give fairly to help realise those rights and to interrogate a crisis of systemic inequality.Taking the easy but misleading route of blaming migrants for economic insecurity only serves to stoke the already smouldering fires of racism. Migrants are dehumanised in this debate, and this racism has harmful impacts on their daily lives.When commentary repeatedly frames migrants as a burden, a threat or the reason for economic hardship, it reinforces stereotypes that have real consequences. It ignores the fact that migration has been a bedrock of our economic success and that migrants on average contribute far more than they receive. Such narratives have historically paved the way for cuts to social security for all, harsher migration policies and a political climate where compassion is treated as weakness. They shape public fear, not public understanding. And when fear grows, racism grows with it. We must ask ourselves: who benefits when communities are set against each other?3:33Factchecking protesters' claims of 'mass migration' into Australia – videoFor example, when racism is embedded in migration systems through visa uncertainty or inadequate workplace protection, it enables exploitation. Some employers take advantage of the fact that migrant workers may fear deportation or visa cancellation if they speak up. This means they can be paid less, work longer hours, or accept unsafe conditions as a means of survival. But this is not a “migrant problem”. It is a structural problem that affects the entire labour market. Underpayment in one part of the workforce drags wages down across the economy. It creates a false sense of job scarcity. It pits workers against each other while employers benefit. Migrant workers lose. Local workers lose. The only winners are those who profit from division and vulnerability.If we truly care about lifting living standards, improving wages and building a fairer future for everyone, then we must tackle the root causes of economic insecurity rather than scapegoat those who contribute enormously to our society. One of the ways of doing this is for the federal government to endorse thenational anti-racism frameworkwhich marks its one year anniversary this week. Strengthening wage protections, ensuring migrant workers can safely report exploitation and enforcing fair work laws – including a ‘positive duty’ where the onus is on employers to protect workers from racial discrimination – all benefit the entire workforce. When workers feel secure, when wages rise, when housing is affordable, when communities are thriving, racism loses its grip, and everyone wins.We need to focus on the systems that create poverty, instead of stigmatising people for being disadvantaged by them. If we tackle the real and complex problems that cause economic insecurity, we can reduce racism, while making systems fairer for everyone. Migration has always been part of Australia’s story. What matters now is whether we use it as a political tool that drives us apart and obscures the real problems, or whether we choose leadership that brings people together and improves the lives of all.Giridharan Sivaraman is Australia’s race discrimination commissionerExplore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumOpinionAustralian politicsInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

Can sledding and survival skills cure their social media-induced anxiety?Philip OltermannTue 25 Nov 2025 11.19 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 12.40 ESTShareNineteen-year-old Hege is stricken by all the common anxieties of her generation. She spends too much time scrolling through socials on her phone, and as a result she is obsessed with how other people perceive her, and highly stressed when it comes to interacting with real humans in the flesh. “I think a lot about what people think about me,” she says. “You get tired of it.”The young adult from Sandnes in the south-west ofNorwayis one of the three teenage protagonists of Folktales, a new documentary that proposes a refreshingly simple remedy for zoomer angst: “Give yourself a fire, a dog, and the starry sky above you.”So says one of the teachers at the educational establishment where Hege and her classmates are packed off to for 12 months: a “folk high school” in Pasvik in the northernmost corner of Europe, 200 miles above the Arctic circle. Here the students don’t sit in classes, they “wake up their Stone Age brains” by learning how to pitch a tent, keep themselves warm at minus 30C, and drive dog sleds across the icy landscape.Hege may still be overthinking things when she dons a pair of RayBans at her first campfire, but soon she goes hours without even remembering to check her mobile, and eventually there is nothing greater in the world to her than dashing through the snow on the back of a dog sled, her body racing but her mind finally standing still.View image in fullscreen‘The experience of complete self-reliance’ … RomainPhotograph: Magnolia Pictures/Everett/ShutterstockFolktales’ directors, the US film-makers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, say they became fascinated with the Scandinavian folk high school concept because its philosophy was so at odds with the priorities of the American education system. “I think the United States is very focused on data and outcomes,” says Ewing. “You take a test and you get graded and put on some kind of curve of how you did, and therefore many high school students are just studying for the tests.Dashing through the snow on a dog sled, Hege’s body is racing but her mind is finally standing still“At folk high schools like Pasvik, there are no tests, written or otherwise. They are about building character, becoming a more enhanced adult, and challenging yourself internally and socially. The idea that you should do something that may never contribute to your chances of earning a living in the future was really attractive for us.”In Europe, the folk high school philosophy may sound more familiar. Its founder, the 19th-century Danish pastor and poetNFS Grundtvig, may not be as much of a household name as other reformist educators such asMaria Montessorior the kindergarten inventor Friedrich Fröbel. But the legacy of Grundtvig’s core ideas – that education should be for everyone and not just the social elite, fostering not just abstract enlightenment but lived “enlivenment” – can be seen across the continent.In German-speaking Europe, it fuelled the spread ofvolkshochschulen,publicly funded adult education centres, while in the UK its philosophy lives on in the Duke of Edinburgh’s award scheme. There are folk high schools scattered across the Baltics, Poland and throughout Scandinavia. The concept caught on big time in Norway, where there are still 85 of them, hosting approximately 7,000 students every year. They are fee-paying – a year at Pasvik costs the equivalent of about £10,000 – but most Norwegian students get a study loan, 40% of which is covered by the government if they complete their course.Grady and Ewing first made a name for themselves withJesus Camp, their controversial 2006 documentary about an evangelical Christian summer camp. It outraged secular audiences with its unflinching depiction of what appeared to be the indoctrination of minors with radical Christian ideas (in one scene, children are urged in prayer to join the fight to end abortion in America). Folktales, by contrast, is less likely to inflame tensions. Shot in a Netflix-compatible style, with an abundance of drone shots and an awe-instructing soundtrack, the film in fact has a tendency to shave the edges off the folk high school experience. Much is made of the invigorating baths in the icy Barents Sea, the age-old wisdom of trees, and campfire husky cuddling – less so of themoose-shooting coursesthat Pasvik’s website also advertises. Norse mythology is woven through the film, though 40% of Norway’s folk high schools are Christian establishments. And the film inadvertently shows, but doesn’t comment on, something the Norwegian government bemoaned in arecent report: that folk high schools struggle to attract students from immigrant backgrounds.But the film does capture the kind of learning experiences that conventional schools simply aren’t designed to create. We follow Romain, an 18-year-old Dutch high-school dropout who is taught to make his own camp in the wilderness. Night is drawing in, the temperature is dropping fast, and Romain goes to the teachers’ camp to ask if he can use their fire to boil his water. “If we let you use our fire, we wouldn’t be helping you,” says the teacher. “I think you can do it”.It’s hard not to root for Romain as he struggles to hide his frustration in front of the camera: “You think I can do it, or you want me to do it?” he asks, politely but pointedly. But in the end, the young Dutchman manages to light his own fire, and towards the end of the film there is a suggestion that the experience of complete self-reliance unlocks in him an ability to improve his connection with other young people in his class. It’s evident that he has lived through something more than a glorified gap year.Folk high schools stress community and social interaction, in a world where there’s great emphasis on individualism“We knew that Romain and the other students were capable of making their camp,” Iselin Breivold, Pasvik’s dog-sled instructor, tells me. “But the conditions were harsher than when we practiced, and some of the students wanted to take shortcuts. And they don’t learn anything from taking shortcuts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But then they can’t, and they have a really big downfall.” The job of Breivold and her fellow teachers isn’t to solve problems for the young people but to encourage them to solve them themselves. “These are challenges you might never have accepted in life outside a folk high school. But there are challenges that make you develop as a human being, both personally, but also in how you see the world and the people around you.”View image in fullscreenStudents are encouraged to ‘wake up their Stone Age brains’ … Bjorn.Photograph: Magnolia Pictures/Everett/ShutterstockFolktales may make instructive viewing in Norway, where folk high schools have recently fallen out of favour with political decision-makers. The government is currently debating a change to a system that, up to now, credits folk high school graduates with two points they can use on their university applications. In a drive to boost the popularity of the Norwegian army, these extra points may in the future be given exclusively to those doing military service. A cut in scholarships, from 40% to 15% of the study loan, is also being debated.The Norwegian research centre Norce has embarked on a five-year project into whether this would all amount to the country dropping a powerful tool for social inclusion. “Like many countries across the globe, we have a growing problem with young people who are losing trust in society, and fall out of work,” says senior researcher Vigdis Sveinsdottir. “And in a world where there’s great emphasis on individualism, folk high schools stress community and social interaction in a way that often goes under the radar in mainstream education.”The kids of Jesus Camp, 10 years later: ‘Was it child abuse? Yes and no’Read moreHege’s story has an ambiguous ending in the film. While a year in the wild seems to have strengthened the young woman’s personality, her return to her home town comes with new frustrations, and she eventually opts to retreat back to the high north to train as a dog handler. The line between character-building adventures and escapism looks like a fine one.Do these young people come out of their folk high school experience better equipped to cope with the challenges of the modern world, I ask the directors? “It’s a tricky question, because of course part of the point is to evade the modern world,” says Ewing. “They’re definitely not better at managing ChatGPT or using AI. But they’re better equipped to be decent human beings who can maybe not shrink under pressure in the future.”Folktales is in UK and Irish cinemas and on digital platforms from 5 DecemberExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsYoung peopleNorwaySchoolsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After all, there isn’t much dramatic potential in shows about creatively flaccid people using ChatGPT to write woeful little Facebook updates. But that is not to say we haven’t come close.For years, fiction about AI tended to be exclusively about killer robots, but some shows have taken a more nuanced look at how AI will shape our lives over the next few years. Here are the best of them.8. HumansView image in fullscreenHorrifyingly prescient … Mia (Gemma Chan), Max (Ivanno Jeremiah) and Flash (Ritu Arya) in Humans.Photograph: Colin Hutton/Kudos/Wild Mercury/Channel 4As this Channel 4 sci-fi wore on, it headed more and more towards the killer robot trope, as the synthetic humans gained consciousness, realised how shabbily the human race had treated them, and sought revenge. But in the more contemplative first season, Humans revolved around the idea of how humanity and AI interact.

Person of InterestView image in fullscreenA race to the bottom? … Michael Emerson in Person of Interest.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyAnother slightly lazy thing for creators to do is to use AI as an all-knowing bogeyman, as the last two Mission: Impossible films proved. Jonathan Nolan’s Person of Interest narrowly avoided falling into this trap, even though it was about an artificial intelligence program designed to prevent crime before it is committed. Person of Interest became more relevant when it introduced a second, less scrupulous program that was determined to destroy the first. If you’ve ever looked on aghast at what seems like AI’s race to the bottom, this will resonate.6. DevsAlex Garland’s banger of a series took a leap when it predicted what AI could achieve by using machine learning to analyse every piece of data in the universe to map the entire past, present and future of human history. Given that today’s AI has roughly the same skills as a trainee copywriter, this may still be some years away. However, the culture that brought the technology into being – which favoured progress over ethics – does feel quite contemporary.5.

Obviously this hasn’t happened yet (give it six months), but it did a very unsettling job of showing how easy it would be, since every single thing we own seems to be connected to the internet. Emails were faked. Phones went down. Wifi-connected cars went haywire. I can’t remember if someone’s smart fridge ended up killing them, but frankly it’s only a matter of time.4. Years and YearsView image in fullscreenThings can only get worse? … Emma Thompson as Vivienne Rook in Years and Years.Photograph: Album/AlamyRussell T Davies wrote his dystopian thriller more than half a decade ago, but with every passing day it feels as if he is getting more and more right. The show predicted the Ukraine war, the pandemic, Trump’s second term and a populist rightwing leader keen to dismantle the BBC. Another running theme of the show is having characters who are forced into low-paid service work after their jobs are taken by AI. Which is depressing, but given that the show also features bombings and death camps, it could always get worse.3. Mrs DavisView image in fullscreenPlanet ravaging stuff … Betty Gilpin in Mrs Davis.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyOn the surface, Vince Gilligan’s new show Pluribus has a lot in common with Damon Lindelof’s 2023 series Mrs Davis. Both feature a woman determined to save the world from a force that seems to have united the rest of the world against her. In the case of Pluribus, an alien virus destroys individuality, replacing all of humanity with a single inanely cheerful consciousness. But in Mrs Davis, the threat was an all-knowing AI that people had willingly signed up for – even though it was ravaging the planet – because it made their lives marginally easier. Sound familiar?2.

The Capture depicted AI as a tool of propaganda, where governments could use deepfake technology to depict anyone doing anything, and the results were indistinguishable from reality. Again, this isn’t impossible to imagine – there are already TikTok deepfakes of Queen Elizabeth II having a tantrum in Greggs – but the thought of AI being used as a way to control the truth is far more frightening than any killer robot.1.

Will the returning Anthology project and Sam Mendes’s planned biopics create new arguments?Stuart MaconieTue 25 Nov 2025 07.26 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 17.44 ESTShareThe early notion of the Beatles as “four lads that shook the world” has been subject to many shifts in emphasis over the decades. They have been valorised, vilified, mythologised, misunderstood and even ignored. The release this month of the new Beatles Anthology – an expansion of the original mid-1990s compilation with CD, vinyl reissues and the documentary series streaming on Disney+ – is testament not just to their enduring appeal but also to how the constant reframing of their story reveals as much about our changing tastes. The 2025 edition arrives as a full-scale revisitation of the original project, bringing with it a remastered, expanded documentary series and a substantial reissue campaign.What is more likely to reshape the way we see the band, though, is the addition of a brand-new ninth episode to the original TV series, built from recently excavated footage of Paul McCartney,George Harrisonand Ringo Starr working together in 1994–95. Far more intimate and informal than the original broadcast, this material captures the three surviving Beatles rehearsing, reflecting and simply spending time as old friends rather than cultural monuments, albeit still with the “kid brother” tensions between Harrison and McCartney. They work on Free As a Bird and Now and Then, jokingly speculate on a stadium reunion tour and generally talk about their history, loss and their unfinished musical ideas. It’s a rare, humanising coda to the well-worn story. With new material like this, and with more than that axiomatic 50 years of distance since the Beatles dissolved in a blizzard of lawsuits and “funny paper”, are we finally approaching a unified theory of everything fab?View image in fullscreenOld friends rather than cultural monuments … Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in the 90s.Photograph: PROf the estimated 2,000-plus books about the Beatles – shelves groaning with both slavish hagiography and angry debunkings as well as whole volumes on their hair, their shoes and the Soviet mind-control programme they were allegedly involved in – Erin Torkelson Weber’s 2016 book The Beatles and the Historians, academic historiography written by a tenured professor at Newman University in Kansas, may seem less sexy than, say, Turn Me On, Dead Man: the Complete Story of thePaul McCartneyDeath Hoax; or Communism, Hypnotism and the Beatles. Among Beatles maniacs however, her “four narratives” theory has become much celebrated and discussed.View image in fullscreenA still from Anthology depicting the Beatles’ transformation from a five-piece to the Fab Four, which digitally altered an image of the group in Hamburg.Composite: PRFirst came the “Fab Four” narrative, prevailing during their lifetime. Breezy and celebratory, this foregrounded the positive, emphasising the joyous collective charm and energy of the early Beatles and glossing over drug use, sexual peccadilloes, Brian Epstein’s homosexuality and even John Lennon’s marriage to Cynthia. Hunter Davies’ authorised biography of 1968 is key here. Davies has a seasoned Fleet Street denizen’s enthusiasm for facts and detail – the £32,000 Ringo paid for his house in Weybridge in Surrey, the £17 a week Pete Best was earning in a bakery when Davies met him – rather than florid musings from the underground press.The “Lennon Remembers” narrative takes its name from a 21 January 1971 magazine interview and later book by Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner. With Lennon in a raw and corrosive frame of mind just three weeks after the dissolution of the Beatles, his bitter, self-pitying diatribe was either a planned purging of the suffocating Beatle myth or, as the comedian and Beatles fan Mitch Benn has tartly summarised it, John in full “messianic smackhead” mode (though in the interview Lennon claims to be no longer “hooked”). Here, he swipes at Harrison and McCartney and traduces loyal associates such as Neil Aspinall, Derek Taylor and George Martin. When the latter plaintively asked him in 1980 “What was all that shit about, John?” Lennon sheepishly replied that he was “out of me head”.Out of this grew what Torkelson Weber calls the “Shout!” narrative, a viewpoint named for Philip Norman’s 1981 biography wherein that author recasts the drama with Lennon as sainted rebel, McCartney a slick vaudevillian of industrious mediocrity and Harrison and Starr callously consigned to cameos as makeweights and tagalongs. It peddles the myth of genius versus craft, updated for the post-punk conscience and the sense of loss in the wake of Lennon’s murder. McCartney referred to it, with some justification, as “shite”.View image in fullscreenSainted rebel … John Lennon at a press conference in New York in 1968.Photograph: John Lindsay/APMore recently, we arrive at the “Lewisohn” narrative. Mark Lewisohn is generally regarded as the world’s pre-eminent Beatles authority and his approach is forensic, impartial, archival and driven by love of the music. He is deep into the research and writing of All These Years, his huge and magisterial three-volume Beatle biography, the second instalment of which is now in production, 12 years on from the first. Our knowledge of Shakespeare’s life is sketchy, opaque and hugely unsatisfactory. Lewisohn, often at his desk in Kent from 6am till the small hours, is determined that the same does not happen to our other great cultural export.“My interest is solely in getting the story right while there are still first-hand witnesses to what happened, to get at the truth if I can and let the rest fall away,” he tells me. “I have no agenda of any kind. I’m attempting to tell the story as neutrally as possible and to put down anything that I consider is relevant and interesting and propels the story forward. I’m taking my job seriously, but the Beatles were very funny people, so I want to be entertaining and reflect that. But I’m approaching it seriously in the sense of trying my very best to get it as right as possible while it’s still possible.”View image in fullscreenLong and winding story …Photograph: PRHis commitment is absolute; he has spent more than a year trying to have corrected one single sentence in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography’s entry on a Beatles associate, a Trinidadian calypso musician called Lord Woodbine, which inaccurately states the fledgling Beatles were once dubbed “Woodbine’s Boys”. (I’ve just checked and, sadly, it’s still there.)Times change. The “Beatle fatigue” of the early 70s calcified into something more openly hostile with the advent of punk: the group were viewed as bulwarks of irrelevant and toothless pop-lite and queasy nostalgia. “No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones” snarled the Clash in 1977, while Glen Matlock was said to have been sacked from Sex Pistols for daring to like the scouse moptops.Then, in the wake of Lennon’s murder, he became lionised at the expense of his peers, particularly McCartney, and (wrongly) seen as the group’s experimentalist and creative engine. This, as Lewisohn says, has now begun to swing the other way. “Post-assassination, we lived in a Lennon world and I guess that lasted about 15 years or so, during which Paul was diminished unfairly. I think that’s been corrected. If you stopped eight people in the street now and asked them to name a Beatle, they would say Paul first, I think – the result of him still being around and engaging in any number of projects which keep his name at the forefront.”Times change again. Happily in recent years, many more women such as Torkelson Weber have entered the realm of Beatles scholarship, scrutinising gender roles and masculinity in the music. Questlove, Nelson George and Yaw Owusu have written about the Beatles in relation to Black artists and Liverpool’s colonial history. In his brilliant documentaryThe Beatlesand India, Ajoy Bose examined how the culture of the Indian subcontinent changed – and was changed by – the band.View image in fullscreenNew wave band … (l to r) Harris Dickinson (John Lennon), Paul Mescal (Paul McCartney), Barry Keoghan (Ringo Starr), and Joseph Quinn (George Harrison) at a photocall for Sam Mendes’ forthcoming Beatles films.Photograph: John Russo/REX/ShutterstockThe Beatles magical history tour shows no signs of slowing. On the ceaseless tide of Beatle worship, scrutiny and scholarship, new waves break every day, and we can only speculate how they will shift the Beatles historiographical landscape. Philip Norman’s forthcoming biography of Epstein promises to refocus attention on the band’s earliest professional years, potentially reassessing his role not only as manager but as the architect of their public persona and their development into global cultural icons.Meanwhile, Sam Mendes’ ambitious plan for four interconnected biopics, each told from the perspective of a single Beatle, suggests a further decentralisation of that traditional “fab four” narrative. Early casting and production details indicate that the films may also give greater weight to the band members’ partners and familial relationships, foregrounding the women whose influence has often been marginalised in previous retellings. Maybe this will reshape how audiences understand individual motivations, creative dynamics, and the fluxes and pressures that eventually sundered the group.So, have we reached a “grand unified theory” – or are we simply in a period where certain interpretations feel temporarily settled? Lewisohn,Peter Jackson(and it must be said, Disney’s) imperious, authoritative perspective would suggest that but, as the lesson of Francis Fukuyama reminds us, those who confidently predict “the end of history” can wind up with egg on their faces. The constant arrival of new material, new perspectives and new technologies suggests that the band’s story remains fundamentally open-ended.Rather than closing the book, these projects may encourage us to see the Beatles not as fixed historical figures but as subjects whose meaning continues to evolve with each retelling. Philip Norman’s Shout! narrative may have fallen from critical favour, but at least two assertions in it still ring true. That the Beatles are “the greatest engine for human happiness the entertainment world has ever seen”, and that when you hear that word, a small black insect is the second thing you think of.This article was amended on 25 November 2025 to clarify that an image used was a still taken from Anthology which had digitally altered an old photograph.Explore more on these topicsThe BeatlesJohn LennonPaul McCartneyGeorge HarrisonRingo StarrfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A working-class mother driven to seek justice for her daughter in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. A modest, resilient woman finding dignity in lifeon the road in Nomadland.The actorFrances McDormand’sthree Oscar-winning performances display rare versatility but have empathy at their core. But qualities were on display last week when she joined the conceptual artistSuzanne Bocanegraat the opening of an exhibition featuring adult-sized cradles.McDormand’s and Bocanegra’s were the hands that rocked the cradle of Nancy Buchanan, 79, and 94-year-old Barbara T Smith, two doyennes of the Los Angeles art scene before Shaker lemon pie was served at Cradled, an exhibition inspired by the Shakers, a Christian sect formally known as the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing.Frances McDormand’s 10 best performances – ranked!Read moreThe Shakers are best known for their simple, communal lifestyle and ecstatic worship that included dancing and shaking (hence the name). Today the last active Shaker community in the world is located at Sabbath Day Lake in Maine,consisting of three members. But the group is gaining fresh attention.A new film,The Testament of Ann Lee, starsAmanda Seyfried as the woman who brought the Shakers from Britain to the American colonies in the 18th century. Cradled, at theHauser & Wirth Downtown Los Angelesgallery, highlights how the Shakers, who embraced celibacy and often sheltered more elders than children, developed a culture of end-of-life care.“Here’s a community where you are saved all the possessiveness, jealousy, enviousness – all the things that come along with carnal relations between men and women, men and men, women and women,” McDormand says from New York in a group Zoom call.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Keith Lubow“If you subtract that, how much more successful can a community be? Sometimes I get frustrated with the idea of, ‘Oh, they only lasted so long as they didn’t have children. They weren’t having sex; of course they weren’t successful.’ In fact, they were successful for 200 years because of that.”Bocanegra, who co-conceived and co-curated the exhibition, chimes in: “That’s what makes the cradle such an interesting object, because it’s something we associate with an infant and yet, for the Shakers, it was used more for adults and for the end of life.”The show features four Shaker cradles on loan from Shaker museums spanning the country from New England to Kentucky. Each is paired with a tableau of Shaker rocking chairs and woven baskets filled with projects so that visitors can take part in the literal and figurative act of mending, an activity at the heart of Shaker values.Sharon Koomler, collections manager atthe Shaker Museumin Chatham, New York, which drew on its archive for the show, observes: “The Shakers weren’t the only ones in the world using an adult cradle but we do find that it speaks to their tender care of people from the cradle to the grave, so to speak, from youth all the way through their advancing years and in their infirmities. It is a way to soothe someone.“From a former nursing background, I can tell you that rocking helps to prevent pressure sores because you’re not leaving anybody on one pressure point, so there’s a practical reason for it as well as the soothing emotional reason.”Jerry Grant, the museum’s director of library and collections, says: “It was a two-person activity, so it meant that if you were being rocked there was somebody with you. When you had Shakers who were ill or dying, they were not left alone. The cradle gives an opportunity for both people to have purpose in that relationship.”McDormand’s fascination with the Shakers grew out of a performance she gave forthe Wooster Group, a New York experimental theater company, based on an album of five Shaker women singing songs passed down through oral history. She became acquainted with Koomler and Grant of the Shaker Museum and staged a forerunner of the show at its pop-up gallery in Kinderhook, New York.McDormand explains: “I was drawn to the adult-sized cradles in the collection because it was something that was provocative in its size and in its use for the infirm and elderly. I was honoured to be asked to create something at the Kinderhook space. I had worked with Suzanne on some of her art lectures and she was one of the most interesting and funny conceptual artists I knew.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Keith LubowThe exhibition is designed to be an immersive, multi-sensory environment. Bocanegra and McDormand worked with the composer David Lang, and Skip Lievsay and Paul Umstron, sound editors, on an end-of-life lullaby that resonates throughout. Lang adapted the text for his “last lullaby” from a Shaker spiritual about eternal life.Asked how her career as a performer translates to the confines of a gallery, McDormand replies: “Well, I’m trying to do that as little as possible in my life, period, and also especially in this space. We enter the space and work is what informs the space, not performance. We’re trying to make it clear that people aren’t coming to a performance.It’s not performative; it’s more experiential.”Bocanegra adds: “We hope that people will feel free to be comfortable and sit.The audience decides how much time they want to spend with the piece and we try to make this installation the kind of thing where you felt like you were welcome and you could sit with it and you could contemplate and we’re hoping that the longer you stay, the more you get out of it.”The Shakers wereborn in Manchester in Britainbut were formally established in America after Mother Ann Lee and a small group of followers arrived in 1774. The movement flourished for more than 200 years.The Shakers were dedicated to pacifism, natural health and hygiene. Their philosophy is encapsulated in sayings such as, “Hands to work, hearts to God” and “Do your work as if you had a thousand years to live but as if you knew you might die tomorrow.” This focus on durable, useful craftsmanship, rather than decoration, resulted in an aesthetic of spare beauty.McDormand says:“If you look at Japanese design, you look at Scandinavian design, you look at mid-century modern, you look at early American, it’s not about decoration, it’s about utility. But because of that and because of the attention that’s given to it, it ends up being beautiful.”View image in fullscreenA cabinet card photograph of Shaker sisters Martha Jane Anderson, Grace Bowers, and Anna White in the North Family Sewing Room, Mount Lebanon, New York, circa 1890 – 1910.Photograph: Courtesy Shaker Museum, Chatham NYGrant chips in: “People will say, ‘I need to simplify my life.’ The Shakers would say simplicity is a singleness of heart. Making your life simpler was to keep yourself simply focused on one thing and not let it get all cluttered up. That’s a lesson that we can always learn. It’s not about just getting rid of the stuff in your house, it’s about what’s inside.”The Shakers were also highly entrepreneurial and self-sufficient. A surprising discovery in the museum archive wasa 1960s Barbie dolldressed in a custom Shaker outfit and created as a product for sale. At the same time they practiced charity, always planting a surplus to provide for their neighbours and those in need.McDormand reflects: “For some reason, people think religious sects are constantly seeking funds or taking a vow of poverty, but they they took care of themselves very well with seed collections and furniture and a lot of different things. One of them was doll clothes and so we saw one of the first Barbie dolls dressed in a Shaker outfit, which was exciting for us, being of our age group.”The actor and producer adds: “I like to call us Shaker-adjacent. There’s many of us that are Shaker-adjacent. We haven’t been thoroughly able to embrace the theology, necessarily, but certainly the ethos and the community spirit.”Cradled is on display at Hauser & Wirth in Los Angeles until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFrances McDormandArtReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her Teatro Oficina, in São Paulo, was named by this paper asthe best theatre in the world.Five hundred miles away is one of my favourite residential buildings,A la Ronde; an eccentric 16-sided home in Exmouth, Devon. It was designed in 1796 byJane and Mary Parminter(two “spinster” cousins, in the words of the National Trust) and relative John Lowder. The cousins, who were not professionals, had been inspired by their Grand Tour of Europe (an unusual undertaking for women at the time) and, in particular, theBasilica of San Vitalein Ravenna, Italy. The critic Lucinda Lambtondescribedthe cottage orné with Byzantine inflection as embodying “a magical strangeness that one might dream of only as a child”.View image in fullscreen‘Magical strangeness’ … A la Ronde.Photograph: Markfromexter/Wikimedia CommonsI thought of Bo Bardi and the Parminters when reading the recentreport by the Royal Institute of British Architects (the RIBA)which found that “stark displays of sexism” were pushing women out of the profession, stalling their progress within it, or putting them off entering it altogether. The RIBA’s chief executive officer, Dr Valerie Vaughan-Dick –the first woman CEO in the organisation’s almost 200-year-old history– said that the report, which documented sexual harassment (including stalking and groping), unequal pay (a16% gender gap), unsociable hours, and pervasive power imbalances, makes for “uncomfortable reading”.It comes two decades after a seminal2003review explored an exodus of women from architecture. Clearly, the industry hasn’t sufficiently renovated itself. More women are studying the subject at university, but just31% of architectsregistered with the Architects’ Registration Board (2022) andunder a quarterof RIBA chartered members are female. Increasingly, the retention issue overshadows the recruitment one. In a2017 surveyby Dezeen, just 10% of senior positions in the 100 largest architecture firms worldwide were held by women. The result is the unfortunate truth that the achievements of some of our finest architects are made even more impressive on the basis of their sex.There’sKazuyo Sejimaand her confident but mercurial buildings which mirror the moods of their natural surroundings: aluminium coruscates in the bright sun and shimmers in the rain; theconsidered “reflective cloud”of her 2009 Serpentine Gallery pavilion (with Ryue Nishizawa) seamlessly integrated with Hyde Park.Mariam Issoufou, a Niger-born architect works with sustainable local materials and resources – compressed earth bricks, rubber wood, palm leaves – to produce handsome libraries and housing estates in her native country and elsewhere.View image in fullscreenHolding its own against flashier neighbours … The Broad Museum in Los Angeles, designed by Liz Diller.Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/ReutersLiz Diller’s work is porous and community-focused – her greatest triumph, in my opinion, is New York’s extremely popularHigh Line, a 2km elevated linear park along an abandoned freight viaduct. Meanwhile, her Broad Museum in Los Angelesholds its ownacross the street from Frank Gehry’s better knownWalt Disney Concert Hall.Architecture has long been considered one of the most misogynistic of fields, whether it’s due to the stereotype of mathematics being for boys or women are solely suited to soft furnishings. This is reflected in day-to-day praxis: on-site PPE which is too large, rarefied cliques, and emails which begin with the salutation “gentleman”. As one of the best architects of the past 30 years, the late Zaha Hadid onceput it: “I am not part of this boys’ network … there are places men can go and women can’t, like those gentlemen’s clubs, or guys asking each other to play golf.”Of course, buildings have long been built by andformen. Le Corbusier’s famedUnité d’habitation, as stunning as the typology is, was designed according to his ideal figure of anthropometric scale. He called this “theModulor Man” – inspired somewhat by Da Vinci’s Vitruvian man – except Le Corbusier based his on a “6ft British policeman” (despitenever building anythingin Britain). This imaginary PC Plod dictated everything from the heights of handles to the dimensions of staircases.View image in fullscreenZaha Hadid’s Phaeno Science Center in Wolfsburg.Photograph: Colin Walton/AlamyIt isn’t just that buildings’ functionality was designed with men in mind, but that they adhered to ostensibly inherently “male” qualities of form and character – hard steel, austere wood-panelling, the rawness ofBéton brut. The most obvious example isphallic skyscrapers; certainly more common than Hadid’s football stadium in Qatar which was mocked forresembling a vulva(she disagreed, but honestly: it does. Then again,so does a stadiumin the same country by Albert Speer Jr).Accordingly, mainstream cultural depictions of architects are mainly hyper-masculine; the brooding Adrien Brody with sleeves rolled up inthe three-hour epic The Brutalist, for instance. The protagonist of Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead, Howard Roark, is an early archetype of the egotistical starchitect (or bro-chitect). Here’s an excerpt channelling Roark: “These rocks, he thought, are here for me: waiting for the drill, the dynamite and my voice; waiting to be split, ripped, pounded, reborn; waiting for the shape my hands will give them.”The hypothesis that unadorned concrete or clean lines are “male” by default is, of course, reductive.Denys Lasdunis one of my favourite architects, and this is not because I think of structural clarity as a signifier of a “male” propensity to lucidity. I’m afraid the (gorgeous) work of Mies van der Rohe does not call to mind the defined pecs ofDoryphoros. Likewise, though Oscar Niemeyer oncesaidhis gorgeous, fluent curves were partly inspired by “the body of the beloved woman”, I imagine a flesh-and-blood woman with the same proportions might topple over. Hadid, often called the “queen of the curve” had her designs compared to the female form, even though she frequently referenced the abstract art ofKazimir Malevichas an influence and not Jessica Rabbit.So does the sex of an architect even matter, aside from the obvious failure of equity? Yes. More women in the profession means that buildings and urban environments increasingly reflect the lived experience of women, style aside. In the 1980s, the women of the London-based activist collectiveMatrix, tired of struggling with prams up steps or hurrying through unlit underpasses, campaigned for and realised a cityscape more attuned to the way women lived.It isn’t that childcare and shopping and domestic labour should be the domains of women, but while these inequities and disparities exist they should be acknowledged and catered for (and that goes for the needs of older people, or those with disabilities or neurodivergence, too).There is alsoresearch which showsthat companies with greater gender diversity on boards tend to generate higher profits. When it comes to architecture specifically – though it’s salient to avoid the diametric of the gender stereotype that resulted in hard, cold crystalline surfaces supposedly reflecting the temperament of men – roundtables from within the industry dosuggestthat women’s key strengths include working more collaboratively and inclusively, and communicating in a more effective way with clients.In the past, even where female and non-binary architects’ contributions have been foundational to acclaimed projects, their input has been overlooked. Two of the most recognised architects in the UK, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, cut their teeth witha firmco-established in 1963 alongside three women. One of whom, as the only licensed architect at that time among the group, was the sole reason the firm was allowed to practice. But few know the names of Georgie Wolton, Su Brumwell and Wendy Cheesman (or assistant Sally Appleby).Frank Lloyd Wright is one of the world’s most lionised architects – for good reason, the guy built multiple masterpiece iterations of my dream home – but the Prairie School style was heavily reliant on his first employee, Marion Mahony Griffin. Half of the lithographs in Lloyd Wright’sWasmuth Portfolioare the work of Mahony Griffin, despite Lloyd Wright’s attempts to claim otherwise.View image in fullscreenThe work of Georgie Wolton, who co-founded an early practice with Norman Foster and Richard Rogers.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverEileen Gray’s iconicE-1027 houseon the shores of Cape Martin in France, meanwhile, filled with her original and innovative furniture designs, was left to fall into disrepair – and not before Le Corbusier himself had vandalised it. (Le Corbusier and Lloyd Wright: excellent buildings, unbearable personalities.)In 2013, apetitionfailed in its attempt to have Denise Scott Brown retroactively awarded the Pritzker prize; it had been awarded solely to her husband Robert Venturi in 1991, despite the fact Scott Brown had been co-principal at the practice for 22 years. (Just six womenhave won the prize in its history, including Sejima and Hadid.) And I’ve lost count of the number of people who think both of theEameseswere men.View image in fullscreenDenise Scott Brown, photographed in 1978.Photograph: Lynn GilbertThe preponderance of women architects needs to improve then, not just to give due credit for, and make tangible, the aesthetic creativeness and beauty of their designs, but to facilitate the real-life actualities of half of the human population. The gradual culture shift within the field that fosters teamwork, better dialogue with clients and considerations of inclusivity, is testament to the fact that more women following in the footsteps of the greatNorma Merrick Sklarekand her fellow trailblazers is important. Women are increasingly advancing in other workplaces thanks to flexible and remote working, mentorship programmes, hiring reforms and the changing nature of networking events. Architecture must build on that.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArchitectureWomenZaha HadidThe RIBAfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But who cares when the work is so sublime you can hear the squelching and smell the river?Adrian SearleTue 25 Nov 2025 10.14 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 14.38 ESTShareTurner or Constable: who’s the boss? Tate Britain’s exhibition of work by the two artists, subtitled Rivals and Originals, fudges the question. Born a year apart and both alumni of the Royal Academy schools in London, each was keenly aware of what the other was doing, in a British art world that was as febrile and competitive, if immeasurably smaller, than it is today (although you should try the Italian Renaissance if you want full-blooded rivalries and enmities). Sometimes, they sought the same collectors and painted the same subjects. Turner was encouraged from an early age by his father, a Covent Garden wigmaker and barber; Constable was the son of a Suffolk mill owner and grain merchant who wanted him to take over the family business.As well as their contrasting backgrounds, their temperaments could not have been more different. A scene fromMike Leigh’s 2014 film Mr Turner, starring Timothy Spall as Turner and James Fleet as Constable, plays in the show, presenting the two painters bickering on Varnishing Day at the Royal Academy in 1832. Turner added a touch of red, in the form of a buoy, to his seascape Helvoetsluys; the City of Utrecht, 64, Going to Sea in order to upstage Constable’s The Opening of Waterloo Bridge, on which the painter had been working for more than a decade. But whatever their rivalry entailed, it was hardly the odd-couple bromance between Van Gogh and Gauguin depicted in the 1956 Vincente Minnelli movie Lust for Life (Gauguin: “You paint too fast!” Van Gogh: “You look too fast!”). It is worth remembering that Constable once wrote in a letter: “Did you ever see a picture by Turner, and not wish to possess it?”View image in fullscreenTurner’s Dolbadern Castle, North Wales, 1800.Photograph: Royal Academy of Arts, LondonThe last time these two paintings were brought together was at the Royal Academy in 2019, and Helvoetsluys, owned by the Tokyo FujiArtMuseum, is not included in the current show. But we do have Constable’s folding sketching chair and sections of Turner’s fishing rod and a reel as well as various palettes, paintboxes and other paraphernalia belonging to each artist. And painting after painting after painting, watercolours and sketches from throughout their careers.Compare Turner’s Dolbadern Castle, North Wales, 1800, with its looming tower silhouetted against a boiling evening sky and its allusions to 13th-century struggle for Welsh independence (and the threat of the French Revolution spreading across the Channel), and Constable’s diploma work submitted to the RA 29 years later, which shows a man opening a lock to allow a boat passage upriver. This is a painting of two men and a dog, a view across the meadows beside a working river, some trees, a distant church and a tremendous sky with a passing rain shower. Turner’s painting is extraordinary and portentous, while Constable’s celebrates an everyday, although now vanished world. I can almost smell the river.View image in fullscreenA Boat Passing a Lock, 1826, by John Constable.Photograph: Heritage Image Partnership /AlamyConstable invites the eye to wander from the squelching underfoot to a distant lowland horizon, and to imagine things that cannot be seen as the river bends out of sight. Turner has you cowering in the gloom beneath the castle on its promontory. His “sublime” becomes a predilection for drama and vaporous emptiness, whereas Constable’s paintings are filled with stuff: carts, posts, locks, windmills, cottages, churches, cathedrals, river boats, horses, donkeys, sheep, bargees and people fishing; reeds, burdock, willows, cornfields, hedges, elms, oaks, weather, rainbows and clouds. Constable was drawn to “the sound of water escaping from Mill dams, Willows, old rotten Banks, slimy posts, & brickwork. I love such things … As long as I do paint I shall never cease to paint such Places.”Turner, who travelled further, gives us mountain passes, wild seas, steamboats and coal barges and the atmospheric pollution ofLondonand the Black Country. He paints the burning of the Houses of Parliament, disasters at sea and incomprehensible painted storms. He painted Noah’s ark on the evening of the deluge and a mashup of Goethe’s theory of light and colour with Light and Colour (Goethe’s Theory) – the Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis, depicting Moses sitting in a sort of bubble, floating in the ether. Turner paints figures that are as inept as those of his beloved Baroque landscape painter Claude Lorrain. Turner’s all over the place. His 1832 Staffa, Fingal’s Cave, has the sun like a billiard ball resting on the horizon, the basalt rocks far on the left picking up the last rays, as the rain moves through, along with the steamboat’s trail of smoke. This is great, but then he goes and paints The Golden Bough, an absurd concoction with figures in a hazy landscape, and decorous pines planted hither and thither, and the little votive sculpture in its blue niche in the rock.View image in fullscreenJMW Turner, Keelmen Heaving in Coals by Moonlight, 1835.Photograph: Studio A/National Gallery of Art, Washington, Widener Collection.When Turner paints Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps in 1812 he pictures Hannibal sitting on his elephant on the horizon, a tiny detail in the huge canvas. The distant animal, with its trunk raised, looks as threatening as a teapot. And what of the lumpen extras in the bottom right-hand corner? It is like a high fantasy CGI scene from a movie, more Lord of the Rings than Gladiator, though Turner was thinking of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was often compared to Hannibal. I gawp but don’t care. Where’s my popcorn? Even the title reads like a bit of superimposed text in a movie.Turner liked the specificity of the titles he gave some of his more grandiose, clamorous scenes. They lent a certain veracity to all that painted chaos. In 1842 he painted Snow Storm – Steam-Boat Off a Harbour’s Mouth Making Signals in Shallow Water, and Going By the Lead. It is inscribed: “The Author was in this Storm on the Night the Ariel left Harwich.” We are lost amid the brown filth from the smokestack, the spume and snow, and heaving sea, the flag signalling how lost we are. Somehow, we have to negotiate all this. When he is specific, Turner is great.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another contemporary, the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich might have coveted this little scrap of unstretched canvas. Constable’s skittering, glittering highlights in his later paintings, those little scrapes and spots and flecks of white that seem detached from any object aerate his worked and reworked canvases and make something entirely fixating of the passing world.View image in fullscreenHampstead Heath With a Rainbow, 1836, by Constable.Photograph: TateBut this feeling was already there in Constable’s cloud studies, painted in the early 1820s. Birds wheeling, clouds billowing and sagging, layered banks of greenish, greyish and bluish cloud, clouds flaring and underlit by the setting sun, rain-heavy clouds and others almost dissolving, clouds with luminous edges and clouds reduced to a few pattering, indistinct marks, massing in gradations of lighter and darker touches. I prefer these small and almost casual studies (yet how specific they are!) to almost anything else in the entire exhibition. They feel suspended in the here and now as much as they record a particular day almost 200 years ago. At his best, Turner could be just as exact, especially at his most offhand, but Constable touches me more.Turner & Constable: Rivals & Originals is atTate Britain, London, 27 November to 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtJMW TurnerJohn ConstableExhibitionsTate BritainLondonreviewsShareReuse this content"

It resulted in a career path like no otherJimmy Cliff: A life in picturesTue 25 Nov 2025 08.42 ESTLast modified on Tue 25 Nov 2025 10.45 ESTShareWhenJimmy Cliffdied, reggae and the music world in general lost one of its most accomplished opportunists. The less sympathetic might have called him a chancer, but from the very beginnings there was little he wouldn’t try if he thought it would advance either himself or the music. Over the years I got to know him, both from interviews and sometimes just hanging out, so many of his anecdotes ended with the words: “Well I wasn’t going to say no, was I?” I wasn’t fully joking when I told him it should be his catchphrase.But that was Jimmy Cliff, a charismatic combination of charm, bravery, humour and an ability to see beyond what was put in front of him. Throughout his career he frequently shifted away from standard reggae industry practice, often expanding the music’s horizons and options.This was true at the start of his career when he saw an opportunity to establish himself as a singer outside the cutthroat world of the Kingston sound systems where artists made records to be played in dances rather than for sale. The 17-year-old talked Leslie Kong, a Chinese Jamaican who owned an ice-cream-parlour-cum-record-shop-cum-cosmetics-boutique called Beverley’s into starting his own label: “I wrote a song called Dearest Beverley and sang it to him in the shop the next day. He loved my voice … so he asked me how he could get into making records. I knew all the musicians and the studios, I knew the business. So I could help him.” Under Kong and Cliff’s guidance, Beverley’s became a very successful and influential label.Jimmy Cliff: a life in picturesRead moreA few years later he took the chance to move to London, immersed himself in the pop music of the day, absorbing new song structures and ideas to apply to the Jamaican music that was already evolving from ska to rocksteady to reggae. He always maintained this helped him develop as a songwriter and allowed him to take Jamaican music into a much more international situation without losing touch with what it was or should be.In the late 1960s such broad-mindedness gave music critics something of a problem. With the Trojan Explosion of perky strings-backed reggae hitting the charts and the first stirrings of roots and culture yet to reach the mainstream, the music was largely dismissed as essentially worthless (BBC Radio 1 was a significant offender). Cliff, however, was releasing thoughtful, well-rounded songs that acknowledged the musical environment outside Kingston, in LP format – this was years before Jamaican music came to terms with albums as anything more than collections of singles. His albums Jimmy Cliff and Another Cycle (1969 and 1971, the latter recorded in the US) contained the likes of Sitting in Limbo, Vietnam, Many Rivers to Cross and Wonderful World, Beautiful People, and confused the hell out of reviewers – this was reggae, Jim, but not as we know it.View image in fullscreenJimmy Cliff pictured around the time of The Harder They Come.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockIt was work of this calibre that attracted The Harder They Come’s director/writer Perry Henzell to approach him to do the music for the film. When Cliff’s evolved and varied reggae was put into context with Henzell’s vivid visuals they made perfect sense; suddenly, assessments of many of the same songs were being rowed back, and Jimmy Cliff was now at the heart of one of the world’s bestselling soundtrack albums. He was always very proud of his part in introducing the world to Jamaica “as it really was” through this, as well as the music he made well into the 21st century which, always looking outwards, maintained his international acclaim.His time in London in the 1960s also offered another example of Cliff’s resourcefulness. About to be evicted from his bedsit after his landlady found out she had “a coloured” living under one of her roofs, she saw him in the audience on Top of the Pops – they were recruited from London discos where he was very much on the scene – dancing next to Nina Simone as she performed. “I told her she couldn’t evict me because I was famous – and she agreed! So much for racism when it comes up against celebrity.”It was also in London that he met Henzell. What transpired, and the way Cliff laughed through the recollection, goes a long way to summing up who he was and how he approached life:“He asked me if I could write music for films. I said: ‘Yeah man, of course I can!’ It was like being back in Kong’s ice-cream shop – you’ve got to know your opportunities! Then six months later Chris Blackwell gave me the script and told me Perry wanted me for the lead part. I’d never acted before, but I took it, read it and liked it, I could identify with both sides of it, I knew Rhygin [the real-life model for Ivan in the movie], I understood that aspect of Jamaican life, and I’d been in the music business since I was 14. It didn’t seem like anything I couldn’t do.“And besides, I wasn’t going to tell them no, was I?”Explore more on these topicsJimmy CliffReggaePop and rockJamaicacommentShareReuse this content"

Lessening their legendary volume, though, would reduce the impact of theMy Bloody Valentinelive show as a multi-sensorial, physical and musical experience. You wouldn’t experience every bass drum like a heartbeat, undergo the peculiar, otherworldly sensation of a ribcage rattling with sound or – during the encore – a noise so ferocious that it feels as if a gale force wind is flapping at your clothes.My Bloody Valentine are, of course, credited with inventing shoegaze, the ethereal, dreamlike, effects-laden genre that has been rediscovered by the TikTok generation. However, at times here they seem to have more in common with noise warriors such as Einstürzende Neubaten than the drippier home counties combos that followed them.That said, at the centre of the maelstrom there is an undeniable prettiness – in co-vocalist/guitarist Bilinda Butcher’s gentle singing, or the lovely melodies that somehow make themselves distinct amid be-hatted singer/guitarist Kevin Shields’ walls of shrieking sound. Such unfathomably but beautifully intermeshing textures are driven relentlessly by the rock solid rhythm section of bassist Debbie Googe and tireless drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig.View image in fullscreenWalls of shrieking sound … Kevin Shields.Photograph: Isaac WatsonThat their tours come along as rarely as comets – this is the first for seven years – makes the Irish-English band sound even more special and unique. It is startling to think that they first unleashed this sound in pubs, not the cavernous venues with eye-melting visuals they occupy nowadays. The near two-hour show traces their journey towards a form of aural sculpture.Shields dedicates 1990’s landmark Soon – the song which took the indie-dance beat to the cosmos – tolate Stone Roses bassist Mani(“he loved this”) but the power fails, and when they play the song again it fails a second time. Still, a subsequent two-minute gap doesn’t kill the momentum or reduce the need for those earplugs. The pulverising several-minute middle section of pure noise during astonishing closer You Made Me Realise is surely the closest guitar, bass and drums come to the sound of an apocalypse.AtOVO Arena, London, 25 November; and OVO Hydro, Glasgow, 27 November.Explore more on these topicsMy Bloody ValentinePop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

French media said the arrests included the last remaining alleged member of the four-person gang who broke into the museum.Citing police sources,Le Parisien newspaper saidthe suspected thief had been detained on Tuesday morning by anti-gang squad officers and was being held at police headquarters. He faced charges of organised theft and criminal conspiracy.The suspect had a criminal record and was linked to the three alleged members of the gang who had already been arrested and were under formal investigation, all of whom had ties to the Paris suburb of Aubervilliers, Le Parisien said.The alleged thieves parked a stolen truck outside the museum and used an extendable ladder and freight lift to reach the first-floor window of the Apollo gallery in the 19 October theft, one of the most spectacular heists in recent French history.Two people smashed an unsecured window and two glass display cases in the gallery before descending in the lift and fleeing on motorbikes driven by two others in a brazen daylight heist that lasted less than seven minutes from start to finish.The gang fled with eight pieces, including an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon Bonaparte gave to his second wife, Marie Louise, and a tiara set with 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds that once belonged to the wife of Napoleon III.View image in fullscreenA tiara worn by Empress Eugénie was among the pieces taken in the raid.Photograph: Danita Delimont/AlamyNone of the jewels have so far been recovered.

Linehan’s lawyer, Sarah Vine KC, asked that he be given 28 days to pay the full amount.The trial heard that Brooks had begun taking photographs of delegates at the event during a speech by Fiona McAnena, the director of campaigns at Sex Matters, a UK gender-critical campaign group.Outside the event, the activist asked Linehan: “Why do you think it is acceptable to call teenagers domestic terrorists?”In response, the court heard that Linehan had called Brooks a “sissy porn-watching scumbag”, a “groomer” and a “disgusting incel”, with the complainant responding: “You’re the incel, you’re divorced.”The judge found that Linehan had taken Brooks’s phone because he was “angry and fed up”, and had damaged it by knocking it to the ground. She said that while the offence was not aggravated by the fact the complainant was transgender, it was because they were 17 years old at the time.She ruled that she was “not sure to the criminal standard” that Linehan had demonstrated hostility based on the complainant being transgender. She added that she did not find the complainant “was as alarmed or distressed” as they had portrayed themself.The prosecutor Julia Faure Walker told the court that Linehan had written “repeated, abusive, unreasonable” social media posts about Brooks, whom he referred to as Tarquin.Vine said: “The background of this case involves what I would describe as provocative conduct by the complainant, and the raising of allegations in the service of, broadly speaking, political point-scoring.”She added that the costs to Linehan had “been enormous”, and resulted from a “momentary lapse of control” which led to behaviour that “could not be described as beyond reproach”.The comedy writer, who has well-publicised strong views on gender issues, said his “life was made hell” by trans activists, adding that the complainant was a “young soldier in the trans activist army”.The writer added: “He was misogynistic, he was abusive, he was snide. He depended on his anonymity to get close to people and hurt them, and I wanted to destroy that anonymity.”He told journalists outside the court that he hoped the not guilty verdict would mean that “people in the future won’t be subject to those kind of tactics”.Explore more on these topicsGraham LinehanTransgenderFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

The asking price: $25m.The Stahl family, which has owned the home for its entire 65-year history, shared a statement on the decision to sell, saying the property had become too difficult to maintain.“This home has been the center of our lives for decades, but as we’ve gotten older, it has become increasingly challenging to care for it with the attention and energy it so richly deserves,”wroteBruce and Shari Stahl, the children of the original owners.They added that the time had come to find a new “steward” of the house – “someone who not only appreciates its architectural significance but also understands its place in the cultural landscape of Los Angeles and beyond”.View image in fullscreenThe Stahl house was ‘avant-garde, modern and unthinkable in terms of how it was built on that site’.Photograph: Julius Shulman/J Paul Getty Trust. Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (2004.R.10)The origins of the Stahl house date to May 1954, when CH “Buck” and Carlotta Stahl bought a hilly patch of land in the then undeveloped Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles for $13,500.Although the Stahl house became a famous symbol of Los Angeles, “nobody famous ever lived here”, Buck oftensaid, calling his family a “blue-collar family living in a white-collar house”. Buck worked as a graphic designer and sign painter, and he and Carlotta transported concrete from city construction projects to the property on their weekends.Buck created the original design for the Stahl house over the summer of 1956, though many architects were originally wary to build it on the precarious hillside. In November 1957, the Stahls interviewed the architect Pierre Koenig, who agreed to undertake the task.With the support of the Case Study program, a project spearheaded by the editor of Arts &Architecturemagazine, John Entenza, the Stahls received subsidies to hire Koenig.The modernist program “was about experimentation” and “using new materials and building in places that maybe previously the technology didn’t really allow”, said Adrian Scott Fine, the president and chief executive of the Los Angeles Conservancy. “All those things are wrapped up into a place like the Stahl house, which was avant-garde, modern and unthinkable in terms of how it was built on that site that everyone else thought, at the time, was unbuildable.”View image in fullscreenIn 1999, the City of Los Angeles declared the house a historic-cultural landmark, and in 2013 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a property considered worthy of protection.Photograph: Julius Shulman/J. Paul Getty Trust. Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (2004.R.10)The Stahl house became Case Study house No 22, and construction began in May 1959. According to the family, construction cost “a mere $37,500” and the home was move-in ready by May 1960. The result was “an idealized version of what everyone thinks LA is and should be”, said Fine.Soon after construction was finished, the architectural photographerJulius Shulmantook perhaps the most famous image of the home. Taken through the floor-to-ceiling glass windows,the photo featurestwo women seated in the home’s living room but appearing to float over the Los Angeles skyline.“I think the enduring impact of Shulman’s photo is due to the way it conveys an idea about living in Los Angeles, an ambivalence about being both in the city and removed from it,” said Kevin Daly, founder of Kevin Daly Architects and an adjunct professor at the University ofCaliforniaLos Angeles school of architecture and urban design.The home made historic appearances in film, television and music videos, including Playing by Heart (1998), Galaxy Quest (1999) and Nurse Betty (2000).In 1999, Los Angeles declared the Stahl house a historic-cultural landmark, and in 2013, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a property considered worthy of protection.View image in fullscreenThe Stahl house had made numerous appearances in TV and film.Photograph: Julius Shulman/J. Paul Getty Trust. Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (2004.R.10)The home remains open for tours, as it has been for the past 17 years, although all are currently sold out through February. In their statement announcing the sale of the home, the family said they would give “ample notice” before discontinuing the tours.Thelistingfor the home emphasizes finding a buyer who will preserve the character of the space.“For collectors of design, patrons of architecture, or institutions seeking to safeguard an American masterpiece, there is simply nothing comparable,” the listing reads. “This is not merely a sale; it is a passing of responsibility – a search for the next custodian who will honor the house’s history, respect its architectural purity, and ensure its preservation for generations to come.”View image in fullscreenThe house was described as ‘an idealized version of what everyone thinks LA is and should be’.Photograph: Julius Shulman/J. Paul Getty Trust. Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (2004.R.10)Fine agreed that the choice of buyer would be an important one, given the home’s history.“I think any time a longtime owner, and a stewardship like this, is transferring hands of a property like this, it always gives us a little bit of a pause – because you never know what the next owner, what their intentions will be. And will they understand and appreciate the house, as in this particular case the Stahl family has?”This article was amended on 25 November 2025 to clarify that the National Register of Historic Places is a listing of places that deserve preservation but does not actually provide any protection for those places.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

Four books deep, this gargantuan work of supernatural existentialism is an unsettling account of the occult phenomena that attend the appearance in the sky of a bright new star. Mysteries from the first three volumes include: who killed the musicians in the forest? What’s going on with the local wildlife? Why does no one seem to be dying any more? By the end of The School of Night, the most burning question may sound comparatively mundane:who isKristian Hadeland?Scattered references appeared in the saga’s first 2,000 pages. Kristian Hadeland was the 67-year-old man buried without mourners by doubting priest Kathrine Reinhardsen inThe Morning Star(2021). InThe Third Realm(2024), he was the sinister chap hitching a lift with Kathrine’s husbandafterthe unloved man she buried is supposed to have died.The School of Night offers another answer. Here, Kristian Hadeland is the author of a 500-page suicide note, and the misanthropic narrator of a compellingly nasty novel. From the remote Norwegian island where he’s preparing to end his life, Kristian sets down the story of how he got there, starting with his time as a photography student in mid-1980s London.Young Kristian has a good eye and self-belief, even if – as a visiting professor suggests – his photos are “a bit dull. Without temperament.” Soon after arriving from Norway, he meets the enigmatic Hans, a Dutch artist into artificial intelligence, and Vivian, who is staging a production of Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus; he develops an uneasy friendship with the former and a hostile sexual relationship with the latter. Kristian is reflexively unpleasant, quick to disdain everyone and everything from homeless people to old women in jeans and coffee with milk.When Kristian is home for Christmas, he’s antagonistic towards his family, too. After his sister overdoses, he hears his father describing him as “a black hole … a narcissist, through and through”. Outraged, he returns to London, retreating into himself. He cycles through the rain in a cityscape that resembles a graveyard. He steals a dead cat from a vet’s, planning to photograph its skeleton. Like so many of Knausgård’s men, he drinks a lot. Then a chance encounter with a homeless man sets Kristian on a path from near ruin to staggering glory.The Faustus subplot indicates Knausgård’s literary model as well as providing an interpretive lens for the reader. When the central crisis of the story is resolved thanks to a mysterious intervention by the Mephistophelean Hans, Kristian’s abilities as a photographer are miraculously transformed. “Every photograph seemed incandescent, it was as if I was being carried forward by some momentous force,” Kristian writes. Twenty-four years later, we find Kristian finalising a retrospective of his work at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. But then, his life and success begin to unravel.Knausgård’s assertion that he barely plans or edits his work may unsettle those who have ventured this far in the series, not to mention repelling readers who are yet to startKnausgård’s assertion that he barely plans or edits his work may unsettle those who have ventured this far, not to mention repelling readers who are yet to start. Each new instalment in the Morning Star cycle has contributed to a sense more of creeping entropy than grand design; and it’s not clear how The School of Night fits into the bigger picture – if thereisone. Thenexttwovolumes, already out in Norway, seemingly focus on the Løyning family first introduced inThe Wolves of Eternity(2023). Are the anachronisms and inconsistencies in the text deliberate, features of a superstructure beyond rationalism whose outline is still only partially visible? How else, when their birth dates don’t align, could the protagonist of The School of Night be the man Kathrine buries in The Morning Star?Other readers will be drawn into kabbalistic exegesis. I found myself translating Danish Reddit threads, examining Norwegian ferry schedules to trace Kristian’s movements, and scouring the classics to understand how the Faustus story may illuminate the world of The Morning Star. When Marlowe’s Faustus asks Mephistopheles, “How comes it, then, that thou art out of hell?” and the demon replies, “Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it”, it’s as good a description of the bleak universe Knausgård has created.As in the first three books, the author’s philosophical preoccupation with death is a constant, expressed through the tension between an instinctual materialism and the haunting possibility of something beyond comprehension. It’s a tension Kristian seems to want to ignore, yet he is unable to explain Hans’s strange agency in his life, let alone the Dutchman’s sudden diabolical appearance at a pivotal moment at the end of part one: “Abruptly, he threw back his head and stared into the sky, the orbs in his sockets rolled white. Three times in quick succession his mouth opened and closed like a fish’s.” Close readers may recall the same convulsion afflicting Jesper, the musician suspected of murdering his three bandmates in a satanic bloodbath, in the chilling final pages of The Third Realm. Intimations of the supernatural give the saga much of its momentum and uncanny frisson. But can the mystery be indefinitely sustained?‘I knew I was doing something I shouldn’t’: Karl Ove Knausgård on the fallout from My Struggle and the dark side of ambitionRead moreSome readers won’t be persuaded. Knausgård’s prose is sometimes not just erratic but incoherent; even fans will concede that you don’t read him for the beauty of his sentences. Besides, 500 pages in Kristian’s hateful company is a lot to handle – and getting the most from The School of Night entails thousands of pages of background reading. (You will need to have paid close attention to experience as a thrill the revelation that the house where Kristian writes his last testament belongs to Egil Stray, the writer of the essay On Death and the Dead that concludes The Morning Star and may yet provide a kind of Rosetta stone for the mysteries of the saga … et cetera.)A lot is riding on Knausgård’s ability to deliver on the colossal promise of this sprawling epic. But for readers with the stomach, patience and faith to keep going, this work of millenarian fiction remains an object of fascination.The School of Night by Karl Ove Knausgård, translated by Martin Aitken, is published by Harvill (£25).

Fewer know that Crick also played a key role in modern neuroscience and inspired our continuing efforts to understand the biological basis of consciousness.Crick once said the two questions that interested him most were “the borderline between the living and the non-living, and the workings of the brain”, questions that were usually discussed in religious or mystical terms but that he believed could be answered by science. In his new biography of the Nobel prize-winning scientist, Matthew Cobb, emeritus professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, does an admirable job of capturing the rare thinker who not only set himself such ambitious goals but made remarkable progress in achieving them, radically remaking two scientific disciplines in the process.Surprisingly, perhaps, Crick was not a child prodigy. He began life as an “averagely bright student”, born in 1916 to a provincial middle-class family: his father ran a shoe company. After boarding at Mill Hill School in north London, he failed to get an Oxbridge scholarship (possibly because he was “hopeless” at Latin), and studied physics and mathematics at University College London, graduating with a 2.1. He began a PhD there, but it was disrupted by the second world war, when he was conscripted into developing mines that could evade German minesweepers.It was only after the war that Crick, inspired by Erwin Schrödinger’s 1944 book What Is Life?, determined that he wanted to investigate the molecular basis of life, for which he needed a grounding in biology. He managed to get a studentship through the Medical Research Council to work at Strangeways Laboratory near Cambridge, studying the structure of cytoplasm (the liquid part of cells), and in 1949 transferred to Cambridge University’s Cavendish Lab, where scientists were using a technique called X-ray crystallography to investigate the structure of proteins. It was there that he found an ideal collaborator in the 23-year-old American scientist James Watson. Remarkably, by 1953 the pair had cracked the structure of DNA.Cobb wants to correct the widespread view that Crick and Watson arrived at their double helix model after stealing data from Rosalind FranklinFar from being the stereotypical reclusive genius, labouring in isolation, Crick was loud-talking and charismatic, a philanderer, poetry lover and thrower of risque parties. Crick’s inspiration and breakthroughs came through intense encounters with others, and he was skilled at bringing researchers from different disciplines together to solve scientific puzzles.In Cobb’s telling, Crick was bold and arrogant, with an uncanny ability to uncover connections and to identify new theoretical and experimental approaches, often challenging far more established experts. Lawrence Bragg, the head of the Cavendish lab, is said to have described him as “the sort of chap who was always doing someone else’s crossword”. This approach meant he often stepped on people’s toes and was occasionally wildly off mark.Cobb wants to correct the widespread view that Crick and Watson arrived at their double helix model after stealing data from Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist whose X-ray diffraction images of DNA supported their theories. In The Double Helix, Watson’s popular account of his breakthrough, he wrote that he developed his ideas after seeing one of Franklin’s images, known as Photo 51. Cobb argues that this was an oversimplification: that Photo 51 gave Watson no new information, and Crick did not himself see it until weeks after the pair made their discovery. Crick and Watson should have asked Franklin for permission to use her data, Cobb writes, and it is true that she did not receive sufficient credit for her work. But the pair nonetheless acknowledged Franklin’s contributions in their academic papers on the double helix, and Crick and Franklin remained on friendly terms, with Crick acting as her “unofficial advisor”.The whole affair nonetheless reeks of sexism, from the lack of courtesy shown to Franklin to her exclusion from networking groups such as the RNA Tie Club, and the letters exchanged between Crick and a male colleague discussing how Franklin was too cautious to be a first-rank scientist. I wished Cobb might have named it as such. (After all, what female scientist of their era could have recovered their public reputation after the kinds of blunders Crick sometimes made.)Cobb sets himself an ambitious task in trying to do justice to both Crick’s prolific scientific career and his colourful personal life, and this biography is an impressive work of research and scholarship. It is intended to be accessible to the general reader, with the advice that those who are struggling with the science should “follow Crick’s advice to readers of his own books and skip the hard bits”. This general reader struggled often with the technical detail and vocabulary. Some difficulty may be inescapable simply because the science is complex. Nonetheless, it is a relief whenever Crick is quoted, describing his research in his own words, because he had a knack for translating hard science into lay terms.In a passage explaining how a rare mutation, if advantageous, can become widespread, Crick observes that “when times are tough, true novelty is needed … chance is the only source of true novelty”. These broader, philosophical reflections, which place discoveries in their wider context, are fascinating and much needed – because when readers feel bogged down, they miss out on the wonder.Crick: A Mind in Motion – from DNA to the Brain by Professor Matthew Cobb is published by Profile (£30).

And yet it has to be said: his lavishly upholstered vampire romance has ambition and panache – and in all its Hammer-y cheesiness, I’m not sure I wouldn’t prefer to it toRobert Eggers’s recent, solemnly classy version of Nosferatu. There are some very bizarre touches, including one shot that appears to show a land border between France and Romania.Christoph Waltz plays a witty yet careworn vampire-hunting priest – I can’t believe he hasn’t played this role before – who finds himself in Paris in 1889 for the French Revolution centenary celebrations. So does the evil Count Dracula, played by the body-horror veteran Caleb Landry Jones with a mangled central European accent reminiscent ofSteve Carell’s Gru from the Despicable Me comedies. This is a part that he too was born to take on.The story is this: the count has been restlessly roaming the world in anguish for 400 years since he became undead, a punishment for his irreligious grief over the death of his wife, Elisabeta (a movie debut role for Zoë Bleu, daughter of Rosanna Arquette). The count has been searching, searching, searching for some woman who would be the reincarnation of his lost love. As ill fortune would have it, the lucky lady turns out to be Mina (also Bleu, of course), the demure fiancee of Dracula’s wimpish land agent, Jonathan Harker (Ewens Abid), who has recently been to the count’s castle to discuss his property portfolio and whose miniature portrait of the winsome Mina caught the count’s hooded eye.Besson structures Dracula’s second-act backstory of global roaming in various outrageous costumes with a sure hand, and he is not above giving us some comedy moments with a distinctly Mel Brooks flavour – such as the count’s repeated and futile attempts to kill himself after Elisabeta’s death, as well as farcical scenes that result after Dracula douses himself in a certain perfume in 18th-century Florence, which makes him irresistible to women. Ridiculous and watchable.Dracula is on digital platforms from 1 December and on DVD and Blu-ray from 22 December.

But conservation efforts have resulted in a rhino comeback inKenya, where numbers are growing in fenced-off sanctuaries known as conservancies that employ local people and keep poachers out.Tom Hardy provides a slightly distracting narration to this documentary, channelling David Attenborough with a dash of 19th-century aristo-explorer. The film opens with the fact that in the past three years, 1,900 rhinos have been poached across Africa, but not a single one in Kenya. In the Borana Conservancy we meet charismatic head ranger Ramson Kiloku, a man who knows every single rhino on his patch by its footprint and the nicks on its ears.Kenya’s rhinos, however, are becoming victims of their own success. Increasing numbers in the conservancies are causing competition between males, who will fight to the death for territory. There is a horrible irony of rhinos protected from poachers killing each other, and a plan is hatched to move 21 rhinos 100 miles away to Loisaba Conservancy – a high-risk strategy, we’re told. A similar attempt ended in disaster with the death of all 11 rhinos being moved.But before the rhinos can be transported, Kenya is hit by a drought, devastating for locals whose survival depends on agriculture and livestock. Gangs of bandits terrorise farms, and poaching is on the rise. Oddly, the film doesn’t explore the threat to endangered species from the climate crisis. I could have lived with a bit more of Hardy on the voiceover if he had been given the remit to explain – and possibly without some choices on the soundtrack, including a mawkish rendition of Knocking on Heaven’s Door.● Rhino is in UK cinemas from 28 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsWildlifeConservationKenyaTom HardyAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Although shot in Australia with a mostly Australian cast sprinkled with a few American actors, it’s supposed to be set in Vietnam in the late 1960s as the US armed forces take on the Viet Cong.But there are other forces to contend with, and we don’t just mean covert Chinese or Soviet operatives, although the latter do feature significantly here. It turns out a nefarious scientific experiment by one of the aforementioned factions has accidentally ushered a whole army of dinosaurs into the jungle and they’ve begun gaily munching their way through anyone who gets in their way. When one squad of Green Berets go missing, Colonel Jericho (Jeremy Piven, hamming it up lustily) assigns the elite Vulture Squad to go in and find out what happened. The troop are led by square-jawed Sgt Ryan Baker (Home and Away veteran Ryan Kwanten) who commands your typical assortment of grunts representing, as we’ll soon see, a range of intelligence quotients that make them ill-equipped to cope with the challenge they are about to face.At least they’ve got some firepower, which means a lot of the dialogue and the background music is drowned out by gunfire. Speaking of music, the production has shelled out for some very on-the-nose needle drops includingCreedence Clearwater Revival’s Run Through the JungleandFortunate Sonin case anyone forgot this is meant to be the 1960s. The money might have been better spent on decent VFX because the dinos, especially when seen in the full-daylight sequences, look pretty plasticky. The representations of disgorged innards of the prehistoric beasts are more convincing, and there’s a cheerful cheesy gleefulness that motors the movie along.Primitive War is in UK and Irish cinemas from 28 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsWar filmsPeriod and historical filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsJeremy PivenFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

ThenMiddle. And nowDavid Eldridge’s superlative trilogy about different couples at successive stages has come to a close withEnd. All three can be appreciated individually but the final play, which opened last week at the National Theatre in London, poignantly overlaps with its predecessors. If you’ve seen the other two, you can’t help but draw connections between them as much as you may find familiarities with your own relationships. Before too long, an enterprising theatre should stage all three plays together.Beginning charted the drunken burgeoning of romance between a pair at a house party who are on each side of 40. Middle is about a marriage in crisis, with a young child also in the equation. Tenderly directed by Rachel O’Riordan, End finds Alfie and Julie squaring up to his cancer diagnosis after spending decades together. But the casting of the new play gives it an extra resonance as it reunites Clive Owen and Saskia Reeves more than 30 years after they starred together in Stephen Poliakoff’sClose My Eyes. I found the memory of that 1991 film complements the play enormously.Inspired by Poliakoff’s 1975 play Hitting Town, Close My Eyes caused a tabloid frenzy for its explicit depiction of an incestuous affair between Natalie (Reeves) and her younger brother, Richard (Owen). The film has a similarly elegiac tone to Eldridge’s play partly because of the nature of its relationship, which is doomed before it begins. As well as that eventual implosion, Poliakoff offers other endings. Close My Eyes opens with Natalie’s recent breakup, the divorce of her and Richard’s parents lingers in the background and Richard’s colleague, who has Aids, is dying. As Natalie’s new husband, Sinclair (Alan Rickman), puts it towards the finish: “Something tells me it’s the end of the party.”View image in fullscreenA society in flux … Clive Owen as Richard and Saskia Reeves as Natalie in Close My Eyes.Photograph: Beambright/Four Four Int/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockNatalie and Richard’s relationship unfolds partly amid the regeneration of Docklands in London and is set against a society in flux and the burst of ruthless Thatcherite individualism in the 80s. Some critics saw their incest as symbolising the era’s moral decay and urban decline – Poliakoff has a character make this comparison in Hitting Town. But in the film the couple’s union is presented as a retreat from a world shown to be not just politically corrupt but also disrupted by the horror of the Aids crisis and climate chaos. Poliakoff told the Observer when the film was released: “If you were to say, ‘Why use this taboo?’ I’d say I want the film to be a seductive experience under the shadow of twin worries – the weather out of kilter and the threat of Aids. As with all my stories, I’m trying to get into the subconscious, so that the story hangs around. I wanted it to have a haunting, end-of-decade, end-of-century feel.”Eldridge sets Alfie and Julie’s personal turmoil against one of the most divisive periods in recent British political history. End takes place one morning in the summer of 2016, a week before the Brexit vote. That is mentioned in passing by Julie but Alfie is more preoccupied with a greater upheaval: his beloved West Ham’s departure from Upton Park after more than 100 years. When he speaks of his career as a DJ, providing people with sparks of dancefloor joy in a dark and unpredictable world, it brings to mind Richard and Natalie hiding away for illicit afternoons that are presented as almost being out of time.The memory of the intense sex scenes in Close My Eyes (“One feels almost embarrassed to be caught watching,” wrote Stephen Holden in the New York Times) also serves to heighten Eldridge’s play. Natalie and Richard are at times literally and almost comically hot under the collar as they are consumed by an addictive, obsessive relationship – in one scene she insists that he stay on the other side of the room as she attempts to subdue their passion. In End, Owen and Reeves each have a beautifully nuanced physicality reflecting the easy comfort of decades together as well as an unavoidable sense of distancing. Early on, Alfie wonders aloud if they will ever make love again. His illness means he uses a crutch and moves awkwardly; as he stands motionless and plays a house music track in contention for his funeral playlist, she dances playfully and seductively around him.That moment is then echoed in the rarest of theatrical sex scenes (intimacy direction by Bethan Clark). Unlike the artfully framed, ample nudity of Poliakoff’s film, Alfie and Julie have a quick shag on the sofa, almost fully dressed. Both actors expertly bring out their characters’ vulnerabilities, their ease with and care for each other, their love and fear. It has humour, melancholy and absolute authenticity in a short and sweet evocation of their more youthful passion and abandon.View image in fullscreenRarest of sex scenes … Clive Owen (Alfie) and Saskia Reeves (Julie) in End.Photograph: Marc BrennerWhen actors reunite to play couples it’s often as the same characters in a sequel but when the roles are new, they can’t help but bring the ghosts of their predecessors. In End, I was reminded of Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer playing the emotionally weatheredFrankie and Johnnyeight years after starring as Tony and Elvira in Scarface and the contrast between their dancefloor encounter at a flashy club in the earlier film and the homely, ramshackle party they attend in the later one.Actors’ previous roles can cleave to them, something directer Jamie Lloyd often exploits, although I was already struggling to buy into the characters of his West EndMuch Ado About Nothingbefore Tom Hiddleston and Hayley Atwell were accompanied by full-length cardboard cutouts of their Marvel characters. End is altogether more powerful in evoking its stars’ screen history. When Alfie recalls his cocksure, “baby-faced” old self, you flash on Owen’s TV role as Chancer as well as the smoothly dressed Richard. The suaveness of his past roles (remember when he was touted as the next James Bond?) accentuates the wincing, tracksuit-wearing Alfie’s dishevelment; his first appearance, standing stiff with a haunted look in his eyes, provokes a double take. In a strange way, Julie’s success as a novelist in Eldridge’s play helps to fulfil the thwarted creative ambitions of Natalie in Close My Eyes.Awkward flirting, 4am breakdowns and a last kiss: David Eldridge on a decade of writing about loveRead morePoliakoff’s film is frequently paradoxical; the nature of their relationship means that even in the first flush of their romance, Natalie and Richard share the well-worn squabbling of siblings and have a whole history as brother and sister to unpick. Like End, it’s poised between the past and the future. Even though the spectre of a possible pregnancy (emphasised in Hitting Town) does not loom in Close My Eyes, a general unease about what lies ahead is often voiced by Rickman’s character, who has made a fortune through stock forecasts.Eldridge’s play painfully imagines the family’s life without Alfie, a future that Julie finds she can only process by plotting it as if one of her novels, much like Alfie, navigates his send-off in terms of a DJ choosing the right banger. The dancefloor becomes a convincing motif for the stages of the trilogy – it’s a place where Alfie has seen first kisses and breakups – and Eldridge draws a nice analogy between storytelling as choosing the right records as well as finding the right words. While End was written without Owen and Reeves in mind (props to casting director Alastair Coomer for bringing them together again), their old film gives this superbly performed new play a remarkable charge of intimacy.End is at theNational Theatre, London, until 17 JanuaryChris Wiegand is the Guardian’s Stage editorExplore more on these topicsTheatreActingClive OwenDavid EldridgeStephen PoliakoffNational TheatreRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

Philip Pullman’s fairytale of volcano scaling, talking elephants and “The Greatest Firework Show in the Galaxy” isn’t one of them. But with buckets of imagination and a sterling cast, Lee Lyford’s new production for six-to-12-year-olds is both epic and spellbindingly intimate. My seven-year-old guest, Artie, isn’t familiar with the book but is immediately enthralled and, at times, so far on the edge of his seat I fear he’ll collide with the woman in front.Lila dreams of becoming a firework-maker like her dad; he isn’t so keen. So when he’s tricked into revealing the final secret to his craft – winning Royal Sulphur from a fire fiend atop a volcano – Lila’s off like a rocket, via jungles and pirates. Her friend Chulak, learning more about the dangers in store, goes in search of protective water with the king’s vociferous white elephant, Hamlet.Lyford and team rifle through a bulging dramatic toolbox to bring it all to life. Anisha Fields’ simple set begins as Lila and her father’s workshop but, with the help of some lo-fi additional scenery and a few humble props, soon becomes a river, a jungle and the side of a volcano, complete with cardboard-box rockslide. Fireworks are unfurling cocktail umbrellas and tiny lights dancing on the ends of fingers. (The finale’s firework competition is more extravagantly breathtaking in ways I won’t spoil.)View image in fullscreenEnthralling … The Firework-Maker’s Daughter.Photograph: Jake BushThere’s excellent puppetry (designs and direction by Maia Kirkman-Richards), from hulking Hamlet – controlled by two cast members within – to intricate shadow puppets parading across a lampshade. “Write down that – that’s amazing!” whispers Artie, jabbing my notepad. Jonathan Chan’s lighting and Elena Peña’s sound design bring real peril. When red lights, smoke, crackling sound effects and a rumbling voiceover conjure the fire fiend, a spooked Artie suggests raising the minimum age guidance to nine.The cast of five take the technical demands of such invention in energetic stride, with all except Tika Mu’tamir (a pleasingly plucky Lila) also playing multiple roles. Artie’s favourite is Jules Chan as cheeky Chulak and one of the useless pirates rowing themselves in circles in his favourite scene – it’s also a moment where Jude Christian’s adaptation adds gleeful silliness to Pullman’s vivid language. My standout is Rose-Marie Christian, whose every incarnation is a delight, although cockney chancer Auntie Rambashi is her best.Lila’s quest could do with a clearer setup, and the final lessons in love and risk-taking a little more exploration. But what seven-year-old cares about all that amid so much fun? Despite some questions throughout, Artie leaves creating fireworks with his fingers, practising the “mouth noises” he admired from the actors, and planning an explosive future career.AtPolka theatre, London, until 18 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsChristmas showsPlay timeChildren's theatrePhilip PullmanChildren's books: 8-12 yearsChildren and teenagersPolka theatrePuppetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

I start with a pilgrimage to a restaurant featured in my book on tapas, New Tapas, a mere 25 years ago.Mesón de Labradoresin the pedestrianised old town is now engulfed by Italian eateries (so more pizza and pasta than paella) but it remains a comforting outpost of tradition and honest food.Map of Alicante areaHere I catch up with Timothy Denny, a British chef who relocated to Spain, gained analicantinagirlfriend and became a master of dishes from the region. Over afideuá demariscos(seafood noodles, €20), we chew over local gastronomy. “For me, Alicante epitomises the Mediterranean – for rice, seafood and artichokes,” he says. “But there are curiosities, too, likepavo borracho.” Tim explains that so-called “drunken turkeys” are cooked in vast amounts of cognac plus a shot of red wine and eventually emerge as a hefty stew, perfect in winter.This passion for experimentation has been endorsed by the Catalan master chef, Ferran Adrià, who once stated “[the Costa Blanca] … has a magical elf that takes hold of the products and sneaks into the kitchens to offer diners unique dishes with unique flavours”.View image in fullscreenFideuá de mariscos.Photograph: Jordi Ruiz/Getty ImagesTim emphasises the preponderance of female chefs in the area, quite a rarity in Spain’s male-dominated world of gastronomy. “Because in this historically poor region, the choice was often between cooking and cleaning,” he says. As proof we greet the exuberant owner of Labradores, Raquel Sabater, among the vintage plates, tiles and furniture that have barely changed after all these years.But I soon discover another reason when I meet the much-garlanded María José San Román atMonastrell, her high-end restaurant beside the marina. Here, as we embark on a refined six-course tasting menu (€79), she tells me about the associationMujeres en Gastronomía(MEG) that she founded in 2018 to unite Alicante’s many talented female chefs. Nicknamed the Queen of Alicante gastronomy, this tornado of energy now heads four restaurants, including the heavingTaberna del Gourmet, with another in the pipeline.A magical elf takes hold of the products and sneaks into the kitchens to offer diners unique dishes with unique flavoursFerran AdriàNext day, I lunch at another member of MEG,La Sastrería, whose owner, María Luisa Rivera, changed tack 20 years ago from landscape gardener to chef. Her restaurant, a smallmodernistabeauty, overlooks a lush square of towering centennial ficus trees, their tangled trunks echoed inside by a curvaceous staircase. Here I opt for anarroz del senyoret(€19)named for the little lord (or in my case lady) who doesn’t like handling shellfish, so it all comes peeled. Theséniarice from Valencia’s Albufera (a freshwater lagoon) is perfect, each tiny grain separate despite 20 minutes or so cooking in María Luisa’s complex broth.Now the island of Tabarca, south of Alicante, beckons. An elongated sandstone slab washed by transparent waters teeming with fish, it is a marine reserve and its coves are a snorkeller’s heaven. After a 25-minute ferry crossing from Santa Pola, I disembark with my guide, Felipe, who fills me in on Tabarca’s rich history.View image in fullscreenSeafood at MonastrellDespite being the smallest inhabited island in Spain, it has seen Greeks, Romans, Berber pirates, smugglers and shipwrecked Genoese sailors who settled there when a military garrison was created in 1760. Quite a history for an islet. Although the garrison later decamped, stone gateways remain leading to quaint streets, a striking church and leafy squares. It’s a dreamy place if you get there before the lunchtime crowds.I am in search of a unique fisherman’s stew combined with rice. Thiscalderois, like paella, named after its cooking dish – in this case a cast iron hotpot. AtLa Almadraba, the owner, a woman called Nines, explains the technique: two courses (€30) start with a succulent dish of potatoes and fish simmered in a broth of alioli, garlic, saffron and parsley so good that I spoon out the remains; it is followed by the rice cooked in the same concoction. The upshot is a fabulous feed overlooking bobbing boats in the harbour and a glittering Med beyond.Another day, another quest, this time in Elche, inland from Santa Pola and 15 miles from Alicante. The city is famed not only for the exquisite Dama de Elche (a fourth-century BC sculpture of a bejewelled Iberian woman) but also for its vast palm grove. About 200,000 date palms in the largestpalmeralin Europe and the northernmost in the world have earned the city Unesco world heritage status. Most of the palms are divided into a grid of rectangularhuertos(orchards) fed by irrigation channels that also nourish fruit trees such as pomegranate, citrus and olives.Miguel Ángel Sánchez, owner of Elche’s largest date company, TodoPalmera, leads me around the Museo del Palmeral, where an enlightening display covers every aspect of the palm tree, whether the plant structure, the use of palm wood and fibre and, extraordinarily, intricate “sculptures” made with white palms for Elche’s Easter processions. For Miguel Ángel, “the palm has so much value: cultural, religious, environmental, nutritional, agricultural, ornamental, functional and spiritual”.View image in fullscreenCooking over a grapevine wood fire at El CachitoHe says that Elche’s date production of about 80 tonnes restricts availability in Spain, so it remains a gourmet product. Five varieties include the widely known Medjoul as well as the local Confitera, which I sample at Miguel Ángel’s farm – freshly harvested, yellow, velvety and utterly delicious. Despite my addiction to Palestinian Medjoul dates, this is an epiphany. When I later spot them at Alicante’s cornucopian Mercado Central, into my bag they go.My lastarrozlunchlooms. Instead of indulging at highly ratedMesón el Granaíno, we head south of town to 90-year-oldEl Cachito, an unpretentious family restaurant. Here I watch another woman, Noelia, orchestrate the flames of grapevine branches in a cavernous, blackened fireplace. The result? A perfect paella of rabbit and wild snails (€18), its glistening grains as flawless as the artichokes grown in her vegetable garden, and as luscious as Elche’s dates.The tripwas provided byspain.info,costablanca.organdvisitelche.com.

Our panel of experts unpicks them one by oneAnna BerrillTue 25 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareI always order chocolate mousse in restaurants, but it never turns out quite right when I make it at home. Help!Daniel, by email“Chocolate mousse defies physics,” says Nicola Lamb, author ofSiftand theKitchen Projects newsletter. “It’s got all the flavour of your favourite chocolate, but with an aerated, dissolving texture, which is sort of extraordinary.” The first thing you’ve got to ask yourself, then, is what kind of mousse are you after: “Some people’s dream is rich and dense, while for others it’s light and airy,” Lamb says, which is probably why there are so many ways you can make it.That said, in most cases you’re usually dealing with some form of melted chocolate folded into whipped eggs (whites, yolks or both), followed by lightly whipped cream. And, with so few ingredients, you need to make them count, Lamb says: “What you’re doing by making chocolate mousse is extending the flavour of the chocolate, so first off always go with a bar you really like.” And, for her, that means 70% dark chocolate.One potential stumbling block, however, comes when folding the melted chocolate into the colder ingredients (eggs, say): “The chocolate can seize and you end up overfolding or knocking out all the air.” Her solution? Whisk a little water, alcohol or coffee (“a couple of tablespoons for 100g chocolate”) into the melted chocolate, and “it’ll be easier to work with”.Use older eggs, too, adds Matthew Ryle, author ofFrench Classics: “As an egg gets older, the white gets looser, which is not what you want when it comes to poaching, but for meringues and mousses it’s perfect, because those looser whites have more elasticity, so they stretch and incorporate air without breaking.” Room-temperature eggs will also help with this.As with any difficult relationship, it pays to take things slow, too. “The longer and slower you whip the meringue, the smaller the bubbles will be,” Ryle says, “resulting in a stronger, fine meringue and mousse.” To ensure a light mousse, Lamb always adds an extra egg white, while Ollie Templeton pours in hot honey. The co-founder ofCarousel, where chocolate mousse has been on the menu since the day it opened, says: “Bring some honey to a boil, pour that into the eggs and whisk until they’ve cooled; that creates a light and airy texture.” He then folds in the obligatory whipped cream, seasons with salt and pops in the fridge for four to five hours to set.If you’ve made a dense, truffle-like mousse (ie, without cream), however, Lamb would take it out of the fridge 20 minutes before serving: “It’s less of a problem with a cream-based mousse,” she says, “although that would still benefit from 10 minutes out of the fridge before digging in.”Templeton would top his mousse with a drizzle of olive oil, some salt and a few crushed hazelnuts: “You want some crunch [a veil of peanuts or breadcrumbs would also do the job].” Lamb, however, is not one for gilding the lily, and just adds a pinch of salt: “Chocolate mousse is one of those things that’s best left alone,” she says. Unless whipped cream has been omitted from the recipe: “In that case, a coupe of chocolate mousse with a spoon of barely whipped cream would be really chic. Chicanddelicious.”Got a culinary dilemma?

It was the standard Japanese curry of potatoes, onion, carrot and pork, usually thickened withS&B Golden Curry blocks. It made a weekly appearance in our house, and now I regularly make it for my own family, too. However, my kids are a little fussy: one likes it with tonkatsu on top and the other doesn’t want any meat at all. So I now make curry with no meat in it, and more vegetables, which means that I have to make only one version (and whoever wants to add tonkatsu can do so!).Vegetable udon curry (yasai kare udon)Udon curry is a great dish if you have (as I often do) impatient people who cannot wait the extra 20 or so minutes it takes to make rice (and, if you have fresh or frozen noodles, it’s even faster). You could also serve this with rice, but if you do, use only half the quantity of dashi, because this curry is made slightly soupier to go with the noodles. If you don’t have a Japanese grater (oroshigane) for ginger, use a microplane.Prep15 minInfuseOvernight (optional)Cook35 minServes4For the dashi2 x 12cm pieces kombu1 litrecold waterFor the curry2tbsp butter4cmknob fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated1 onion, peeled and sliced½aubergine, dicedA pinch of salt1 carrot, peeled and chopped into chunky slices200gpotato(floury will be softer, waxy will be firmer), peeled and chopped1tbsp Japanese curry powder2tsp garam masala2tbsp mirin, or sake1 litredashi(see above and method)1tbsp soy sauce½ green bell pepper, seeds and pith discarded, flesh thinly sliced2tsp potato starch, or cornflour2tbsp miso4 servings udon noodlesFirst, make the dashi, which you can do in one of two ways. For the lengthier, cold infusion method, put the kombu and cold water in a container or jar, cover and leave in the fridge overnight to infuse. The next morning, lift out and discard the kombu, and the dashi is now ready to use. If you don’t have time to make the cold infusion, simply put the kombu and water in a saucepan over a low heat, so it warms up and draws out the flavour as slowly as possible. Just before the liquid starts to boil, take off the heat, remove the kombu and your dashi is ready.Now for the curry. Melt the butter in a heavy-based saucepan ordonabeon a medium heat, then stir in the ginger, onion, aubergine and salt. Stir to coat everything in the buttery ginger for about two minutes, being careful the onion doesn’t burn, then add the carrot and potato. Tip in the curry powder and garam masala, and stir to coat the vegetables.Pour in the mirin, followed quickly by the dashi and soy, then bring to a simmer and leave the vegetables to cook for about 10 minutes, until tender. Add the green pepper and cook for a couple of minutes more.Meanwhile, make a slurry by mixing the potato starch with a splash of water until dissolved, then stir this into the curry along with the miso, and leave to bubble and thicken for a minute.Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain and rinse under cold water – this will give them a bit of spring. Distribute the noodles between four bowls and pour the vegetable curry over the top.This recipe is an edited extract from The Japanese Pantry, by Emiko Davies, published by Smith Street Books at £30.Explore more on these topicsFoodNoodlesJapanese food and drinkCurryVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkPotatoesrecipesShareReuse this content"
